Discussions for the 2007 Article IV Consultation and Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance (EPCA) were held
in Abidjan April 30–May 15, 2007. The team consisted of Messrs. Kouwenaar (head), Egoume (resident
representative), Fabig, Le Hen, and Bornhorst (all AFR), Dicks-Mireaux (PDR), and Ms. Nkhata (MCM).
Mr. Alle, senior advisor to the Executive Director for Côte d’Ivoire, participated in the policy discussions.
The mission met with the Minister of Economy and Finance and other senior officials, and was received by
President Gbagbo and Prime Minister Soro. It met with representatives of the private sector, civil society, and
the donor community.

•

At the 2003 Article IV Consultation, completed on March 31, 2004, Directors stressed that (i) actions to
improve the political and security situation should be accompanied by a coherent economic policy framework
to promote private sector confidence; and (ii) public finances, transparency and governance in public
enterprise operations and the cocoa sector needed to be strengthened. The subsequent Article IV consultation
was postponed several times because of the security situation and division of the country.

•

Côte d’Ivoire is a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) whose currency,
the CFA franc, is pegged to the euro. It has accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4
of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement. Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance, but data quality and
timeliness have declined since the conflict started.

•

Côte d’Ivoire’s outstanding use of Fund resources at end-May 2007 was SDR 91.41million (28.11 percent of
quota). Côte d’Ivoire is current in its payments to the Fund. A PRGF-supported program was interrupted in
late 2002 and expired in March 2005. Côte d’Ivoire is in nonaccrual status vis-à-vis the World Bank and
African Development Bank (AfDB). Relations with the Fund, World Bank Group, and AfDB, and statistical
issues are presented in an informational annex to this report.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In emerging from political instability, conflict, and economic stagnation since 1999, Côte d’Ivoire
will need strong domestic consensus and the continued support of the international community to
reunify the country and start its recovery, which are also crucial for stronger growth in the
subregion. The authorities see an IMF-supported program as key for returning to growth of at
least 5 percent, reducing poverty, and progressing toward the MDGs. EPCA would be a step
toward a PRGF arrangement and HIPC/MDRI relief.
The Article IV discussions with the authorities showed a broad consensus on key challenges
and policy requirements. Discussions centered on removing constraints to post-conflict
recovery, enhancing transparency in public resource management, strengthening the financial
sector, and addressing longer-term obstacles to growth.
The EPCA-supported program for 2007 focuses on short-term measures to address these
challenges:
•

Restoring security, social services, and basic infrastructure in the whole country. Tight
financing constraints require reinforcing revenue administration and reorienting spending
away from nonessential spending toward social/reunification spending. The program for 2007
targets a primary basic fiscal surplus of 1 percent of GDP.

•

Promoting efficient use of public resources. Early efforts would focus on enhancing transparency in public resource mobilization (energy and cocoa/coffee sectors), strictly enforcing
budget procedures, and ensuring transparency in budget execution.
In the medium and longer term

•

Modest fiscal primary basic surpluses would help progress toward compliance with WAEMU
convergence criteria and debt sustainability. The LIC-DSA shows debt distress, and to reduce
debt vulnerabilities sizable debt relief (within the framework of HIPC/MDRI) and prudent
debt management would be needed.

•

Revitalizing structural reforms, notably in the energy and export agricultural sectors, would be
crucial for attracting investment, diversifying the economy, and raising productivity. Steps to
enhance soundness, banking supervision, and the judiciary environment are needed to enhance
the financial sector’s role in supporting growth. Impediments to the business climate need to
be addressed to improve competitiveness.
Implementation of macroeconomic policies along these lines should contribute to domestic
stability and the external stability of the WAEMU. Central in this regard are the policies in
2007 that aim to achieve sustainable fiscal and external positions.
A resurgence of political tensions, delays in disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration
(DDR), and weakening security represent risks to program implementation. The authorities’ firm
commitment to the program, as demonstrated by strong prior actions, and continued international
support for the peace process should help keep these risks in check.

I. INTRODUCTION
1. Côte d’Ivoire is emerging from a political crisis that began in 1999 and erupted in
civil conflict in September 2002 (Table 1). The conflict divided the country into the center,
north, and west (CNW), occupied by the rebel forces (Forces Nouvelles (FN)), and the south,
controlled by the government. With the deployment of French troops, the conflict abated, and
in January 2003, a government of national transition was formed under the Linas-Marcoussis
Accord. However, progress in restoring peace and political stability, after faltering under
successive transition governments, stalled in late 2006.
2. In early 2007, to restart the peace process, President Gbagbo and FN leader Soro
began a direct dialogue, facilitated by Burkina Faso President Compaoré. The talks
culminated in the Ouagadougou Accord of March 7, 2007, which has received the support of
the international community. The Accord sets out a roadmap for DDR, the dismantling of
militias, reunification of the country, and preparations for elections by February 2008. A new
transition government, with FN leader Soro as prime minister, was formed in early April; an
integrated command center for the army and rebel forces was set up; and prefects for all
districts and judges for the nationality identification hearings were appointed. This would
permit the start of the cantonment of armed forces, the dismantling of militias, and the
identification of the population in late July.1
3. Implementing the roadmap in time for the presidential elections, as targeted, will be
challenging. Progress will require firm political consensus among the major stakeholders
and strong international support. A high-level consultation committee, which includes the
president, prime minister, leaders of the major political parties, and President Compaoré, is
expected to reinforce the political consensus underpinning the roadmap; progress is also
monitored by another high-level committee, which includes representatives of the
international community.
II. LEGACY OF THE CONFLICT, CHALLENGES AHEAD
A. Impact of the Conflict
4. The conflict and political instability have taken a heavy toll on growth, poverty, and
economic policies. In 2000–06, average economic growth turned negative; it was well below
the rates in the rest of WAEMU and sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Public and private
investment dropped below earlier and comparator levels, as concerns about the political and
security situation grew and external finance dwindled. Private sector activity was scaling

Most of the country is under UN Security Phase III, though certain areas, mostly in the west, are under
Phase IV.

back, especially in industry, and by 2006 real GDP was some 35 percent below its pre-crisis
trend level. The partition of the country disrupted trade within the country and diminished
Côte d’Ivoire’s role as a regional hub. Export volume growth fell between 1994–99
and 2000–06. The external current account held up, thanks to an increase in oil exports
since 2002 and overall favorable terms of trade. While private and official inflows declined
sharply, sizable external arrears were accumulated, and international reserves remained
adequate.

5. Côte d’Ivoire accounts for almost 40 percent of GDP in the WAEMU and is an
important driver of growth in other WAEMU countries. While economic performance in
other WAEMU countries has held up since 2000, developments in Côte d’Ivoire have
undercut investor confidence and hurt regional trade and output.
6. Fiscal performance and transparency have suffered, owing to falling revenue and
crisis-related expenditure pressures as well as internal divisions and a lack of
accountability. As growth slowed and the tax base eroded, total revenue fell; tax revenue,
meanwhile, dropped below the WAEMU convergence criterion (Box 1). Pressures for
defense, discretionary presidential, and other sovereignty spending rose. While overall fiscal
deficits narrowed (reflecting some spending discipline), because of limited donor financing,
domestic and external arrears increased. The composition of spending deteriorated as health
and education spending fell as a share of GDP. Budget management weakened: expenditure
was partly executed outside budget procedures and some oil revenue stayed off-budget.

Box 1. WAEMU Convergence Criteria
Côte d’Ivoire joined the WAEMU Pact on Convergence, Stability, Growth, and Solidarity in 1999.1
The Pact calls for the observance of quantitative criteria to improve the efficiency of regional monetary
policy, reduce domestic and external vulnerabilities, and enable each member to reach a stable growth
path. With almost 40 percent of the WAEMU’s GDP, Côte d’Ivoire is of key importance to the
region’s stability and development. In 2005 and 2006, Côte d’Ivoire met two of the nine criteria.

First-order criteria
Basic fiscal balance/GDP (≥ 0 percent) 2/
Average consumer price inflation (≤ 3 percent)
Total debt/GDP (≤ 70 percent)
Change in domestic arrears, billions of CFAF (≤ 0)
Change in external arrears, billions of CFAF (≤ 0)
Second-order criteria
Wages and salaries/fiscal revenue (≤ 35 percent)
Capital expenditure domestically financed/fiscal revenue (≥ 20 percent)
External current account balance, excluding grants/GDP (≥ -5 percent)
Tax revenue/GDP (≥ 17 percent)

7. In the cocoa/coffee and cotton sectors, output declined, structural reforms stalled,
and financial conditions deteriorated. The cocoa/coffee sector is a major source of exports
and income; together with the cotton sector, it supports some 9 million people, half the
population. Coffee and cotton outputs declined sharply and cocoa activity stagnated owing to
crisis-related disruptions, stalled reforms, and low investment. Financial management and
transparency have been weak: quasi-fiscal levies on cocoa and coffee have not been used to
benefit producers as intended, and, as world prices declined, financial conditions weakened
and producer incentives shrunk.
8. The development of the financial sector has been adversely affected by the crisis.
Since 2002 all bank branches have been closed in the CNW. The quality of bank loan
portfolios also declined, in part, because government domestic arrears to the private sector
surged. The crisis has also exacerbated longer-standing weaknesses, particularly in smalland medium-sized banks, where compliance with prudential ratios has declined. The share of
Ivoirien banks in total WAEMU bank assets has declined from 40 percent in 2000 to around
30 percent in 2005, and private credit-to-GDP ratios in Côte d’Ivoire fell below levels in
other WAEMU and SSA countries. Intermediation was also affected by the deterioration of
an already weak judicial system.

11
9. Poverty, social conditions, and governance worsened (Figures 1 and 2). The poverty
rate is estimated to have increased from 35 percent in 2000 to 43 percent in 2006, and Côte
d’Ivoire’s ranking on the UN Human Development Index has declined since the late 1990s.
The government’s ability to deliver public services, notably health and education, was
disrupted, especially in the CNW. Most indicators of governance worsened.
Human Development Index stagnated and poverty rose.

B. Recent Economic Developments
10. Since 2003 the economy has grown modestly, despite stagnant investment. Rising
outputs of oil/gas, petroleum products, and telecommunication services have been the main
source of growth. Informal sector activity partly offset a sharp decline in industry. The
external current account has remained in surplus, as a pick-up in imports was offset by strong
oil exports. In 2006 growth weakened as activity in the secondary sector, notably in
hydroelectricity and agro-industries, fell further. The external current account surplus
widened as imports slowed and the terms of trade (owing to higher oil prices) improved.

11. Inflation has remained subdued. Average consumer price inflation was around
2½ percent in 2004–06. The real effective exchange rate has trended slightly upward in
recent years, in line with the euro’s appreciation vis-à-vis the dollar and Côte d’Ivoire’s
inflation being similar to those of trading partners; this trend accelerated in early 2007.

12. In 2004–06 budget management kept the overall deficit in check, though the fiscal
situation was difficult and Côte d’Ivoire did not comply with most fiscal WAEMU
convergence criteria (Box 1). The primary basic balance stayed in surplus; but by 2006, it
had slipped to 0.3 percent of GDP, 1 percent of GDP below the budget objective (Tables 4a–
b). In both 2005 and 2006, this weakening reflected revenue shortfalls relative to budget
targets, in particular for oil/gas, and overruns in nonwage recurrent expenditure, especially in
discretionary presidential spending. In 2006, unanticipated outlays to address the dumping of

13
toxic waste in Abidjan and gas subsidies to the electricity sector also contributed to the
overrun in primary basic spending. At the same time, health and education spending fell
short of budget targets. These developments, coupled with the dearth of external financing,
led external arrears to increase to 21 percent of GDP by end-2006. Domestic arrears were
reduced somewhat, to 5 percent of GDP at end-2006.

13. The government implemented some measures to strengthen public finance
management and tax administration, but made little progress in improving budget
execution and transparency. In 2005–06, absent an approved budget until midyear,
spending was managed through treasury advances rather than normal budget procedures. As
a result, accountability was weak and the composition of spending did not conform to the
budget. To meet temporary cash needs, the authorities resorted to advanced collection of
cocoa export taxes against large discounts. With the recent growth of the informal sector, tax
evasion and fraud have increased. To reduce fraud and corruption, the government
introduced a new standardized VAT form and computerized its customs clearance system.
Measures to improve the management of spending included the extension of the Integrated
Public Finance Management System (SIGFiP) to districts, and the implementation of a new
Public Procurement Code.
14. In early 2007, without an approved budget, the government managed its
expenditures through treasury advances in line with available financing. In the first
quarter, the primary basic surplus reached 0.6 percent of GDP. Overall revenue performance
was relatively good, and expenditures were broadly executed along the lines of the 2006
budget.

14
15. Regional policies continued to determine monetary developments.2 Since 2003, net
credit to the government declined, but commercial banks increased their lending to the
government. Private sector credit growth was low given the political uncertainties and lack of
investment opportunities (Tables 6a-b). In August 2006, the BCEAO increased its discount
rate in response to inflation and higher euro interest rates, but because of overall excess
liquidity, bank interest rates were largely unaffected. Since 2006, excess liquidity declined
(as it did in other WAEMU members), and in February 2007 the BCEAO started weekly
reverse-repo auctions, in which mainly smaller, less liquid banks from Côte d’Ivoire and
elsewhere participate.
16. The banking sector has shown some resilience during the crisis; soundness varies
greatly across institutions, but systemic risks are contained (Table 12).3 Banking
activities in the CNW ceased after the crisis began; institutions with heavy exposure to small
and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and weak sectors, such as transport, were the hardest
hit. Credit risk increased, but after peaking at 26 percent in 2004 the share of nonperforming
loans fell to 20 percent in 2006. Larger, mostly foreign-owned banks refocused their
operations on large enterprises to strengthen their balance sheets. However, compliance with
prudential norms worsened, and 8 out of 18 banks, representing one-fifth of total deposits, do
not respect the capital adequacy ratio. In 2006, five banks recorded losses and six banks were
under close surveillance by the Banking Commission. Since March 2007, banks have begun
to reengage in the CNW.
17. Structural reforms in the cocoa/coffee and energy sectors have been limited absent a
firm domestic consensus during the crisis (MEFP, ¶15). A large share of the quasi-fiscal
levies on cocoa and coffee exports in 2001–05 as well as spending by the sector’s agencies
cannot be traced. In 2006 the authorities took initial steps to improve transparency in the
collection and use of funds and financial management. Quasi-fiscal levies were reduced
slightly for the 2006/07 season to improve producer prices; part of the levies were channeled
to a rural investment fund that, together with two other investment funds, is supervised by a
committee co-chaired by the ministers of finance and agriculture. In the energy sector, to
enhance its transparency, efficiency, and revenue potential, the government in 2006
announced its participation in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI),
initiated comprehensive audits of the sector, and reduced the protective margin of the
profitable domestic refinery. The electricity sector continued to face serious financial strains
owing to the nonpayment of bills in the CNW and the accumulation of cross-arrears with the
government. The government provided support with gas subsidies (equivalent to 0.8 percent

of GDP) to the sector in 2006; in March 2007 it reached agreement with the national
electricity company to eliminate existing cross-arrears and on measures to prevent any new
accumulation.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Challenges: Economic Recovery and Sustained Growth
18. Policy discussions focused on the legacy of the conflict and the related challenges.
The authorities broadly concurred with the staff’s assessment of past economic performance
and policies. Looking ahead, authorities and staff agreed on the need to:
•

Remove constraints to economic and social recovery. Restoring security,
redeploying the administration, and restoring social services, especially in health and
education, throughout the country are essential. The budget would need to
accommodate the costs of these programs, including through realistic costing, donor
support, and domestic resources.

•

Enhance transparency in public sector resource management and related reforms.
Improving transparency and efficiency in the energy and cocoa/coffee sectors and in
budget execution is important for allocating public resources more efficiently and for
strengthening growth and export prospects. Better monitoring and reporting of
resource flows would boost the quality of pro-poor spending and build donor support.

•

Strengthen the role of the financial sector. The restoration of banking operations
throughout the country, improved compliance with prudential regulations, and a
stronger judicial system are necessary.

The authorities recognized that progress in meeting these challenges needed to be supported
by prudent financial policies aimed at securing fiscal and debt sustainability. They emphasized the importance of a concerted effort to improve governance, transparency, and the
business climate, and noted the opportunities and challenges of further trade liberalization for
growth. The authorities agreed with the staff that domestic policies—if pursued along the
lines discussed in this report—would contribute to preserving external stability of the
WAEMU currency area.
B. Medium-Term Outlook and Debt Sustainability Analysis
19. A successful political transition, improved security, and the relaunching of structural reforms underpin an improved medium-term outlook (Table 10). Following a year
of transition, growth is expected to accelerate with an initial period of catch-up followed by a
gradual investment-driven strengthening to reach over 6 percent in 2012, in line with the
immediate pre-crisis trend and Côte d’Ivoire’s 1960–80 growth (Box 2). For post-conflict
countries, the speed and length of the recovery to pre-crisis output levels and growth rates

16
vary widely, depending on the initial trough, the destruction or depreciation of capital stocks,
the degree of insecurity, and foreign aid flows. In Côte d’Ivoire the loss of capital has been
relatively small and a large part of the reduction in output is explained by a lack of demand.
Therefore, the recovery could potentially be fast. On the external side, the projected increase
in investment imports and the profile of oil production are expected to lead to a gradual
deterioration in the external current account (including official transfers) to a deficit of
2½ percent of GDP by 2012, from a 2½ percent surplus in 2007.

Box 2: Côte d’Ivoire: Sources of Growth
Pre-crisis Growth
Growth averaged 5 percent in 1994–99. Following the CFA franc devaluation in 1994, growth surged and was
buttressed by trade and other economic liberalization and structural reforms. Increased investment levels, averaging
14 percent of GDP, supported growth. While export agriculture and construction grew strongly, industry and services
contributed most to growth.

Crisis Growth
GDP dropped 7 percent in 2000-03. The industrial, construction, and trade sectors suffered most from the decline in
demand, worsening security conditions, a drop in investment, and closure or departure of SMEs; cumulative output
losses were on the order of 20–30 percent. Non-export agriculture (15 percent of GDP) maintained its growth at 2–
3 percent per year and softened the impact of the crisis.

GDP recovered 4 percent in 2004-06. A sharp
increase in oil and petroleum product production
led the recovery. A few sectors, with a low share
of GDP, saw growth of over 10 percent a year
(e.g., telecom, cashews). Investment declined
further to an average of 8 percent of GDP, barely
enough to maintain the economy’s capacity, and
productivity likely declined.
Per capita income fell 15 percent during the
crisis. At end-2006, output was some 35 percent
below the immediate pre-crisis trend level.

processing industries.
 Restoration of capacity of the electricity sector by resolving gas supply and financial problems.
 Oil/gas production is projected to contribute less to growth as output would peak in 2009–10 and fall thereafter.
Meeting the poverty MDG will require annual growth rates of 6-7 percent. This would require higher
investment (above 16 percent of GDP) and productivity gains through structural reforms. In the primary sector,
cocoa output has the potential to improve (better producer incentives through reorganization of the sector and
reduction of quasi-fiscal levies). Cotton has high growth potential as it returns to its pre-crisis levels and benefits
from further improvement in productivity (modernization, selection of seeds). In the secondary sector, stronger
growth depends foremost on improvements in the business environment. In the tertiary sector, a substantial
increase in social services (education, health) should help improve human capital. Transportation and trade could
also grow faster when the regional trade liberalization (WAEMU and ECOWAS) becomes fully effective.

20. Under a downside scenario—of prolonged political uncertainty and security
concerns, little or no donor support, and stagnating structural reforms—economic
growth would remain low (2 percent a year). Without improvements in the business
climate and the revenue base, private and public investment would fall relative to GDP.
Lower growth and investment would compress imports, but with little pick-up in the export
sectors, the current account surplus would decline steadily.

21. Restoring debt sustainability requires prudent fiscal policies but also debt relief and
concessional donor support. The staff's projections over the medium term include
increasing non-oil revenue (offsetting declining oil revenue) and expenditure outgrowing
revenue on account of rising investment and pro-poor current spending. The primary basic
surplus would decline somewhat but still average 1 percent of GDP in 2007-12, contributing
to improved adherence to WAEMU convergence criteria and better debt ratios. The longterm projections for the LIC-DSA4 assume constant total revenue in percent of GDP, but
continued increases in public spending, eventually leading to small primary deficits. The
ratios of NPV of public external debt to GDP, exports, and revenue indicate that Côte
d’Ivoire would remain in debt distress during 2007–13 based on the country-specific
thresholds. Under the standard stress tests, in particular at lower export growth and nominal
exchange rate depreciation, the period of distress would double. The LIC-DSA results
suggest that achieving debt sustainability would require sizable debt relief and a resumption
of concessional donor support, in addition to prudent policies.

4

Supplement 1. The LIC-DSA baseline does not assume concessional reschedulings or HIPC/MDRI debt relief.

19
C. Foreign Exchange System, Competitiveness, and Trade
22. Côte d’Ivoire is a member of WAEMU and maintains an exchange system free of
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions.5 The BCEAO said that it strictly applies the current (unrestrictive) regulations
but expressed concerns that commercial banks were not respecting the regulations on
repatriation of export earnings. Commercial banks argued that they were conducting foreign
exchange transactions through accounts held abroad because access to foreign exchange
from the BCEAO was cumbersome. The government is planning a seminar with the BCEAO
and banks to resolve this matter shortly.
23. The authorities generally agreed with the staff that external competitiveness was
broadly adequate (Box 3). The real effective exchange rate (REER) is estimated to be
about 20 percent below its pre-1994 devaluation level. Estimates of the equilibrium real
exchange rate (ERER) for Côte d’Ivoire suggest that the REER is close to or below the
ERER. The increase in oil exports has likely increased the ERER, but further trade
liberalization, such as under the envisaged Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the
EU, could lower it. The authorities agreed that strengthening competitiveness was key for
private sector growth and diversification. To this end, it is important to improve the business
climate, notably regarding the cost of licenses and nonwage labor costs which are higher than
the average of SSA countries (Table 13). The authorities stressed the need to rehabilitate
road, port, and utilities infrastructure, as well as to address the emerging scarcity of skilled
labor, caused by the closure of some higher education institutions, frequent strikes in the past
decade, and schools in the south being burdened with students from the CNW.
24. The authorities agreed with staff that the prospective EPA could help stimulate
competition and efficiency and create new potential for investment and trade, but
expressed concern about transition costs. In the authorities’ view, while the predominantly
agricultural non-oil export sector could benefit, segments of the industrial sector would be
vulnerable. They were also concerned about tax revenue losses, and noted that it would take
time to broaden the domestic tax base. In their view, transition arrangements should address
these concerns. The staff cautioned that the potential trade diversion consequences of the
EPA should be minimized.

5

Côte d’Ivoire applies temporary restrictions relating to UN-imposed sanctions, based on WAEMU Regulation
14/2002/CM of September 2002 which provides for the enforcement of decisions by the UNSC Sanctions
Committee to freeze funds. The authorities are in the process of notifying the Fund of these restrictions.

20
Box 3. Côte d’Ivoire: Trade and Competitiveness1
Trade pattern (1994–2006): The share of Côte d’Ivoire (CIV) in world exports has been broadly stable over
the past decade (0.07 percent). In recent years, the decline in agricultural exports has been offset by an increase
in oil exports. CIV represents two-thirds of WAEMU exports. The share of the EU in CIV’s trade remains high
(and higher than in the rest of WAEMU) but is falling, more sharply for exports than for imports. The share of
WAEMU in CIV’s trade has remained low (about 8 percent, on average) and is largely driven by CIV exports to
the region.

Common External Tariff (CET) of WAEMU: The CET, in place since January 1, 2000, is based on the transit
system and not on free movement of goods. Obstacles to internal trade remain: non-tariff barriers, unauthorized
levies, complex administrative procedures, and differences in interpretation of community regulations. CIV has
arrears in its obligations to compensate other members for import tax losses due to the CET.
Trade policy issues: ECOWAS heads of states approved a CET (aligned on the CET of WAEMU) in
January 2006, to be effective from January 1, 2008. An EPA between ECOWAS and the EU on progressive
elimination of mutual trade restrictions is targeted to be in place by end-2007. The present trade regime
(Generalized System of Preferences - GSP) between EU and ACP operates on the basis of a WTO waiver,
which expires at end-2007.
REER, Term of Trade, and Labor Cost
External Competitiveness: CIV’s REER has been
appreciating but remains about 20 percent below its
pre-1994 devaluation level. Estimates of the ERER for
CIV suggest that the current level of the REER is
broadly in line with long-term fundamentals. Exports
are benefiting from rising oil production, which should
raise exports some 10 percent above their trend level
in 2006–10. The increase in oil output should raise the
ERER, while the forthcoming EPA should lower it.

impact of EPA on exports should be small.
Nevertheless, a favorable effect is expected on processed exports, such as cocoa products, which currently face
high tariffs, while an unfavorable effect could come from new competitors entering the EU duty-free under EPA
agreements for other regions. Imports from EU (40 percent of CIV’s imports) taxed at 10 percent, on average, are
expected to increase, as they gain duty-free access to CIV. This would lead to trade creation and trade diversion.
Assuming that tariffs would possibly remain on 20-30 percent of imports from the EU, the static import tax
revenue loss could be about 1 percent of GDP.

D. Macroeconomic Outlook and Policies for 2007
25. To support post-conflict recovery and reconstruction efforts through an economic
program, the authorities have requested a purchase under EPCA. They regard EPCA as
a bridge toward a PRGF arrangement and a World Bank EERC in 2008 (MEFP, ¶28). They
also see it as a step toward normalization of relations with external creditors and a decision
point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative in 2008. The program envisages the clearance of
arrears to the World Bank (largely in 2007) and the AfDB (in early 2008). Côte d’Ivoire
meets the eligibility criteria for EPCA. The country has an urgent balance of payments need,
as evidenced by its large external arrears. Although the rebel occupation of the CNW has
disrupted public service delivery, the country has enough capacity to plan and implement
policies. The Ouagadougou Accord provides for sufficiently stable security conditions and
the government has started to function throughout the country. Fund assistance would be part
of a concerted international effort.
26. The proposed access under EPCA—12.5 percent of quota (SDR 40.65 million)—is in
line with similar post-conflict cases. The EPCA supports the authorities’ program for 2007.
The authorities have requested subsidization of the interest rate. They intend to request a
second purchase in the next six months; approval would be contingent on continued
eligibility for EPCA, a satisfactory track record under the first EPCA, and agreement on a
program and budget for 2008.
27. The program focuses on building the foundation for sustained recovery and poverty
reduction in an environment of still improving security, regaining political stability,
and country reunification (MEFP, ¶17). The authorities recognized that early progress in
implementing the Ouagadougou Accord and demonstrating improvements in governance,
particularly in public finances and the energy and cocoa/coffee sectors, were important first
steps in gaining donor and private sector support. They stressed that the program focuses on
the immediate needs for a successful exit from the crisis, while restarting structural reforms,
but that the timing of deeper reforms needed to take into account the transitional context and
await a firmer political consensus.
Macroeconomic Outlook for 2007
28. A modest recovery is expected, as the economy benefits from the envisioned political
normalization. Real GDP growth should reach 1.7 percent in 2007, as industry, construction, and trade start to recover, supported by the ongoing rehabilitation of public
infrastructure and redeployment of government services in the CNW. Public and private
investments would likely remain sluggish in 2007 pending the renewal of donor support and
full return of business confidence. Capacity problems in the electricity sector pose a risk to
economic prospects. The external current account surplus is projected to drop as exports of
oil temporarily decrease and imports pick up in line with increased economic activity.

22
Removing constraints to economic and social recovery—creating fiscal space
29. The 2007 budget aims at addressing immediate post-conflict needs while setting the
stage for medium-term fiscal and debt sustainability (MEFP, ¶18-19). The 2007 budget,
passed at end-May, aims to increase the primary basic surplus (a measure of mobilization of
domestic resources to service debt) to 1 percent of GDP (from 0.3 percent in 2006). With
donor financing for non-crisis-related spending still modest before the elections, this surplus,
together with resources raised on the WAEMU market, would help reduce domestic arrears
(by ½ percent of GDP) to be followed by further settlements in 2008-09 (MEFP, ¶32). The
surplus would also finance, in part, the clearance of arrears to the World Bank (totaling
2.5 percent of GDP as of end-June 2007) and the resumption of debt service payments to the
AfDB. The planned fiscal adjustment, combined with repayment of domestic arrears, is
expected to have little or no contractionary effect.
30. Revenue is planned to rise by ½ percent of GDP through more efficient taxation of
petroleum products, improvements in tax administration, and extension of tax
collection to the whole country (MEFP, ¶20, 30, 35 and Box 1). The reduction in the
protective margin of the national oil refinery and the change in the tax base using import
parity prices are expected to increase revenue by ⅓ percent of GDP. Measures to combat
fraud in taxes and customs include enforcing businesses’ compliance with the new standard
VAT form, and improving border controls. Furthermore, the government intends to review
tax exemptions introduced to soothe the adverse impact of the crisis on businesses.
31. The 2007 budget seeks to cut nonessential spending, contains a modest peace
dividend, and provides for greater social and crisis-related spending (MEFP, ¶21-24).
Primary basic expenditure would decrease by 0.3 percent of GDP, while the share of social
and reunification spending would increase. Discretionary presidential and security-related
spending would decline in line with DDR and normalized security conditions. The wage bill,
reflecting the continued wage freeze and normal retirements, would be held constant in terms
of GDP (at 6.4 percent); this would allow for significant recruitment in health and education,
especially in the CNW, and for the integration of ex-combatants in the army. Investment
spending on the ongoing transfer of the political capital to the country’s interior will be
reduced in 2007, and the authorities are reassessing the costs and phasing of this program in
light of resource availability and other priorities.

Including net compensation proceeds for toxic waste damage.

32. The crisis-related spending programs are critical for successful reunification and
political stability (MEFP, ¶23). To ensure that they are adequately financed, the budget
seeks to avoid excessive expenses in these programs and allocates an increase of 0.8 percent
of GDP to these programs. A large part of this increase is funded by donors (Tables 4a–b),
including pledges expected to be made at a conference in mid-July.
33. Domestic and external sources would fill the program’s financing need (Table 7 and
MEFP ¶44-45). In light of the sizable resources needed for the clearance of arrears
(US$480 million at mid-2007) and resumption of debt service payments to the World Bank
and AfDB, the mobilization of World Bank resources for arrears clearance and budget
support are critical to closing the gap. The Bank’s Post-Conflict Assistance Project (PCAP)
pre-arrears clearance grant of US$120 million is expected to be considered by the Bank’s
Board in mid-July 2007; it would support reinsertion of ex-combatants, community
rehabilitation, and identification of the population. In line with the arrears clearance
framework, broadly endorsed by IDA at end-June, the authorities would contribute one-half
of the amount needed to clear their arrears to the Bank; the remainder would be provided

24
from Bank resources. As regards AfDB, debt service payments would commence in August
2007, as part of an agreement on eventual arrears clearance in early 2008. Part of the
financing need will be met by issuing government paper on the WAEMU market and rolling
over existing debt to domestic banks. The remaining gap will be filled by additional donor
support and further borrowing from WAEMU/domestic sources. The net total of such
borrowing should stay within ½ percent of GDP in 2007.

Enhancing transparency in public sector resource management and related reforms
34. The authorities stressed the priority they give to enhancing public resource management and encouraging private sector growth (MEFP, ¶27-28). The 2007 program focuses
on structural measures, elaborated in consultation with World Bank staff, with direct effects
on transparency in public finances and the energy and cocoa/coffee sectors and on financial
soundness. These early measures would provide a platform for deeper reforms in the context
of the planned Bank EERC.
35. Mostly upfront measures aim to improve expenditure management and transparency (MEFP, Box 1 and ¶32). Key measures include the full reinstatement and
application of normal budget execution and preparation procedures; a significant reduction in
the use of treasury advances; and regular publication of budget execution reports.
36. The authorities aim to reduce the deficits of the civil service pension fund (CGRAE)
and Postal Savings Fund (CNCE), which are part of government fiscal operations
(MEFP ¶33). The deficit of the CGRAE, which reached ½ percent of GDP in 2006, is
projected to rise further. With a view to defining measures that help restore financial
viability, the authorities intend to update the 2000 actuarial study by the ILO. The CNCE,
despite receiving large budget subsidies (¼ percent of GDP in 2006), has registered
significant losses in recent years. Its restructuring plan aims to improve profitability and
reduce reliance on government subsidies.
37. The authorities are committed to enhancing transparency and efficiency in the
energy sector, fully realizing its revenue potential, and spurring private investment
(MEFP, Box 2 and ¶34–36). To sustain the sector’s significant contribution to growth and
tax revenue, the authorities aim to introduce reforms that help address technical difficulties in
oil/gas production, increase domestic refining capacity, bring electricity tariffs (unchanged
since 2001) in line with fuel costs, and improve electricity bill collection. Based on the
forthcoming audits, the authorities intend to formulate a strategy and action plan for the
hydrocarbon sector, in collaboration with World Bank staff, to be implemented from
September 2007.6
38. The authorities intend to revisit their strategy for the cocoa/coffee sector and have
started promoting the transparent use of quasi-fiscal levies (MEFP, Box 3 and ¶37-38).
Côte d’Ivoire is the world’s largest cocoa producer—cocoa accounts for one quarter of its
exports; yet inadequate producer incentives and poor management in the sector’s agencies
have limited its contribution to rural growth. The authorities noted that they had already
reduced levies in recent years, increased the allocation of levies to rural investment, and
6

See Selected Issues Paper on the energy sector.

26
strengthened government oversight. Bank and Fund staffs have recommended deeper
reductions in the levies to benefit farmers. However, the authorities are unconvinced that
these would translate into higher producer prices and saw a continued role for the levies to
finance rural infrastructure. With a view to improving the sector’s incentives and management, the authorities agreed to prepare a comprehensive reform strategy that would address
the level of (quasi-) taxation and the sector’s legal and institutional framework.
39. The authorities are committed to reverse the recent decline in output and financial
performance of the cotton sector (MEFP, ¶40). Output has fallen by one-half since 2002
and payment arrears have mounted. The authorities emphasized the importance of this sector,
which supports some 2 million people, mainly in the north. To help improve the financial
situation of operators and producers, the government is completing the clearance, with EU
support, of its arrears on subsidies to the sector. It intends to adopt a restructuring plan which
would improve the sector’s extension services and marketing structure.
Strengthening the role of the financial sector
40. The authorities agreed with staff’s assessment of banking and microfinance sector
vulnerabilities, and on the need to strengthen the capital base of troubled banks. The
authorities agreed that banks’ weak compliance with prudential norms needed to be urgently
addressed. They noted that it was the prerogative of the WAMU Banking Commission to
initiate remedial actions, but reiterated their commitment to support the Commission’s efforts
to ensure compliance (MEFP, ¶26). Staff encouraged the authorities to fully do their part,
notably in the appointment of temporary administrators and withdrawing licenses. While the
authorities recognized that weaknesses in the judicial system impede loan recovery and
contract enforcement, they indicated that the weaknesses needed to be addressed under a
medium-term program with donor support.7
41. The authorities agreed that the large state-owned National Investment Bank (BNI)
still depends heavily on public sector deposits and credits (MEFP, ¶26). Staff highlighted
the continued breach of several key prudential norms and the importance of opening up the
capital to private participation. The authorities underlined recent progress in BNI’s
restructuring and its important role in financing economic activities that could not be
financed otherwise. With a view to improving BNI’s financial viability and reorienting its
activities from the public to the private sector, the authorities plan an external audit of the
BNI and a strategic study of its role in financing the economy.

7

These issues will be covered by an FSAP for the WAEMU region in late 2007.

27
Social sector issues and PRSP
42. The government attaches priority to reversing the deterioration in education and
health services (MEFP, ¶41-42). The focus is on the rehabilitation of schools, health
clinics, and hospitals and the redeployment and additional recruitment of teachers and
doctors for the affected areas. The government is preparing medium-term plans for the health
and education sectors, to be implemented with donor support. As regards the preparation of a
PRSP (MEFP, ¶43), the authorities have begun to take stock of progress achieved vis-à-vis
the objectives of the 2002 I-PRSP and plan a poverty survey. They expect to finalize the
PRSP by mid-2008.
Capacity building, technical assistance, and statistical issues
43. While broadly adequate, Côte d’Ivoire’s capacity for surveillance, program
monitoring, and statistics collection needs strengthening in several areas (MEFP, ¶46).
Since early 2007, at the request of the authorities, technical assistance missions from
AFRITAC-West have resumed covering tax administration, public expenditure management,
debt management, and microfinance. The authorities are seeking further assistance in these
areas, as well as for a review of tax exemptions, anti-money laundering, and national
accounts. The government is also reinvigorating several interministerial committees for
program implementation and data reporting.
Program monitoring and risks
44. The authorities’ MEFP contains structural and quarterly quantitative indicators
through December 2007 (Appendix I, Attachment I, Tables 1-2). Definitions and adjusters
of financial indicators and requirements for data transmission to staff are described in the
TMU. Prior actions are listed in Table 2 of the MEFP.
45. The staff assesses as adequate Côte d’Ivoire’s capacity to repay the Fund. The
government has remained current on its Fund obligations. Côte d’Ivoire’s membership in the
BCEAO has ensured—and should continue to do so—payment to the Fund, notwithstanding
significant arrears to other creditors.
46. There are important political and economic risks to program implementation.
Despite progress in building consensus, political tensions could lead to delays in
implementing the authorities’ roadmap to peace and elections—with possible consequences
for the security situation, defense spending, and the timing of elections. Such delays could
jeopardize the attainment of program objectives, dampen donor support, and provoke a
resurgence of political instability.

28
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
47. Côte d’Ivoire is emerging from a period of political instability and crisis that took
an economic and social toll. Per capita real income fell by one-sixth, social services
deteriorated, and social indicators worsened. The impact was felt throughout the subregion.
48. The political and security situation has improved since the March 2007
Ouagadougou Accord, but daunting challenges remain. To push forward on the road to
sustained peace, elections, and economic and social recovery, stronger domestic consensus
building and the continued support of the international community are crucial. In this
context, an EPCA-supported program could help secure progress in these areas and facilitate
securing higher growth and poverty reduction.
49. To achieve rapid economic recovery, the authorities would need to rigorously
implement measures to improve public resource management.
• Short-term measures should focus on restoring security, reunifying the country,
and rehabilitating social services and basic infrastructure. With tight financial
constraints, this requires creating fiscal space by reinforcing revenue administration,
improving revenue collection (especially from the energy sector), and reducing
nonessential spending.
• Early steps to improve transparency in revenue mobilization and budget execution
are needed to improve resource use and reinforce domestic political consensus. Strict
enforcement of existing budget procedures, regular publication of budget execution,
and reporting on physical and financial flows in the energy and cocoa/coffee sectors
would support such efforts.
50. Longer-term challenges include strengthening financial sector soundness,
revitalizing reforms in the energy and cocoa/coffee sectors, and improving
competitiveness.
• Financial sector. To enhance the sector’s role in growth, financial supervision
and the judiciary environment for loan recovery need to be strengthened. Better
compliance with prudential norms and the audit of the state-owned National
Investment Bank are welcome steps, as is the planned regional FSAP.
• Energy sector. Reforms to improve the transparency and efficiency of the oil/gas,
refinery, and electricity sectors would support growth and boost government revenue.
The ongoing audits of the sector are a good step; their recommendations, when
issued, must be implemented as early as possible. Pricing energy products in line with
world prices should induce more efficient use of these resources and avoid implicit
subsidies. The envisaged steps to implement the EITI process are welcome.

29
• Cocoa/coffee/cotton sectors. Reform of the institutional structure is urgently
needed to realize these sectors’ potential in promoting growth, employment, and
poverty reduction. The envisaged formulation and implementation of a
comprehensive strategy are important steps. Close monitoring of the use of existing
quasi-fiscal levies—and reducing them further—are crucial for improving the
conditions of farmers.
• Competitiveness. Sustained growth will require improvements in
competitiveness and further diversification of the economy. While there are no signs
that Côte d’Ivoire’s real exchange rate is above its equilibrium level, stronger growth
in nontraditional tradables will be needed to offset the projected decline in oil exports
and rapid growth in demand for imports. Reducing the costs of doing business is a
priority.
51. Implementation of the envisaged macroeconomic policies should contribute to
domestic stability and the external stability of the WAEMU. Central in this regard are the
policies in 2007 that aim to restore sustainable fiscal and external positions. In time, these
policies should also help compliance with the WAEMU convergence criteria.
52. In addition to prudent fiscal policies and public debt management, sizable debt
relief would be needed to restore debt sustainability. The LIC-DSA shows debt distress,
and key NPV of debt ratios are well above the country-specific thresholds.
53. The focus of the authorities’ program for 2007—on short-term measures to promote
economic recovery, rebuild government services, and ensure transparency in public
resource management—is appropriate. The 2007 budget allows for more spending on
social services, basic infrastructure, and crisis-related programs, while reducing defense and
discretionary presidential spending. To capture the peace dividend, all spending should be
strictly monitored. The start of reforms in the energy and cocoa/coffee sectors is welcome.
54. The government’s adoption of a timetable for the preparation of the PRSP is
welcome. It is important for the authorities to involve a wide range of stakeholders, while
using surveys and diagnostic studies to assess rehabilitation needs across the country.
55. The authorities’ capacity for program monitoring and data provision to the Fund is
broadly adequate. However, committees involved in program implementation and data
monitoring need strengthening, especially in budget execution and cocoa/coffee and energy
sector monitoring. The quality and timeliness of data provision need improvement, especially
in the areas of national accounts, labor data, and balance of payments.
56. While recognizing the risks facing the program, staff recommends approval of the
authorities’ request for an EPCA purchase. The risks include resurgence of political
tensions, delays in DDR, and weakening security, which could postpone the elections and

30
slow program implementation. In weighing those risks, staff has considered the authorities’
firm commitment to the program, as evidenced by strong prior actions, and the international
community’s continued support of the peace process.
57. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation discussions be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

These indicators are to a large extent based on subjective perception and judgment.

The CPI gathers data from sources that span the last two years. All sources measure the perception of corruption (frequence
and/or size of bribes in the public and political sectors). To determine the mean value for a country, standardization is
carried out via a matching percentile technique. This allows all reported scores to remain within 0 and 10 (10 is the best).
3/
The CPIA measures the extent to which a country's policy and institutional framework supports sustainable growth and poverty
reduction, and consequently the effective use of development assistance. The exercise yields scores for all of the 16 criteria
that compose the CPIA. Bank staff assesses the country's actual performance on each of the criteria, and assigns a rating.
These scores are averaged, first to yield the cluster score, and then to determine a composite country rating as the average of
the four clusters. The rating level is between 1 and 6 (the best).
4/
The Cost of Doing Business index ranks economies from 1 to 175, with first place being the best. The index is calculated for
each country as the simple average of country rankings on each of the topics covered. The ranking of each topic is the
average of the percentile rankings on its component indicators.
5/
The recovery rate calculates how many cents on the dollar claimants (creditors, tax authorities, and employees) recover
from an insolvent firm.
6/
Average cost in U.S. dollars per container to export and to import.

Appendix I
Abidjan, July 12, 2007

Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431

Dear Mr. de Rato,
1.
Since 1999, Côte d’Ivoire has suffered from political instability, a factor that has
contributed to a slowdown in the economy and a sharp deterioration in social conditions.
The country’s partition into a northern and southern zone following the crisis of
September 2002 led to further deterioration in the economic and social situation. Since
2005, there has been some progress toward peace, reunification, and national
reconciliation thanks to the efforts of successive governments. In March 2007, the
Ouagadougou Accord between the President of the Republic and the Secretary-General of
the Forces Nouvelles, with the support of all the major political parties, opened the way to
a sustainable solution to the crisis and open, democratic, and transparent presidential
elections in early 2008. The Accord was welcomed by the populations living in Côte
d’Ivoire, the international community, including the Economic Community of West
African States, the African Union, and the United Nations Security Council.
2.
Pursuant to the Accord, the new transition government, which took office in April
2007, is focusing its efforts on implementing as rapidly as possible the unification and
restructuring of the two armies, the disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR)
program, dismantling the militias, redeploying government services throughout our
national territory, identifying the population, and preparing for the elections. The
government has already created the Integrated Command Center for the two armies and
the mixed brigades, and has eliminated the “confidence zone.” These brigades have begun
to operate in this zone to ensure security. We have also adopted a new amnesty law for
war crimes and crimes against the State, and have begun to implement the measures to
reunify the country. By end-July 2007, we hope to have achieved significant progress in
regrouping and disarming ex-combatants and in dismantling the militias. We also intend to
reinstall the prefectural administration and to make the decentralized subnational governments (town halls and general councils) fully operational in all 22 départements in the
central, northern, and western zones of our territory, as well as to resume the process of
identifying the population, in particular through identification hearings by end-July 2007.

51
3.
Progress made with these steps should permit Côte d’Ivoire’s external partners to
gradually reengage. To this end, we have adopted a plan for the gradual clearance,
beginning in mid-July 2007, of arrears to the World Bank, as well as a plan for clearing
arrears to the African Development Bank, as agreed with these two institutions. We have
also introduced a mechanism for setting aside the funds necessary to cover debt service
requirements vis-à-vis these institutions for the remainder of 2007.
4.
With the support of the international community, the transition government intends
to build on the gains made to date to implement policies aimed at national reconciliation,
sustained recovery of economic growth, improved social conditions, and poverty
reduction. Our Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP), attached
hereto, describes the government’s economic and financial program for 2007. The
government recognizes the crucial importance of progressively improving transparency in
the public policy management and the need to combat fraud and corruption. To this end,
we have begun to implement specific measures for the management of public and quasipublic resources, in particular in the oil/gas sector and the coffee/cocoa sector. Equally, an
important aspect of economic policy in 2007 will be the building of the capacity of public
institutions and of administration in the whole country, and penalizing proven cases of
mismanagement.
5.
Fiscal policy for 2007 reflects that this year is one of transition and reunification.
Expenditure relating to our exit from crisis and to the electoral process will be given
priority; they will thus absorb a sizable share of our budgetary resources. However, our
objective is to reap the dividends of peace as soon as possible and for the benefit of the
population. To this end, we are extending resource mobilization to the entire reunified
national territory. We also will reduce nonessential expenditures (including front-line
bonuses), including those with no direct social and economic impact, and reorient
resources toward social outlays and the rehabilitation of basic infrastructure. We will also
re-evaluate the scope and phasing of certain major construction projects in light of
available financing and the needs of our country’s population. We are also planning to
return to normal budget execution procedures and to regularly disseminate budget
execution statements within the government and to the general public. For programs
associated with our exit from crisis, we intend—in consultation with our external
partners—to formulate realistic budgets and to organize, before end-July 2007, a donor
conference aimed at obtaining their support for covering the residual financial
requirements of these programs.
6.
The government believes that the policies defined in the MEFP are appropriate for
achieving our economic objectives. It will take any further measures that may prove necessary to implement the program. In support of its program, the government requests
Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance (EPCA) from the IMF in the amount of SDR 40.65

52
million, or the equivalent of 12.5 percent of our quota. We strongly hope that Côte
d’Ivoire will receive an interest rate subsidy. We intend to request additional assistance
under the EPCA of the IMF within the next six months.
7.
This request and the associated program would also be a bridge to a new program,
for which we will request the IMF’s support under its Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF). Such a program should make it possible for Côte d’Ivoire to regain
access to the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. The
government plans to prepare its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) as quickly as
possible.
8.
The government will consult with the IMF on the implementation of the economic
policy program set forth in the MEFP. It will provide the IMF with all the information
required for monitoring program implementation, in accordance with the IMF’s policy on
such consultations.
9.
The Ivoirien authorities wish to make this letter, the attached MEFP, the attached
Technical Memorandum of Understanding, as well as the IMF staff report on the EPCA
request available to the public. We hereby authorize their publication and their posting on
the IMF website following approval by the IMF Executive Board.
Sincerely yours,

/s/

Appendix I. Attachment I. Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies for
2007
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Since 1999, Côte d'Ivoire has been in a protracted political crisis that led to an
armed conflict in 2002 and the division of the country into a northern and southern part.
The socioeconomic impact has been considerable: per capita real GDP declined significantly; basic social services deteriorated, particularly in the northern part of the country;
and the number of displaced persons reached about 1 million. Over the last three years, the
security situation has gradually improved, and growth has recovered moderately thanks to
the resilience of the economy. However, increased government spending and the
prolonged suspension of external assistance resulted in a deterioration of the budget
situation and a sizable accumulation of external and domestic arrears.
2.
In recent years, with the support and mediation of the international community,
Côte d'Ivoire made some progress toward restoring peace, though the political
environment and security situation have been fragile. In early 2007, to relaunch Côte
d’Ivoire on the path to peace, President Gbagbo and the Secretary General of the Forces
Nouvelles, Guillaume Soro, engaged in a direct dialogue that resulted in the signature of
the Ouagadougou Accord in early March 2007. The Accord has received the support of the
major political parties and the international community, including the Economic
Community of West African States, the African Union, and the United Nations Security
Council; and it opens the way for rapid reunification and national reconciliation and
elections by early 2008. It will be the cornerstone for peace and security, economic
recovery, and the improvement of social conditions.
3.
The new transition government took office in April 2007, and in May established a
roadmap and implementation matrix for the Accord. The roadmap calls for the relaunching
and acceleration of the disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) program;
the dismantling of militias; the unification and restructuring of the armies; the
identification of the population; the organization of elections; and the redeployment of
government services throughout the entire country. In mid-May 2007, these programs and
processes—in particular the regrouping of ex-combatants, the dismantling of militia, and
the redeployment of administrative and social services—got under way. We expect by
end-July 2007 to have completed the reinstallation of the prefectural administration and to
have made the decentralized subnational governments (town halls and general councils)
fully operational in all 22 départements in the central, northern, and western (CNW) zones.
By the same date, we will have begun the regrouping of ex-combatants in the 17 sites
(with a view to their integration into the army or their demobilization), the dismantling of
militias, and the resumption of identification hearings (audiences foraines).

54
4.
The government is determined to ensure that the peace process moves ahead
steadily in the coming weeks, so that Côte d'Ivoire may rapidly benefit from the financial
engagement of the Bretton Woods Institutions and our other partners. To that end, in
agreement with the two institutions concerned, we have adopted a plan for the gradual
settlement of arrears to the World Bank to begin in July 2007, and a plan to clear arrears to
the African Development Bank (AfDB) by April 2008, in the framework of its PostConflict Facility.
5.
This Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) sets out the
specific objectives and policies that the authorities intend to implement in the context of
their program in 2007. The authorities are seeking the support of the international
community and of the IMF in the form of Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance (EPCA).
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
6.
The economy has rebounded from the conflict and has shown continued resilience
to the crisis, with three successive years of positive growth. In 2006, economic growth
reached about 1 percent, supported by strong oil production (crude and refined products)
and a pick-up in telecommunications and trade. This helped offset the decline in several
industries, notably food processing. Consumer price inflation remained low, at 2.5 percent
in annual average terms. Real and nominal effective exchange rates were broadly stable
in 2006, reflecting inflation in line with Côte d’Ivoire’s trading partners and the stability of
the euro vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar.
7.
In 2006, the fiscal situation was weaker than expected and the primary basic fiscal
surplus reached 0.3 percent of GDP (compared with 0.4 percent of GDP in 2005 and
1.4 percent of GDP targeted for 2006). Revenues were somewhat lower than expected,
largely reflecting lower than projected oil and gas production because of technical
difficulties. Expenditure was higher than anticipated in the 2006 Budget owing to overruns
on nonwage current expenditure (excluding spending related to exiting from the crisis), in
particular unforeseen higher sovereignty spending, expenses necessitated by a toxic waste
spill, and gas subsidies to the electricity sector, which faces serious technical and financial
difficulties. These overruns were attenuated by lower-than-expected spending relating to
exiting from the crisis, as progress on the DDR, redeployment, and identification programs
was slower than envisaged. Education and health expenditure fell to 26.9 percent of total
primary expenditure, compared to 28.6 percent in 2005.
8.
Given the expenditure and cash flow pressures, the overall fiscal deficit was
largely financed by an accumulation of external arrears (which rose by 3 percentage points
to 21 percent of GDP at end-2006) as well as borrowing on the West African Economic
and Monetary Union (WAEMU) and international financial markets. The government
managed to keep the stock of domestic arrears constant, and in early 2007, started to

55
regularize the end-2005 stock through securitization (in an amount equivalent to 0.3
percent of 2007 GDP).
9.
Progress was made in fiscal and accounting reforms, in several areas in 2006. In
mid-2006, the government adopted streamlined procedures for the execution and control
of expenditure related to exiting from the crisis and financed by its own resources.
However, because of the late adoption of the 2006 Budget Law and unforeseen demands,
the budget was to a large extent executed through Treasury advances. The deconcentration
of fiscal management was further extended by linking 8 more départements to the
integrated expenditure management system (SYGFiP), bringing the total to 37 by the start
of 2007. Implementation of the new Public Procurement Code adopted in 2005 began in
2006. The accounting management system was improved with ASTER software, and
efforts were initiated to improve the training of accountants with the creation of a training
and capacity building center in 2006.
10.
On the revenue side, in late June 2005 the government introduced a standardized
invoice (facture normalisée) with features to combat VAT fraud and cover the informal
sector, but effective implementation was delayed to the second half of 2006 because of
resistance by operators. Since late 2006, the tax and customs directorates have been
applying a simplified system for reimbursing VAT credits within 60 days. Customs
implemented the measures in its action plan, notably the streamlining of its computerized
customs clearance system, which helped reduce the potential for fraud and corruption.
Furthermore, the rate of the profit tax (BIC) was lowered from 35 percent to 27 percent for
large enterprises, and to 25 percent for small and medium-sized enterprises.
11.
During the first quarter of 2007, pending approval of the 2007 Budget, spending
took place through advances in line with priorities and available resources. Revenue
performance has been in line with projections except for lower oil/gas revenue related to
technical difficulties in the Baobab field, which should be resolved later in the year. As a
result, the primary basic surplus reached 0.6 percent of GDP. In early 2007, the
government received a compensation payment of CFAF 95 billion from the foreign
company responsible for the toxic waste spill. After deduction of the costs of remedial
measures already committed by the government, the remaining amount of CFAF 66.8
billion has been placed in a special government account with the BCEAO to be used for
assistance to victims and preventive measures in 2007-08.
12.
The external current account balance (including official transfers) moved from near
zero in 2005 to a surplus of 3 percent of GDP in 2006. This largely reflected an increase of
almost 50 percent in the export volumes of crude oil and petroleum products and
somewhat higher world oil prices. A decline in cocoa export volumes was offset by more
favorable cocoa prices. The capital account continued to show a large deficit, owing to the
almost complete lack of external financing. Consequently, the overall balance of payments

56
deficit reached 2.5 percent of GDP and was financed by the accumulation of external
arrears.
13.
Broad money increased by 10 percent in 2006, largely in line with an increase in
the net foreign assets of the banking system and the moderate increase in domestic credit.
14.
The banking system has improved its performance since 2004, but also faces crisisrelated and structural weaknesses. Since the start of the crisis in September 2002, all 19
bank branches in the central, northern, and western zones were closed. However, since
March 2007 the banks have begun to resume operations in these areas and are gradually
increasing their activities. The ratio of nonperforming loans to total credit, which had
increased sharply between 2001 and 2004 to over 26 percent by end-2004, improved to
20 percent at end-2006. However, eight of the 18 banks are not in compliance with the
capital adequacy ratio, six banks are not observing the minimum liquidity ratio, and six
banks were placed under close surveillance by the WAMU Banking Commission. The
restructuring of the National Investment Bank (BNI) has progressed: in line with the
BNI’s objective of redirecting its activities toward the private sector, the share of claims
on government in the BNI’s portfolio fell to 60 percent at end-2006 (compared with 64
percent at end-2005 and 83 percent at end-2001). The share of public sector deposits
remained at its 2005 level of 60 percent in 2006 (compared with 81 percent in 2002).
While some of its prudential ratios improved, the BNI is still not in compliance with the
liquidity ratio and the ratio for lending to shareholders. The microfinance sector increased
its share in total financial activity (from 2.5 percent of deposits in 2002 to 4.9 percent in
2006), but its performance suffered from the crisis, resulting in three consecutive years of
losses, and capital is negative for the sector as a whole.
15.
Progress with structural reforms in the coffee/cocoa and energy sectors was limited
owing to the crisis. The quasi-fiscal levies on cocoa were reduced by CFAF 3 per kilogram
(one-third of the envisaged reduction) during the 2006/07 season to increase producer
prices. To improve transparency in the collection and the efficient use of these levies, the
government took steps, in early 2006, to strengthen the monitoring of the investment funds
(FDPCC—Investment and Prudential Reserve). It earmarked CFAF 12.5 per kilogram of
the quasi-fiscal levies for a rural investment fund held in a special account at the BCEAO.
The Committee responsible for reviewing and monitoring programs and projects in the
coffee/cocoa sector (the “Coffee/Cocoa Committee”), created in February 2006, oversees
these investment funds. All programs and projects selected in this context have been
subject to final approval by the Minister of Agriculture and the Minister of Economy and
Finance.
16.
The energy sector has grown substantially in recent years with the entry into
operation of new oil/gas fields, better use of refining capacity, and the high demand for
electricity. However, the government is aware that the transparency and efficiency of the
energy sector need to be improved and its economic and revenue potential fully realized.

57
To this end, the government announced its participation in the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative (EITI) in May 2006 and is taking steps to begin effective
participation in 2007. In recent months, the delayed financial, technical, and operational
audits for oil and gas extraction, refining and distribution, and for the electricity sector,
were started with World Bank support, and are expected to be completed by August 2007.
In mid-2006, the protective margin of the refinery, Société Ivoirienne de Raffinage (SIR),
was reduced from 13 percent to 8 percent of the import parity price, in line with the
government’s commitment. The electricity sector continues to experience serious financial
and technical difficulties, including the nonpayment of electricity bills in the north
since 2002 and the accumulation of cross-arrears. To help address these difficulties, the
government provided a gas subsidy to the electricity sector in 2006. In March 2007, the
government signed a protocol with the Compagnie Ivoirienne de l’Électricité (CIE) to
settle all outstanding cross-arrears and avoid accumulating any new arrears.
III. 2007 PROGRAM
Overall objectives
17.
The main objectives of the government’s post-conflict program for 2007 build on
the progress made thus far, as well as on the determination of all parties to ensure security,
promote national reconciliation, reunify the country, relaunch the economy, and reduce
poverty. Progress with the reunification and national reconciliation process, the restoration
of public infrastructure, and the resurgence of confidence on the part of the private sector
should make it possible to achieve growth of 1½ percent, despite a decline in oil
production attributable to the temporary technical difficulties experienced in an important
oil field. The principal objectives for 2007 are the reduction of macroeconomic and
financial imbalances, the resumption of structural reforms, and the creation of an
economic environment conducive to private sector activity. To that end, the government
recognizes the crucial importance of good governance in the management of public
resources and combating fraud and corruption.
Fiscal policy
18.
Fiscal policy in 2007 is aimed at beginning to restore fiscal and debt sustainability
while addressing Côte d’Ivoire’s post-conflict needs. In the short term, expenditures
related to exiting the crisis (DDR, redeployment, identification, and elections) will
continue to absorb a considerable share of budgetary expenditures. The share of budget
expenditure devoted to the social sector, reunification, and the rehabilitation of the
economic infrastructure will be gradually increased. At the same time, fiscal policy will
allow for progress toward closer adherence to the convergence criteria of the West African
Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU).

58
19.
The 2007 Budget Law promulgated in end-May 2007 targets a primary basic
surplus of 1.0 percent of GDP (compared with 0.3 percent in 2006) and an overall deficit
(excluding grants, on a payment order basis) of 1 percent of GDP. Given the sizeable
expenditure needs owing to the post-conflict situation, the government is seeking the reengagement of the international community to help Côte d'Ivoire in its reconstruction
efforts. To that end, resources equivalent to about 3 percent of GDP will be needed for
clearing arrears with the World Bank and starting normalizing financial relations with the
AfDB.
20.
The fiscal program calls for a revenue increase of 0.5 percent of GDP (excluding
the net revenue from toxic waste damage compensation). To achieve this, the government
will rapidly extend tax collection to the whole of the country, further strengthen tax
administration, and broaden the tax base, in particular through generalized use of the
“standardized invoice.” It will also increase revenue from petroleum product taxation
through a combination of (see ¶35): (i) a further reduction in the protective margin for the
refinery (SIR) and an increase in the taxable base beginning in mid-June 2007; and (ii)
better control of taxation of domestic consumption. Finally, it will step up its efforts to
obtain budgetary revenue from oil/gas through improved monitoring of the financial flows
in the sector, and in particular through efforts to optimize the revenue from the national
company (PETROCI).
21.
Primary basic expenditure (excluding interest on debt and foreign-financed
investment, as well as expenditure relating to the toxic waste spill) will be contained at
17.6 percent of GDP (compared with 17.9 percent in 2006). This reflects the combined
impact of lower nonessential current expenditure and the reorientation of resources toward
social sector and reunification spending. In particular, sovereignty expenditure, front-line
bonuses (primes de front), and other military expenditure will be reduced in line with
progress with the DDR program and the normalization of the security situation. As regards
personnel expenditure, the government will keep the wage bill at the equivalent of
6.4 percent of GDP. This will allow for the integration of ex-combatants into the unified
army as well as net recruitment of 6,000 civil servants. New hiring will give priority to the
immediate needs in the education and health sectors arising from the redeployment of
services throughout the entire country. In order to address the serious shortage of primary
and secondary school teachers, the government intends to raise the teacher retirement age
to 60 years and eliminate the rule of retirement after 30 years of service by end-September
2007.
22.
In respect to other current spending, the government intends to contain gas
subsidies for the electricity sector at CFAF 30 billion and take measures to improve the
financial situation of the sector. Spending on utilities (water, electricity, telephone) by the
central government will be contained through strict application of budget ceilings and
continued efforts to enhance the government entities’ awareness of the need to economize.

59
The budget contains a “contingency” line of CFAF 15 billion for unforeseen needs related
to the reunification. The fiscal program for 2007 seeks to safeguard social spending
(education, health and other spending as defined in the TMU) and to increase it in the
event of higher-than-anticipated oil revenues or external budgetary support. Such spending
will increase to 27.9 percent of total primary expenditure, compared with 26.9 percent
in 2006.
23.
Implementation of the government’s roadmap will require expenditures related to
exiting the crisis, excluding front-line bonuses, of about 1.2 percent of GDP (compared
with 0.3 percent in 2006). These expenditures will cover in particular: (i) the DDR and
community rehabilitation program, with support from the World Bank and other external
partners; (ii) the redeployment of some 12,000 more civil servants, in addition to the
12,500 civil servants already deployed since 2004, with support from the EU and the
World Bank; and (iii) the identification of the population and organization of the elections.
The government intends to hold a donor conference before end-July to complete the
financing of these programs, although considerable amounts of domestic resources have
been allocated to them under the 2007 Budget and financial support from donors has been
lined up.
24.
Domestically financed investment expenditure will be contained at its 2006 level
of almost 2 percent of GDP. Bearing in mind the financial constraints during the transition
period, the investment program is focused on the rehabilitation of the infrastructures
needed for basic administrative and social services, postponing and/or reducing the scope
of projects that have no direct social or economic impact. In this connection, expenditure
for the transfer of the political capital to Yamoussoukro, which is essential for
reunification and for the development of the country’s interior, is contained at CFAF 17.3
billion in 2007, compared with CFAF 27 billion in 2006. By end-2007 the government
will reassess the costs and phasing of the multiyear program for the transfer of the capital
in light of the availability of funding and the priority needs of the country. To mobilize
additional resources for addressing the major reconstruction needs of Côte d’Ivoire, the
government intends to organize, with support from the World Bank and the UNDP, an
additional donor conference during the fourth quarter of 2007.
Monetary policy and the financial sector
25.
Monetary policy is executed by the BCEAO. Broad money is expected to grow by
about 5 percent in 2007, or somewhat above the rate of growth of nominal GDP. Taking
into account the planned issuance of securities to meet the government’s financing needs,
net credit to the government from the banking system should decrease by 2 percent of
broad money at end-2006. On this basis, credit to the private sector and net foreign assets
should increase by 6 percent and 2 percent of end-2006 broad money, respectively.

60
26.
The government will continue to support the efforts of the WAMU Banking
Commission to ensure that Ivoirien banks comply with prudential ratios and apply the
Commission’s recommendations, in particular as regards the capital adequacy ratio. In
particular, the government will call upon the eight undercapitalized banks to produce plans
for building up capital by end-2007. In the case of the BNI, the government is cognizant of
the importance of implementing the recommendations made by the Banking Commission
and of the still very high share of the public sector in the bank’s deposits and claims. By
mid-2008 it will prepare an external financial and operational audit of the BNI, as well as
a strategic study of the role of the BNI in financing the economy.
Governance, transparency, and structural reforms
27.
The government reiterates its determination to put good governance in the
management of public resources at the center of its economic program. It is committed to
combating corruption and fraud at all levels, strengthening the rule of law, and restoring an
economic and regulatory environment that is conducive to economic activity.
28.
In 2007, the government will place emphasis on moving ahead with key structural
measures that have a direct impact on the economic environment and fiscal transparency.
These measures should lay the foundations for deeper and more far-reaching structural
reforms in the longer term as part of a program that could be supported by the IMF’s
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) and an Emergency Economic Recovery
Credit (EERC) from the World Bank in 2008. The government will place particular
emphasis on: (i) capacity-building and enhanced accountability of public administration
and managers; (ii) tightening controls; and (iii) better communication (including
publication) of the results of public policy. The government has taken or is committed to
taking measures in the areas of public finances, the energy sector, and the coffee/cocoa
and cotton sectors.
Fiscal reforms (Box 1)
29.
The extensive reforms completed in recent years have made it possible to
modernize and computerize tax administration and budget execution. The integrated fiscal
management system (SIGFiP) covers all participants in the public expenditure process,
and the deconcentration of the system will be pursued in the 56 localities serving as
administrative centers of regions or départements. The government intends to strengthen
these management tools further in order to enhance revenue collection and transparency of
budget execution.
30.
Revenue. Owing to the crisis since 2002, the government has used legal provisions
and successive agreements to grant a number of tax exemptions in favor of adversely
affected enterprises. Most of these measures will remain in effect through 2007. However,
the government intends to evaluate all exemptions (with IMF technical assistance) by end-

61
December 2007. The government also intends to further strengthen tax administration,
including implementation of its action plans to combat tax fraud. In particular, the
Directorate-General of Taxes will continue to implement the measures recently
introduced, including the full implementation of the “standardized invoice.” At the
Directorate-General of Customs, measures are now being implemented to gradually secure
the borders, enhance cooperation with the customs administrations of Ghana, Mali, and
Burkina Faso, and strengthen inspections. From May 2007, the government has
discontinued the advance payments of the single export duty (DUS) on cocoa and coffee.
31.
There are also plans to further strengthen the control and monitoring of the revenue
agencies and public enterprises managing significant public resources. The work program
for 2007-08 calls for an increase in the number of audit missions conducted by the
Inspection générale des finances (IGF) as well as a number of independent audits of the
major public enterprises. To that end, the staffing and technical capacities of the IGF and
the Participations and Privatization Directorate (DPP) will be strengthened for conducting
such missions. Finally, the government will undertake an independent audit of domestic
petroleum product consumption and the related tax revenues before end-September 2007.
32.
Expenditure. The fiscal management and accounting systems (SIGFiP and
ASTER) will be fully exploited to control and monitor budget execution and to issue
budget execution statements at least quarterly. The existing budget execution procedures
will be strictly adhered to, and recourse to Treasury advances reduced. These systems will
be further harmonized so as to allow budget execution reporting through the payments
stage from 2008 onward. Furthermore the authorities intend to submit the draft final
budget accounts (lois de règlement) for fiscal years 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006 to the
Chambre des comptes by end-2007. The government further intends to make a particular
effort to reduce the stock of domestic arrears (including VAT arrears) by at least CFAF 50
billion (0.5 percent of GDP) in 2007, which should help the recovery of the private sector.
In addition, the government is committed to adopting, before end-2007, a plan for clearing
the remaining verified stock of arrears over the 2007-09 period, including through further
securitization, while taking into account the social impact. At the same time, expenditure
financed by an expected post-conflict grant from the World Bank will pass through
a fiduciary trust management agency (Agence de Gestion Fiduciaire—AGF), for which
the terms of reference have been agreed with World Bank staff.
33.
The government intends to contain the growth of the structural deficit of the
government employee pension fund (Caisse Générale de Retraite des Agents de l’Etat—
CGRAE), which is projected to increase to CFAF 54 billion in 2007 (from CFAF 47
billion in 2006). The government also intends to update the actuarial study prepared by the
International Labor Office (ILO) in 2000, and to issue a call for bids by end-June 2007.
The study in question will be used as a basis for actions relating to the retirement system
and age and to the pension calculation base. The application for a bank license for the

62
postal savings fund (Caisse Nationale des Caisses d’Epargne—CNCE) is under review by
the Banking Commission. Based on the audit already performed and the CNCE’s five-year
operating and restructuring plan, it should gradually be able to improve the profitability of
its portfolio. This will enable the government gradually to reduce the cash subsidies on
which the CNCE is heavily dependent; in 2007, the subsidy will be reduced to
CFAF 15 billion, from CFAF 22 billion in 2006.
Energy sector (Box 2)
34.
For some years the government has been considering ways to improve the transparency and efficiency of the energy sector with a view to fully realizing the economic and
revenue potential of Côte d’Ivoire’s energy resources. In this context, the government
recently has made fully operational the “Oil Committee” to monitor energy product
production as well as the revenues generated and their allocation. This committee, which
reports to the Minister of Mines and Energy and the Minister of Economy and Finance, is
responsible for monitoring: (i) the management of oil and gas flows to optimize
production and assets, as well as the government’s share of revenues; and (ii) the
production and marketing of petroleum products. The committee will prepare quarterly
reports on the physical, financial, and tax flows in the sector as a whole for the ministers
concerned and for information to the Council of Ministers. These reports will be
forwarded to World Bank and IMF staffs.
35.
The government intends to assess the performance of the energy sector and, to this
end, has taken steps to overcome earlier delays in the sectoral audits financed by the
World Bank. These audits will provide the basis for developing a strategy and action plan
to strengthen the efficiency and management of the sector and improve the transparency of
physical and financial flows. The government will also take appropriate measures to
improve transparency and government revenues. These include (a) the implementation of
the necessary steps to conform with the EITI validation framework, including the
appointment of a senior official responsible for leading EITI implementation and the
preparation and publication of a work plan, with the goal of preparing an EITI compliant
report of revenues from extractive industries in June 2008; (b) the completion by midAugust 2007 of the audits of the three energy subsectors; (c) increasing the tax component
in the structure of petroleum prices and reducing the protection for the domestic refinery
from 8 percent to 6 percent of import parity prices (IPP) (mid-June 2007) ; (d) revision of
the calculation basis for the taxation of petroleum products (based on import parity prices
(IPP)), incorporating protection for the domestic refinery of 6 percent of the IPP and a
safety margin for absorbing minor fluctuations in the IPP (October 31, 2007); (e) full
application of the automatic pricing mechanism for petroleum products (based on the IPP)
(December 31, 2007); and (f) systematic production of consistent tables on physical,
financial and tax flows.

63
36.
The government intends to take the following measures in 2007 to improve the
viability of the electricity sector: (i) regular payments to cover government consumption
throughout the country; (ii) the control of consumption and reduction of waste on the part
of government; (iii) reduction in the technical, nontechnical, and financial losses of the
electricity company (Compagnie Ivoirienne d’Électricité—CIE); and (iv) an increase in
domestic tariffs, by an average of 10 percent, from end-August 2007.
Coffee/cocoa sector (Box 3)
37.
Since 2001, the government has undertaken a series of reforms and studies of the
coffee/cocoa sector, aimed at improving (i) producer prices and productivity, in the face of
world market challenges; (ii) marketing arrangements; and (iii) the monitoring of the
sector by government and public and private agencies. The results of these reforms have,
however, been disappointing: the quasi-fiscal levies on the sector have not benefited
producers, as intended, nor have they significantly helped improve the competitiveness of
the sector as a whole.
38.
The government has therefore decided to revisit the functioning of existing
agencies, including their roles in the collection of quasi-fiscal levies. It intends to prepare,
before end-March 2008, a new comprehensive strategy for the sector, with the help of
external partners and based on existing studies and audits. Pending the preparation of such
a strategy, the government has already taken, or plans to take, a number of measures that
will have an immediate favorable impact on transparency and good governance in the
sector, particularly in the management of quasi-fiscal levies. The bulk of these levies will
continue to be supervised by the “Coffee/Cocoa Committee.” This committee will
continue to examine the collection and use of levies for the FDPCC-Investment Fund and
the Prudential Reserve (CFAF 10.55 per kilogram and CFAF 5 per kilogram, respectively)
and to approve programs and projects proposed by the sector’s agencies for joint approval
by the Minister of Economy and Finance and the Minister of Agriculture. Moreover, the
role of the Committee has been expanded to include supervision of the use of quasi-fiscal
levies to the Rural Investment Fund (CFAF 12.5 per kg)—held in a special account at the
BCEAO—and for the cocoa bags (sacherie). The Committee will provide quarterly reports
to the ministers concerned and for information to the Council of Ministers. Furthermore,
the government intends to reduce the quasi-fiscal levies by CFAF 2.65 per kilogram for
the 2007/8 crop season in order to benefit producers. With regard to the quasi-fiscal levies
collected in the sector during 2000-05, the government intends by mid-2008 to conduct a
retrospective analysis of the amounts collected and the usage thereof by the ARCC and the
BCC, and by the FRC and the FDPCC (including investments). The results of the analysis
will be taken into account in formulating the overall strategy for the sector.

64
Trade and other reforms
39.
The government is committed to ensuring that Côte d’Ivoire reaps the benefits of
globalization and trade integration. The forthcoming widening of the WAEMU common
external tariff (CET) to the ECOWAS and the Economic Partnership Agreement with the
EU, planned for end-2007, should help stimulate competition, productivity, and
investment. In addition, these agreements will have an impact on tax revenue, poverty, and
foreign trade. To better understand this impact and address its implications, the
government intends to seek technical assistance from the World Bank and IMF.
40.
The government recognizes the need for a strategy to strengthen the efficiency of
the cotton sector, which is the main source of income of about 280,000 farms representing
over 2 million people. The decline in world prices and the disruption caused by the crisis
have led to a sharp decline in output and in the financial viability of the sector. To help
cushion the pressure on producer incomes, in the 2001/02-2004/05 crop years the
government provided a producer subsidy that was to be prepaid by the ginners and
reimbursed to them by the government. However, the government accumulated large
arrears to the ginners, which in turn led to arrears in ginners’ payments to producers. To
resolve this situation, beginning in 2006, the government has been clearing all these
arrears (about CFAF 14 billion) and intends to complete this operation in 2007 with
support from the European Union. In addition, as the subsidy was stopped for the 2005/06
season, by end-July 2007 the government intends to adopt an action plan for the recovery
of the sector. By end-2007, it intends to seek additional support for this reform from the
European Union and the World Bank.
Social sector and PRSP process
41.
Social conditions and poverty have worsened in recent years; Côte d’Ivoire’s
ranking on the United Nations Human Development Index dropped to 163 out of 177
countries in 2004. The incidence of poverty is estimated to have increased from 33.6
percent in 1998 to 38.4 percent in 2002. Estimates made by the World Bank indicate that
the poverty rate was 42.6 percent in 2006. The health and education services have
deteriorated significantly, in particular, in the central, northern and western (CNW) zones
of the country. The government is determined to reverse this trend by redeploying public
services throughout the country and by the progressive rehabilitation of education, health,
and village water supply infrastructures.
42.
For the health and education sectors, the government intends to address the most
pressing needs first, while preparing a longer-term strategy for improving social services.
In the health sector, a recent mission to assess requirements in the CNW zones identified
and quantified urgent needs, which we have begun to remedy. In particular, 1,300 new
doctors and other senior health officials are now being deployed and new nurses are being
trained in response to these urgent needs. For the medium term, we have prepared a

65
National Health Development Plan which we plan to submit to donors at end-2007. In the
medium term the government intends significantly to increase the health sector’s share in
total primary expenditure above its current level of 5.4 percent of GDP. In the education
sector, based on a recent diagnosis of needs in the CNW zones, the government is
implementing measures to ensure that the 2007/08 academic year begins normally for the
majority of children. This requires the redeployment of some 9,100 teachers and the
minimum rehabilitation of schools over the next three months. For the medium term, the
government is updating the “Ivoirien School Restoration Plan 2006-08,” and will present it
to donors by end-2007.
43.
The government intends to prepare its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP),
which should be completed by no later than the third quarter of 2008. The preparation of
the PRSP—which aims at achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)—will
be under the supervision of the reactivated PRSP supervisory committee (“PRSP
Committee”) and will be based on the National Development Strategy and regional and
national consultations. The preparation process will include: (a) an assessment of progress
made between 2003 and 2006 under the March 2002 Interim-PRSP; (b) a survey of
poverty and vulnerable groups; (c) a diagnostic study of poverty and the sources of
growth; and (d) the preparation of a medium-term expenditure framework and resultsmonitoring systems. In the event that the government requests a program supported by the
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) before the PRSP has been finalized, the
request will include a PRSP implementation status report.
Program financing and external debt
44.
Despite efforts to increase the primary basic surplus, a financing gap of around
CFAF 200 billion (2 percent of GDP) remains in 2007. This gap reflects, among other
things, the resumption of external debt service payments to multilateral institutions, and
arrears clearance and debt service payments to the World Bank (equivalent to
CFAF 261 billion). In agreement with these institutions, the government has adopted plans
to progressively clear its arrears to the World Bank and the AfDB. This is intended to open
the way to a resumption of financial assistance from the two institutions. With respect to
the World Bank, the government will pay current debt service due from July 2007, and
contribute at least one-third of the amount needed to clear total outstanding arrears in line
with the agreement with the World Bank expected to be finalized by mid-July 2007. For
this purpose, the government has, by end-June 2007, set aside funds for clearance of these
arrears and for current debt service in a special account at the BCEAO in the amount of
CFAF 20 billion. By end-September 2007, it will set aside an additional CFAF 33 billion
in this account, with the total corresponding to one-half of the minimum payments
anticipated. The remaining arrears would be cleared by an exceptional operation by the
World Bank’s International Development Association (IDA), for post-conflict countries.
The approval of this assistance is expected early in the second half of 2007. The total
amount of arrears payments by the government in 2007 would be subject to revision in

66
light of the World Bank’s contribution to arrears clearance. A corresponding adjustment
will be applied to the domestic financing of the program in 2007.
45.
For the AfDB, the government plans to begin payment, no later than September
2007, of a portion of its current debt service payments due since May 2007, and, in April
2008, to settle one-third of arrears outstanding at end-April 2007, with the remainder to be
paid through contributions from donors and the AfDB Facility for post-conflict countries.
More generally, the government will develop a strategy for settling its arrears to all of its
external creditors, with implementation in 2008. To cover any residual financing gap
in 2007, after taking into account financial assistance from external partners (including the
IMF under its EPCA policy and the World Bank post-conflict assistance grant), the
government intends to issue government securities on the WAEMU financial market and
use other forms of domestic financing.
Capacity-building, technical assistance, and statistical issues
46.
Owing to the crisis, Côte d'Ivoire will need to strengthen its administrative
capacities in a number of areas. In this context, we will seek assistance from the IMF in
2007 for: (i) strengthening tax administration and reviewing tax exemptions; (ii)
improving debt management; (iii) anti-money laundering and combating the financing of
terrorism; and (iv) strengthening the national accounts system. With support from the
World Bank and other donors, the authorities intend to develop a comprehensive plan to
strengthen public financial management.
IV. PROGRAM MONITORING
47.
Performance under the 2007 program will be monitored through prior actions,
quarterly quantitative indicators, and structural indicators (Tables 1 and 2). The definition
of these indicators, the adjusters for any excess budgetary support and oil revenues, and
the data reporting requirements are defined in the Technical Memorandum of
Understanding (TMU).
48.
To ensure the effective and timely implementation of our economic program, the
government has established or recently strengthened several interministerial committees.
Implementation of the program for 2007 is under the overall supervision of the “Technical
Steering Committee for the Post-Conflict Program,” which will also coordinate the work
of the specialized interministerial committees in close consultation with the Office of the
Prime Minister: the “Oil Committee,” “Coffee/Cocoa Committee,” “PRSP Committee,”
“Interministerial Primary Commodities Committee,” and “TOFE Committee.” The
existing interministerial committee (“Steering Committee for Economic and Structural
Reforms) and its executive secretariat, under the auspices of the Prime Minister’s office,
will be reactivated in anticipation of the future program supported by the Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF).

67
49.
Throughout the program, the government undertakes to refrain from external
borrowing on non-concessional terms other than specified in the TMU (Table 1). It further
undertakes not to introduce or intensify restrictions on payments and transfers for current
international transactions, introduce multiple currency practices, conclude any bilateral
payments agreements that are inconsistent with Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of
Agreement, or impose or intensify any import restrictions for balance of payments
purposes. Moreover, the authorities, in consultation with IMF staff, undertake to adopt any
new financial or structural measures that may be necessary for the success of the program.

Appendix I. Attachment II. Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU)
1.
This technical memorandum of understanding describes the set of prior actions and
quantitative and structural indicators agreed between the government of Côte d’Ivoire and
the staff of the IMF to monitor the program supported by Emergency Post-Conflict
Assistance (EPCA). It also specifies the periodicity and deadlines for transmission of data to
the staff of the IMF for program monitoring purposes. Unless otherwise specified below, the
government is defined as the central government of Côte d’Ivoire, including the National
Social Security Fund (Caisse Nationale de Prévoyance Sociale, CNPS) and the Civil Service
Pension Fund (Caisse Générale de Retraite des Agents de l’Etat, CGRAE), and Treasury
operations for public companies in liquidation, and does not include any local government,
the central bank (BCEAO), or any government-owned entity with separate legal personality.
I. QUANTITATIVE INDICATORS
2.
In the program-monitoring context, quarterly quantitative indicators are set for
June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2007. They include (a) a floor on the primary
basic fiscal balance; (b) a ceiling on total outstanding external payments arrears; (c) a floor
on social expenditure (education and health); (d) a ceiling on the stock of the government’s
domestic payments arrears, as defined for program purposes; and (e) a zero ceiling on new
nonconcessional external borrowing (notwithstanding ¶14 below). The quantitative
indicators are calculated on the basis of the cumulative change from January 1, 2007 (for
cases involving end-2006 stocks) and are set out in Table 1 of the Memorandum of
Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP).
A. Basic Primary Fiscal Balance
3.
The primary basic fiscal balance is the difference between the government’s
revenue (excluding grants) and total expenditure plus net lending, excluding interest
payments and externally financed capital expenditure. It includes expenditure related to
exiting the crisis, defined as domestically and donor-financed government outlays on the
disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) and community rehabilitation
program; the redeployment of government; the identification process; and the elections. The
revenue (CFAF 79.3 billion in 2007) and expenditure (CFAF 49.3 billion in 2007) associated
with the toxic waste problem are excluded. This balance also includes expenditure recorded
on the “contingency expenditure” line, reserved for reunification expenses (in particular for
redeployment).
4.
The quarterly floor on the primary basic fiscal balance will be adjusted downward by
the amount of donor-financed spending relating to exiting the crisis that exceeds the
program projections (MEFP, Table 1).

74
5.
The quarterly floor on the primary basic balance will be adjusted downward by the
amount of external budgetary support received in excess of the programmed amount to offset
any revenue shortfall or any excess domestically financed social, reunification-related, or
crisis-exit spending,8 up to a cumulative maximum of CFAF 50 billion. The remainder of the
excess budgetary support (not spent) will be used to reduce the government’s domestic debt,
including payments arrears (see ¶12).
6.
Part or all of the excess revenues from petroleum/gas extraction (including dividends
paid by PETROCI to the government) above the programmed amount will be used to offset
the revenue shortfall or allocated to social or reunification spending up to a maximum
cumulative amount of CFAF 50 billion. The floor on the primary basic fiscal balance will be
adjusted upward by the remaining excess not used for social or reunification expenditure.
The remainder of the excess oil revenues will be used to reduce the government’s domestic
debt, including payment arrears (see ¶12).
7.
The oil revenues forecast for 2007 is based on: an average price (including discount)
of US$57.4 per barrel; a volume of 17.4 million barrels; and an average exchange rate of
CFAF 488.5 = US$1.
B. Government Revenue
8.
Total government revenue is defined as tax revenue collected by the Tax
Administration (Direction générale des impôts, DGI), the Treasury (Trésor), and the
Customs Administration (Direction générale des douanes, DGD); revenue collected by the
CNPS and the CGRAE; and other nontax revenue as defined in the fiscal reporting table
(Tableau des opérations financières de l’Etat, TOFE).
C. Government Wage Bill
9.
The government wage bill is defined as all expenditures (on a commitment basis) on
pay, bonuses, and allowances paid to government employees, military personnel, and other
law and order personnel, and includes expenditures on special contracts and other temporary
or permanent government jobs.
D. External Payment Arrears
10.
External payment arrears are defined as the sum of external payments due but unpaid
on outstanding external debt that has been contracted or guaranteed by the government,
excluding those due payments subject to rescheduling or restructuring. The accumulation of
8

As defined in Table 1 to the TMU, based on the budget classification used in the public finance management
system (SIGFiP).

75
external payment arrears is the difference between (a) the gross amount of maturities due on
external debt service (principal and interest), and (b) the amount actually paid during the
period under consideration.
11.
Under the agreement with the World Bank, it is planned to clear the external arrears
of Côte d’Ivoire with the World Bank in the second half of 2007 and first quarter of 2008. At
the same time, it is planned that Côte d’Ivoire will maintain its debt service obligations vis-àvis the World Bank up to date beginning in July 2007. The basic assumption adopted is that
half of the arrears will be cleared using the domestic resources of Côte d’Ivoire, with the
balance being paid by a contribution from the World Bank. An amount of CFAF 53 billion
will be put in an escrow account at the BCEAO according to the following timetable:
CFAF 20 billion at end-June 2007 and CFAF 33 billion at end-September. This amount
corresponds to half the payments planned for clearing arrears and current debt service by the
government in 2007. In the event that the IDA allocation for clearing arrears differs from that
in the basic assumption, the contribution of Côte d’Ivoire will be revised. If the clearance of
arrears to be carried out by Côte d’Ivoire is greater/less than the basic assumption, the
amount of net domestic financing will be increased/reduced by a corresponding amount.
E. Domestic Payment Arrears
12.
Domestic payment arrears represent government overdue obligations and are defined
as committed (engagées et liquidées) and validated (visées par le contrôleur financier)
expenditures but not paid. They include bills due and not paid to public and private
enterprises, but exclude domestic debt service (principal and interest). CFAF 50 billion is
deducted from the stock of domestic payment arrears defined above to take into account the
time frame for payment stipulated by the administrative regulations in force (90 days).
Changes in the government's domestic payment arrears during a period correspond to the
difference between new overdue obligations of the government and the payments made on
old overdue obligations. By way of illustration, domestic payments arrears totaled
CFAF 354.5 billion at end-December 2006 and comprised:
Treasury’s unpaid payment orders
Treasury debt (PGT, TPA, TGE, ACDP)
Arrears on EPN subsidies (excluding CNPS, CGRAE)
Arrears to General Councils and Municipalities
Adjustment for orders validated by Financial Comptroller (PEC comptable)
Arrears to CI-Telecom, CIE, SODECI on current consumption

13.
Within the framework of the program, the government will undertake a net reduction
of CFAF 50 billion in the stock of domestic payment arrears (MEFP, Table 1). The government also undertakes, in coordination with the private sector, to: (i) prepare an inventory of
the end-2006 stock of residual domestic arrears to suppliers; and (ii) adopt a plan to clear
these arrears. Any excess budgetary support above the programmed amount not used to
finance a downward adjustment in the government’s primary basic fiscal balance as specified
in ¶5 above will be used to reduce the domestic debt, including payment arrears. Any excess
oil/gas revenues above the programmed amount not used as specified in ¶6 will also be used
to reduce the government’s domestic debt, including payment arrears.
F. New Nonconcessional External Borrowing
14.
The term “debt” has the meaning set forth in point No. 9 of the Fund’s Guidelines on
Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt.9 The quantitative indicators on
contracting or guaranteeing nonconcessional external debt with an original maturity of one
year or more apply not only to debt as defined above, but also to commitments contracted or
guaranteed for which value has not been received. These quantitative indicators do not apply
to rescheduling arrangements, BOAD loans up to the equivalent of US$30 million, drawings
on the Fund, normal import-related commercial credits, or borrowing on the WAEMU
financial market.
15.
A loan is concessional if its grant element is at least 35 percent, the net present value
(NPV) of the loan being calculated using a discount rate based on the average of the OECD's
Commercial Interest Reference Rates (CIRRs) over the last ten years for loans with a
maturity of at least 15 years; for loans with a maturity of less than 15 years, the NPV is based
on the average CIRRs of the preceding six-month period (February 15 to August 14 or
August 15 to February 14). To both the ten-year and six-month averages, the same margins
for differing repayment periods would be added (0.75 percentage point for repayment periods
of less than 15 years, 1 percentage point for 15 to 19 years, 1.15 percentage points for 20 to
29 years, and 1.25 percentage points for 30 years or more).
16.
Within the framework of the program, the government undertakes not to contract or
guarantee nonconcessional external loans under the conditions defined in ¶14-15, with the
exception of loans constituting rescheduling of maturities.
II. MEMORANDUM ITEM: NET BANK CREDIT TO GOVERNMENT
17.
Net bank credit to government is defined as the difference between government debts
and government claims vis-à-vis the central bank and commercial banks. The coverage of net
9

See “Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to External Debt in Fund Arrangements,” Executive
Board Decision No. 6230-(79/140), as amended by Executive Board Decisions No. 11096-(95/100) and
No. 12274-(00/85).

77
bank credit to government is that used by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO),
and is the same as that shown in the net government position (NGP). Except as otherwise
stated, government is defined as the central government of Côte d’Ivoire and does not
include local governments, the central bank, or any other public body with separate legal
personality. By way of illustration, this stock totaled CFAF 345.3 billion at December 31,
2006, broken down as follows:

III. STRUCTURAL INDICATORS AND PRIOR ACTIONS
18.
The program consists of three segments for purposes of the structural indicators and
prior actions set out in Table 2 of the MEFP: (a) public expenditure management; (b)
transparency and governance in the energy/petroleum sector; and (c) transparency and
governance in the cocoa sector.
IV. PROGRAM MONITORING AND DATA REPORTING
19.
Monitoring of the quantitative and structural indicators will be the subject of
a monthly evaluation report, prepared by the authorities within one month of the end of each
month, which will assist with assessing performance in terms of the program’s quantitative
and structural objectives.
20.
The authorities will report to Fund staff immediately if they sign or guarantee any
new foreign borrowing contracts, as well as the terms of such contracts.

78
21.
Based on existing data already reported to the IMF staff, the authorities will, in
cooperation with Fund staff, prepare a set of consistent tables on the budget and the energy
sector and coffee/cocoa sector and send them monthly or quarterly to the IMF starting on
June 15, 2007:
a. Budget (see MEFP, Box 1):
- a quarterly report (within one month following the end of each quarter) providing a
statement of budget execution (revenue and expenditure), with expenditure classified by
type, function, and administration/type, at the various stages of the expenditure process
(allocation, commitment, payment order, and settlement).
b. Energy sector (see MEFP, Box 2):
-

monthly tables showing oil and gas production by field, sharing conditions,
valuations prior to and after the swap, the swap rate, tax and nontax revenues for
the government, and revenues for P

-

monthly tables showing: (i) purchases of crude oil by the refining sector, by
supplier, including Ivoirien suppliers; (ii) production, consumption, and imports
of petroleum products, including butane; and (iii) calculation of prices of
petroleum products, including domestic and imported butane;

-

monthly tables showing: (i) purchases of gas by the electricity sector, by supplier;
(ii) production of electricity in Côte d'Ivoire; and (iii) applicable prices, electricity
sector revenues, unpaid invoices, and cross arrears.

c. Coffee/cocoa sector (see MEFP, Box 3):
-

quarterly information (within 45 days) on the collection and use of quasi-fiscal
levies and the bank account balances for FDPCC-Investment and FRC-Prudential
Reserve, as well as for the Rural Investment Fund.

-

half-yearly information on (i) the collection of quasi-fiscal levies; and (ii) halfyearly budget execution statements on the operations of the ARCC, FRC, BCC,
and FDPCC.

22.
The BCEAO will each month report the provisional data on the net government
position to Fund staff within 30 days of the end of the period under review and will provide
the final data within 45 days of the end of the period in question. The information provided
will include the complete, itemized listing of public sector liabilities and assets vis-à-vis: (i)
the BCEAO; (ii) the banking sector; and (iii) the BNI. This shall include:

79
•

statements of the “escrow accounts” to be used for paying debt service/arrears to the
World Bank;

•

the balance of revenue relating to toxic waste;

•

detailed information on all accounts relating to the issuance and payment of interest and
principal on the domestic debt;

•

the statements of the Rural Investment Funds; and

•

the balance of revenue from the cocoa bags (sacherie).

23.
The government will report the information specified in Table 2a on a monthly basis,
within 45 days of the end of the month, unless otherwise indicated. The government will
report the information specified in Table 2b quarterly, within one month of the end of the
quarter.
24.
More generally, the government will report to the Fund staff any information needed
for effective program monitoring.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
CÔTE D’IVOIRE
Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis 2007
Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association
Approved by Thomas Krueger and Michael Hadjimichael (IMF)
and Vikram Nehru and Sudhir Shetty (IDA)

July 19, 2007
The external Low-Income Country Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) shows that Côte
d’Ivoire is in debt distress with large external arrears. The public sector DSA suggests that
Côte d’Ivoire’s public debt is currently unsustainable. Key debt indicators are projected to
fall below the country-specific indicative thresholds only after 2013.1
I. BACKGROUND
1.
Côte d’Ivoire’s public debt, including arrears, at the end of 2006 is estimated at
US$14.9 billion–84.8 percent of GDP. External public debt accounted for US$12.9 billion,
or 73.3 percent of GDP, of which US$6.2 billion was owed to Paris Club creditors,
US$2.7 billion to London Club creditors, US$2.5 billion to the World Bank, US$1.0 billion
to the AfDB Group, and US$0.2 billion to the IMF. Côte d’Ivoire’s external public debt was
stable at around 80 percent of GDP in 2002-04, and with very limited new borrowing and
some repayments mainly to the Fund, declined somewhat thereafter (Figure 1). Domestic
public debt (including arrears to suppliers) amounted to 11.5 percent of GDP at the end
of 2006. Private external debt is estimated to have been US$5.5 billion (31.1 percent of
GDP) at that time. The staff’s estimate is based on information on interest payments and
therefore subject to considerable uncertainty. Thus, total (public and private) external debt
stood at US$18.3 billion, or 104.4 percent of GDP at end-2006.
1

This is the first debt sustainability analysis prepared for Côte d’Ivoire using the debt sustainability framework
for low-income countries developed jointly by the IMF and the World Bank. The DSA, produced jointly by
Fund and Bank staffs (see “Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability
Framework for Low-Income Countries (LICs),” April 17, 2007) is based on external and public debt data from
the Ivoirien authorities, and on IMF and World Bank staff estimates. The IMF staff report on the 2007
Article IV Consultation (see this Country Report) provides additional information.

2

2.
Côte d’Ivoire is in debt distress. Since late 2002, large external arrears have been
accumulating, rising from US$0.4 billion, or 3.5 percent of GDP, in 2002 to
US$3.6 billion, 20.5 percent of GDP at end-2006. At that point, arrears to Paris Club
creditors were 12.9 percent of GDP, to London Club creditors 2.5 percent, to the AfDB
Group 2.4 percent, and to the World Bank 2.2 percent of GDP. Arrears account for a fourth
of total external public debt. Côte d’Ivoire has no arrears to the IMF. Key debt indicators and
debt distress thresholds are summarized in Table 1.

3.
Côte d’Ivoire has not yet benefited from debt relief under the enhanced HIPC
Initiative and MDRI. Because it belongs to the group of countries grandfathered for HIPC
eligibility, it could be eligible for HIPC and MDRI debt relief.2,3 With domestic revenues
exceeding 15 percent of GDP, and exports exceeding 30 percent of GDP, Côte d’Ivoire could
qualify under the “fiscal window”, and a net present value (NPV) of debt-to-revenue target of
250 percent would apply.4
4.
The last Paris Club rescheduling for Côte d’Ivoire took place in April 2002. At
the time, Paris Club creditors granted the country rescheduling on Lyon terms covering
almost US$2 billion in arrears and current maturities through end-2004. The creditors agreed
to top up the reduction rate to Cologne terms as soon as Côte d'Ivoire reached the decision
point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. Because of the outbreak of armed conflict in
September 2002, the debt relief envisaged under the agreement was only partly achieved.

2

Under the original HIPC Initiative, Côte d’Ivoire had reached the decision point in 1998, but not the
completion point. In March 2002, the IMF and IDA Boards discussed the preliminary decision point document
under the enhanced HIPC Initiative, posted on the IMF Website on March 12, 2002, but the decision point,
foreseen for late 2002, was not considered because of the crisis and interruption of the PRGF-supported
program.

3

See “Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative – Issues Related to the Sunset Clause,” posted on the
IMF Website August 16, 2006.

4

The HIPC methodology to calculate the NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio differs from the calculation in this
analysis. No direct conclusions can thus be drawn from this analysis to the HIPC debt reduction factor.

II. UNDERLYING DSA ASSUMPTIONS
5.
The medium-term macroeconomic assumptions underlying the baseline scenario
are based on durable resolution of the socio-political conflict and a steady recovery
after years of civil conflict (Box 1). Real GDP growth would gradually pick up from its
stagnation during the 2000-06 crisis and settle at around 5 percent, comparable both to
the 1994-99 pre-crisis average and the 1960-80 average. The primary balance is assumed to
steadily decline from a surplus (1 percent of GDP on average during 2007-12) to a deficit of
2 percent of GDP during 2013-27 because of increasing public expenditures for social and
investment needs. It is assumed that initial external assistance resumes in 2007 and expands
after clearance of World Bank arrears in the second half of 2007 in the context of an
economic program supported by IMF Emergency Post Conflict Assistance.5 AfDB arrears
would be cleared under its Post-Conflict Facility in 2008. For this LIC-DSA, it is assumed
that all other arrears, including to Paris Club and commercial creditors, would be rescheduled
on non-concessional terms (zero average grant element).6 Any arrears clearance would
require a comprehensive economic reform program that would, inter alia, address the
country’s presently limited capacity to repay its creditors. The DSA does not take into
account contingent liabilities due to data limitations. With a CPIA average rating of 2.56
for 2004-2006, the indicative debt burden thresholds for “weak policy” apply to Côte
d’Ivoire.
6.
The previous external DSA for Côte d’Ivoire assumed lower GDP growth, but
much more favorable current account balances. Real GDP growth was projected to
average 4.0 percent for the first five recovery years and 4.5 percent for the rest of the period;
the new estimates are 4.3 and 5.2 percent. The upward revision of the growth scenario largely
reflects the improved political outlook, substantially increased oil and gas production, and
expected structural reforms in the cocoa, coffee, cotton, energy and financial sectors. The old
DSA projected export growth in US dollar terms at 7.1 percent throughout the projection
period, compared to 4.7 percent for 2007-12 and 6.7 percent for 2013-2027 in the new DSA.
The old DSA assumed non-interest current account surpluses whereas this DSA projects an
average deficit of 2½ percent of GDP for 2013-2027. This DSA also assumes a lower grant
element for new borrowing. The higher oil production in this DSA also adds some 1 percent
of GDP to government revenue compared to the old DSA. Despite somewhat stronger growth
in GDP, with heavier debt accumulation the debt dynamics of the current DSA lead to debt
indicators that are above those of the previous DSA.
5

Under an understanding between the World Bank and the Ivoirien authorities, the government of Côte d’Ivoire
has agreed to complete its arrears clearance to the World Bank by the first quarter of 2008. The authorities’
economic program, to be supported by IMF EPCA, foresees achieving that already in 2007.

6

For the share of this debt that is not multilateral or official bilateral, but on commercial terms, a grace period
of 5 years and a maturity of 10 years is assumed.

Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions for the Baseline Scenario
Real GDP growth: After 1.7 percent real GDP growth in 2007, a sustained recovery is projected to start
in 2008 with growth of 3.5 percent, progressively accelerating to peak at 6.5 percent in 2012. The
average growth rate in 2013- 2027 is 5 percent, close to the pre-crisis average of 5 percent as well as the
growth achieved during 1960–80. In this scenario, the growth during the recovery phase through 2012
would come from renewed confidence and enhanced security; a return to full capacity utilization in
transport and industry; and new investments, especially in communication and energy. Longer-term
growth would be sustained by investment, helped by structural reforms in the energy, cocoa, coffee and
cotton sectors.
Inflation: Inflation is projected at about 3 percent for the entire projection period.
Real exchange rate and terms of trade: The real effective exchange rate is projected to stay broadly
constant throughout the projection period. The terms of trade are projected to worsen in 2007, to
improve through 2010, and to remain broadly constant thereafter.
Current account balance: The current account balance (including official transfers) is projected to
decline steadily from a surplus of 2 percent of GDP in 2007 to a deficit of 3 percent in 2013 and to stay
at about this level until 2027. This would reflect strong import growth (especially for investment),
outpacing exports. As oil exports start declining after 2010, nonoil exports (in US dollar terms) are
assumed to pick up gradually during 2007-12 and grow steadily at 7 percent a year thereafter, compared
with 8 percent during 1994-2006.
Government balance: The primary balance (total revenue and grants less non-interest expenditure) is
projected to stay in surplus (averaging 1 percent of GDP) in 2007-12 and to turn to a deficit (averaging
2 percent of GDP) in 2013-27. The declining trend reflects, in terms of GDP, constant overall revenue,
but rising non-oil revenue and gradually increasing public expenditures, in line with increasing
borrowing capacity.
External assistance, scaling up and concessionality: The baseline scenario assumes that grants
(mainly for projects) will remain close to their current level of just over 1 percent of GDP. Project loans
are assumed to grow gradually from ½ percent of GDP in 2007 to 2 percent from 2012. The residual
external financing need, which fluctuates as a function of fiscal operations, is assumed to be covered
mainly by multilateral creditors (average grant element 47 percent) and the remainder by bilaterals
(average grant element 35 percent), and commercial creditors (nonconcessional). During the projection
period, financing would gradually shift to less concessional sources, leading to a gradual decline in the
average grant element.
Domestic borrowing is assumed to be supporting the government’s spending needs, with domestic
public debt (excluding arrears) gradually declining from 6½ percent of GDP in 2007 to 4 percent
in 2027. Arrears to domestic suppliers are projected to decline from 4 percent of GDP in 2006 to
zero percent from 2015.
Real interest rates: The average real interest rate on domestic debt is estimated at 0.4 percent in 2007,
rising to about 3 percent in 2015 and staying there until 2027.

6
III. EXTERNAL DSA
A. Baseline
7.
In the baseline scenario, all NPV indicators are above the country-specific
indicative thresholds for “weak policies” in 2007 and decline gradually over time. The
NPV of public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt-to-GDP ratio starts out at 59 percent
in 2007, about double the country-specific indicative threshold and declines gradually to
33 percent in 2027. Given Côte d’Ivoire’s solid export base, the NPV of PPG debt-to-exports
ratio, is only slightly above the threshold in 2007, but remains above it through 2027. The
NPV of PPG debt-to-revenue ratio, at over 300 percent in 2007, drops below the 200 percent
threshold in 2015 (Tables 2 and 3, and Figure 2). For all ratios the downward trend is due to
relatively prudent new external borrowing on concessional terms.
8.
In the baseline scenario, the debt service indicators are never significantly above
the thresholds. Figure 2 shows a characteristic hump-shape for the debt service-to-exports
and the debt service-to-revenue ratios because the grace period assumed for the commercial
debt share contracted under the arrears clearance operation in 2008 would end in 2013 and
the 10-year maturity would be reached in 2018. For the same reason, the upward trend in the
rate of (net) debt accumulation is dampened between 2013 and 2017.7
B. Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
9.
The alternative scenarios and stress tests bear particular weight in assessing
risks to Côte d’Ivoire’s debt situation given the fragility of the peace process. The standard
alternative scenarios and stress tests in both the external and public DSA templates capture
well the key vulnerabilities, but some modifications were necessary to account for the civil
conflict.
10.
For all NPV indicators, the historical scenario leads to much less favorable debt
dynamics than the baseline. The historical scenario (A1 in Table 3) has been modified by
taking the 1997-2001 averages (rather than the standard 1997-2006 averages) for all relevant
variables in order to exclude the past five years of civil strife. With this modification, it
assumes, inter alia, constant real GDP growth of 1.5 percent and a constant noninterest
current account surplus of 2.4 percent of GDP from 2008 on. For all NPV indicators the
historical scenario reverses the downward trend of the baseline, with all indicators above the
respective thresholds.
11.
Both debt service indicators are higher in the historical scenario than in the
baseline. In the historical scenario, the indicators exceed country-specific thresholds
7

See ¶5 and footnote 6.

7
from 2013 for the debt service-to-exports ratio and 2009 for the debt service-to-revenue ratio,
reflecting a much higher debt stock in this scenario.
12.
Assuming new public sector loans at less favorable terms worsens the debt
scenario considerably, emphasizing the critical need for a prudent borrowing strategy.
With an interest rate 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline (A2 in Table 3), the
ratios of the NPV of debt to GDP, exports and revenue would be about 50 percent above their
baseline levels toward the end of the projection period.
13.
The stress tests do not reverse the baseline trends but increase all debt indicators
significantly. The most extreme shocks for the NPV of debt-to-GDP, the NPV of debt-torevenue and the debt service-to-revenue ratios consist of a combination of shocks (test B5 in
Table 3). For the NPV of debt- and debt service-to-exports ratios, the most extreme shock is
export value growth one standard deviation lower than the historical average in 2008
and 2009 (test B2 in Table 3). For all indicators, the curves in Figure 2 shift up relative to the
baseline almost in parallel, with the NPV indicators converging only slowly back to the
baseline, while the debt service indicators do not converge.
IV. PUBLIC DSA
A. Baseline
14.
The indicators for the NPV of total public debt are high but decline gradually in
the baseline scenario. The NPV of debt-to-GDP and NPV of debt-to-revenue ratios drop
faster at the beginning of the projection period than toward the end, reflecting primary
surpluses in the early years. But also in the later years, the primary deficits remain below the
debt-stabilizing primary deficit, thus gradually reducing debt (Tables 4 and 5, Figure 3).
15.
The debt service-to-revenue ratio trends downward only slowly. Starting out at
27 percent in 2007, it reaches 19 percent in 2027. In between, Figure 3 displays the same
hump-shaped profile discussed for the external DSA (see ¶8).
B. Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests
16.
An alternative “no policy reform” scenario reflects a continued forced restraint
on spending as during the crisis and leads to a gradual repayment of public debt. The
“no policy reform” scenario (A2 in Table 5) has been modified compared to the template in
that the primary balance is unchanged from 2006 rather than from 2007 because the primary
balance in 2007 already reflects an ambitious reform effort under the envisaged IMF EPCAsupported program. Thus, the “no policy reform” scenario assumes a constant zero primary
balance, which characterized the crisis years with almost no new net financing. Also, this
scenario assumes real GDP growth to remain at its 2006 level of 0.9 percent so as to match a
crisis primary balance with a crisis growth rate. In this scenario, all indicators are initially

8
above the baseline, but fall below it after 2016, with the NPV indicators reaching zero
before 2027.
17.
In the scenario with permanently lower GDP growth, the debt ratios remain
broadly unchanged and thus are increasingly above the baseline. Scenario A3 in Table 5
implies that the 2008-2027 average real GDP growth rate drops to 4.5 percent from 5 percent
in the baseline . The elimination of the baseline’s downward trend in debt ratios because of
lower GDP growth underscores the importance of structural reforms leading to the return of
private sector confidence and an improved business climate that are needed for a robust
economic recovery.
18.
The most extreme stress tests reverse the trends observed in the baseline
scenario; the majority of the remaining stress tests slow down the improvement in debt
indicators. The most extreme stress test for all indicators consists of real GDP growth at the
historical average minus one standard deviation in 2008-09, replacing the baseline growth
rates of 3.5 in 2008 and 4.9 percent in 2009 by -1.9 percent each. Such a shock would send
the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio upward; it would reach 95 percent in 2027, compared to
37 percent in the baseline scenario. A similar picture emerges for the NPV of debt-to-revenue
and debt service-to-revenue ratios. These results underscore the sensitivity of the debt
dynamics to the growth assumptions.
V. DEBT DISTRESS QUALIFICATION AND CONCLUSIONS
19.
In the staffs’ view, Côte d’Ivoire is in debt distress. As in the previous DSA, the
external NPV of debt ratios, although declining, are well above country-specific indicative
thresholds for most of 2007-2015. The public DSA does not change this assessment. The
alternative scenarios and bound tests indicate that the debt indicators are sensitive to shocks
that significantly prolong the period during which key ratios are above the thresholds. In
particular, the debt dynamics are vulnerable to lower real GDP growth and lower export
growth. These vulnerabilities underscore the importance of a stable socioeconomic
environment and sound policies to permit a sustained improvement in economic
performance.
20.
The staffs have discussed this DSA with the authorities. The authorities generally
agreed with the staffs’ assessment and expressed their ambition to access the enhanced HIPC
Initiative. Côte d’Ivoire’s debt management capacity and debt statistics are broadly adequate
for effective debt sustainability analysis.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline, while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Safeguards Assessments

The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is the common central bank of the
countries of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) which includes
Côte d’Ivoire. The most recent safeguards assessment of the BCEAO was completed on
November 4, 2005. The assessment found that progress has been made in strengthening the
BCEAO’s safeguards framework bank since the 2002 safeguards assessment.
The BCEAO now publishes a full set of audited financial statements and improvements have
been made to move financial reporting closer to International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS). Furthermore, an internal audit charter has been put in place, and mechanisms for
improving risk management and risk prevention have been established and follow-up on
internal and external audit recommendations has been strengthened.
1

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the
completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the
decision point. Hence these two amounts cannot be added.

2

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed during the interim
period.

4

The new assessment identified a number of areas where further steps would help solidify the
progress made. The main recommendations relate to improvements in the external audit
process (including the adoption of a formal rotation policy), further enhancement of the
transparency of the financial statements by fully adopting IFRS, and further strengthening of
the effectiveness of the internal audit function. The status report of the implementation of
recommendations, received from the bank in March 2007, indicates that some progress was
achieved.

Appendix II. Côte d’Ivoire: Relations with the World Bank Group3
(As of June 21, 2007)
1.
Prior to the September 2002 crisis, the Bank Group’s Country Assistance Strategy
sought to assist Côte d’Ivoire in reducing poverty through (i) sound macroeconomic management, including prudent debt management; (ii) increased private sector development and
investment under an efficient and transparent regulatory framework; (iii) more efficient
expenditure targeting in health, education, and basic infrastructure through innovative
delivery approaches; (iv) strengthened institutional and human capacity; (v) emphasis on
environmental sustainability; and (vi) improved governance, notably in the area of public
expenditure management.

2.
After an interruption caused by the country being in nonaccrual status the Bank
resumed its lending operations in Côte d'Ivoire following the clearance of arrears in
January 2002. An Economic Recovery Credit equivalent to US$200 million (over an
18-month period) was approved on June 11, 2002 and the first tranche of US$100 million
was disbursed. The credit aimed at: (i) creating the conditions for renewed broad-based
growth driven by rural recovery and resumed confidence in the private sector; (ii) improving
public services delivery with participation of local communities; and (iii) improving
efficiency and accountability in public resource management. Implementation of structural
reforms underpinning the ERC, however, was delayed by the intervening conflict. Moreover,
because of the lack of an adequate macroeconomic framework (the related IMF PRGF credit
was also stopped) and stalling progress on structural reforms, the ERC was closed on
December 31, 2003 (as originally envisaged), and the remaining two tranches were canceled.
Côte d’Ivoire fell again into nonaccrual status on November 2, 2004, with arrears to the Bank
estimated at end-June 2007 to total about US$480 million. World Bank arrears must be
cleared prior to any disbursements from existing projects or the provision of new financing
from the Bank, other than an exceptional pre-arrears clearance grant in support of the postconflict transition.
3.
Meanwhile, notwithstanding the suspension of disbursements and delays in
presenting new projects to the Bank’s Board due to the arrears, the Bank has been providing
limited financial support and addressing pressing needs via six Post-Conflict Fund grants
totaling about US$2 million. They include: (i) support to establishing a “National Program
for DDR” amounting to $100,000 (only half of which was spent because the then CNDDR
did not request the second tranche); (ii) “Communication to Strengthen Social Cohesion”
(US$270,000) executed by the NGO Search for Common Ground; (iii) “Community
Reintegration Pilot Project 1” (US$ 538,690) implemented by CARE International; (iv)
“Community Reintegration Pilot Project 2” (US$737,500) in partnership with CARE
International; (v) “Reintegration of children associated with the armed groups and forces”
(US$298,000) implemented by UNICEF; and (vi) a “Rapid Social Assessment” amounting to
US$160,000. Two additional LICUS grants were recently approved as part of a US$6 million
LICUS package. The first one, which the Bank executed, is for an amount of $1.9 million to

provide assistance in post-conflict planning and improving governance, including audits in
the energy sector. The second, for US$2.25 million, to be executed by the Prime Minister’s
Office, is for support of the national identification process. The third and last part of the
package will be to finance pilot initiatives in employment creation for youth at risk (US$2.25
million).
4.
During the discussions at the World Bank-IMF Spring Meetings in April 2007, the
World Bank and Ivoirien authorities discussed the issues concerning the implementation of
the Ouagadougou Accord, the Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration (DDR)
process and the Bank’s re-engagement in Côte d’Ivoire. An agreement was reached for the
government of Côte d’Ivoire to begin paying current debt service to the Bank in July, 2007
while the Bank agreed to aim to approve a pre-arrears clearance grant in support of postconflict transition (Post-Conflict Assistance Project—PCAP), pending full clearance of Bank
arrears over the next 8-9 months. The government of Côte d’Ivoire also committed to
elaborate a plan for the full clearance of arrears acceptable to the Bank. The objective of the
plan is to effect the complete payment of Bank arrears by February 2008. The plan will entail
a contribution from the government of at least one-third of total accumulated arrears at the
time of the beginning of the arrears clearance operation (end-June 2007). Within this
framework, the Bank has accelerated the preparation of the PCAP grant of US$120 million—
in support of the Ouagadougou Accord—and scheduled it for Board presentation on July 17,
2007. In addition, the Bank would request approval from the Board of Directors of an
exceptional IDA allocation to facilitate the financing of the remainder of the arrears not
financed from Côte d’Ivoire’s own resources.
5.
The World Bank arrears clearance will take place within a credible macroeconomic
fiscal framework supported by and closely coordinated with an IMF program. During a joint
Bank-IMF mission in May 2007, the Bank has left with the government an Aide-Mémoire as
a record of discussions and agreements and a basis for further dialogue and reforms in key
economic sectors (including cocoa/coffee, energy and financial sectors) that will be the
subject of a Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review
(PEMFAR) and a budget support operation, Emergency Economic Recovery Credit (EERC)
in the next fiscal year. The Bank’s dialogue with the authorities is centered on the following:
•

Finalizing of the ongoing three audits in the energy sector, launching of a new
PEMFAR, and restarting of the PRSP process,

•

In FY08—if arrears are fully cleared—the Bank would reactivate its existing four
projects (US$104 million) and finance a new HIV/AIDS US$20-40 million grant and
a project for strengthening of institutions and governance.

•

As soon as satisfactory progress is made on the DDR program and the related security
front (to guarantee safe access to conflict-affected areas), as part of the reconstruction
process, the Bank is expected to take the lead in organizing a Multi-Donor
Assessment close collaboration with the IMF, EU and other development partners (the
LICUS-financed activities will inform the MAM). The purpose of the MAM is to
identify reconstruction financing needs, new expenditure priorities, and the likely
sources of external finance.

7
•

Also, analytical work is under way with regard to a poverty diagnostic and rapid
social assessment, as well as other work on forestry, governance, infrastructure, and
regional power integration; work would resume on public expenditure management
following the full re-engagement. The ongoing LICUS package is also focused on
analytical work.

•

After an adequate macroeconomic framework is established for a reasonable period
of time, and basic measures to strengthen governance and transparency in energy,
cocoa/coffee, financial, and public expenditure management are taken, a US$120150 million—Emergency Economic Recovery credit (EERC)––could be provided in
support of structural reforms, after a track record of policy performance under the
IMF’s EPCA and full clearance of Bank arrears.

6.
The IFC’s portfolio has been showing strains from the continued economic crisis as
clients struggle in the prolonged uncertainty and economic downturn. The committed
portfolio totals US$88.9 million. With the return of stability and an end to the economic
crisis, new projects may again be selectively considered.
7.
MIGA’s outstanding portfolio in Côte d’Ivoire consists of one project, with two
contracts of guarantee, in the manufacturing sector, with a total gross and net exposure of
US$15.05 million. Currently, MIGA accepts applications for guarantees for projects in Côte
d’Ivoire, but has no project in its active pipeline for the country.

IMF-World Bank collaboration in specific areas
8.
The World Bank has worked closely with the IMF on the Ivoirien authorities’ reform
program, and shares the same views on policy issues. There is broad agreement on the core
reform program the authorities intend to pursue, namely: (i) streamlining public expenditure
management and tax policy; (ii) enhancing governance and transparency in the energy and
cocoa/coffee sectors; and (iii) reducing financial sector vulnerabilities. Broad division of
labor between the Bank and the Fund is detailed in the Table 1 below.

Appendix III. African Development Bank Group Operations Strategy
1.
Bank Group Portfolio and its Management. Out of a total of 49 operations,4
approved since the start of intervention in Côte d’Ivoire for a net commitment of UA5 1,030
million (US$1,535 million), the current project portfolio has now only four projects for a net
commitment of UA 61.5 million, excluding projects whose balances have been cancelled.
The outstanding balance of these projects is only UA 5.5 million, of which a UA 3.7 million
grant for National Good Governance and Capacity Building Programme (PNBGRC). The
remainder will be cancelled. The aim of the project (PNBGRC) is to contribute to
strengthening the rule of law, to sound public resource management, and to poverty reduction. Specifically, its purpose is to: (i) contribute to improving the operation of the legal
system; (ii) strengthen structures and institutions involved in the decentralization process;
(iii) support the public resources management capacity; and (iv) strengthen the PNBGRC
coordinating structure.
2.
Regarding portfolio management, the ongoing projects have been seriously affected
by the crisis arising from the suspension of disbursements from February 1, 2003. Following
discussions with an Ivoirien delegation in Tunis in July 2004 and July 2005, the Bank began
canceling the balances of 10 operations in accordance with the relevant Bank procedures. As
of end-February 2007, the total amount cancelled was UA 65.7 million. The Bank has not
made any further cancellations since there is hope of resumption of financial cooperation
with the country. While loan disbursements have been suspended in accordance with the
sanctions for accumulation of arrears, the Bank has continued implementing operations
financed with grants. These include the Study for formulation of the Irrigation Development
Plan, the Road Toll and Weighbridge Study Plan and the Agneby Plan Study, which have
been practically completed.
3.
Status of Arrears to the Bank Group and Payment Schedule. Côte d’Ivoire’s
arrears owed to the Bank Group stood at UA 335 million (US$463 million) at April 30, 2007,
with UA 327 million for ADB and UA 8 million for ADF loans. The private sector arrears
amounted to UA 1.52 million as at April 30, 2007. Côte d’Ivoire has no arrears on its
subscription to the Bank’s capital.

4.
Steps by the Bank to facilitate arrears clearance. Following the clearance of
arrears at end March 2002, the Board approved an interim strategy under ADF VII on
April 3, 2002. This strategy could not be carried out since arrears began building up again
from February 2003, and the Bank suspended all disbursements on loans, and no operations
were approved under ADF IX and X. However, the Bank has maintained the dialogue with
the government in order to be able to implement its strategy, as soon as it would re-engage in
Côte d’Ivoire. During various consultative missions, the Ivoirien authorities reaffirmed their
commitment to stabilize arrears and stay current on maturities. However, these commitments
have not been carried out.
5.
During the May 2006 IMF mission on Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance, in which
the Bank participated, the government undertook to (i) demonstrate its willingness to
cooperate, by repaying the Bank an amount of CFAF 10.2 billion representing partial
payment of interest due in 2006; and (ii) adopt an arrears clearance plan by September 2006,
for full implementation by July 2007 at the latest. Neither the interest payments nor the
government mission to Tunis envisaged for July 2006 to discuss an arrears clearance plan
with the Bank took place.
6.
On April 28th, 2007, the Ivoirien authorities and the Bank came to an agreement on
the modalities of an arrears clearance scheme. This scheme is included in the Memorandum
of Economic and Financial Policies elaborated by the IMF in May 2007. Within the
framework of the Post-Conflict Countries Facility (PCCF), it assumes moving the cut-off
date from end-December 2003 to end-April 2007 and effective clearance of arrears in April
2008. The servicing of the maturities falling due between May 2007 and April 2008 must
start no later than September 2007 and must be paid in full by April 2008. By this date, the
Country will also have to pay one-third of the arrears outstanding as of end-April 2007. The
remaining two-thirds will be shared between donors and the PCCF.
Strategy and Instruments for Macro-economic Dialogue and Arrears Clearance
7.
Objective and Strategy. The strategy consists in identifying and implementing a new
solution for arrears settlement that will enable the Bank to fully resume cooperation with the
country. This strategy involves: (i) continued dialogue toward meeting the criteria for
accessing the Post–Conflict Country Facility (PCCF); and (ii) institutional capacity building.
With a view to resolving the arrears problem within the framework of the PCCF, the Bank
will be taking the following actions: (i) Board submission of a Dialogue Note in October
2007, discussing the socio-economic situation in Côte d’Ivoire, as well as the way forward on
clearing arrears outstanding to the Bank Group; (ii) preparation of a Technical Assistance
and Capacity Building operation, to use the allowable 50 percent of the ADF X allocation
before year end-2007; (iii) Board presentation of the interim Country Strategy Program
(CSP); (iv) launching appraisal of new operations, starting with the post-conflict reconstruction program; and (v) a review of the portfolio with a view to resuming disbursements for
ongoing operations. In the medium-term, when the arrears problem has been fully resolved,
the Bank will submit to the Board a Country Strategy Paper that will serve as framework for
its operations.

11
Appendix IV. Statistical Issues
While broadly adequate, the macroeconomic statistics need strengthening. While the
authorities have generally provided the core statistical indicators to the Fund (see attached
table), there are weaknesses in the areas of national accounts, balance of payments, and
public finance, and the conciliation of fiscal and monetary data. Côte d’Ivoire participates in
the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since May 2000, however, the metadata
posted on the Data Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB) have not been updated since June 2001.
Real sector
The authorities have published comprehensive national accounts data for the period 1987-95,
using 1986 as the base year. They have also published a new set of national accounts for the
period 1996-2006 using 1996 as base year. GDP data reported for the IFS are now current.
The authorities have updated the national accounts to bring them in line with the 1993
System of National Accounts and changed the base year to 1996. However, GDP deflators
appear to be lacking in quality. Technical assistance (TA) in national accounts has been
provided by AFRITAC West. A harmonized consumer price index (CPI) (base 1996) was
adopted by all members of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU),6
including Côte d'Ivoire. A revision of the CPI put in place in the beginning of January 1998
is currently being implemented. There are no regular publications on wages and employment.
Public finances
The Ministry of Finance has reported data up to 2006 for publication in the Government
Finance Statistics Yearbook. The authorities do not provide monthly or quarterly fiscal data
for publication in IFS. However, the Ministry of Finance has made available to AFR detailed
monthly government finance data through March 2007. Documentation on the coverage of
general government units and public enterprises is lacking. While the government has
committed to addressing this weakness and to making a comprehensive effort to reconcile
fiscal and monetary data, there is little progress to date. Deficiencies in the recording of
expenditures undermine sound fiscal reporting.
Monetary accounts
Monetary data are prepared by the national agency of the Central Bank of West African
States (BCEAO). Some of the problems with the monetary statistics are common to all eight
member countries of the WAEMU, while others are specific to the systemic issues in Cote
d’Ivoire’s bank and non-bank financing of the operations of the central government and the
rest of the public sector. There has been improvement in the timeliness of data on monetary
institutions and deposit money banks. The authorities now report monetary data to STA on a
regular basis, with a reduction in the lag from about six months to three to four months. The
BCEAO has also improved the estimates of currency in circulation in each WAEMU
6

Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo.

12
member country by addressing the large backlog of unsorted banknotes held by the central
bank’s national agencies. In 2005, the BCEAO made substantial revisions to the estimates of
banknotes in circulation in member states resulting from cross-border banknote movement.
These revisions were due to changes in the method to estimate currency in circulation in the
WAEMU countries. The revised method, based on updated sorting coefficients (initially
established in 1990), has been applied retroactively from December 2003. The BCEAO is
using sorting coefficients to evaluate the amounts of currency issued by each country, which
in turn, are used to estimate currency in circulation and to adjust the net foreign assets of
each member country.
A monetary and financial statistics mission visited the BCEAO headquarters in Dakar in May
2001, and STA participated in a BCEAO-sponsored seminar on monetary statistics in April
2003. In these regional fora, STA reviewed with the BCEAO representatives outstanding
methodological issues that concern the member countries of the WAEMU and discussed the
BCEAO’s plans to adopt the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual.
In August 2006, as part of the authorities’ efforts to implement the methodology in the
Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual, the BCEAO reported to STA monetary data for
June 2006 for all member countries using Standardized Report Forms (1SR-central bank,
2SR-other depository corporations, and 5SR-monetary aggregates). These data were
reviewed in STA and comments were provided to the authorities. An official response is
pending.
Balance of payments
Since December 1998, the responsibility for compiling and disseminating balance of
payments statistics is formally assigned to the BCEAO by an area-wide legislation adopted
by all WAEMU members. The national agency of the BCEAO in Abidjan is responsible for
completing and disseminating the balance of payments statement, while the BCEAO
headquarters in Dakar delineate the methodology and calculate the international reserves
managed on behalf of the participating countries. Data consistency has significantly
improved over the past few years with the full transition to the Balance of Payments Manual,
Fifth edition (BPM5), improved sourcing methods, and the training of staff. This has
contributed to the reporting of balance of payments data in the framework of the BPM5 from
1996 onwards. The BCEAO national agency disseminates balance of payments statistics with
seven months lag, which is longer than the recommendation of the GDDS. The BCEAO also
compiles and disseminates the annual data of the international investment position. Data are
reported regularly to STA for inclusion in IFS and the BOPSY.
Regarding trade, the customs computer system allows satisfactory monitoring of trade data.
Further improvement of the coverage of services and transfers (especially workers’
remittances) is needed.
Concerning the financial accounts, the foreign assets of the private nonbanking sector are
inadequately covered. Reporting of private capital flows, in particular foreign direct

13
investment in Côte d’Ivoire, is unsatisfactory. Insufficient information exists on private debt
stocks and private debt service flows.
The BCEAO has implemented a compilation system allowing commercial banks to report
data on payments involving non-residents. The balance of payments compilers receive
payment statements every 10 days. However, the information is not used in the compilation
of the annual balance of payments, but is used to support data quality controls and to provide
for early information to the BCEAO authorities.

CÔTE D’IVOIRE: TABLE OF COMMON INDICATORS REQUIRED FOR SURVEILLANCE

14

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
August 3, 2007

1.
This supplement provides an update on developments since the issuance of the Staff
Report on July 20, 2007. The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged.
2.
The government remains determined to push forward the peace process despite
the end-June attempt at the Prime Minister’s life. On June 29, Prime Minister (PM) Soro
escaped unhurt a rocket attack on his plane after landing in Bouaké, the Forces Nouvelles
headquarters; four people were killed. The attack was unanimously condemned in Côte
d’Ivoire and abroad and the government called for a UN-led investigation. The President and
the Prime Minister have reaffirmed their commitment to the Ouagadougou Accord, including
presidential elections; however, the latter are unlikely to take place before mid-2008, i.e.,
well after the target date of February 2008.
3.
Implementation of the Ouagadougou Accord has continued albeit with delays.
The ceremony of the “peace flame”—a weapon-burning ceremony that had been postponed
because of the assassination attempt against PM Soro—took place in Bouaké on July 30 in
the presence of President Gbagbo, PM Soro, and six African heads of state. This milestone
should provide renewed momentum to the implementation of crisis-resolution programs. The
armed forces and ex-rebel commanders are continuing discussions on the restructuring of the
national army and the Integrated Command Center will supervise the disarmament,
demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) process. A partial regroupment of armed forces is in
effect and 21 regroupment sites are ready. The actual DDR—which will likely involve much
fewer ex-rebels than previously thought—is expected to start in early September. The
reinstallation of the préfets (administrative heads of départements) in the ex-rebel zones has
been completed and the judges for identification hearings have been appointed; the
identification hearings (for ID and electoral cards) are expected to resume in mid-August.
The redeployment of the civil service is continuing, in particular with the gradual return of
education and health workers.
4.
Growth has been broadly in line with projections in the first five months of 2007.
Preliminary data show a pick-up in activity (relative to 2006) in a range of sectors, notably
industry (+2 percent), construction (+16 percent), and trade (+15 percent), while other
activity indicators increased by at least 6 percent (import volumes, electricity consumption,
and cement use). Relative to 2006, oil production has dropped as expected due to technical
reasons, while cocoa marketing fell somewhat. Nevertheless, the trade balance, helped by
high oil and cocoa prices, remained in surplus.
5.
Fiscal developments through May 2007 were broadly in line with the program
targets. While the primary basic balance at end-May was consistent with the end-June

2
indicative target, revenue (notably from oil/gas) was below target because the government
provided gas for free to the electricity sector; this was offset by lower spending, notably for
investment. The government reduced domestic arrears to suppliers.
6.
The government has reached an agreement on arrears clearance with the World
Bank and resumed debt service to World Bank and African Development Bank (AfDB).
In mid-July, the authorities signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the World Bank
committing to pay one-half of the end-June outstanding arrears (US$472 million; 2.5 percent
of GDP) before end-February 2008, while the other half will be financed from a special IDA
allocation. Côte d’Ivoire has already paid most of debt service to World Bank and AfDB
falling due in the third quarter of 2007 (Staff Report, ¶33). It has set aside further funds for
such debt service and arrears repayment in an escrow account at the BCEAO (MEFP, ¶44).
7.
The financing of crisis-related programs in 2007 has been largely assured. The
World Bank Board approved a pre-arrears clearance grant under the Post-Conflict Assistance
Project (PCAP) on July 17. The grant (US$120 million) provides financing for the economic
reintegration of ex-combatants and youth-at-risk, related community rehabilitation projects,
and identification of the population. At a donor conference in Abidjan on July 18, donors
confirmed existing commitments, and the EU, AfDB and bilateral donors made additional
pledges estimated at some 0.1 percent of GDP for 2007, with likely further assistance as the
crisis-related programs crystallize.
8.
With the recent funding arrangements, Côte d’Ivoire should benefit from a
concerted international effort in 2007. Donor support in 2007 is projected to amount to
some of 3.2 percent of GDP (US$600 million), consisting of: expected IDA support for Bank
arrears clearance (1.2 percent of GDP), Fund EPCA (0.3 percent), committed donor support
for crisis-related programs, including under the Bank’s PCAP (0.7 percent), and identified
project financing (0.9 percent).
9.
The remaining financing need in 2007 will be covered by domestic sources. The
remaining gap under the financial program (some 0.5 percent of GDP) is being mobilized
from WAEMU/domestic sources, including a further issuance of Treasury bills.
10.
The two remaining prior actions have been implemented (MEFP, Table 2). The
authorities have provided staff with data on government financial operations; they have also
provided reports to the Council of Ministers on the physical, financial, and tax flows in the
energy subsectors.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation
with Côte d'Ivoire
On August 3, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the 2007 Article IV consultation with Côte d'Ivoire.1
Background
Côte d’Ivoire, the largest economy of the West African Economic and Monetary Union
(WAEMU), is gradually emerging from political instability and civil conflict that started in 1999.
The crisis led to the partition of the country and the disruption of public services, especially in
the former rebel-held northern zone. The crisis has taken a heavy toll on growth and social
conditions: per capita income fell by one-sixth, poverty rose, and many social indicators
worsened. These developments have also hurt regional trade and output.
In 2004-06, growth turned positive to an average rate of 1 percent a year and was helped by
favorable agricultural output and a strong rise in oil production. However, industrial output
continued to decline, while private and public investment remained one-third below their precrisis levels. Inflation has remained low. The outlook for 2007 is for a modest recovery to 1½
percent output growth, depending on progress in political normalization and the restoration of
public services throughout the country.
During 2004-06, the overall fiscal deficit remained at about 1½ percent of GDP despite the
difficult situation. Non-oil revenue was resilient and oil revenue increased. While spending
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
remained constant as share of GDP, its composition worsened with overruns on defense and
discretionary presidential spending at the detriment of social and basic infrastructural spending.
With continued low levels of donor financing, external arrears continued to accumulate, to 21
percent of GDP by end-2006.
The external current account (including official transfers) has remained in surplus, helped by
resilient cocoa production and favorable prices. The surplus widened to 3 percent of GDP in
2006 as oil exports rose sharply and imports remained sluggish in line with domestic demand.
With official financing dwindling and net private capital outflows continuing, external arrears rose
further. Gross official reserves remained at over 2½ months of imports.
On the structural side, improvements in transparency and governance were limited during the
crisis. Some measures were taken to strengthen public financial management and tax
administration, and reforms in the energy and cocoa/coffee sectors were initiated. However, the
budget was largely executed through treasury advances and accountability on financial flows in
the energy and cocoa/coffee sectors remained weak.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors welcomed the end of Côte d’Ivoire’s civil conflict and the start of its national reconciliation,
which will be key steps towards restoring a lasting peace and helping Côte d’Ivoire emerge from a
prolonged crisis. They noted that the crisis has taken a substantial economic and social toll, with
negative repercussions for the whole region. To overcome this legacy and address the daunting
challenges facing Côte d’Ivoire, Directors stressed the importance of full implementation of the
March 2007 Ouagadougou Accord. Steps to strengthen domestic consensus building as well as the
continued support of the international community will both be crucial for achieving lasting peace and
economic recovery.
Against this background, Directors called on the Ivoirien authorities to implement policies to promote
early recovery in the post-conflict period. In the near term, measures should focus on restoring
security, reunifying the country, and rehabilitating social services and basic infrastructure. Given the
tight financial constraints, improved public resource management will be key. Directors underscored
the need to create fiscal space by improving revenue collection and reducing nonessential spending.
Also essential will be early steps to improve transparency in revenue mobilization and budget
execution, including strengthened budget control, systematic publication of budget execution
statements, and regular reporting on physical and financial flows in the energy, cocoa, and coffee
sectors. Looking at the medium term, Directors stressed the importance of reviving structural
reforms to enhance private sector development and improve competitiveness.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ program for 2007, which is being supported by assistance under
the Fund’s policy on emergency assistance to post-conflict countries (EPCA). They noted that the
authorities’ program provides a sound and strong initial framework for establishing macroeconomic
stability and catalyzing donor support, while seeking to address the immediate challenges facing
Côte d’Ivoire. Directors welcomed the program’s focus on measures to promote economic recovery,
rebuild government services, and ensure transparency in public resource management. They
considered that the 2007 budget rightly envisages increased spending on social services, basic

3
infrastructure, and crisis-related programs, while reducing defense and discretionary presidential
spending. Directors underscored that all spending should be strictly monitored. They also called for
further efforts to resolve domestic arrears.
Directors considered that strengthening the financial sector will be critical for securing macroeconomic stability and higher growth. This will require improvements in financial supervision and in
the judiciary environment for loan recovery. Directors stressed the need for better compliance with
prudential norms, and welcomed the audit of the state-owned National Investment Bank.
Directors considered that reforms to improve the transparency and efficiency of the oil/gas, refinery,
and electricity sectors will support growth and boost government revenue. They looked forward to
the implementation of the recommendations of the ongoing audits of these sectors, and welcomed
the planned steps to price energy products in line with world prices and to conform to the framework
established by the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).
Directors strongly encouraged the authorities to reform the institutional structure of the cocoa,
coffee, and cotton sectors, with a view to enhancing their contribution to growth and poverty
reduction. They viewed the envisaged elaboration of a comprehensive strategy as an important
step, while stressing the need to closely monitor the use of quasi-fiscal levies and to reduce them
further.
Directors noted that Côte d’Ivoire’s real exchange rate is in line with its equilibrium level. They
underscored that sustained growth will require improvements in competitiveness and further
diversification of the economy, including stronger growth in nontraditional exports, which will be
needed to offset the projected decline in oil exports and rapid growth in the demand for imports. In
this context, Directors attached priority to the revitalization of structural reforms aimed at enhancing
productivity and reducing the costs of doing business. Directors noted that implementation of the
envisaged macroeconomic policies and structural reforms should also contribute to the external
stability of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU).
Directors observed that the Low-Income Country Debt Sustainability Analysis (LIC-DSA) shows that
Côte d’Ivoire is in debt distress. They looked forward to the authorities’ establishing the necessary
good track record—including under the EPCA—to enable Côte d’Ivoire to be considered for PRGF
assistance and debt relief under the HIPC Initiative. Directors also looked forward to the planned
preparation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper based on consultations with a wide range of
stakeholders.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

IMF Executive Board Approves US$62.2 Million in Emergency Post-Conflict
Assistance for Côte d’Ivoire
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved an amount
equivalent to SDR 40.6 million (about US$62.2 million) in Emergency Post-Conflict
Assistance for Côte d’Ivoire. The assistance supports the authorities’ program for 2007 and is
intended to help Côte d’Ivoire build the foundation for sustained recovery in an environment
of improving security, regain political stability, and reunite the country.
Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance (EPCA) is designed to promote a strengthening of
administrative and institutional capacity, which will be necessary to sustain economic
recovery and a higher level of financial assistance. The IMF’s support through EPCA is a key
part of a concerted international effort to provide financial assistance to Côte d’Ivoire.
Following the Executive Board's discussion of Côte d’Ivoire, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“The Ouagadougou Accord provides a welcome roadmap to overcome the years of conflict
that took a substantial economic and social toll in Côte d’Ivoire. Rapid implementation of
this roadmap and sound economic policies are now key for securing economic recovery in
Côte d’Ivoire, which will have positive effects throughout the region.
“To lay the basis for rapid economic recovery in the post-conflict period, the authorities have
adopted an economic program that is being supported by assistance under the Fund’s policy
on emergency assistance to post-conflict countries (EPCA). This program provides a sound
and strong initial framework for establishing macroeconomic stablilty and catalayzing donor
support, while seeking to address the immediate challenges facing Côte d’Ivoire. Short-term
measures under the program focus on restoring security, reunifying the country, and
rehabilitating social services and basic infrastructure. This will require creating sufficient
fiscal space by improving revenue collection and reducing spending in nonessential areas.

2

“The authorities should strictly enforce existing budget procedures and improve transparency
in budget execution. The intended regular publication of budget execution statements and
reporting on physical and financial flows in the energy, cocoa, and coffee sectors are
important steps.
“Structural reforms will be critical for securing higher growth over the medium term. These
will include steps to strengthen financial supervision and the judiciary environment for loan
recovery. In the energy sector, adjustment of prices in line with world prices should induce
more efficient use of these resources. The authorities also need to increase their efforts to
reform the cocoa, coffee, and cotton sectors. Productivity-enhancing structural reforms,
including sustained reductions in the costs of doing business, will improve competitiveness,
sustain growth, and help to diversify the economy.
“The authorities’ program for 2007 rightly focuses on measures to promote economic
recovery, rebuild government services, and ensure transparency in public resource
management. Higher spending on social services, basic infrastructure, and crisis-related
programs are envisaged in the 2007 budget as well as a reduction of defense and
discretionary presidential spending. Implementation of these policies should also contribute
to external stability of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU).
“The authorities are encouraged to proceed with the preparation of their Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP). Adoption of a PRSP and the establishment of the necessary good
track record—including under the EPCA—will enable Côte d’Ivoire to be considered for
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) assistance and debt relief under the Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative”, Mr. Portugal said.

Statement by Laurean W. Rutayisire, Executive Director for Côte d’Ivoire
August 3, 2007
On behalf of my Ivorian authorities, I would like to express my appreciation to Management
and staff for maintaining a constructive policy dialogue with Côte d’Ivoire over the past
years admist the challenging political crisis facing the country. The authorities are in broad
agreement with and welcome the staff appraisal of the recent economic developments as well
as the policy advice on macroeconomic and structural reforms conducive to sustained growth
and poverty reduction.
The March 2007 Ouagadougou Peace Accord resulted in a new government, paving the way
to peace and national reconciliation. The Peace Accord is centered on disarmament,
reunification of the country, identification of the population, and elections. Furthermore, by
establishing the basis for power-sharing at the highest level of the country, the Ouagadougou
Peace Accord has provided reassurances to populations all over the country, including the
main political parties, and gained support from the international community. Since the new
cabinet took office, important steps have been taken to implement the peace road map.
Notably, the following achievements have been registered:
¾ In May 2007, disarmament of the militias in the West was carried out;
¾ On May 31, the 2007 budget was approved by the Government;
¾ In June, prefects and judges were installed all over the country. These two categories
of public servants not only materialize the presence of the government and the state
institutions over the whole country, but they also are the key officials who will
conduct the reunification and identification processes prior to the scheduled 2008
elections;
¾ On July 25, international donors pledged a total of 193 billion CFA francs (about 406
million U.S. dollars) in support of Cote d'Ivoire's peace process during a roundtable
organized by the authorities;
¾ On July 30, an historic ceremony of “the flame of peace” was held in Bouaké to
announce officially the end of the civil conflict and the reunification of the country.
These achievements need to be underpinned by stepped-up actions towards rehabilitation of
social and economic infrastructure, and economic recovery.
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND CHALLENGES AHEAD
The political crisis that started in 1999 and aggravated by the now five-year long conflict has
taken a huge toll on economic performance and human development in Côte d’Ivoire. Staff
estimates cumulative output losses around 20-30 percent, owing to a declining demand and
its subsequent effects on industry, construction and trade, the most affected sectors. Per

2
capita income is estimated to have fallen 15 percent during the crisis. Social conditions have
deteriorated, along with thousands of displaced populations compounded by shortfalls in the
delivery of public services, notably health and education. Moreover, the conflict in Côte
d’Ivoire has had adverse impacts on the economy of neighboring countries and on the whole
West African Economic and Monetary Union.
In this situation of severe economic and social hardship, my authorities have done their best
to handle the country’s basic liabilities as well as unanticipated and manifold crisis-related
expenses. Furthermore, especially since discussions began with staff in 2006, the authorities
have shown strong commitment to sound macroeconomic management as well as to reforms.
As a result of their efforts, the economy showed resilience, and the relatively good fiscal
stance kept the country away from collapsing.
Recently, the economic fundamentals have begun to regain ground, ensuring overall
macroeconomic stability. After registering the most adverse effects with negative growth
rates over the 2002-03 period, the economy slightly recovered at rates of 1.5%, 1.8%, and 1%
in 2004, 2005, and 2006 respectively. Inflation remained subdued albeit upward pressures
stemming from food and housing prices. While poverty and social conditions have
deteriorated following the displacement of populations and the subsequent impact on
agricultural production, my authorities have taken various actions to minimize the impact of
these negative developments. Many social safety nets (cash transfers, food, first aid
equipments) were put in place since the start of the conflict to help rural populations escaping
from war zones.
Going forward, my authorities' initial actions will be sustained through the policy measures
set forth in their memorandum for the 2007 EPCA-supported program, which aims at
national reconciliation, sustained recovery of economic growth, improved social conditions,
and poverty reduction. These include broad measures in the fiscal, debt management,
monetary, financial and structural reform areas.
FISCAL POLICY AND DEBT MANAGEMENT
The huge pressures exerted by the conflict-related spending on public finances render the
overall macroeconomic situation fragile. My authorities are aware of the need to raise
government revenue further to support the implementation of the peace road map. The
reforms in the tax and customs administration over the past years have yielded noticeable
performance in revenue collection, unfortunately overshadowed by rising crisis generated
public spending. A number of these reforms and management systems introduced within the
customs administration have recently been commended by international customs
organizations and selected to be extended to other countries in the region.
The specific actions ahead are centered on extending tax collection to the whole country, by
broadening the tax base to at least its pre-crisis size. In addition, the introduction of a
“standardized invoice” should help cover a large share of informal activities. The authorities
have also begun to reinforce their actions against fraud and corruption by giving more

3
equipment to control officers. Especially targeted is the developing fraud on customs duties
stemming from weak control over borders due to the conflict.
On the expenditure side, commendable budget management kept overall deficit in check
amidst daunting spending pressures tied to the crisis. As for the slippages recorded in 2006,
in my authorities' view, these slippages are largely attributed to unanticipated spending
occasioned by the fleeing of rural populations to the capital city and related requests for
public assistance. In addition, the expenditures related to the dumping of toxic waste in
Abidjan in July 2006 contributed to the overrun in the primary basic spending.
For the period ahead, my authorities are determined to maintain continued grip on spending
pressures as the country makes further progress towards peace. For instance, the reunification
of the army will help reduce front-line bonuses and other current military expenditures. This
will leave room for the necessary spending related to the resumption of public service in the
CNW zones. Under the 2007 budget, my authorities are committed to achieve a primary
basic surplus of 1.0 percent of GDP. Apart from the measures stressed above, additional
revenue is expected from petroleum product taxation, and oil/gas products to help meet this
target.
As for debt management, the authorities made a priority of assisting the private sector, and
thus reduced domestic arrears to 5 % of GDP at end-2006, along with a set of measures to
strengthen the balance sheets of companies that suffered the most from collateral damages.
On the external front, an agreement was reached with multilateral creditors including the
World Bank and the African Development Bank on arrears. Following this agreement, the
World Bank recently resumed its assistance to Côte d’Ivoire. Still, the country’s external debt
is unsustainable and remains one of the urgent issues to address in the post-conflict era.
MONETARY POLICY AND FINANCIAL SECTOR ISSUES
The monetary policy under the fixed rate CFA Franc/Euro is conducted by the BCEAO, the
central bank serving the 8 countries of the WAEMU. The overall good stance of the union, as
well as the relatively favorable health of Ivorian exports has helped preserve the countries'
external position, the major threat being the appreciation of the Euro against the dollar.
Regarding the financial sector, the long stalled weaknesses have been worsened by the
conflict. Though the number of banks has increased, credit to the private sector, especially to
small new investment projects and established SMEs remain far below demand if not
inexistent. The credit generally benefits large enterprises and commodity exports activities.
My Ivorian authorities are determined to strengthen bank supervision and to carry out needed
structural reforms so as to deepen the financial sector.
STRUCTURAL REFORMS AND GOVERNANCE ISSUES
Despite an unfavorable environment, my authorities have made important progress in
structural reforms regarding mainly the cocoa/coffee and oil sectors. The government has

4
created committees of senior officials to monitor closely the quasi-fiscal levies in the
cocoa/coffee sector and financial flows in the oil sector.
The cocoa/coffee committee assesses programs and projects proposed by the sector’s
agencies, and that are implemented in production zones at the benefit of farmers. This
mechanism has helped improve the governance in the sector as well as the services – roads,
and other basic needs - to the producers. Yet, more needs to be done and the authorities intent
to conduct a thorough assessment of the liberalization aiming at reorganizing the
cocoa/coffee sector, when the conflict is over and the social climate more conducive to such
reforms.
As for the oil sector, in addition to the oversight of the committee, the World Bank is
financing a number of audits that will provide the basis for a government strategy and an
action plan to improve the management of the sector. Furthermore, my authorities are taking
actions to adhere to the EITI.
Regarding the financial sector reforms, the Banque Nationale d’Investissement –BNI – has
made important steps towards unwinding its ties to the central government. It does not extend
direct money to the government anymore, thus improving its ratios.
The process of transforming Caisse d’Epargne et de Chèques Postaux into a bank is at its
final stage. Upon completion, the public treasury will no longer funnel money into this
institution. Moreover, the overall disengagement of the state from the banking sector is
proceeding.
On the general issue of governance, my authorities acknowledge the huge challenges posed
by the conflict and a number of decisions taken out of normal procedures owing to the
urgency of situations. However the authorities have insisted before staff that they have faced
challenging trade-offs over the past years between financial orthodoxy and preventing the
country from falling apart irremediably. Maintaining a relative stability of the country has
been at the cost of some isolated weaknesses that should not be taken for structural
weaknesses in governance and transparency.
CONCLUSION
My Ivorian authorities are committed to consolidate peace and pave the way for stronger and
sustained growth. In that regard, they intend to take actions to diversify the economy away
from the export of traditional commodities. A clear option of strengthening the industrial
sector will be key to creating more jobs in the modern sector and raise the employment
potential of the economy for youths.
Along with this endeavor, addressing the debt issue in a sustainable manner remains a big
concern for my authorities. That is why they view the EPCA as a transition towards further
steps that are debt relief under the enhanced HIPC initiative and the MDRI. Debt relief will
remove heavy bottlenecks and unleash considerable possibilities for Côte d’Ivoire. Before the
conflict, the country used to allocate almost half of its annual budget to repay the debt

5
service. Such a trend over decades displaced public investment and undermined the basis for
long term growth.
My authorities have achieved commendable results in maintaining an overall macroeconomic
stability amidst manifold challenges posed by a complex civil conflict. The Ouagadougou
Peace Accord has brought hope of reconciliation and reunification of the country and the
peace process is back on track. My Ivorian authorities are committed to implementing all the
axes of this accord in order to achieve a full restoration of peace, national reconciliation, and
complete economic rehabilitation. The assistance of the international community will be key
in accompanying this momentum. In view of the efforts made at both political and economic
management fronts, my authorities will appreciate the Board s support for an EPCA program.
