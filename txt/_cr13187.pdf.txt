STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
May 29, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Near-term outlook: Strong growth momentum, but significant stability risks. GDP
growth of 8 percent in 2012 is projected to continue into 2013, with inflation back above
10 percent. Ghana’s strong democratic institutions and favorable prospects for oil and gas
are attracting significant foreign direct investment (FDI). Yet, a large current account deficit,
thin external buffers, and rising public debt expose the economy to serious risks. Energy
sector problems could curtail growth, while heavy government borrowing is raising the cost
of credit to the private sector.
Economic policy agenda: Advancing middle-income status. Ghana has made great
strides in reducing poverty and has recently reached lower middle-income status. The
economy, however, still relies heavily on agriculture and natural resources, particularly for
exports, and most jobs are in the informal sector. The newly elected government has
adopted an ambitious transformation agenda, centered on economic diversification, shared
growth and job creation, and macroeconomic stability.
Macroeconomic policy mix: Need for realignment. With a near tripling of the cash deficit
relative to 2011 to almost 12 percent of GDP, fiscal policy was highly expansionary in 2012.
Monetary policy was tightened with some delay to halt a rapid currency depreciation, but
success in stabilizing the currency came at the cost of double digit real interest rates. The
immediate policy priority is to safeguard stability by rebuilding fiscal and external buffers
and reduce debt, while keeping a tight monetary policy stance. Decisive fiscal consolidation
will, in due course, allow for a reduction in interest rates. Going forward, successful
economic transformation will require a realignment of spending away from wages and
subsidies toward investment in infrastructure, while structural fiscal reforms are needed to
restore policy credibility and build institutional resilience to the political cycle.
Financial sector: Containing vulnerabilities and removing structural constraints. The
banking system has grown steadily in assets and profitability, but high interest rates are
pricing out profitable investment projects, while raising the risk of a renewed increase in
nonperforming loans. The Bank of Ghana should consider requiring banks to hold higher
minimum capital buffers against a future downturn, while addressing gaps and
inconsistencies in the banking laws, and deepening cooperation with regional counterparts
to improve the regulation and supervision of foreign banks.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK: HIGH
POTENTIAL BUT SHORT-TERM RISK
1.
Peaceful elections in December 2012 confirmed Ghana’s strong democratic credentials.
President Mahama’s National Democratic Congress was reelected in December with a small margin
in the popular vote, but a sizeable parliamentary majority. Uncertainty arises from the opposition’s
challenge of the election results in court. The government faces high expectations for transforming
Ghana’s nascent oil and gas resources into quality jobs and improved services and living conditions
for its people.
2.
Growth continued at a robust pace amid rising fiscal and external imbalances. 2012 GDP
growth of close to 8 percent was supported by expansionary fiscal policy, mirroring patterns of past
election years. Fiscal pressures came to the fore in a rising public sector wage bill and costly energy
subsides that pushed the

(BoG) tightened monetary
policy in the second quarter of the year to arrest a rapid depreciation of the cedi. The currency has
since stabilized, with recent depreciations in line with inflation differentials, but at the cost of
double-digit real interest rates. Although consumer price inflation stayed in the single digits in 2012,
this outcome was helped by low food and repressed domestic fuel prices. With rising core inflation
(excluding food and energy) and a February increase in fuel prices, inflation has moved back above
10 percent.
4.
The growth momentum continues into 2013, with inflation on the rise. While non-oil
growth is likely to decelerate, as a result of energy disruptions and high real interest rates, increased
oil production is projected to keep overall growth close to 8 percent. Survey-based inflation
expectations remain elevated at above 10 percent. The current account deficit is projected to stay
high at 12 percent of GDP, despite a moderation in import growth, reflecting a weaker outlook for
cocoa and gold exports. Staff projects a small reduction in the fiscal deficit (financing) to 10 percent
of GDP this year, about 1 percent of GDP higher than the authorities’ budget projections, mainly
reflecting a continuation of energy subsidies.

5.
Ghana’s medium-term outlook is positive, if vulnerabilities are addressed. The economy
continues to attract significant FDI, aided by the prospect of rising oil and gas production. Non-oil
growth is projected to stabilize at a still robust level of 5–6 percent. A planned reduction in the fiscal
deficit to about 6 percent of GDP is feasible by 2015, if policies are implemented as envisaged,
contributing to a gradual decline in inflation. The current path of fiscal consolidation together with
increased oil and gas production from new fields would reduce the current account deficit to a still
high level of 7½ percent of GDP by 2018.
6.
Short-term stability risks are significant (Appendix I). Deteriorating public debt dynamics
and low official reserve buffers make the economy susceptible to risks from delayed fiscal
adjustment, weaker terms of trade, and rollover risks from foreign holdings of government bonds.
Domestically, energy sector problems pose downside risks to growth and fiscal outcomes.
7.
Recommendations from the 2011 Article IV consultation remain valid today. At the time,
Executive Directors stressed the importance of stronger fiscal management and called for rigorous
implementation of the authorities’ plan to reduce the cash deficit, including the re-establishment of
cost-recovery pricing of energy products and the avoidance of domestic arrears. Other
recommendations included improvements in tax administration, payroll management, and debt
management, supported by prudent borrowing strategies. While the government implemented a
number of important measures in these areas, with impressive improvements particularly on the
revenue side, the latest fiscal developments have substantively reversed the achievements of 2011.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
ECONOMIC POLICY AGENDA: ADVANCING MIDDLEINCOME STATUS
There was full agreement that successful realization of the government’s growth agenda
will require careful prioritization and sequencing, supported by fiscal consolidation.
8.
Ghana is at a critical stage in its economic development. While having reached lower
middle-income status, the economy still relies heavily on agriculture and natural resources and most
jobs are in the informal sector. Similarly, the concentration of exports on three commodities (gold,
cocoa, and oil) makes the economy vulnerable to terms-of-trade shocks. Although poverty and
social indicators have improved significantly, about a quarter of the population still lives below the
poverty line, and demographic trends will require the creation of 6–7 million jobs in the next
20 years to absorb new entrants into the labor market. Appendix II discusses Ghana’s inclusive
growth successes and challenges in more detail. It concludes that the government will need to
leverage Ghana’s strong governance and business environment and decisively tackle current growth
constraints to diversify production toward manufacturing and higher-value agriculture. Better
infrastructure, improved access to credit, further investment in health and education, and sustained
macroeconomic stability will be central to ensure Ghana’s continued robust and inclusive growth.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GHANA

9.
The government’s transformation agenda provided the context for the discussions. It
pursues three broad objectives:
•

Economic diversification. Leveraging oil and gas resources to create a robust job-creating
manufacturing sector will require significant infrastructure investments and removal of the main
bottlenecks to growth—inadequate and unreliable energy provision and lack of affordable
private sector financing.

•

Social inclusion. To make further advancements in poverty reduction, ensure that the benefits of
growth are widely shared, and build a workforce ready to take on higher-skilled jobs, the
government wants to further strengthen Ghana’s social safety net and continue investments in
utilities, health, and education, while improving the quality of social spending.

•

Macroeconomic and debt sustainability. An updated debt sustainability analysis suggests that
Ghana’s risk of debt distress has risen, but remains moderate, provided the government
successfully implements a sizeable fiscal adjustment (see supplement).

10.
The government’s immediate priority is to restore macroeconomic stability. Fiscal
consolidation is needed to reduce existing vulnerabilities and allow for a gradual realignment in the
policy mix in support of private investment and growth. At the same time, the government
recognized that successful transformation requires administrative and institutional reforms to
promote reliable policy implementation—including resilience to the political cycle—higher efficiency
of public infrastructure investment, and deeper financial intermediation.

FISCAL POLICY: REALIGNING PRIORITIES
There was agreement that fiscal consolidation and a shift in the composition of spending
from wages and subsidies to investment are needed to support growth, reduce external
pressures, and keep debt sustainable. The mission strongly supported the government’s
plans for improving public financial management, while advocating more ambitious
fiscal consolidation than currently planned.
11.
The government’s main policy task is to reverse the large fiscal slippages of 2012. The
fiscal deficit (financing basis) rose to almost 12 percent of GDP—nearly twice the level anticipated in
the revised budget (Figure 3). The government also accumulated net arrears of 2.8 percent of GDP,
of which nearly half was to state-owned enterprises, mainly linked to the under-pricing of fuel and
utilities. A shortfall in revenue and grants added to the deficit, but the main cause for the large fiscal
deterioration was higher spending.
12.
Failure to control the public wage bill was the key driver behind the larger deficit.
Recurrent spending rose by 4¼ percentage points of GDP between 2011 and 2012, reflecting higher
interest cost, energy subsidies and, in particular, a much larger wage bill, which grew by 47 percent

in nominal terms. An 18 percent pay hike explains part of this increase, and new hiring appears to
have offset the smaller-than-expected savings from the recent payroll audit, but many of the factors
that could explain the increase have not yet been quantified. In addition, deferred wage payments
from the single spine salary reform amounted to 2½ percent of GDP, twice the level included in the
mid-year revised budget. The government has initiated a thorough examination of the payroll,
realizing that its ability to control wages in the future hinges on its understanding of the significant
overruns in 2012.
13.
The mission saw difficulties in meeting the 2013 fiscal target in the absence of
additional policy measures. The budget foresees a deficit of 9 percent of GDP on a cash basis,
assuming a 12 percent nominal increase in the wage bill and higher tax revenue, mainly as a result
of further efforts to strengthen the performance of the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA). Other
revenue measures—an audit and subsequent streamlining of VAT exemptions, an improved VAT bill
(including VAT on financial services), and a windfall profit tax on mining—are expected to become
effective only in 2014. Pressures on the expenditure side arise from the need to cover subsidies on
fuel and utilities. While the former were significantly reduced with the February price increases,
utility tariffs remain below cost-recovery levels. Without price adjustments, compensation to stateowned energy companies could exceed the budgeted amount by 1 percent of GDP by the end of
the third quarter. Incorporating these additional expenditures, a delayed impact from the envisaged
revenue measures, but also a higher nominal GDP (as a result of recent upward revisions to the 2012
data), staff projects a deficit of 10 percent of GDP this year.
14.
The authorities acknowledged the challenges, but were positive that their deficit
target could be achieved. They anticipated that the repair of the West African Gas Pipeline and
new domestic power facilities would restore stable energy supply soon, which would then allow
regular adjustments in utility tariffs. Spending control would be significantly strengthened with the
full rollout of the Ghana Integrated Financial Management Information System (GIFMIS) and
improved cash management, including closer scrutiny of monthly expenditure relative to forecasts.
In response to revenue shortfalls in the first four months of the year, the authorities announced in
late May their plans to submit new tax measures to parliament. These include the reintroduction of a
stabilization levy—a temporary additional profit tax on certain sectors, such as financial services and
mining which was in place also in 2009-11—levies on certain imports, increases in excise duties, a
review of fees and charges, and administrative measures to raise GRA collections. The estimated
combined impact is close to ½ percent of GDP for the six months starting in July, which would be
broadly sufficient to offset the revenue shortfall through April. In addition, the government plans to
undertake a major mid-term review of its policies in the summer, to assess the need for additional
measures. The mission welcomed this review, stressing the urgency of reducing vulnerabilities.

Staff deemed the government’s medium-term deficit target of 6 percent of GDP
feasible by 2015, but saw implementation risks. Factors expected to support consolidation
include: (i) the elimination of energy subsidies, deferred single spine wage payments, and past
arrears; (ii) implementation of the envisaged tax policy measures and improvements in revenue

of all nonsecurity subvented agencies to the mechanized payroll
and set up of an integrated HR management system;
(v) strengthening of cash management, with a consolidation of
government accounts; and (vi) ongoing improvements in the
integrated public investment and debt management framework.
Success, however, depends on whether politically difficult
measures—such as adjustments of energy prices to full costrecovery levels—will be implemented in a timely and durable
manner. The mission also pointed to implementation risks from
possible delays and difficulties in implementing public financial
management reforms, as has been the case in the past.

Irrespective of feasibility, the mission viewed a deficit target of 6 percent of GDP as
insufficiently ambitious. Informed by its external sustainability assessment, staff made the case for
an additional adjustment in public consumption of 3-4 percent of GDP by 2017 to reduce the large
current account deficit, while making room for increased public and private investment (Box 1). A
lower fiscal and external current account deficit would also allow the buildup of official reserves
toward the authorities’ target of more than 4 months of imports—up from 2.8 months of imports in
December 2012. This target is consistent with staff’s analysis of optimal reserves, which suggests
that a cover of 4.2 months of imports would provide a reasonable cushion against plausible shocks,
such as deteriorating terms of trade or reversals of capital inflows invested in government bonds
(Box 2).

While the above measures give some guidance of reserve
adequacy, they have been criticized to provide only imprecise
benchmarks. A conceptually superior approach is to estimate the
“optimal” level of reserves which maximizes their net benefits.
Following the method applied by Dabla-Norris et al. (2011), the net
benefits depend on the expected cost of a crisis given the stock of
reserves, a vector of fundamentals (exchange rate regime, fiscal
balance, institutions), the exposure to shocks (external demand, FDI,
aid), and the opportunity cost of holding reserves (interest differential).1
The approach implies optimal reserve holdings of 4.2 months of
imports ($8.1 billion) for 2012, compared with actual reserves of
2.8 months of imports ($5.3 billion). Raising reserves to the
suggested level would reduce the predicted cost of a crisis, in the event
of a large shock, by about 24 percent.

return of gold and cocoa exports to their 2009 levels could curb net
current account inflows by $1.6 billion. At the same time, high yields on government bonds have increased foreign
participation, with nonresidents now holding about one-third of government domestic debt (in three and five-year bonds).
This creates potential for net portfolio inflows, as bonds are typically held to maturity and those maturing in 2013 had very
low foreign participation. However, if instead foreigners decided to reduce their exposure by selling, for example, half of
their holdings (arguably at a significant discount) on the secondary market, this would translate into capital outflows of
$1.4 billion. Thus, a confluence of adverse developments could seriously weaken the balance of payments, lending strong
support to the model-based conclusion that current reserve levels provide an inadequate buffer against plausible countryspecific shocks.

Box 2. External Sustainability Assessment1
Medium-term current account benchmarks for Ghana range from -4 to -2.8 percent of GDP. Ghana’s optimal path in the next
five years should lead to a reduction in the current account deficit combined with a significant fiscal consolidation and a shift from
public consumption to public investment.
MB
ES
Model
The three methodologies used—external sustainability (ES), macroeconomic
balance (MB), and model-based—approach the assessment from different
perspectives. Combining their results provides a richer picture of Ghana’s external
position. The ES approach provides a current account benchmark consistent with
stabilizing NFA at a certain level, but abstracts from the country’s underlying
internal fundamentals. The MB approach estimates a benchmark based on the
country’s fundamentals relative to its trading partners, but does not capture
Ghana’s recent oil windfall and its potential use for infrastructure investment. In a
capital-scarce economy, like Ghana, this may warrant higher current account
deficits. By calibrating the dynamic neoclassical model by Araujo et al. (2012) to
the case of Ghana, the recent discovery of offshore oil and gas reserves is explicitly
incorporated into the assessment of the current account.

Both the ES and MB approaches suggest that the current account deficit
should decline in the medium run, but magnitudes of adjustment differ. Stabilizing Ghana’s NFA-to-GDP ratio at its 2009 preoil discovery level of -26.8 percent implies a current account benchmark of -2.8 percent of GDP. The MB approach predicts a
medium-run benchmark of -3.5 percent of GDP which is strongly influenced by Ghana’s relatively high rates of GDP per capita and
population growth. Under this approach a fiscal adjustment would narrow the gap from two sides: directly, by reducing the actual
current account deficit, and indirectly by lowering the benchmark, with every percentage point improvement in Ghana’s fiscal
balance translating into a 0.3 percentage point increase in the sustainable current account deficit.
A model-based approach is used to qualify the above results and to
provide quantitative indications of the optimal composition of
2
consumption and investment in Ghana in the medium run. The paths
of the current account, as well as private and public consumption and
investment implied by the model, are the result of the optimal choice of
a social planner maximizing social welfare. The optimal choice takes
account of the need for infrastructure scaling up and incorporates
inefficiencies inherent in investment projects in developing countries,
given a long-run level of NFA (note that FDI is treated as decreasing NFA
in the model). Once calibrated to Ghana’s economy, the model can
provide a current account benchmark, as well as information on the
optimal composition of consumption and investment.

Current Account: All approaches suggest that the current
account deficit has to decline in the medium term.

First, the optimal composition of spending is estimated consistent
with the projected current account deficit in the medium run. This step reveals the long-run level of NFA under which the
currently projected deficit for 2017 would be optimal and the optimal levels of private and public consumption and investment
given this projection. A current account benchmark broadly in line with the projected path of the current account deficit in the
medium run is consistent with a long-run NFA level of -78 percent of GDP. This level would place Ghana in the lowest 20th3
percentile within the group of middle income countries. Given this long-run NFA level, the model predicts that recurrent
government expenditure is around 4.5 percentage points of GDP above and public investment more than 2 percentage points
below the optimal value in 2012. In 2017, government consumption is projected to be more than 3 percentage points of GDP
higher than its benchmark and public investment almost 0.5 percentage point below its optimal value.

Box 2. External Sustainability Assessment (Concluded)
Second, the spending composition and the current account benchmark are derived based on a more conservative long-run
NFA to GDP ratio. The optimal macroeconomic path is now derived assuming an NFA-to-GDP ratio of -40 percent corresponding
to the median NFA level of lower-middle income countries. This NFA level implies a benchmark for the current account deficit of
9.8 percent of GDP in the short run and 4 percent of GDP in the medium run.

The current account deviations from the benchmarks obtained above suggest that the Ghana cedi is overvalued by 13.6 to
17.1 percent in the medium run, but call for different policies to support external sustainability. In particular, both MB and
model-based approaches suggest that the adjustment in the current account can be achieved through fiscal consolidation, with the
latter approach highlighting that the adjustment of fiscal expenditure should arise through a disproportionate cut in current
expenditure, while public and private investment should be safeguarded.

A model-based analysis confirms these conclusions and provides further insights on
the trade-offs between different policy choices. Appendix III presents the results of a dynamic
stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model, capturing the interaction between public investment,
growth, and debt sustainability, calibrated to the Ghanaian economy. The analysis illustrates that
achieving a long-term debt ratio of about 50 percent may require a stronger fiscal effort than
assumed in the standard DSA. It confirms that further upfront consolidation would reduce the debt
ratio significantly with only small reductions in the growth dividend. Alternative policy scenarios
suggest that such a front-loaded adjustment could generate significant benefits if combined with
reforms to enhance investment efficiency. The latter would even create scope for a more ambitious
scaling up of public investment and a larger growth dividend, without endangering the debt
dynamics. A more ambitious investment profile without improved efficiency, however, would raise
the debt ratio significantly.
19.
In light of these findings, the mission recommended policy measures to generate
savings of another 3 percent of GDP by 2015, complemented by further institutional reforms.
While there are limits to achieving faster consolidation in 2013, staff viewed prompt action on
measures that can be implemented quickly as critical to reduce fiscal and external risks. This,
together with an ambitious and credible action plan for the coming years, would go a long way in
reinforcing confidence. The mission suggested a thorough expenditure review, with possible support
from the Fund’s Fiscal Affairs Department, to identify areas for savings and reprioritization,
consistent with the government’s own agenda.
20.

There was broad consensus on the areas for reform:

•

On the expenditure side, it was agreed that a return to full cost-recovery pricing for fuel and
utilities—cushioned by targeted social programs—should be pursued as soon as possible, not
only to generate savings, but also to restore the financial viability of the public energy
companies, as part of a comprehensive reform of the sector. The largest potential for savings
could be achieved by rationalizing the wage bill, including actions to streamline, discontinue, or
commercialize the activities of subvented agencies. A public sector reform secretariat has been
established under the office of the president to develop specific plans. The authorities saw
benefits in the mission’s proposal to move to multi-year wage agreements and to negotiate
salary increases before the budget is finalized to enhance predictability. Decisive action on these
and other fronts, in the context of a broad public expenditure review, could reasonably generate
savings of another 2 percent of GDP by 2015. On wages alone, savings of 1¾ percent of GDP
could be achieved, relative to current projections, by limiting pay increases to inflation, while
keeping the size of the public sector unchanged.

•

On the revenue side, a far-reaching removal of exemptions, together with further tax policy
measures, for example in the area of property taxes, could generate additional revenue of
1 percent of GDP by 2015.

These measures, taken together, would help rebuild external buffers, establish favorable debt
dynamics, improve the composition of fiscal spending toward priority areas, and allow a
readjustment in the policy mix to reduce high real interest rates.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

GHANA

21.
The authorities also recognized the importance of institutional reforms to strengthen
budgetary control and predictability:
•

Debt management and investment planning. Building on past achievements, the authorities
are committed to further strengthen their performance in these key areas that will only increase
in importance with growing reliance on nonconcessional financing. The planned issuance of
another Eurobond of up to $1 billion is part of their strategy to smooth rollover needs and
reduce debt-servicing costs—by replacing more expensive borrowing from the less liquid
domestic market—while shoring up international reserves. The authorities are also taking a more
systematic approach to the implementation of investment projects, prioritizing completion of
existing over new projects.

•

Budget allocation rules for statutory funds. Fixed allocation to these funds, established for
priority areas, such as roads, education, and fiscal decentralization, limit budget flexibility but are
constitutionally mandated. Rather than attempting to change the underlying principle, the
authorities saw scope in reviewing the transfers and associated spending obligations, with a view
to streamlining overall government expenditure and creating more flexibility to adjust spending
in response to shocks or changed priorities.

•

Fiscal rules. The authorities were open to renew the dialogue over the adoption of
comprehensive fiscal rules to support fiscal prudence and debt sustainability, once consolidation
is firmly on track and fiscal predictability has been established.

MONETARY POLICY: LITTLE ROOM FOR EASING
There was broad agreement that monetary policy needs to remain tight until fiscal
consolidation is firmly established.
22.
The mission raised concerns about the BoG’s direct financing of the fiscal deficit in the
run-up to the 2012 elections. The sharp increase in net credit to the government far exceeded the
statutory limit of 10 percent of revenue for total bank financing and risked weakening the
perception of the BoG’s independence, as well as the credibility of the inflation targeting regime.

elimination was practical. The mission agreed with the BoG’s proposal to establish a separate ceiling
for its component of government financing that is consistent with macroeconomic stability
objectives and enforced.
23.
Faced with a rapidly depreciating currency, the BoG took a number of measures in
2012 to tighten domestic liquidity. Apart from raising its policy rate by 250 basis points and
directly mopping up liquidity, the BoG reduced banks’ maximum net open forex position and
required them to hold mandatory reserves on foreign currency deposits in cedi, rather than foreign
currency. These measures were successful in absorbing excess liquidity and stabilizing the cedi, while
raising interbank rates well above the policy rate. Thus, the effective policy stance, as evidenced by
market rates, has been tighter than suggested by the policy rate.

Box 3. Six Years of Inflation Targeting in Ghana: Policy Lessons and Challenges1

Ghana is one of the few lower-middle income countries that adopted inflation targeting (IT) as a formal framework for its
monetary policy. This box summarizes the key findings of a joint study by the IMF African and Research Departments on
the performance of Ghana’s IT regime over the six years of its existence (2007–12). It applies a stylized macroeconomic
model of the kind typically used by central banks to guide their policy in the early phases of their IT experience.2 The key
findings and policy conclusions are: the IT regime has been successful in bringing inflation down to single digits, but there
remain significant operational challenges to make the framework more transparent and accountable.
Inflation Record and Monetary Transmission

The interest rate channel, a key channel of IT policy, seems to function in
a standard way. This conclusion takes account of the fact that the
overnight interbank market rate has at times deviated quite significantly
from the official policy rate. Because the former is a better proxy of the
BoG’s effective policy stance, it is used instead of the official policy rate to
analyze the implementation of the IT framework. Figure 2 shows the
correlation between the interbank market rate and economic activity,
measured by the output gap (the difference between actual output and
its potential level). Past interest rate tightening is associated with
moderating economic activity in the future (Figure 2, SW quadrant
showing negative correlation), indicating that the BoG is forward-looking
by tightening rates when an output gap is expected to open up. Also, the
BoG seems to appropriately tighten the policy rate in response to past
increases in the output gap (Figure 2, NE quadrant showing positive
correlation).

IT period

Correlation Between Output Gap and BoG Policy Rate

The IT regime has been successful in delivering on its goal of reducing inflation and keeping it stable at the authorities’
target level. The Bank of Ghana (BoG) reduced headline inflation from 20-percent levels in 2004 to 10.7 percent by end2010 (above the 8.6 percent mid-point target, but within the target band); since then, inflation has stayed within the official
target bands (Figure 1). This was helped, however, by low food inflation
and administered energy prices; core inflation, excluding food and
energy, has been persistently in double digits throughout the IT period
(2007-to date) and within the upper limit of the official target bands since
2011.

The six-year experience of IT in Ghana can be divided into three sub-periods: (i) transition period (2007-2008), (ii) ITgaining-credibility period (2009-2010), and (iii) complacent period (2011-2012). A macroeconomic model is used to shed
light on the key drivers of economic cycles and the policy transmission mechanism during those periods. The model
reflects the essence of the macroeconomic relationship between output, prices, interest rates, and exchange rates as
predicted by economic theory. Specifically, monetary policy follows a Taylor-type rule in which the policy interest rate
responds to expected future deviations of inflation from the target and to the output gap. Formally, the behavior of output
and inflation is captured by an IS curve, which captures demand shocks, including fiscal policy changes, and a Phillips curve.
As a small open economy, Ghanaian economic activity is further affected by foreign factors. The exchange rate, satisfying
risk-adjusted uncovered interest-rate parity, is a nominal shock absorber between the domestic and foreign developments.

Box 3. Six Years of Inflation Targeting in Ghana: Policy Lessons and Challenges (Concluded)
The model can explain volatility in interest rates, prices, and output by underlying (model-estimated) “fundamentals.”
Figure 3 shows the actual interbank rate and the fundamental rate estimated
by the model. Figure 4 decomposes the interbank (policy) rate into its
structural components, including unexpected shocks (other factors). During
the IT transition period, the actual rate was close to its fundamental level, but
policy still lacked credibility: when the food and fuel price shock hit the
economy in 2008, inflation expectations surged (Figure 5). This prompted the
authorities to increase rates by more than warranted by economic
fundamentals (Figure 3) in an attempt to gain credibility and anchor inflation
expectations. During the following five quarters (2009Q3–2010Q4), inflation
declined, reaching its 9 percent target by end-2010. Subsequently, the
monetary stance turned too accommodative, planting the seeds for yet
another credibility test. As the economy entered an expansionary period
with the start of oil production, liquidity conditions eased rapidly. The
interest rate fell below its fundamental rate, and associated capital
outflows triggered a sharp exchange rate depreciation. Inflation
expectations accelerated again (light green bars in Figure 5). At this point,
breaking the cycle required aggressive action, leading to double–digits
real interest rates.
What are the conclusions?
Stronger commitment to single-digit inflation could have benefited the
real economy through lower financing costs. The ‘lack of credibility’
premium in interest rates, comes from different sources: an imperfect
alignment of market rates with the BoG policy rate, delayed reaction to
growing liquidity pressures, and insufficient communication of the policy
stance. Credibility of the IT framework could also be enhanced by setting
a medium-term inflation target to better anchor expectations. The BoG
may want to adopt a more ambitious medium-term inflation target of 5-6
percent, to realize the significant welfare gains from a lower inflation
environment. Looking forward, the BoG should make further
improvements in the systematic use of a model-based forecasting and
policy analysis (FPAS) and in communicating effectively to the public its
policy decisions, including policy and forecasting mistakes, in line with best
practice in IT-based monetary policy frameworks.

Considerations beyond the model-based analysis
A successful implementation of the IT framework cannot be seen in isolation from fiscal policy shocks which may threaten
the inflation target. An expansionary fiscal policy that relies directly on BoG financing, as it has occurred in Ghana in the
past two elections (2008 and 2012), makes it difficult to achieve and sustain lower inflation rates. Such a policy of
monetizing the fiscal deficit raises inflation directly, while also entrenching it through higher inflationary expectations.

It recommended an increase in the policy rate to counter inflationary pressures, supported by active
liquidity management that keeps market rates appropriately tight. This would also strengthen the
signaling role of the policy rate within the inflation-targeting framework by narrowing the gap with
current interbank rates. The mission suggested that a further tightening of the policy stance could
be warranted, should recent hikes in domestic fuel prices create second-round effects, or should the
cedi come under renewed pressure. In the latter case, the mission cautioned against direct
interventions that would further deplete an already low reserve cover. Subsequent to the mission,
during its May meeting, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) raised the policy rate by 100 basis
points to 16 percent.
25.
The mission also advised the BoG to strengthen the implementation of the inflationtargeting framework. It welcomed the BoG’s interest in improving its liquidity management, based
on a consistent and user-friendly liquidity-forecasting framework. To strengthen its policy
effectiveness, the BoG should manage liquidity in a manner that results in a close alignment of
market rates with its policy rate. Following the May MPC meeting, the BoG announced two welcome
changes to its monetary operations to strengthen the effectiveness and signaling functioning of the
policy rate: (i) a widening of the interest rate corridor by raising the upper bound to 200 basis points
above the policy rate (with the lower bound remaining at 100 basis points); and (ii) introduction of a
standing facility to manage liquidity more effectively in the interbank market, enhancing the
transmission mechanism. Looking forward, the mission encouraged the BoG to make further
improvements in the systematic use of a structural model-based inflation forecasting tool, and in
communicating effectively to the public its policy decisions—including policy and forecasting
mistakes—in line with best practice in IT-based monetary policy frameworks. Finally, it suggested
that credibility of the IT framework would be further enhanced by setting a one- to two-year rolling
inflation target, as opposed to the current end-year target, to better anchor expectations. The
mission also noted that a more ambitious target could generate significant welfare gains from a
lower inflation environment.

FINANCIAL SECTOR: CONTAINING VULNERABILITIES
AND REMOVING STRUCTURAL CONSTRAINTS
The Bank of Ghana is focused on strengthening its regulatory and supervisory powers, in
line with the 2011 FSAP recommendations, and to keep pace with new risks in the
financial sector. The mission’s advice benefited

opportunities to the private sector. The authorities fully agreed that decisive fiscal consolidation was
necessary to reduce the crowding out of private investment.
27.
While the banking system has grown steadily in assets and profitability, the mission
cautioned about the buildup of new risks. Despite strong credit growth, the ratio of nonperforming loans (NPLs) has not fallen since mid-2012, but merely stabilized at around 13 percent,
and high interest rates spell risks of a renewed deterioration in banks’ credit portfolios. Moreover,
strong profits from high treasury-bill rates can reduce banks’ incentives to improve efficiency,
Box 4. Enhanced Financial Sector Surveillance: Main Conclusions1
Ghana was selected as one of the pilot cases for enhancing surveillance of financial systems in low-income
countries. The purpose is to go beyond the traditional surveillance focus on banking system soundness and
solvency, by analyzing in more depth the interplay between financial development, macroeconomic and
financial stability, and effectiveness of macroeconomic policies. The main conclusions of the study are as
follows:
• While the banking system has grown rapidly and is competitive by standard metrics (barriers to
entry and concentration of assets), private credit has remained relatively low as a share of GDP and
access to affordable credit is a major constraint on growth.
• High real interest rates—a result of structural factors, such as high operating cost, but also excessive
government borrowing—are constraining private sector access and create risks of a renewed increase in
nonperforming loans (NPLs).
• An upgrading of financial sector legislation and supervisory practices is ongoing and is needed to
deal with the growing complexities of an evolving financial landscape with increased foreign
participation and a growing role of microfinance institutions.
• Rural and Community Banks have become a main channel for financial inclusion, though only about
30 percent of adults have an account at a formal institution. A sizeable part of the population relies
instead on the services of about 600 microfinance companies, as well as 3,000-5,000 individual susu
collectors that serve over half a million customers.
• The ownership role of the state, especially of the BoG, in the financial sector raises concerns about a
level playing field and reputational risks to the BoG’s credibility as an independent regulator and
supervisor. Risks also arise from the slow decision-making and resolution process for the two remaining
weak banks.
• The BoG has the tools to conduct effective inflation targeting, but there is room to improve its
forecasting and liquidity management framework to restore the signaling role of its policy rate.
• A return to fiscal discipline and effective policy coordination are needed for successful further
disinflation and increased financial deepening.

potentially delaying otherwise warranted consolidation and cost reduction in the industry. Overhead
costs relative to total assets are already significantly above peer countries, and the cost-to-income
ratio is high. While, on average, only 30 percent of banks’ income results from treasury bills,
retaining profitability in some institutions may prove challenging, once the government’s high
borrowing demands are reversed. Concentration is also high with large exposures to single obligors
and economic sectors. In light of these risks, the BoG is encouraging banks to make effective use of
the existing credit reference bureaus and was open to suggestions to raise minimum capital buffers
against a future downturn.
28.
Building on recent improvements in supervisory practices, the mission urged the BoG
to focus on the remaining gaps and challenges identified in the 2011 FSAP. 2 The BoG has
greatly improved its offsite supervision, backed by enhanced risk-assessment processes. It is now
focusing on strengthening its regulatory powers and standards in areas such as consolidated
supervision and has requested Fund technical assistance to help address gaps and inconsistencies in
the laws that constrain its ability to set and enforce prudential regulations. Further areas for
improvement include deepened cross-border supervision, where the BoG has signed MoUs and
begun to supervise some foreign-owned banks jointly with its relevant supervisory counterparts.
Finally, while the number of weak banks has declined since the 2011 FSAP, the mission encouraged
the authorities to address the risks posed by the two remaining problem banks, either through their
sale or orderly liquidation, while developing contingency plans in case of further stress. This would
also reduce reputational risks to the BoG’s credibility as a supervisor, arising from its ownership
stake in one of the banks.

STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
Despite a strong growth momentum, short-term stability risks are significant. Ghana’s
strong democratic credentials and favorable prospects for oil and gas production continue to attract
significant FDI. Yet, low external buffers and a rising domestic debt ratio expose the economy to
risks, such as weaker terms of trade, reduced capital inflows, or unanticipated spending needs.
Energy sector problems could curtail growth, while excessive domestic government borrowing is
raising the cost of credit to the private sector. Both factors have been identified as key constraints to
growth.
30.
Ghana’s positive medium-term outlook is contingent on strong political will to
confront these challenges decisively. The immediate policy priority is to safeguard stability by
rebuilding fiscal and external buffers. Decisive fiscal consolidation will, in due course, also allow for a
reduction in interest rates. Going forward, successful economic transformation will require a
realignment of spending away from wages and subsidies toward investment in infrastructure, while
structural fiscal reforms are needed to restore policy credibility and build institutional resilience to
the political cycle. Ultimately, better infrastructure, improved access to credit, further investment in

health and education, and sustained macroeconomic stability will be central for Ghana’s ambition of
achieving full middle-income status and raising the living standards of all its citizens.
31.
The government’s primary policy task is to reverse the large fiscal slippages of 2012.
Gaining control over the wage bill is the first priority, starting with a thorough examination, already
initiated by the government, of the factors that drove the spending overrun in 2012. Improvements
in revenue administration and new tax measures are welcome, but much of their impact is likely to
be felt only in the coming years. The announced reintroduction of the stabilization levy combined
with other immediate measures will provide an important offset for early-year revenue shortfalls, but
prompt action is also needed to curtail tax exemptions and bring fuel and utility prices back to full
cost-recovery levels. The latter is essential not only to eliminate costly subsidies, but also to restore
the financial viability of the power sector companies as a requirement for tackling Ghana’s energy
problems. In the absence of additional policy measures, and assuming a delayed removal of energy
subsidies, staff sees significant risks that this year’s deficit target of 9 percent of GDP will be missed.
32.
The government’s deficit target of 6 percent of GDP by 2015 is achievable, but would
keep public debt high and external buffers low. Staff recommends an additional fiscal
adjustment of 3 percent of GDP by 2015, using a combination of revenue and expenditure
measures, including a reduction in the wage bill as a share of GDP to make room for investment in
critical infrastructure and social priority areas. Without the additional fiscal adjustment, Ghana’s
public debt burden would likely remain high, and official reserves would continue to fall short of the
authorities’ target of 4 months of imports, leaving the economy exposed to terms-of-trade shocks
and destabilizing shifts in confidence.
33.
Staff’s external stability assessment confirms the need for reducing recurrent
government spending. Ghana’s projected medium-term current account deficit exceeds the
sustainability benchmarks, suggesting an overvaluation of the real exchange rate by 13½ to
17 percent in the absence of further policy adjustment. An additional reduction in public
consumption of 3-4 percent of GDP by 2017, would facilitate a reduction in the current account
deficit to a sustainable level of about 4 percent of GDP, without the need for an exchange rate
adjustment, while making room for increased public and private investment.
34.
The monetary policy stance will need to remain tight until inflationary pressures
decline and fiscal consolidation is firmly established. Both actual inflation and inflation
expectations have risen recently, with upside risks from the sharp increase in government borrowing
and a still positive output gap. The latest increase in the policy rate was warranted to counter
inflationary pressures and should continue to be supported by active liquidity management to keep
market rates appropriately tight. A further tightening of the policy stance could be warranted in the
event of second-round effects from recent hikes in domestic fuel prices or renewed pressure on the
cedi, while foreign reserves should be protected. Successful fiscal consolidation would provide scope
for lowering interest rates in due course.

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GHANA

35.
The Bank of Ghana has room to improve the functioning of its inflation targeting
framework. Recent decisions to raise the policy rate, combined with measures to steer market rates
back into the policy corridor, are welcome and important steps to restore the policy rate’s signaling
role within the inflation-targeting framework. Going forward, the BoG should manage liquidity
consistently in a manner that maintains a close alignment of market rates with the policy rate, with
the latter being set at a level consistent with the inflation target. The process for selecting the policy
rate could be strengthen by the systematic use of a model-based inflation forecasting tool which—
together with improved communication to the public—would bring the BoG closer to best practice
in IT-based monetary policy frameworks. Credibility of the IT framework could be further enhanced
by setting a one- to two-year inflation target to better anchor expectations, while a more ambitious
target could generate significant welfare gains from a lower inflation environment.
36.
The priority in the financial sector is to contain vulnerabilities and remove structural
constraints. Ghana’s banking sector has grown steadily in assets and profitability, but high interest
rates are pricing out profitable investment projects, while raising the risk of a renewed increase in
nonperforming loans. Higher minimum capital buffers may be warranted as protection against a
future downturn. The BoG has implemented important actions over the past years to improve bank
supervision. It should now focus on addressing gaps and inconsistencies in the banking laws, and
deepening cooperation with regional counterparts to improve the regulation and supervision of
foreign banks active in Ghana. Dealing with the remaining two weak banks is also a priority, as is the
divestiture of the BoG’s financial stake in banks that it supervises.
37.
It is recommended that the next Article IV Consultation be held on the regular twelvemonth cycle.

Nature/Source of
Main Threats
1. Delayed fiscal
adjustment

Likelihood of Severe Realization of
Threats in the Next 1–3 Years
(high, medium or low)
Medium
• The fiscal adjustment in 2013 falls
significantly short of the budget target.
• Opposition from politically
important groups could make it difficult
for the new government to significantly
reduce current spending, such as wages
and energy subsidies.

Impact if Realized
(high, medium or low)
High
• Stronger domestic demand could
renew inflationary pressures and
prompt cedi depreciation, requiring the
central bank to increase already high
interest rates.
• High real domestic interest rates
could increase the fiscal debt service,
create risks to banks’ loan portfolios,
and reduce funding available for the
private sector, hurting growth.
• Continued subsidies could further
undermine the financial viability of
energy-sector SOEs.
• Debt dynamics could worsen,
further reducing capacity to handle
shocks given thin fiscal buffers

2. Sudden stop or
reversal of capital
inflows

Medium
• The large 2012 deficit was primarily
financed by domestic debt, and the
2013 budget assumes a continued
heavy reliance on domestic financing.
• As of end-2012, 30 percent of
domestic debt was held by nonresidents, putting the economy at risk
of a sudden stop or reversal of capital
inflows.

1

Medium
• Foreign reserve cover remains thin
at less than 3 months of imports. If
nonresidents decided to roll over only
50 percent of their existing bond
holdings, reserves would drop by
$1.4 billion (about one month of
imports).
• Significant currency depreciation
could reignite inflationary pressures and
raise the cost of foreign debt service.

The RAM shows relatively low probability events that could materially alter the baseline discussed in this
report. The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of risks surrounding this
baseline.

a sharp contraction of exports—though
part of this would be offset by lower
profit and dividend payments.

• Significant currency depreciation
could reignite inflationary pressures and
raise the cost of foreign debt service.

Medium
• Inflationary pressures are
understated by temporarily low
dynamics in food prices and
unsustainable government subsidies
that keep energy prices below market
levels.

monetary policy tightening to prevent
second-round effects, raising funding
costs for the government.
• A generalized increase in inflation
would disproportionately affect lower

Appendix II: Inclusive Growth Successes and Challenges 1
Ghana has experienced strong and broadly inclusive growth over the last 20 years,
defined as growth that raises the income of most or all in society, including the poorest
groups. Significant progress in poverty reduction has been achieved as well as the
establishment of a highly rated governance and business environment. Growth over the
medium term will depend more heavily on extractive industries, which will need to be
complemented by diversified, private sector-led growth, particularly in more laborintensive industries. This note reviews past successes and focuses on three major
challenges: access to credit, energy infrastructure, and growth in labor-intensive sectors.
In all three areas current macroeconomic challenges constrain the government’s ability to
promote robust, inclusive growth. Fiscal consolidation followed by policies targeted at
these critical issues will be crucial for Ghana to advance to full middle-income status
while creating 6–7 million quality jobs in the next 20 years.

Background
1.
Ghana has experienced strong per capita GDP growth over the last 20 years, consistently
outperforming Sub-Saharan Africa and the world. Growth has accelerated over the last 5 years,
with strong performance in 2011, in particular, due to investment in oil extraction. This growth
experience has recently vaulted the country into lower-middle income status. Yet over the same two
decades middle-income countries as a group have experienced even stronger performance,
suggesting that the government’s objective of achieving full middle-income status will require
sustained improvements in growth over the medium term.

2.
Ghana’s period of sustained growth appears to have been widely shared. The fraction of
the population living on less than $1.25 a day has declined significantly, outperforming regional
peers. Ghana has become a regional leader by poverty measures. It has significantly lower levels of
poverty than the group of middle-income countries did in the early nineties, but still lags relative to
those countries today. At the same time, measures of inequality have increased, with Ghana’s Gini
coefficient converging to regional comparators. Measures of the share of income going to the
poorest 10 percent and 20 percent tell a similar story. While a rise in inequality may be considered a
natural consequence of sustained growth, the experience of Senegal and Sub-Saharan Africa as a
whole suggests that it is possible to reduce inequality while raising growth.

3.
Ghana’s successes in poverty reduction have been also reflected in significant
improvements in other Millennium Development Goal measures (Table A1). Ghana has kept
pace with or outperformed the Sub-Saharan African average in mortality rates for mothers and
children during births—increasingly attended by skilled health staff, in access to better water and
sanitation, and in school enrollment and youth literacy. Ghana has had some success protecting
particularly vulnerable populations. It has made progress in its urban/rural poverty divide from a
very unequal starting point but still had the largest urban/rural consumption divide of the
6 countries studied in the Fall 2011REO. Ghana has outpaced the region in erasing gender inequality
in education, and has reduced the economic activity rate of its 15–24 year olds by nearly a third
between 2000 and 2006, while increasing educational opportunities, but has moved backwards in
some other areas of women’s equality. These achievements have been strong on balance and
demonstrate that recent growth has translated into social investment and development by a variety
of measures.
4.
Ghana’s successes in growth, poverty reduction, and quality of life improvements have
been underpinned by a high-quality governance environment. Ghana has been highly rated in
the World Bank’s World Governance Indicators since their first observation in 1996. Its ratings have
continued to improve, accelerating past even the average Upper-Middle Income Country in the
World Bank’s latest ease of doing business indicators.

Three Constraints to Inclusive Growth
A recent analysis by the U.S. and Ghanaian governments, based on firm-level surveys
reporting barriers to growth, has identified access to affordable credit and reliable
electricity provision as principal constraints to growth (U.S. Government and Government
of Ghana, 2011). These constraints present a particularly heavy burden for small and
medium-sized enterprises and labor-intensive sectors, areas where growth is most
inclusive. This section analyzes these constraints and the challenge of promoting growth

38

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

32.7

GHANA

in employment-producing sectors, and suggests policies which can ensure that growth in
Ghana continues to be broad-based and robust.

A. Improving Access to Credit
5.
Access to affordable credit in Ghana is significantly constrained in spite of good
governance indicators. The lending-deposit spread in Ghana is large relative to comparator
countries and persistent over time. On one hand, the real return to savings is negative, leaving
domestic savings well below that of countries with less developed financial markets. On the other
hand, high real borrowing rates suppresses private sector credit which is also underdeveloped
relative to similar and even less developed markets.
6.
The banking system is relatively well developed, as measured by financial access. Ghana’s
banking system had more bank accounts and branches per capita than the regional average in 2010,
and more than its income level and other structural indicators would suggest according to the
World Bank’s FINSTATS data. Nevertheless, it has fallen behind Kenya by these measures since 2005
and trails Nigeria by a significant margin. While Rural and Community Banks have become a key
channel for financial inclusion in Ghana, only about 30 percent of adults have an account at a formal
institution. A sizeable part of the population relies instead on the services of about 600 microfinance
companies, as well as 3,000–5,000 individual susu collectors that serve over half a million
customers.2 Country comparisons of firms’ access to financial services provide a similarly mixed
picture; Ghana has slightly more firms with access to credit than the benchmark predicts, but fewer
small firms.
7.
A strong institutional ranking and increased competition have not delivered cheaper
financial intermediation or reduced bank profitability. Ghana is ranked 23rd in the world and 4th
in Sub-Saharan Africa in the World Bank’s Access to Credit ranking in its Doing Business Indicators.
The high ranking is due importantly to its establishment of a credit rating agency covering
5.7 percent of adults. According to the most recent FSAP the use of this information by lenders is in

Competition is on the rise but has also
failed to deliver. There are 26 banks operating

three banks by size comprise less than half of
10
banking system assets—a highly diversified
sector relative to comparator countries. This

and excessive bank profitability. Discussions with
stakeholders suggested that the rapid growth of the financial sector has had the opposite effect—
bidding up bankers’ wages and increasing the cost of intermediation. These discussions suggested
that the lending-deposit spread genuinely reflects operating costs in excess of banking sectors in
comparator countries.

9.
Increases in domestic borrowing by the government are likely to further crowd out
private sector credit. A recent spike in domestic borrowing of the government has increased T-Bill
rates and interbank market rates. In the past,

Fiscal consolidation will help alleviate difficulties in access to affordable credit. If the
pattern of the spike in T-Bill rates in 2008 is repeated, a concerted fiscal consolidation will bring
lending rates to lower levels over the medium term. The current above-average profitability of the
banking sector should also decline as these returns to government debt normalize, likely spurring a
rationalization of the crowded market for banking services. A reduction in the number of banks,
concentrating assets in the hands of the more efficient banks and cooling off the labor market for
seasoned bankers, should lower intermediation costs and reduce persistent lending-deposit spreads
over the medium term. It will be critical that predictable and efficient bank resolution procedures are
in place to respond if lower bank profitability materializes.

B. Improving the Quantity and Quality of Energy Supply
11.
Ghana’s infrastructure deficit, and in particular the quantity and reliability of energy
supply, has been identified as another major constraint on growth. Entrepreneurs report that
unreliable energy supply, the high cost of private generators, and the uncertain future of energy
providers is a major concern in investment decisions. These concerns are most acute in sectors
which contribute heavily to job growth—manufacturing and downstream agricultural
transformation. The government faces significant operational challenges to meet its goal of
generating 5,000 Mw by 2016.
12.
The financial situation of energy providers is preventing necessary maintenance and
additional investment. Reluctance to raise electricity prices to cost-recovery levels, along with
relatively high commercial and technical losses in the distribution network, have led the state energy
companies to record regular operational losses. The energy production sector is under further
temporary strain from the disruption in delivery of natural gas from Nigeria through the West
African Gas Pipeline, increasing the share of petroleum-based production at double the marginal
cost. The pipeline is expected to resume delivery shortly, but additional energy production slated to
come online is facing delays and may not be sufficient to meet growing demand. While raising
electricity prices is difficult in an environment of deteriorating delivery, the sector is currently unable
to maintain current infrastructure, much less ramp up investment to expand production. Shoring up
the financial situation of the ECG and VRA (the state-owned distributor and producer of power,
respectively) is a prerequisite to improving the operational efficiency of these bodies.
13.
Further investments in new energy production will be necessary to keep pace with
demand. Ghana’s dynamic economy is expanding rapidly, and energy output will need to grow by
an estimated 200–250 MW/year to match production growth, with more needed to improve
reliability. As domestic natural gas production comes on-stream it is important that a financially
viable energy sector with reduced policy uncertainty is in place to see this resource converted to
electricity.

C. Growing Where the Jobs Are
14.
Ghana’s economy will need to add 6-7 million jobs by 2030, according to population
and economic activity rate projections. Currently more than 80 percent of Ghana’s jobs are in the
informal sector (GSS 2012), and it is unlikely that the formal economy will be able to generate
enough stable salary work to absorb the influx of new workers. More than 40 percent of workers are
in the agricultural sector which remains poorly paid and largely informal. Among the middle-income
SSA countries compared in the Fall 2012 REO, the agriculture share of GDP in Ghana was more than
twice as high as in any other country and was declining at the second slowest rate. As discussed
below, the sector has registered below-average growth over the past 5 years. While Ghana likely
enjoys a natural comparative advantage in agriculture and should not pursue a manufacturing-led
growth strategy at all costs, diversifying unskilled labor away from basic agriculture, while increasing

agricultural productivity, would likely lead to higher growth—benefitting the most vulnerable within
and outside the agricultural sector.

The recent increase in growth has been concentrated in capital-intensive sectors,
limiting the positive effect on employment and inclusiveness. While labor-intensive sectors like
manufacturing and agriculture underperform relative to overall growth (both under 5 percent),
extractive industries, financial services, and communication have outperformed. With primary and
secondary school enrollment marking significant gains over the past decade, further progress on
tertiary education will be important to moving workers into these high-growth sectors. Otherwise a
continuation of capital-intensive growth risks undermining Ghana’s history of inclusive growth in
which all benefit from greater output.
16.
The extractive sector will continue to grow over the next 10 years as petroleum
production peaks and new natural gas fields are brought on stream. These developments
promise strong growth rates but threaten to exacerbate the capital-intensive growth of the past
5 years. Prudent use of natural resource revenues for infrastructure and human capital investments
will determine whether these developments contribute positively to the welfare of the average
Ghanaian worker.
17.
To turn this growth dividend into jobs and raise the living standard of all Ghanaians,
the government will need to leverage its high quality governance and business environment
to diversify growth towards manufacturing and advanced agricultural production. While a
recent AfDB analysis found that labor market regulations are a serious constraint to growth in the
manufacturing sector, the evidence is mixed. Labor costs are relatively high, but those enterprises
which have thrived in the current environment rate labor costs below the macroeconomic and
political environment, market size, and resources as a constraint on growth. Better infrastructure,
improved access to credit, further investments in health and education, and sustained
macroeconomic stability will be central to ensure that the next two decades of robust growth in
Ghana are as inclusive as the last two.

Appendix III: Public Investment, Growth, and Debt
Sustainability 1
1.
The Ghanaian authorities have emphasized the need to address large infrastructure gaps
to secure Ghana’s long-term growth. They intend to focus investments on productivity-enhancing
infrastructure, including roads, energy infrastructure, storage facilities, and irrigation systems that
would crowd in private investment.
2.
While addressing infrastructure gaps is essential, the scope for debt-financed
infrastructure investment is contingent on maintaining debt sustainability. Two separate tools
are applied to inform the assessment of debt sustainability and the associated policy choices: the
standard debt sustainability analysis (DSA) and a model-based approach. The standard DSA
confirms previous results, suggesting that Ghana is able to scale up investment from around 6 to
9 percent of GDP, while maintaining a moderate risk of distress. 2 This conclusion holds even under
conservative assumptions on growth dividends, but is contingent on successful fiscal consolidation.
The second tool—and focus of this appendix—is a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE)
model that is tailored to resource-rich developing countries and explicitly captures the interaction
between public investment, growth, and debt sustainability.

A. The Model
3.
The DSGE model, based on Buffie et al (2012), is designed to capture many of the
economic features prevalent in developing countries. 3 The model suggests that a comparison of
an investment’s rate of return and the cost of funding is not sufficient to assess the viability of a
project. Investment efficiency and absorptive capacity play an important role in determining debt
sustainability. Public investment may be inefficient, that is a dollar spent on public investment does
not necessarily lead to an equivalent increase in public capital, whereas absorptive capacity
problems may result in implementation delays and cost overruns.
4.
An additional advantage of the DSGE approach is that it specifically models the
relationship between investment and growth. Not surprisingly the model predicts a positive
direct relationship between public investment and growth: infrastructure investment increases the
productivity of existing capital, both private and public, and spurs further investment (crowding in).
At the same time, the model also captures the potentially negative effects of debt-financed public
investment, whereby higher real interest rates crowd out private investment.

B. Application to Ghana
5.
Calibrated to the Ghanaian economy, the model can match the long-run debt-to-GDP
ratio projected in the standard DSA, but there are also significant differences (Table 1). First,
the model suggests that projections in the DSA may underestimate the positive effect of investment
on growth. Trend per capita GDP growth is

reason is that higher growth in the scalingup phase is not sufficient to generate the additional revenues needed during the repayment phase
to return to the same debt ratio. These additional resource needs are met by a combination of lower
current primary expenditures and higher VAT rates. The latter, in turn increases the real interest rate
(via lower private savings), dampening private investment during the repayment phase. 4

debt sustainability requires considerable effort on various fronts. Table 2 and Figure 1A present

2013 budget, can create
noticeable growth dividends; real per capita income would be about 15 percent higher in 2032
than without the scaling up (growth dividend). However, the model predicts that despite the
projected fiscal adjustment, the debt ratio would follow an inverted U-shape, peaking at around
70 percent of GDP in 2020, and declining to its current level (around 50 percent of GDP) by
2032. The additional investment would raise the public and private capital stocks by about 30
and 10 percent of GDP, respectively.

Note that a rising debt-servicing burden is also a feature of the standard DSA, where the debt service-to-revenue
ratio approaches the established DSA threshold.

•

A front-loaded fiscal adjustment of an additional 3 percent of GDP by 2015 (analogous to the
active scenario in the DSA), would generate a slightly lower growth dividend but result in a
significant decrease in the public debt ratio to less than 40 percent of GDP.

•

A more ambitious scaling up of investment can significantly boost the growth dividend, provided
there is no correlation between the size of the surge and capacity constraints. More ambitious
plans, however, may jeopardize debt sustainability. The model suggests that additional
investment scaling up to an average of 12 percent of GDP over the medium term would result in
a debt ratio of nearly 70 percent of GDP by 2032.

•

Additional reforms to improve investment efficiency (gradually increasing the share of public
investment spending that is transformed into productive capital) coupled with an increase in
user fees, would raise the growth dividend significantly, while simultaneously strengthening debt
sustainability. A scenario assuming a gradual improvement of investment efficiency and user
fees of a magnitude attainable over the medium term shows that the debt ratios of the baseline
and ambitious investment scenarios could be reduced to about 40 and 50 percent of GDP,
respectively.

7.
The different investment and reform scenarios have varied implications also for the path
of the external current account adjustment. The model suggests that under the baseline scenario
the assumed fiscal adjustment would lead to an improvement in the current account of almost
6 percent of GDP by 2032. More ambitious investment plans are associated with an initially smaller
current account adjustment—because of the additional investment spending—but this is reversed
subsequently as the investment profile adjusts to the baseline and higher tax rates are required
during the repayment phase, reducing private consumption. A front-loaded fiscal consolidation
would entail a significantly lower current account deficit throughout the projection period.

C. Conclusions
8.
The model illustrates that a successful scaling up of public investment in Ghana will
require complementary efforts to create fiscal space and improve investment efficiency. Even
if the rate of return on projects is high, weak efficiency of public investment can greatly reduce the
growth dividends from scaling up and increase the risk of debt distress. In addition, fiscal
consolidation (significantly lower primary current spending and higher tax revenue) remains a key
ingredient to debt sustainability, even with high investment efficiency; in the absence of reforms to
improve the efficiency of public investment, and higher user fees, the fiscal effort required to keep
the debt ratio at manageable levels would have to be larger.

Appendix IV: Implementation of the 2011 FSAP Update—Key
Policy Recommendations
The FSAP update made wide-ranging recommendations. This appendix presents a
summary assessment of progress in key areas.

Banking system stability
•

Most of GCB’s exposure to Tema Oil Refinery was restructured. However, fiscal developments,
including the re-emergence of arrears, create new concerns over government-related NPLs.

•

The authorities chose not to commission an audit of problem banks, instead seeking to raise
audit standards through auditor rotation and supervisory meetings with banks and auditors.

•

The authorities did not establish a steering committee for bank resolution and no banks have
been resolved. While there are now fewer weak public banks, there remain two.

•

A Financial Stability Department has been established, training delivered (IMF TA). There are
plans for a first publication soon. There has been limited progress with identifying data gaps.

•

The authorities have not developed a comprehensive framework for crisis management. Powers
to facilitate resolution have not been strengthened with new legislation.

•

State ownership or control of the banking sector has not been reduced.

Systemic liquidity management
•

Initiatives have been taken to improve the foreign exchange market (screen-based systems, BoG
intervention at interbank rates, Code of Conduct), and activity has increased.

•

Severe weaknesses remain in liquidity forecasting and there is a need to reform and develop the
liquidity management framework and use of monetary policy instruments.

Financial sector regulation and supervision
•

BoG’s holdings in banks have not been reduced. For ADB, legislation is planned to change the
bank’s status from specialist to commercial bank, facilitating disposal of the BoG’s stake.

•

Forbearance remains a feature of the BoG’s supervision, evidenced by its approach to weak
banks and readiness to grant waivers from the large exposure (single obligor) limits.

•

Plans to amend the Banking Act to strengthen the BoG’s powers have not been progressed.

•

Regulations have been drafted to strengthen the licensing framework, but they have not been
issued, nor have guidelines to enhance industry risk management.

DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS—UPDATE

Approved By
Michael Atingi-Ego and
Mark Joseph Flanagan
(IMF) and Jeff Lewis and
Marcelo Giugale (IDA)

Prepared by the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank1

The analysis suggests that Ghana’s risk of debt distress has risen, but remains moderate.
Driven by expansionary fiscal policy in 2012, several of Ghana’s public domestic and
external debt indicators have deteriorated, but external debt burden indicators are
projected to remain well below their respective indicative thresholds, provided fiscal
consolidation is realized as planned and continues beyond the medium term. Total public
debt is projected to stabilize at approximately 52 percent of GDP in the long run, with
debt service absorbing more than 40 percent of government revenue. A more frontloaded adjustment would be needed to set the debt ratio on a declining trend.

KEY ASSUMPTIONS UNDER THE BASELINE SCENARIO
1.
Macroeconomic assumptions
are broadly in line with those in the
November 2011 DSA, with
deviations mainly related to the
projection of oil production (Box 1
and Tables 1–2). Revisions reflect:
(i) updated information on proven
reserves in the Jubilee field and
recently assessed new fields;
(ii) associated FDI inflows, particularly
in 2016–2018; and (iii) a slightly higher
share of non-concessional borrowing,
consistent with Ghana’s rising wealth
and income status. By assuming a
back-loaded production start for the
newly assessed fields, and no
production from future discoveries, the
growth projections are conservative.

Box 1. Baseline Macroeconomic Assumptions
Real GDP-growth: After the acceleration of real GDP growth in 2011 to 15 percent, driven by oil production
and a considerable expansion of the non-oil economy, Ghana experienced another year of high real GDP
growth of almost 8 percent in 2012. Increased oil production is projected to keep the growth rate at this
level in 2013. In the medium-term, growth is projected to moderate until production from new oil fields
boosts output in 2018. In the long-run, real growth is assumed to stabilize at 5-6 percent, with new oil
discoveries implying significant upside potential.
Inflation: CPI inflation increased in late 2012, and survey-based expectations point to a further rise to above
10 percent in 2013. Supported by an improvement in the policy mix, inflation is expected to decline in the
medium run, with the GDP deflator stabilizing at 7-8 percent in 2018–2033.
Government balances: After widening to 7.9 percent of GDP in 2012, the primary deficit is projected to
improve to 2.2 percent of GDP by 2015, and to gradually fall to less than 1 percent of GDP in the long run.
Current account balance: Notwithstanding strong export growth of 15 percent, the current account deficit
widened to 12.2 percent of GDP in 2012, as a result of sharply rising imports. Owing to weaker terms of
trade, the current account deficit is expected to remain close to 12 percent in 2013 and above 8 percent of
GDP until 2017, driven by strong capital imports. Beginning in 2018, the deficit it is projected to gradually
decline to approximately 4 percent of GDP in 2033, broadly in line with its optimal level according to Fund
staff’s external balance assessment.
Financing flows: Ghana continued to attract significant FDI of above 8 percent of GDP in 2012, the main
part of which was related to the oil sector. Driven by the discovery of new fields, FDI is projected to stay
close to 7 percent of GDP until 2018, and then to gradually decline to 4 percent of GDP by 2033. Consistent
with Ghana’s improving income status and wealth, inflows from grants are projected to decline to less than
½ percent of GDP in the medium to long term. Borrowing is projected to become increasingly nonconcessional with above 90 percent of loans. The Eurobond, which the authorities are considering, is not
included in this DSA, but could help smooth rollover needs and actually reduce total debt service cost by
replacing more expensive borrowing from the less liquid domestic market.

EXTERNAL AND PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
A. External Debt Sustainability Analysis
Baseline scenario
3.
Ghana’s external debt
indicators are all projected to remain
below the relevant indicative
thresholds. The projected level and
composition of external debt is broadly
in line with the November 2011 DSA,
with a deterioration of export-based
indicators caused by a downward
revision in the terms of trade, but an
improvement in the revenue indicators,
reflecting further improvements in
revenue administration and tax
collection. All indicators remain below
their respective thresholds in the
baseline scenario (Table 3 and Figure 1A
and Table 3A).

1A and Table 3A). Though pushed up,
all three stock indicators as well as the debt service-to-export ratio remain under their respective
thresholds even under the standardized stress tests. However, the debt service to-revenue-ratio—
which is already close to its threshold level in the baseline scenario—increases to 26–30 under the
most extreme shock which constitutes a one-time 30 percent depreciation relative to the baseline in
2014. While having a more moderate impact, a decrease of non-debt creating flows to their
historical averages minus one standard deviation would also result in a breach of the debt serviceto-revenue threshold.

B. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
5.
Additional risks arise from the sharp increase in domestic debt, as indicated by the
total public debt dynamics (Table 4 and Figure 2A). Both considered stock indicators of public
debt have deteriorated significantly compared with the November 2011 assessment, with domestic
currency debt now exceeding external debt. On the basis of the authorities’ plans to decrease the
fiscal deficit by 6 percentage points of GDP by 2015, and assuming further gradual consolidation in
the medium to long term, Ghana’s present value of total public debt would stay at around
52 percent of GDP in the long run, leaving the country vulnerable to shocks. This is 10 percent of
GDP higher than in the previous DSA, of which about 2 percent is attributable to the decrease in the
discount rate from 4 to 3 percent. Debt service is projected to be lower compared to the previous
assessments, mainly reflecting less conservative assumptions on the maturity profile of domestic
borrowing, consistent with the authorities’ intentions.2 However, even assuming longer maturities
for domestic debt and an improvement of revenues in percent of GDP in response to ongoing
administrative reforms, public debt service

CONCLUSIONS
7.
While Ghana’s public debt situation has worsened since the last DSA, risks of distress
remain moderate. Deteriorations in the debt indicators relative to exports are mainly driven by a
weaker external outlook, while fiscal slippages in 2012 have set total public debt on a less favorable
path. Revenue-based indicators have overall improved compared to the last DSA, but the debt
service-to-revenue ratio still presents the most pronounced risk.
8.
Robust growth, a realization of the planned fiscal consolidation, and further
adjustment in the long run are essential to achieving the projected debt paths. The baseline
scenario assumes the authorities’ envisaged consolidation of 6 percent of GDP by 2015 followed by
gradual further consolidation in the long run. These measures will help stabilize the public debt ratio
at a still elevated level of about 52 percent of GDP. More ambitious upfront adjustment could set
the debt ratio on a much more favorable path.
9.
The authorities broadly agree with the analysis, but consider the projections to be on
the conservative side. In particular, they expect larger growth dividends from infrastructure
investments in the context of a more rapid development of the oil and gas sector and overall higher
potential GDP growth. A more optimistic growth projection would result in stronger debt indicators.

INTRODUCTION
1.
Ghana was selected to be one of the pilot cases for enhancing surveillance of financial
systems called for by Executive Board in May 2012 (FO/DIS/12/66). 1 The Board discussion
found that a shallow and undiversified financial sector creates macro-financial vulnerabilities that
impact the macroeconomy, and its ability to sustain growth and reduce poverty. While important to
understand how to generate financial deepening that will provide greater access to credit and
financial services, the process of deepening itself carries with it its own risks if there is inadequate
supervision and regulation. The paper also shows that undeveloped financial systems constrain
monetary policy implementation and the efficacy of its transmission mechanism as these systems
are often characterized by excess liquidity and thin government debt markets rendering interest
rates less correlated with policy rates.
2.
This study comes on the heels of the Ghana Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP) update conducted in February 2011. Section II presents the macroeconomic context
shaped by expansionary fiscal policy in the run-up to the elections in 2012. Section III presents an
overview of the financial system, focusing on the dominant banking sector. Section IV, identifies
emerging vulnerabilities, including supervisory challenges associated with risks identified in the
FSAP update and new risks from the evolving financial landscape, with a growing presence of
regional banks. Section V reviews financial access provided by nonbank financial institutions, and
associated risks. Given the active role the government has played in the financial system, section VI
examines the extent of this role, and suggests how it could be modified to create a more robust
sector that can provide greater access and competition for banking services. Finally, the Board paper
highlights the interaction of the financial sector with the effectiveness of monetary policy
implementation. Section VII reviews the monetary policy framework in Ghana, and recommends how
monetary policy implementation could be improved. This section also makes recommendations of
how to develop the still small interbank and foreign exchange markets.
3.
•

The main findings are as follows:
While the banking system has grown rapidly and is competitive by standard metrics (barriers to
entry and concentration of assets), private credit has remained relatively low as a share of GDP
and access to affordable credit is a major constraint on growth. 2

To date, Benin, Senegal, the West African Economic, and Monetary Union and Haiti have been included as pilot
cases.

•

High real interest rates—a result of structural factors, such as high operating cost, but also
excessive government borrowing—are constraining private sector access and create risks of a
renewed increase in nonperforming loans (NPLs).

•

An upgrading of financial sector legislation and supervisory practices is ongoing and is needed
to deal with the growing complexities of an evolving financial landscape with increased foreign
participation and a growing role of microfinance institutions.

•

Rural and Community Banks have become a main channel for financial inclusion, though only
about 30 percent of adults have an account at a formal institution. A sizeable part of the
population relies instead on the services of about 600 microfinance companies, as well as 3,0005,000 individual susu collectors that serve over half a million customers.

•

The ownership role of the state, especially of the BoG, in the financial sector raises concerns
about a level playing field and reputational risks to the BoG’s credibility as an independent
regulator and supervisor. Risks also arise from the slow decision-making and resolution process
for the two remaining weak banks.

•

The BoG has the tools to conduct effective inflation targeting, but there is room to improve its
forecasting and liquidity management framework to restore the signaling role of its policy rate.

•

A return to fiscal discipline and effective policy coordination are needed for successful further
disinflation and increased financial deepening.

MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN 2012
4.
While real GDP growth in Ghana has been steady and robust in recent years, the fiscal
surge in 2012 in the run-up to elections creates risks for economic and financial stability. GDP
growth in 2012 was 8 percent, with a rising public sector wage bill and costly energy subsides
pushing both the fiscal and current account deficits to about 12 percent of GDP. The government
financed almost 80 percent of its deficit domestically, and additionally accumulated new arrears. The
repeated occurrence of government arrears introduces uncertainty into financial transactions, as
banks are concerned that NPLs may increase. They particularly reduce access of smaller firms that
depend on government contracts, because banks tend to scrutinize them more, anticipating the risk
of nonpayment.
5.
In response to rapid exchange rate depreciation, monetary policy was tightened in the
second half of 2012. The currency has since stabilized, but at the cost of double-digit real interest
rates. The year ended with inflation remaining in single digits at 8.8 percent, helped by low food and
repressed domestic fuel prices.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GHANA

6.
Following the fiscal deficit surge and the tight monetary stance, the price of
borrowing shot up. Starting at below 10 percent at end-2011, interest rates on 91-day Treasury
bills went from close to 14 percent in the first half of 2012 to 21½ percent in the second half, and
have inched up to about 23 percent in April. While the policy rate also increased, though only to
15 percent, the interbank rate has hovered at around 19 percent.
7.
The large volume of domestically financed government borrowing at high interest
rates threatens to crowd out private sector credit. Discussions with banks suggested that they
are not eager to extend loans to much riskier small and medium-sized enterprises, when they can so
profitably lend to the government at low risk of default.

OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
8.
Ghana’s financial sector is bank dominated. Commercial banks account for more than
75 percent of total financial sector assets, followed distantly by Rural and Community Banks
(5 percent), while pension funds, the insurance sector and other sectors such as leasing are still at a
nascent stage (Table 1).
9.
The banking sector has grown by almost 60 percent since 2010, with total commercial
banks assets reaching GH¢27 billion in 2012. Foreign banks account for 55 percent of commercial
bank assets, with various banks from Europe, Nigeria and South Africa having established offices in
Ghana. (Appendix 1 shows selected financial indicators in Ghana over time, benchmarked against
what would be predicted using similar characteristics including GDP per capita.)

THE BANKING SECTOR
A. Access to Credit and Banks’ Performance
10.
Access to credit remains constrained and below the potential needs of the country.
Private credit has been stable in recent years at 15 percent of GDP, 3 though deposit mobilization has
improved, with deposits increasing from 20 percent of GDP in 2007 to 24 percent in 2011. Credit
growth accelerated sharply in 2012 at over 40 percent, a rate last observed in 2008. The ratio of
credit to GDP however remains well below values observed in peer countries or predicted by a panel
regression model (e.g. 21 percent predicted for 2011) 4, in part due to the strong growth experienced
in Ghana.
11.
The banking system is diversified and fragmented. Domestic private banks have grown
particularly fast (22 percent of assets compared with 12 in 2005), while foreign banks have
continued to have the largest market share and have gained ground (55 percent in 2012 of assets
compared with 49). The role of public banks is gradually decreasing (23 percent of assets in 2012
compared with 40 percent in 2005). In terms of assets, market concentration remains limited relative
to comparators. The five largest banks control 45 percent of assets and the largest one has a
12 percent market share (after it took over a small public bank) 5. There is no sign of broad market
consolidation, with few mergers, no exits and new domestic and foreign banks still applying for
licenses (most recently, a domestic bank was granted a license in late 2012).
12.
Banks primarily lend to a few large counterparties. Mortgage lending remains
underdeveloped and consumer finance is just starting, with impressive growth observed recently in
a few banks. Available data points to significant concentration of banks’ business. At the end of
September 2012, 55 percent of all loans went to the fifty largest borrowers. Moreover, this high
figure underestimates credit concentration as many institutions implement a value chain approach
and offer credit to large corporates’ employees and suppliers. 6 Detailed information is not available
on loans to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) but most banks mentioned they were only now
preparing to target this market.

3

Variations observed over the period 2007-2011 are partly linked to (i) the restructuring of exposures to Tema Oil
Refinery (credit partly swapped for a government bond) and (ii) the transfer of portfolios of non-performing loans to
(non-bank) special purpose vehicles.
4

In 2011, credit to GDP was 18 percent for the regional median, 32 percent for the income median, 15 percent in
Uganda, 17 percent in Tanzania, 19 percent in Cote d’Ivoire, 24 percent in Mozambique and 30 percent in Senegal.
The panel regression model controls for per capita income, population size, population size and demographic
profiles (see Beck & al., benchmarking financial development, World Bank, 2008).
5

In 2011, Ecobank took over the The Trust Bank, a public bank then controlled by the public pension scheme SSNIT.
The Trust Bank controlled 2.6 percent of bank assets at the end of 2011.
6

“Value chain” refers to all the activities and services that bring a product (or a service) from conception to end use
in a particular industry—from input supply to production, processing, wholesale and finally, retail.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GHANA

13.
Banks’ funding has shifted towards demand deposits, but still exhibits significant
concentration. Customer deposits increased from 58 percent of total liabilities in 2009 to
67 percent in 2012 (with demand deposits increasing 10 percentage points to 41 percent and term
deposits declining 4 points to 13 percent), while deposits from other financial institutions declined.
These gains were achieved in spite of a slow expansion of the branch network (866 in 2012
compared with 784 in 2010). 7 The funding base remains concentrated with the twenty largest
depositors representing 30 percent of all deposits at the end of September 2012.
14.
The cost of credit is high (both in nominal and real terms) and reductions since the
peak observed in 2008-2010 are being reversed. Offered rates on corporate loans have hovered
around 25 percent since 2005 and exceeded 30 percent in 2008-2010. They declined to a low of
24.5 percent in August 2012, when they started to increase again. Rates reached 25.7 percent by the
end of 2012. Similarly, ex post lending rates declined from 25 percent in 2010 to 19 percent in 2011
before increasing again to 20 percent in 2012.
15.
Bank efficiency has improved, but remains poor. Overhead costs to total assets stood at
7.3 percent in 2011 compared to 9.5 percent in 2007. The level observed in 2011 remains
significantly above peer countries and the predicted value. 8 The cost to income ratio is relatively
high (61 percent in 2011), but closer to values observed in peer countries.
16.
The banking industry is very profitable, with exceptionally high returns on average
asset and equity in 2012 (Figure 1). The largest banks exhibit the highest profitability ratios
probably reaping the benefits of economies of scale and being price makers in some markets. The
largest banks also have different business profiles and strategies, reducing the impact of
competition.

7

The four public banks still control a third of all bank branches, with a particularly strong presence in remote areas
for the largest one.

8

In 2011, operational cost to GDP was 4.4 percent for the regional median, 3.9 percent for the income median,
6.5 percent in Uganda, 5.3 percent in Tanzania, 5.6 percent in Cote d’Ivoire, 7.2 percent in Mozambique and
4.4 percent in Senegal. The value predicted by a panel regression model was 4.2 percent.

17.
In 2012, the Bank of Ghana introduced new requirements on credit pricing with the
objective of addressing the high cost of credit in Ghana. It defined how banks should calculate
their own base rate (cost of funding, operational cost, cost of risk and profit margin) and required
that banks do not offer credit below such base rate. So far, the 91-day Treasury bill rate continues to
be for many banks a key determinant in the setting of customer rates.

B. Banking Soundness
18.
While the banking sector has been emerging from a period of strain, areas of
weakness remain particularly amongst the public banks. The sector has experienced periods of
heavy loan losses resulting from poor governance and weak credit standards and banks have been
ill-equipped to address the pronounced economic cycles in Ghana. Performance has been weakest
among the domestic (mostly public) banks, but foreign-owned banks have not been immune. The
BoG has responded by raising bank capital requirement levels—a GH¢60mn minimum paid-up
capital requirement took effect for all banks at the end of 2012. These efforts have borne some fruit
in 2012. However, two medium-sized domestic banks remain weak.
19.
Key indicators of the sector's financial soundness have stabilized over the last year
(see Figure 2), in part due to banks’ strong profitability. The key Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)
reached 18.6 percent at end-2012 (from 17.4 percent at end-2011) as banks not yet meeting the
GH¢60mn requirement raised new capital (all banks were in compliance by the deadline). Nonperforming loans (NPLs) have been gradually falling as a share of the total loans, although only from
14.2 percent to 13.4 percent in the year to end-2012, as have net NPLs (i.e. after deducting
provisions) in relation to capital. By contrast, liquid asset ratios have been worsening slightly, despite
banks' preference for high-yielding government securities, which remain at elevated level

GHANA

(Figure 3). While the system as a whole has strengthened, the position of individual banks still varies
significantly. One bank is in breach of its CAR.

20.
The quality of bank credit needs careful assessment in the context of Ghana's banking
sector. Recent reductions in NPLs reflect in part the sector's rapid credit growth, although
underwriting standards for new loans remain untested. The high share in bank lending of overdraft
facilities, lending by public banks that is influenced in some cases by government priorities, and
loans where servicing is dependent on the performance of government are likely to mask some
forbearance. Banking sector NPLs have been reduced by restructurings of past loans (the two
weaker banks have established asset management companies that are not subject to bank
provisioning requirements). All banks are slow to write-off NPLs, which requires supervisory
approval. The use of stress and scenario testing to identify and respond to vulnerabilities remains
underdeveloped.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GHANA

21.
Improved audit and supervisory work appears to be contributing positively to bank
soundness, as are improvements in banks' governance and risk management. Since 2010, the
BoG has required banks to rotate their auditors and has increased its scrutiny of financial statements
and its challenge to bank management and auditors, and banks seem to be responding to this more
intensive supervision. In addition, many of the weaker banks have restructured their boards,
recruited experienced new senior managers, established risk management units and started to
develop risk practices, particularly for credit.
22.
Banks remain vulnerable to volatility in the economy and financial policies. Banks
noted in discussion the potential for rapid changes in financial conditions, as occurred most recently
in mid-2012. Credit quality is also likely to be adversely affected by the current high interest rate
environment (see Figure 4) and by the government's management of its cash flows, including arrears
financing.

There are several areas of concentrated risk in the banking sector. Banks’ focus on larger
borrowers risks concentrations of loan portfolios (the top 50 borrowers account for over 50 percent
of loans on average). Some banks have concentrated exposures to energy sector borrowers, where
single obligor limits have in some cases been waived by the BoG in the interests of enabling energy
supplies to be maintained. Banks' exposures to other banks are not subject to prudential limits and
can be large. Market and interest rate risks are not subject to comprehensive regulatory
requirements or to strong asset and liability management frameworks yet.
24.
The outlook for the two weak banks is uncertain, creating stability risks. Both banks
require recapitalization, funds for which have not been forthcoming from existing shareholders
(government and SSNIT). Other domestic banks lack the financial strength to support a merger.
Neither bank accounts for more than 3.5 percent of total banking sector assets. However,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

uncertainty over the outlook creates risks to confidence. Orderly resolution and closure are currently
not being considered.

Policy recommendations
For further financial deepening and for the sector to provide greater access to credit, it is important
for the banking sector to be sound and well-functioning. Below are some recommendations to build
such a sector.
•

Address risks posed by the two remaining weak banks as a priority. Where decisions are pending
on potential private sector solutions, other options (including orderly resolution) should be
considered and contingency plans developed; weak banks should not be permitted to expand
their business beyond current levels (see also section V.)

•

Develop further the analysis of NPLs. This could include cross-bank reviews of practices (for
example in relation to claims on government and overdraft lending).

•

Strengthen capacity to identify and respond to emerging risks, including further development of
scenarios and stress testing and closer integration of stability analysis with actions to be taken
by bank supervisors to address risks. The BoG should consider requiring banks to hold
additional capital buffers against a future downturn.

•

Review threats to stability from risk concentrations in the banking sector, including risks related
to claims by banks on other banks (which are not subject to single obligor limits) and exposures
of foreign-owned banks to the groups of which they are a part.

C. Regulatory and Supervisory Developments
25.
The 2011 FSAP made extensive recommendations on strengthening the regulatory and
supervisory framework, but implementation has been patchy. 9 The assessment of compliance
with the Basel Core Principles (BCPs) pointed to many areas where the BoG's powers were
inadequate, for example on consolidated supervision and bank resolution; where regulatory
standards were weak; where the BoG had not set expectations of banks in relation to issues such as
corporate governance; and where effective supervision was being compromised by forbearance. The
FSAP also noted the need to develop crisis management arrangements and to strengthen the safety
net (by introducing deposit insurance). The BoG has been improving supervision processes but has
made limited progress as yet on the FSAP recommendations on regulation and financial stability.
26.
Significant improvements in the BoG's supervisory work provide a basis for the
introduction of risk-based supervision. The BoG has strengthened its offsite supervision with an
9

A summary of progress on implementing the FSAP key policy recommendations is included in the Staff Report.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GHANA

enhanced risk assessment process that addresses key areas of supervisory focus (solvency, liquidity,
earnings, management and sensitivity to foreign exchange risk) and assigns to banks an overall
rating. The BoG is using its new risk assessments to inform its onsite work program. The first
trilateral meetings with bank managements and auditors covered all banks for two years of financial
statements, and these meetings are being used to support the development of a more intensive
style of supervision.
27.
However, this improvement in supervision is not being matched by developments in
regulation. Too much of the burden of effective prudential regulation is being placed on
supervision which requires significant resources, especially given the number of banks in the sector.
The BoG has identified necessary legislative changes including:
•

powers to perform consolidated supervision;

•

further powers to carry out orderly bank resolution;

•

establishment of single obligor limits in relation to banks' exposures to other banks; and

•

introduction of administrative sanctions for defined breaches of requirements without the need
for summary conviction by a court.

28.
The BoG's ability to enforce prudential regulation is currently jeopardized by gaps and
inconsistencies in the law and regulations. Preparation by the BoG of draft legislation and its
submission to the MoF, the first step in the legislative process, has not been completed. The Bank
engaged consultants to undertake the initial drafting, but the work was not undertaken as
contracted, causing significant delay and leading to the BoG requesting technical assistance from
the IMF. The BoG has made progress with the preparation of implementing regulations and
guidelines covering issues such as expectations of external auditors, corporate governance and
outsourcing, but these have not been issued.10
29.
In addition, there are areas where regulations made under existing powers need to be
strengthened:
•

Aspects of the CAR calculation framework are weak (including the 50 percent risk weighting of
export finance highlighted in the FSAP); and the BoG now needs to move away from
emphasizing minimum nominal capital, which is being eroded by inflation, 11 to perfecting its
risk-based framework.

•

The BoG is relying for its bank liquidity regulation on the primary reserve requirements that form
an important part of monetary policy operations; but these are not fit for prudential liquidity

10

Staff did not review draft documents in detail.

11

The new requirement was applied earlier (from 2010) to foreign-owned banks than to others (December 2012),
reflecting the difficulties which the domestic banks had in meeting the requirement.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

GHANA

purposes should be supplemented by new liquidity standards drawing as appropriate on the
Basel III framework. 12
30.
Supervisory effectiveness continues to be impaired by forbearance and distraction
from prudential objectives. While the BoG plans to restrict new waivers from the single obligor
limits to exposures to state-owned enterprises in relation to oil and gas business, banks continue to
have expectations that waivers will be granted at short notice where energy supplies are at stake. In
other areas, effective supervision may be compromised by the elevation over prudential
considerations of wider objectives such as supporting growth in bank lending (the basis for the 50
percent risk weighting for export finance); promotion of bank mergers (the basis for a paid-up
capital target); and policy on state-owned banks.
31.
Ghana continues to lack a comprehensive crisis management plan and full bank
resolution powers. While there has been no bank failure in Ghana since 1999, the authorities have
had to manage stress at banks - relying on extensive informal intervention powers, liquidity support
by the BoG, and various forms of forbearance. The options provided for resolution in the legal
framework remain less than comprehensive. There remains no deposit insurance scheme and no
formal crisis coordinating arrangements. Mechanisms for crisis management have proven effective
in the short term in preventing instability but are informal and rely on government readiness to
provide support that undermines the credibility of alternative approaches, especially the use of
resolution powers. The objectives should be to establish practical arrangements for managing a
crisis, including the definition of roles and responsibilities; and to build credibility that resolution
tools will be used in practice.

Cross border supervision
32.
Ghana has extensive responsibilities as a host supervisor (of foreign-owned banks) and
needs to deepen further its cross-border supervision. Its position creates supervisory challenges,
including where the Ghanaian entity is not seen by the home supervisor to be significant within the
group—likely to be the case for most of the foreign-owned banks in Ghana. This may lead to
restricted information flows. The BoG needs to take particular care proactively to maintain
communication channels with home supervisors. Many of the formal requirements for effective
cross-border supervision are in place—including MoUs with many home supervisors and a
supervisory college for WAMZ supervisors. Onsite supervisory work is being undertaken jointly with
one home supervisor. However, the BoG is not yet engaged in crisis management preparations with
home supervisors or in planning for the implications for its supervision of home supervisors’
recovery and resolution planning.
33.
The BoG is not assessing the risks to banks arising from foreign ownership. Because it
regulates only foreign-owned subsidiaries and not branches, the BoG can impose the same
12

BoG supervisors should also monitor the basis (rates and other conditions such as collateral) on which banks are
accepting term deposits and respond to any outliers.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GHANA

standards as apply to domestic banks and can restrict intra-group exposures in case of weaknesses
in the rest of the group. However, the BoG does not regularly review whether it needs to use its
regulatory or supervisory powers to address risks arising from the parent groups or jurisdictions in
which they operate; and it allows foreign-owned banks regularly to place large balances with
parents and other group members.

Policy recommendations
•

Finalize and issue the draft regulations and other materials which the supervisors have drafted.

•

As the BoG plans, prepare high quality draft legislation to effect the changes to the legislation
needed to strengthen its powers, including enabling it to issue regulations and to impose
administrative penalties.

•

Enhance prudential standards and supervision, especially for the largest banks, seeking in
particular to strengthen capital adequacy and develop full prudential liquidity standards;
establish requirements on corporate governance, risk management and controls; apply
prudential standards to groups as well as individual banks; and limit scope for forbearance.

•

Review supervisory strategies for foreign-owned banks including by assessing the risks in
relation to reliance on home supervisors and how to address these, for example by limits on
bank exposures to their parents and closer cooperation with home supervisors on crisis
management and recovery and resolution planning.

NONBANK FINANCIAL SECTOR
A. Overview of Financial Services
34.
Ghana has other types of financial institutions, besides commercial banks. (See Table 5
for a description of these institutions). The legal status of these institutions varies from formal
(Rural and Community Banks, Savings and Loans); to semi-formal (microfinance companies or
“corporate susus”); and finally, informal and unregulated (individual susu and individual money
lenders).
35.
Access to financial services is low, with only 29.4 percent of adults having an account
at a formal institution in Ghana. Comparatively though, the ratio of banked-to-unbanked adults is
slightly higher than the average for sub-Saharan Africa (24.1 percent).
36.
Although, collectively, these financial institutions have less than 10 percent of the
financial system assets. 13 They serve over 4 million poor—often rural—people. In 2012, 5.8 percent
13

documentation, and interviews with Ghamfin and BSD.

GHANA

of adults had taken a loan from a formal institution, while 3.4 percent had taken a loan from an
informal private lender.
Table 2. Types of Financial Institutions Outside Commercial Banks

Type of institution

Definition and outreach

Savings and Loans (S&L)

Mostly focused on consumer, micro and SME finance in urban areas and
make loans under $15,000. Minimum capital requirement is $3-5 million.

Rural and Community Banks
(RCB)

Small banks owned by individual shareholders, with operations limited to
within 25 miles radius of the bank. The creation of these institutions in the
1970s was encouraged by BOG, taking preference shares in RCBs as a way to
promote financial inclusion in rural areas, and there are 136 RCBs today.
Minimum capital requirement is GH¢. 150 000 Minimum deposit size is GH¢
20 and average lending rates are about 25%. The umbrella association is ARB
Apex.

Credit Unions

Work-place based or community-based institutions.

Microfinance companies (or
“corporate susus”)

Small companies intermediating deposits and loans. These companies have
proliferated without regulation in the years 2000, competing with RCBs with
higher lending rates (which can go above 100% pa) but shorter credit
processes. There are 600 microfinance companies but 173 have obtained a
license. The umbrella association is the Association of Microfinance
companies.

Financial NGOs (FNGOs)

Mission-driven organizations lending external donated funds.

Individual susu collectors

Collect daily savings from customers at their doorstep and return
accumulated amount at the end of the month minus one day's deposit.
Minimum deposit size is GH¢. 1 Some susu collectors have started illegally
providing loans based on these deposits. CGAP estimates that there are
3,000-5,000 susu collectors in Ghana serving over half a million customers,
with a monthly deposit base of at least US$50 million. Their umbrella
association is the Ghana Co-operative Susu Collectors' Association (GCSCA).

B. Rural and Community Banks
37.
RCBs have become a key channel for financial inclusion, though their weaknesses
create significant risks and consolidation is necessary. RCBs have seen 40 percent growth of total
assets in 2012, with 700 branches, and a potentially large customer base. Despite strong total asset
growth, the NPL ratio for RCBs was 20 percent in 2012 which points to persistent weaknesses in the

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GHANA

credit process. Of 136 RCBs, five have not met the required minimum capital and sixteen have a CAR
below the required minimum (10 percent). Consolidation is difficult, however, as registries of
shareholders for many RCBs need to be updated and/or reconstructed.
38.
The BoG supervises RCBs with the assistance of ARB Apex Bank, and realizes that
supervision of RCBs still needs improvement. In addition to providing various services to RCBs
(liquidity management, mobilization of funds, and training), ARB Apex collects data from all RCBs on
a quarterly basis and provides recommendations to the BoG, which could be used when the BOG
staff undertakes an annual onsite supervision at each RCB. The enforcement process, however, is
slow. For instance, two RCBs that ARB Apex had recommended for closure to BOG two years ago are
still not resolved. In the absence of a deposit insurance fund, BOG is reluctant to revoke the license
of the weakest RCBs for fear of affecting negatively the confidence in these institutions, as it
happened in 2003 when the BOG closed three RCBs.

C. Microfinance Services
39.
Guidelines for microfinance institutions issued by BOG in July 2011 have brought
clarity to the microfinance sector, though licensing has been slow. 14 The guidelines clarified the
different categories of players and their scope of authorized activities, and addressed some of the
risks by putting in place capital requirements, operational requirements (corporate governance,
information systems) and exposure limits for deposits and loans (see Table 6). These guidelines
urged all microfinance companies to obtain a license within six months; however, out of 600 MFIs
only 173 have complied and obtained a license.
40.
Moreover, the minimum capital requirement is too small to generate economies of
scale and reduce operational costs, pushing many of them to finance their fixed assets with
deposits. BOG is currently drafting new guidelines to require microfinance companies to comply
gradually with higher capital requirements which could go up to GH¢ 1 million for microfinance
companies with a national branch network.
41.
With effective interest rates that can go above 100 percent per annum, microlending
activities raise concerns of over-indebtedness. In urban areas particularly, customers can borrow
from multiple sources. A credit bureau including RCBs and microfinance companies needs to be
created. Positive steps have been taken in this direction as BOG has engaged with ARB Apex to
integrate RCBs to the credit bureau used by commercial banks. The Ghana Micro Finance Institutions
Network (GHAMFIN) has created a “Reference center”, but the costs of access to information are
perceived too high by microfinance companies.
42.
Many commercial banks are linked to microfinance activities. For instance, HFC Bank has
entered a joint venture with CHF International to establish Boafo Microfinance services; Fidelity Bank
14

See http://www.bu.edu/bucflp/laws/operating-rules-and-guidelines-for-microfinance-institutions/.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

GHANA

provides lending directly to microfinance companies; while Barclays Bank provides lending to the
Ghana Cooperative Susu Collectors Association (GCSCA) which then onlends to susu collectors. The
BOG does not monitor these activities and their associated risks.

D. Mobile Banking
43.
Although mobile phone penetration is over 100 percent, mobile banking has not taken
off in Ghana. Only 1 percent of the population uses a mobile phone to send money compared to
an average of 11 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa. Obstacles to mobile banking development range
from lack of incentives in the regulation which prohibits exclusive partnerships between banks and
mobile network operators (MNO), to the lack of reliability of networks to ineffective advertising from
banks.

E. Insurance
44.
The Ghanaian insurance sector remains small, with low levels of penetration. The
numbers of companies, life and non-life, have not significantly changed since the 2011 FSAP update.
Premium income is growing rapidly, especially in life insurance, but from a low base (total for the
sector was less than GH¢ 650 million in 2011.) Economic growth and the development of oil and gas
are supporting higher demand for insurance. However, penetration (the ratio of insurance premiums
to GDP) remains less than 2 percent. The non-life sector continues to contend with high levels of
premium payment arrears (over 20 percent of assets at end-2011), reflecting intensive competition
(originally related to a surge in new entrants some years ago) as well as poor market practices such
as high levels of credit to customers.
45.
As in banking, there is significant government engagement with insurance.
Government involvement includes state ownership and some government intervention to direct
insurance cover to particular customers, which has been useful. For example, CGAP reports on their
website that one of their evaluation studies shows that in Ghana, insured farmers bought more
fertilizers, planted more acreage, hired more labor, and had higher yields and income, which led to
fewer missed meals and fewer missed school days for the children.
46.
The insurance regulator is seeking to raise standards and address poor practices.
Solvency standards are based on existing EU requirements. The National Insurance Commission is
progressing plans for an overhaul of insurance legislation, including a much increased minimum
capital requirement designed in part to force industry consolidation. The NIC is also setting limits on
credit, introducing corporate governance standards and moving to risk based supervision by 2014.
Prospects for much increased penetration seem poor, given persistent high costs.

Policy recommendations
•

Encourage consolidation among RCBs and resolution of weakest RCBs

•

Accelerate licensing process for microfinance companies

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GHANA

•

Increase minimum capital requirement for microfinance companies

•

indebtedness

ROLE OF THE STATE IN THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
A. Public Banks
47.
The ownership structure of the four public banks brings together diverse public institutions,
with different mandates and objectives. Ghana Commercial Bank (GCB), the largest public bank, is
jointly controlled by the public pension scheme (SSNIT) and the Ministry of Finance (MoF). The
shareholding of Agricultural Development Bank (ADB), the second largest public bank, is split by law
between MoF and Bank of Ghana. MoF and Bank of Ghana also control National Investment Bank
(NIB), while SSNIT is the dominant shareholder of Merchant bank (MBG). Bank of Ghana’s stakes are
held through the Financial Investment Trust (Table 3).

Public banks lost market share, but the two largest remain among the top five banks.
Public banks control over a fifth of assets and credit and a quarter of deposits. Their share of bank
assets in 2012 is slightly more than half what it was in 2005. The staffing and branch networks of the
two largest explain that public banks have a third of all branches and 30 percent of all employees.
They operate with thinner capital buffers than their peers (accounting for 16 percent of banks’
shareholders’ funds (Table 4).

Efforts have been successful to improve the governance of these two public banks and
initiate their financial and operational restructuring. Senior staff with experience in private banks
has been appointed. Initial progress is evident in the risk management and internal control functions
(including policies and procedures) and new systems and tools are being introduced to better
control risk, improve the speed of decision-taking and facilitate the introduction of new products.
Staffing in key control functions often remains insufficient, and additional hiring is contemplated.
The Government restructured most of GCB’s exposure to Tema Oil Refinery (TOR), significantly
improving the bank’s financial structure.
50.
The restructuring of public banks was financed by internally generated funds, as
public shareholders provided only limited financial support. This explains the slow progress
observed in other cases when necessary resources could not be generated considering their weak
financial situation.
51.
Two public banks remain weak, and there are significant downside risks of this
situation continuing. The impact of these two bank (and their groups) continuing without
20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GHANA

resolution is that it prevents stronger banks to gain market share and drive improvements in the
market such as additional credit at lower cost, and part of bank deposits are not allocated in a
productive way (i.e., they finance the carrying cost of past NPLs rather than activities which would
support growth going forward). There are reputational risks to BoG’s credibility from forbearance
due to perceived favoritism, especially when it is a shareholder. There could be further negative
repercussions if there is a loss of confidence in these weak banks that may mean additional fiscal (or
BoG’s) exposures.
52.
Options going forward short of resolution portend distortions and risks. Muddling
through would prevent further gains in financial intermediation; a forced merger with another public
bank is being considered though international experience tends to show that such approaches lead
to much weaker institutions. At the very least any merger should be explored at arm’s length and
involve all potential interested parties; and listing weak institutions on the stock market with still
limited screening capacity and with significant retail investors would pose significant risks going
forward for market development and orderly resolution. Listing should be for sound, transparent
and restructured institutions.

B. Social Security and National Insurance Trust
53.
SSNIT’s size relative to the Ghanaian economy is gradually decreasing. Its contributions
declined following the 2008 reform, which introduced a three-tier pension system and only gave
SSNIT responsibility for the first one (compulsory defined benefit regime). That said, the value of
pensions it pays out has significantly increased in 2012, while some contributions were not paid in
due time. These trends have negatively impacted the size of its investable resources.
54.
SSNIT remains the main local institutional investor, especially for long-term
investments. Its investment portfolio was worth 5.9 percent of GDP in September 2012, though
lower than it was in 2009 at 7.3 percent of GDP. A third of its assets is invested in equity (with banks
representing two thirds of this portfolio), over half in fixed income products (including term lending)
and a tenth in alternative investments (e.g. real estate). Investments and lending are managed inhouse, following an investment policy last updated by the Board in 2010.
55.
SSNIT’s term deposits in the banking system significantly decreased in 2012. It
continues to offer term deposits to banks only at spreads over government bill rates and generally
requires full collateralization with government bills. When placing deposits in banks, SSNIT does not
differentiate among banks, taking the view that if banks they deposit in face problems, SSNIT should
not be affected. Its share of total deposits has significantly declined from 2.1 percent in June 2011 to
0.9 percent in December 2012, partly reflecting the increasing share of demand deposits across the
banking system.
56.
SSNIT retains large equity stakes in banks, but is divesting its controlling shares
gradually. At the end of 2012, SSNIT was the largest shareholder in four banks and had additional

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

GHANA

stakes in five banks. 15 The combined market share of all the banks in which SSNIT had invested in
was 52.8 percent in 2008. SSNIT divested its majority stake in The Trust Bank in 2011 (and took a
minority stake in the bank which absorbed it) and is in talks to do the same in another bank.

C. Independence of the Supervisor
57.
Bank of Ghana (BoG) holds stakes in supervised entities through a trust, which is a
major governance concern. BoG holds stakes in four supervised entities, including two banks.
These investments are held through the Financial Investment Trust (FIT), a trust set up in the early
2000s with BoG as sole beneficiary. FIT is administered by a four-person Board appointed by BoG
and including two of its officials. FIT’s mandates include disposing of BoG stakes in these supervised
entities, but no progress was made in this regard in recent years. 16

D. Policy Recommendations
58.

The Ghanaian authorities should contemplate taking the following measures:

•

Set a cap on the two troubled banks’ balance sheets so as to limit losses and prepare a
structured plan to deal with potential stress in these institutions.

•

Explore options to divest BOG’s shares in all entities that it supervises.

•

Assess as part of BOG’s supervisory process whether high rates paid on term deposits by some
banks reflect liquidity tensions and take action accordingly

•

Define in BOG policies how it would deal with a problem bank where SSNIT has an equity stake,
to ensure it would be treated similarly as others and prevent moral hazard;

•

Assess SSNIT’s investment processes and policies as part the on and off-site supervisory process
of the National Pension Regulatory Authority (NPRA)

15

At the end of 2012, SSNIT was the largest shareholders of MBG (90.2 percent), CAL bank (33.2 percent), GCB
(29.8 percent) and HFC (26.2 percent). It also had stakes in Fidelity (14.9 percent), Prudential (4.7 percent), Standard
Chartered (14.3 percent), SG-SSB (21.6 percent) and Ecobank (13.9 percent).

16

Staff was informed that a stake in HFC bank was disposed off soon after the trust was established.

MONETARY POLICY FRAMEWORK AND
IMPLEMENTATION
A. Inflation Targeting: Challenges and Opportunities

Inflation targeting was formally introduced in Ghana in 2007 to support financial
sector development by anchoring inflation expectations and building confidence. An inflation
targeting framework requires a clear understanding of the monetary policy transmission mechanism
to achieve a target rate of inflation with the use of monetary policy instruments, notably interest
rates. In addition, the traditional channels of monetary transmission through interest rates, bank
lending and asset prices require workable institutional frameworks, functioning money and
securities markets, and a reasonably competitive banking sector where interest rates respond to
changing market conditions and funds are channeled from savers to borrowers as credit to the
private sector at affordable costs.
60.
While many of the elements of a functioning inflation targeting regime are in place in
Ghana, the current policy mix poses challenges. The crowding out of private sector credit as a
result of high interest rates due to large public sector borrowing, amplifies the structural problem
that the level of private sector credit is relatively low, reducing the impact that monetary policy can
have on aggregate demand. In effect, if government demand for borrowed funds raises market rates
above the levels at which it is feasible for the private sector to borrow, private expenditure becomes
insensitive to bank lending rates. In moving forward, there is also room to generally strengthen the
interest rate transmission channel by ensuring that there is an effective policy rate that provides a
meaningful signal for expectations as well as a strong pass-through to market interest rates.

B. Liquidity Management Framework
61.
Although important progress has been made in developing the monetary policy
implementation framework, important challenges remain in the conduct of monetary
operations. The change-over to an inflation targeting framework has not resulted in a more
fundamental change in liquidity management, which continues to be based on reserve money
targeting. Most banks participate in the interbank market, which is predominantly overnight and
securitized. The BoG has at its disposal a broad range of instruments as well as a liquidity
forecasting framework. Payment and settlement arrangements are advanced and an auction market
for treasury securities is functioning well. There are, however, some continuing difficulties with
forecasting government expenditures and no systematic analysis is undertaken of forecasting errors.
Concerns about the cost of sterilization appear to have at times impacted on BoG’s operations to
mop up excess liquidity, and these concerns threaten to undermine the pursuit of BoG’s price
stability mandate. More importantly, interbank rates have deviated from the policy rate by more

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

GHANA

than the targeted corridor, and the policy rate has been overtaken by the Treasury bill rate as the
benchmark for market interest rates (Figure 5).
62.
Monetary policy implementation has been subject to large swings over the last year.
During 2011, monetary policy became gradually looser and interest rates fell to low levels. By early
2012 considerable pressure had built up in the foreign exchange market, and the currency began to
depreciate. The BoG tightened monetary policy by increasing the policy rate and intervening in the
foreign exchange market. In addition, measures directed toward supporting the domestic currency
market were introduced, including changing the denomination of required reserves on foreign
currency deposits from foreign to domestic currency and imposing a 100 percent domestic currency
cover for banks’ vostro accounts. Although the exchange rate was stabilized, interest rates continued
to increase, also driven by increased government borrowing. At the MPC meeting in February 2013,
the policy rate was kept unchanged at 15 percent, while interbank rates hovered around 19 percent
and the rate for 91-day Treasury bills was 23.12 percent in February. 17

For an inflation targeting regime, liquidity management requires a clearer short-term
focus to ensure stability and balance in the market for bank reserves, together with improved
forecasts, and some adjustment of its instruments. In order to stabilize short term interest rates
close to the policy rate, the central bank needs to target banks’ excess reserves, and forward-looking
liquidity operations should aim in the longer run to comply with any target path for other monetary
17

The policy rate determines the interest rates used in the BoG’s open market operations. At the present level of the
policy rate (15 percent), banks may borrow at 17 percent (policy rate +2 percentage points) and place funds at
14 percent (policy rate –1 percentage points); however, only at the discretion of the central bank. Excess reserves are
not remunerated.

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GHANA

variables, such as reserve money. Improved forward-looking liquidity forecasts would include daily
forecasts of excess reserves and composition of reserve money, and forecast error. Moreover, while
the BoG has available traditional instruments of monetary policy, some redesign and adjusted use of
these instruments could be useful for liquidity management including the establishment of standing
overnight lending and deposit at interest rates linked to the policy rate; use of repos and reverse
repos transactions only on the initiative of the central bank and restricted to bank participation; and
an extension of the maintenance period for reserve requirement from one week to at least two
weeks while continuing to allow banks to meet the requirement on average over the longer
maintenance period.
64.
Improved coordination of fiscal and monetary policy will improve liquidity
management and hence, the implementation of monetary policy. The three main areas for
better coordination include having accurate forecasts of government’s cash flows, and in that
regard, improving the new financial systems Ghana Integrated Financial Management Information
System (GIFMIS) , and establishing a Single Treasury Account (TSA) would be essential; having a
clear understanding of cost sharing for the implementation of monetary policy so that cost
considerations do not hamper monetary policy objectives; and given shallow debt markets, it would
be preferable to conduct monetary operations using Treasury bills since the existence of two similar
risk-free instruments—central bank bills and Treasury bills—may hamper market development.

C. Money and Foreign Exchange Markets
Domestic interbank and money market
65.
The interbank money market is becoming fairly active with most banks participating
(Figure 6). The trading is mostly on an overnight and securitized basis, although the larger banks
have established unsecured credit lines with some of their counterparties. Average daily trading
turnover fell sharply between 2006 and 2009 (from GH¢ 322 to GH¢ 77 million), but has gradually
increased over the last years, reaching GH¢ 203 million in 2012. Daily activity is uneven and to a
large extend driven by uncertainty about BoG’s participation.
66.
The primary market for government securities is active. There are regular weekly
auctions, with an issuance calendar published in advance. Prior to April 2011, all 27 banks, as
well as four non-bank financial institutions, were Primary Dealers (PDs). Currently, there are 15 PDs,
who are expected to underwrite the auctions and act as market-makers in the secondary market. In
practice, however, this arrangement is not enforced.
67.
Well functioning money and securities markets would improve the transmission of
interest rates. Starting with the interbank market, the suggested reforms of the central bank’s
liquidity management would give incentives to banks for a more active planning and management
of their own liquidity. Market functioning would also improve if the underlying securities for repos
could be traded, in line with international practice.

Foreign exchange interbank market
68.
The foreign exchange market has grown but it remains small in size and dominated by
a few players. All the 27 licensed banks are authorized to deal in foreign exchange, but only six are
regularly trading and fulfilling their function as market-makers. Daily turnover in the interbank
market increased to USD 20 million during 2012, which was a doubling from the previous year
(albeit from a low level), in part due to exchange rate pressures experienced in the second half of
the year. However, the daily fluctuations in both traded volume and rates are large (Figure 7).

A well-functioning foreign exchange market is important for monetary policy
implementation and financial sector development. Empirical studies have shown that the passthrough to domestic prices from exchange rate changes is strong and rapid in Ghana, which
underscores the link between a stable exchange rate and price stability.18 In an inflation targeting
system, however, it is important that this stability is primarily achieved through appropriate macroeconomic policies and not by directly managing the exchange rate. The effective functioning of the
foreign exchange market with transparent price discovery in the wholesale interbank market and
supportive interventions by the central bank will facilitate risk-taking and confidence by economic
agents.
70.
Interventions in the foreign exchange market should support the achievement of the
BoG’s monetary policy objectives. Given the close link between exchange rate and price
movements in Ghana, a weakening currency could result in a build-up of inflationary pressure and
hence justify BoG’s action. Furthermore, direct interventions in the foreign exchange market can
complement the interest rate transmission channel. However, targeting a particular level of the
exchange rate would be inconsistent with an inflation targeting regime. The BoG may still find it
necessary to intervene in the foreign exchange market to ensure an orderly market, as bulky
transactions in a shallow market could disrupt the market and lead to large swings in the exchange
rate unrelated to economic fundamentals. In these situations, it is important to communicate clearly
the BoG’s objectives and to emphasize that in the context of a floating exchange rate regime the
BoG is not targeting any particular exchange rate level, but intervening to reduce volatility.

D. Policy Recommendations
•

Strengthen the current liquidity management framework by improved forward-looking liquidity
forecasts with focus on banks’ excess reserves and re-design monetary instruments and adjust
their use.

•

Improve coordination between MoF and BoG in the areas of cash flow projections as input to
liquidity forecasts, sharing of costs of monetary policy by agreeing on a binding MOU and the
continued use of Treasury bills as a monetary policy instrument.

•

Establish the operational and legal basis for the use of repos as part of interbank trading and for
use in a broader money market.

•

Communicate clearly to the market when BoG is intervening in the foreign exchange market,
emphasizing that the central bank is not targeting a particular exchange rate level.

•

Continue ongoing measures (such as introducing a screen-based information and trading
system, intervention at quoted market rates, and a Code of Conduct) to strengthen the
operations of the interbank foreign exchange market.

Implementation of Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief (PCDR): Not Applicable
Decision point—point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a country
qualifies for assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of assistance to be
committed.
Interim assistance—amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision and
completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance committed
at the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional circumstances).
Completion point—point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its assistance
committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of interest income as
defined in footnote 2 above. The timing of the completion point is linked to the implementation
of pre-agreed key structural reforms (i.e., floating completion point).
Safeguards Assessment
The Bank of Ghana (BoG) was subject to an update safeguards assessment with respect to the PRGF
arrangement approved on July 15, 2009; the assessment, completed on December 2, 2009, followed
an initial safeguards assessment from October 2003. The update assessment found that while the
safeguards framework of the BoG had been strengthened in several areas, new risks in governance
oversight emerged with the removal of the former Board in January 2009. In March 2010, a new
Board was appointed and the BoG is committed to implementing measures proposed by staff.
Exchange Rate Arrangement
On February 2, 1994, Ghana accepted obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4, of the
Fund’s Articles of Agreement. The exchange rate regime is classified as a managed float. Ghana
currently maintains a multiple currency practice (MCP) subject to Fund approval, whereby the BOG
calculates a reference rate and uses it for certain official transactions without having a mechanism in
place to ensure that this exchange rate does not differ from the rate prevailing in the market by
more than 2 percent. The exchange system is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for
current international transactions. At the end of April 2013, the average exchange rate for
transactions in the interbank market was GH¢1.98 per U.S. dollar.

Article IV Consultation
The 2011 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Accra during Feb 16–Mar 1, 2011. The staff
report (Country Report No. 11/128) was discussed by the Executive Board on May 25, 2011 and is

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. The
quality and timeliness of certain data need to be improved. There are notable deficiencies in the
dissemination of statistical information to the public, although the situation has improved with the
recurrent publication on the Bank of Ghana’s (BOG) website of the Monetary Policy Committee
Statement, Statistical Releases, and economic and financial reports since 2003.
National Accounts: Ghana compiles annual and quarterly estimates of GDP by economic activities
at current and constant (2006) prices following the System of National Accounts 1993 regularly.
Incorporation of latest/updated data sources, changes in conceptual treatment/methodologies and
rebasing of national accounts to 2006 led to a significant upward revision of the estimates of GDP
published in November 2010. In addition, Ghana Statistical Service recently published annual GDP
by expenditure estimates at current and constant (2006) prices for the years 2006-12. Private
consumption expenditure which was estimated as a residual in the old series, has been calculated
directly in the rebased series.
Ghana is one of the countries participating in the Quarterly National Accounts Module of the
Enhanced Data Dissemination Initiative (EDDI) supported by the United Kingdom Department for
International Development (DFID). Four missions have been conducted (September 2010, April 2011,
November/December 2011, and February 2013) under this project. The February 2013 mission
worked towards further improving the methodology of the current and constant price QGDP
estimates by economic activity. In addition, the methodology for each component of the published
annual expenditure estimates was scrutinized and a preliminary methodology for expanding these
to quarterly was developed. The constant price methodology has been improved by introducing
forestry stock changes and extending the range of indicators for measuring cocoa production,
hotels, and air transportation. It is expected that estimates of QGDP by expenditure will be compiled
by mid-2014.
Labor statistics: The scarcity of labor statistics is a cause for concern. Labor statistics are almost
nonexistent, although some wage indicators are available from the Social Security National
Insurance Trust (SSNIT). The Ministry of Employment has been receiving technical assistance from
the United Nations Development Program and the International Labor Organization in the design
and compilation of labor statistics.
Government finance statistics: Steps have been taken to improve fiscal data. The Controller
Accountant General Department (CAGD) currently compiles monthly budget implementation
reports, and the data are available within six weeks, although some factors undermine their
reliability. There is a need for comprehensive and timely reconciliation of monthly treasury data with
bank accounts. To address these shortcomings, the government has formed a committee to define
the nature of “broad” and “narrow” government; moved to a system of immediate booking for
“direct debits” and more frequent reporting of government account balances; and is implementing a
new automated Budget and Public Expenditure Management System (BPEMS). The BPEMS covers
ministries, departments, and agencies. Several GFS missions worked with the authorities to improve
the economic classification of data in accordance with the requirements of GFSM 2001. In 2009, an
STA mission also provided guidance on the compilation of a partial financial balance sheet for

budgetary central government, and proposed that information on debt stocks that is available on a
monthly basis be reported for the inclusion in the International Financial Statistics (IFS).
The coverage of transactions is uneven. There are also difficulties in accounting for expenses paid by
extrabudgetary funds. The operations of special funds, such as the SSNIT (currently regarded as a
public financial corporation by the authorities), the Ghana Education Trust Fund (GETF) and the
District Assemblies Common Fund (DACF), are not yet covered in the fiscal accounts. Although the
majority of local government expenses are directly met from budgetary accounts, the revenue of
local governments and related spending, and transactions financed from the DACF are not yet
covered. Extending the coverage of fiscal data to general government is strongly encouraged.
Comprehensive solutions to some of the data problems may have to await full implementation of
the BPEMS system and incorporation of Fund technical advice. Various missions from FAD have
suggested short-term temporary solutions to alleviate current data quality problems.
Monetary and financial statistics: While BOG has made significant progress on implementing the
previous missions’ recommendations on monetary and financial statistics, continued efforts are
needed to expand the institutional coverage and improve the timeliness of the data reporting.
The June 2011 monetary and financial statistics mission assisted in improving the data mapping for
compiling the standardized report forms (SRFs) for central bank (SRF 1SR) and other depository
corporations (ODCs) (SRF 2SR). BOG has used the updated mapping to compile and report SFR 1SR,
SRF 2SR, and SRF 5SR for monetary aggregates for publication in the IMF’s International Financial
Statistics (IFS). As a result, the data quality has improved. However, data have not been reported
regularly and the timeliness has worsened. Data through October 2012 were published in the April
2013 issue of IFS—a lag of more than six months. The mission also assisted in mapping the
statistical returns for other financial institutions to SRFs with a view to expanding the data coverage.
However, no further progress has been made on including these other financial institutions in the
coverage of monetary statistics.
Debt statistics: The responsibility for external debt recording and payment is divided among three
agencies. The Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MOFEP), through its Aid and Debt
Management Unit (ADMU), maintains the external debt database. It is responsible for recording
debt payment obligations, issuing payment requests, and tracking HIPC debt relief. The CAGD
confirms the legality of the payment and authorizes the release of public funds. It is responsible for
accounting for debt payments and rendering reports to parliament. The BOG as the payment agent
for the government verifies payments made to ADMU and CAGD.
To enable systematic comparison of the budget, the balance of payments and the BOG cash-flow
data, the authorities should clearly identify the government subsectors for which data are reported
and prepare a clear classification of financing, outstanding debt, and guarantees issued.
External sector Statistics: The Balance of Payments Office (BPO) of the Research Department of the
BOG is responsible for the compilation and dissemination of balance of payments and International
Investment Position (IIP) data for Ghana. Ghana participates in the external sector module of EDDI
and has benefited extensively from technical assistance in developing and undertaking enterprise
surveys of cross-border financial flows and stocks (Foreign Assets and Liabilities Survey (FALS)), with
a view to improve the quality of balance of payments statistics and IIP statistics. A major
achievement was the submission of an IIP to the Fund’s Statistics Department (STA) during 2011 for
the period 2006 through 2009 and the data were subsequently published in the March 2011

International Financial Statistics (IFS). However, there are still some challenges to overcome with
respect to the timeliness of the data. Next steps are, therefore, the implementation of a small timely
sample quarterly survey of cross-border capital to overcome the timeliness and quarterly estimates
challenges. Despite the progress achieved in improving the data sources and compilation
techniques, substantial work is still needed to strengthen existing, and develop new data sources to
improve the accuracy and reliability of the current and capital, and financial account. The missions
urged the BPO to work towards closing major remaining data gaps by making the International
Transactions Reporting System (ITRS) a reliable data source to the extent possible, and use it at its
full potential and as a cost-efficient way to receive information for the current, capital, and financial
account. ITRS reporting is being revised to ensure that it serves as: (i) a broad indicator of BOP
current, capital, and financial account transactions; and (ii) a data source for transactions of which
direct reporting is not feasible.
Trade statistics: Currently, the GSS is not publishing timely monthly trade statistics, although the
data are available from the Customs, Excise, and Preventive Service (CEPS). The staff has
recommended that the GSS collaborate with the CEPS to process customs data within six weeks and
with the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MOT) and the BOG to identify and reduce discrepancies in
trade statistics and to ensure that imports into bonded warehouses are not double-counted. Data
collection procedures of the CEPS need to be improved, and there is also room for improving trade
volume data collected by the CEPS through customs invoices, which would help the GSS to extract
meaningful import and export unit values. The May 2010 STA mission found that BPO treats goods
that are temporarily imported into Ghana without passing the customs authorities (i.e. not yet
captured by customs) and then sold to enterprises in the free zone as exports. This treatment would
imply that free trade zones are treated as located outside the Ghanaian economic territory, which
should not be the case.
Fund staff has recommended that the GSS produce export unit values for major export
commodities, such as gold and cocoa. A high coverage of the country’s export bundle can be
obtained from just three major exports—cocoa, gold, and unwrought aluminum. In contrast,
deflation of imports is likely to require an iterative procedure to strike a balance between coverage
of the index and its stability, owing to the heterogeneity of the basket.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Participant in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since July 20, 2005.
III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
STA found some major issues in the March 2010 data for the Central Bank and the February 2010
data for the ODCs that the authorities submitted in April 2010 for publication in the IFS. For this
reason, STA thoroughly reviewed the entire mapping of source data to the SRFs and several
misclassifications were fixed. As a result, the updating of the IFS page for Ghana was resumed in
March 2011 after a long delay. The latest data published in the IFS are for December 2010. Data for
publication in the IFS on international transactions were last reported for 2009, quarterly
government finances for March 2010, and national accounts for 1997. No quarterly balance of
payments data are currently reported for publication in the IFS. The latest available data reported for
publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) are for 2009. However, these data
cover only the cash revenue and expense transactions of the budgetary central government.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Ghana
On June 12, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Ghana. 1
Background
Economic growth continued at a robust pace of 8 percent in 2012 amid rising fiscal and external
imbalances. Fiscal pressures came to the fore in a mounting public sector wage bill and costly
energy subsidies that pushed the deficit close to 12 percent of GDP. The fiscal expansion led to
a significant deterioration in the public debt ratio and contributed to a widening deficit in the
external current account, with the latter also reflecting sizeable foreign direct investment (FDI).
The policy mix deteriorated in the course of 2012. While fiscal policy became increasingly
expansionary, the Bank of Ghana tightened monetary policy in the second quarter of the year to
arrest a rapid depreciation of the cedi. The currency subsequently stabilized, with recent
depreciations in line with inflation differentials, but at the cost of high real interest rates.
Consumer price inflation stayed in the single digits in 2012, helped in part by low food and
repressed domestic fuel prices. With rising core inflation (excluding food and energy) and recent
increases in fuel prices, inflation has moved back above 10 percent.
The growth momentum continues into 2013, with increased oil production projected to keep
overall GDP growth close to 8 percent. Non-oil growth is likely to decelerate, however, as a
result of energy disruptions and high real interest rates. Survey-based inflation expectations
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

remain elevated at above 10 percent. The current account deficit is projected to stay high at
12 percent of GDP, despite a moderation in import growth, reflecting a weaker outlook for cocoa
and gold exports. Staff projects a small reduction in the fiscal deficit to 10 percent of GDP this
year, about 1 percent of GDP higher than the authorities’ budget projections, mainly reflecting
higher cost of energy subsidies.
While Ghana benefits from strong democratic institutions and favorable prospects for oil and
gas, a reduction in macroeconomic imbalances over the medium-term is contingent on
strengthened policies. Non-oil growth is projected to stabilize at a still robust level of 5–6
percent, and inflation should gradually decline as policies are rebalanced. A planned reduction
in the fiscal deficit to about 6 percent of GDP is feasible by 2015, if measures are implemented
as envisaged. This, together with increased oil and gas production from new fields, would
reduce the current account deficit to about 7½ percent of GDP by 2018, financed in large part
by strong FDI.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the great strides Ghana has made in reducing poverty and
reaching lower middle income status. With favorable prospects for oil and gas production and a
supportive business environment, Directors saw strong potential for sustained and inclusive
growth, provided current macroeconomic vulnerabilities are addressed decisively.
Directors were concerned about the reemergence of a large fiscal deficit in 2012, widening
external imbalances, and rising domestic debt, which expose the economy to risks from weaker
terms of trade or reduced capital inflows. In addition, high domestic interest rates, due to
excessive government borrowing, could curtail Ghana’s growth momentum.
Directors underscored the need for decisive action to rebuild fiscal and external buffers and
reduce public debt, and in particular, stressed the importance of regaining control over the
public wage bill. They welcomed the decision to remove fuel subsidies and called for similar
action to adjust electricity prices, as a crucial step to tackle Ghana’s energy supply problems.
Improving revenue mobilization, including implementation of envisaged tax policy measures, is
also a priority. The mid-term policy review would be an opportunity to identify additional
measures to secure the fiscal targets.
Directors saw a need for more ambitious fiscal consolidation over the medium term to ensure
sustainable debt dynamics, allow the buildup of official reserves, and lower the current account
deficit. Realigning public spending from subsidies and wages to investment would also support
future growth. Given the growing reliance on nonconcessional financing, Directors welcomed
the authorities’ efforts to strengthen debt management and investment planning.
Directors supported the maintenance of a tight monetary stance until inflationary pressures
subside and fiscal consolidation is firmly established. They recommended containing monetary
financing of the fiscal deficit, and saw scope for further improvements in the inflation targeting
framework to enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy. This could involve improved

3
forecasting, enhanced communication to the public, and rolling one to two year inflation targets,
to better anchor expectations.
Directors noted that the banking system has grown rapidly and is competitive. They
recommended higher minimum capital buffers to contain vulnerabilities, including the risk of
increasing nonperforming loans. Directors encouraged the authorities to follow through on the
2011 FSAP recommendations by further upgrading financial sector legislation and supervision,
and deepening cooperation with regional counterparts. They also stressed the need to address
the issues pertaining to the remaining weak banks, and advised the Bank of Ghana to divest its
financial stake in the banking sector.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Jafar Mojarrad, Executive Director for Ghana
and Philip Abradu-Otoo, Advisor to Executive Director
June 12, 2013
On behalf of our Ghanaian authorities, we would like to express our gratitude to staff and
management for their continued support to Ghana through policy advice, technical assistance, and use
of the Fund resources. Our authorities appreciate the high quality discussions with Ms. Daseking and
her team during the Article IV Consultations. The authorities broadly agree with staff analysis and
recommendations, which they consider pertinent, and stress the importance of fully taking into
account the challenges of the economic transformation that is currently underway in Ghana.
Overview
The Ghanaian economy has continued along a high growth path in recent years, supported by the
favorable prospects for its oil and gas resources, which have attracted large foreign direct investment
inflows, as well as by the strong performance of the non-oil sector. Ghana’s stellar achievements in
raising per capita income, reducing poverty, and making decisive progress toward a more inclusive
growth are well rendered in the interesting Appendix II. While the country has moved to low-middle
income status, its economy is also undergoing a major transformation, reflecting not only the large
investments in oil extraction and future prospects in this area, but also the growth momentum of the
non-oil private sector, which needs to be supported through public investment in infrastructure,
prudent macroeconomic policies, and further improvement of the business environment. As seen in
similar cases, this kind of transition can generate temporary large imbalances that must be managed
in a manner that facilitates the economic transformation. From this perspective, the newly elected
government believes that macroeconomic policies and structural reforms must also focus on helping
meet the transformation challenges.
Recent economic developments and outlook
In 2012, real GDP grew by 8 percent and was mainly driven by the non-oil sectors, namely
agriculture, industry, and services. Inflation stabilized at 8.8 percent following measures put in place
by the monetary authorities to contain the rapid depreciation of the currency in the first half of 2012.
However, fiscal policy implementation suffered some setbacks as the deficit widened to 12 percent on
account of a variety of exceptional factors, as explained below. The current account deficit
deteriorated further to 12 percent of GDP and gross international reserves remained low at 2.8 months
of import cover. It is important to note, however, that the large current account deficit is closely
associated with sizable foreign direct investment, mainly in the extractive industry, with imports of
capital equipments, machinery, and intermediate goods representing about 70 percent of total imports.
Looking ahead, the outlook for 2013 and for the medium term is favorable. The growth
momentum is expected to be sustained, albeit with some deceleration in the outer years, until
production in new oil fields comes on stream with the non-oil sectors expected to continue to grow
strongly. Inflation is likely to stay around 10 percent in 2013 on account of adjustment of petroleum
prices and expected utility tariff increases, but would stabilize at single digit levels thereafter. The

2
risks posed to the economy from continued imbalances in the fiscal and current accounts are well
understood, and the authorities are committed to addressing them in the current fiscal year and
beyond, as outlined below.
Fiscal Policy
Fiscal policy implementation in 2012 was expansionary and fell short of expectations in an
election year. While the authorities own up to this slippage, they are carefully reviewing all the
factors that led to this outcome. These include: (i) implementation problems associated with the
single-spine wage policy initiated in 2009 to correct distortions in the public sector wage structure,
notably the clearance of 2010-2011 arrears in 2012; (ii) shift from cash to accrual basis (iii)
significant shortfall in grants from donors; (iv) over-estimation of revenues from the oil companies;
(v) larger-than expected petroleum and utility subsidies, and (vi) higher interest cost burden arising
from the steep rise in short term domestic interest rates. Under the circumstances, the authorities
agree that the current stance is unsustainable, and require corrective measures to ensure fiscal
sustainability. A number of short and medium term policies have been initiated to ensure that the
deficit target of 9 percent for 2013 will be reached.
On the revenue side, the main measures being proposed include the re-introduction of the National
Fiscal Stabilization Levy; imposition of a levy on imports; increase in some excise taxes; and review
of fees and charges. Implementation of these measures would generate additional revenue equivalent
to 0.5 percent of GDP. The cabinet has cleared these measures to be submitted for parliamentary
approval.
On the expenditure side, the focus will be to regain control over the wage bill. The cause of the
significant rise in the wage bill in 2012 is still being assessed to provide a better understanding of the
inherent dynamics with the objective of preventing its reoccurrence. Preliminary findings point to the
automatic admission of a large number of health and educational workers onto the pay structure. As
part of the Government’s policy to improve social indicators and achieve the Millennium
Development Goals, a policy of automatic absorption of eligible health and educational trainees was
implemented. Hence, the arrears paid in 2012 relate to both single spine and non-single spine wage
policies. The wage-setting process will be reviewed with a possible shift towards multi-year
agreements that would be negotiated before the budget is finalized. In addition, plans to streamline,
discontinue, or commercialize the activities of subvented agencies are being developed and
implemented, while the biometric registration of their staff and migration to the mechanized payroll
system are being expedited.
Eliminating the fuel subsidy has been a major policy achievement. Ghana’s track record in the
area of energy price reform is well documented in the recent Fund paper on energy price subsidy
reform (SM/13/29, Supplement 1). The authorities have taken further actions since the beginning of
the year to eliminate the subsidy in order to free resources for social and public investment. On
February 17, 2013, prices of petroleum products were adjusted by between 15 and 50 percent, and on
June 1, 2013, further adjustments of between 3 and 5 percent were announced, resulting in a total
elimination of subsidies on petroleum products. With the full phasing out of these subsidies—while

3
retaining the targeted cross-subsidy—the stage is set for implementation of an automatic price
adjustment mechanism beginning July 2013.
The authorities are committed to address the constraints in the energy supply situation and
bring prices to cost recovery levels. While our authorities agree that substantial adjustments are
required, they believe that careful prioritization and timely sequencing of the subsidy elimination
program will be essential. The Public Utilities Regulatory Commission (PURC) has consistently
made the granting of tariff increases conditional on improved services to consumers. With some
improvements in the electricity supply situation, the PURC has begun discussions with the utility
companies with the view to adjust utility prices. Here too, the objective is to institute an automatic
pricing formula once cost recovery is fully achieved.
Further steps are contemplated in the area of public finance management and institutional
fiscal reforms. These include strengthening project selection and prioritization, reviewing rigid
budget allocation rules of statutory funds, monitoring commitments of Ministries, Departments and
Agencies as they arise, and ensuring that existing pipelines of signed contracts are cleared before new
contracts are awarded. As highlighted in the report, the authorities are open to renew the dialogue
over the adoption of a comprehensive fiscal rule, once progress is made in fiscal consolidation.
The updated debt sustainability analysis shows moderate risk of debt distress. The authorities
are determined to take necessary steps to safeguard long-term debt sustainability. To this end, new
non-concessional borrowing will be only for critical projects that comply with clearly established
appraisal guidelines. The Ghanaian authorities plan to implement a self-financing scheme for
commercial loans for projects. Strengthening the Public Private Partnership (PPP) framework for
development will also limit borrowing and reduce debt service costs. In addition, the authorities will
seek to improve the public debt maturity and cost profile by replacing costly short-term borrowing in
the illiquid domestic market by medium-term external borrowing. A planned Eurobond with the size
of up to $1 billion aims at achieving this objective while strengthening the external reserve buffer.
Monetary and Financial Sector Policies
Monetary policy was tightened in the first half of 2012 in connection with rapid exchange rate
depreciation. The Central Bank raised the policy rate three times in 2012 by 250 basis points;
together with additional quantitative measures to mop up excess liquidity and stabilize the cedi, as
highlighted in the report. These measures helped restore stability in the foreign exchange market.
Data for April 2013 show a rise in headline inflation to 10.6 percent, driven in part by the
pass-through of petroleum price increases in February 2013 and aggregate demand pressures. With
the second round of increase in petroleum prices in June 2013, and planned increase in electricity
tariffs, scheduled for the second half of the year, the Central Bank has indicated its readiness to
ensure that inflationary pressures remain contained. At its recent Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)
meeting held on May 22, 2013, the Central Bank further increased its policy rate by 100 basis points
after having assessed that the risks to inflation remained high. In addition, the policy interest rate
corridor was widened at the upper bound by 200 basis points to make it expensive for banks to

4
borrow from the Central Bank and a standing facility was introduced to manage interbank liquidity
more effectively and improve upon the transmission mechanism. The authorities believe that their
experience with inflation targeting has been positive as outlined in Box 3, and will seek to further
strengthen the IT framework in the area of liquidity management and forecasting capabilities. The
authorities have requested Fund Technical Assistance and a joint collaborative effort between the
Fund and the Central Bank is already underway.
On financial sector stability, capital adequacy levels, non-performing loan ratios, and liquidity
buffers have improved, and credit is growing strongly. Despite the sound position of the banks,
challenges remain that would have to be addressed. First, our authorities and staff are in agreement
regarding the risks of crowding out profitable private investment through high lending rates, with
possible adverse effect on NPLs. Further enhancing competition in the banking system and reducing
upward pressure on interest rates through government borrowing will help address this issue. Second,
efforts are underway to update financial laws and regulations and the Central Bank is working to
address existing gaps in this area with Fund assistance. Regarding guidelines for microfinance
institutions issued by the Central Bank in July 2011, the slow pace of granting licenses was intended
to ensure that supervision capacity can meet the increased demand. The Central Bank is currently
expanding and restructuring its supervision department with assistance of a Fund resident advisor.
The expectations are that by the end of the third quarter, the new supervision department would be
created and become fully operational to effectively handle supervision demands of the microfinance
institutions.
Structural Reforms
The authorities remain steadfast in addressing the constraints in the energy sector to keep up
with demand and ensure reliability of energy supply. A hydroelectric dam project initiated in
April 2008 to augment the supply of electricity is on track for completion. The project, estimated at
US$800 million, and designed to have 4 generating power units, is expected, upon completion, to
generate 404 megawatts of electricity, one of which has been completed and commissioned in May
2013. The other three units are scheduled to come on stream by November 2013. The completion of
the hydroelectric dam projects in November 2013 and restoration of natural gas to power a key
thermal plant would elevate the total power supply by 560 megawatts and improve overall reliability
of energy supply.
Commendable progress has been made in improving Ghana’s business environment, as evidenced by
the World Bank “Doing Business” and governance indicators. Further efforts will seek to streamline
procedures, improve access to credit, and remove infrastructure and energy related impediments to
investment and growth.
On social issues, our authorities welcome the report’s findings, which attest to Ghana’s progress on
improving per capita income and living standards, reducing poverty and income inequality, and
building strong foundations for higher and more inclusive growth. The authorities are determined to
work further to improve job prospects, strengthen social safety nets, and improve the quality of social
spending, particularly in health and education.

Conclusion
The Ghanaian economy is undergoing a critical phase of its transition to full-middle income status,
with important future changes in its economic structure and drivers of growth. The authorities are
aware of the challenges involved in this kind of transition and intend to manage them in a way that
would sustain the investment and growth momentum while achieving macroeconomic stability. The
authorities are appreciative of their engagement with the Fund and continue to attach high value to its
policy advice and technical assistance.
