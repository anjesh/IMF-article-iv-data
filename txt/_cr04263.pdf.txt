JAMAICA
Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2004 Consultation with Jamaica
Approved by Caroline Atkinson and Matthew Fisher
July 19, 2004

• Discussions: A staff team comprising Antônio Furtado (Head), Wendell Samuel, and Yan Sun
(all WHD); Emanuele Baldacci (FAD); and Inutu Lukonga (PDR) held discussions in Kingston
during May 25–June 4. The mission met with Finance Minister Omar Davies, Bank of Jamaica
Governor Derick Latibeaudiere, Financial Secretary Shirley Tyndall, other senior officials, opposition
leader Edward Seaga, and representatives of labor and the private sector. Mr. Ian Bennett,
Mr. Richard Campbell, and Ms. Emma Cunningham (OED) attended the policy discussions
• Intensified surveillance: The authorities have requested intensified surveillance of the mediumterm economic strategy they have formulated, which has not been negotiated with Fund staff. In this
context, semi-annual interim staff reports are expected to be prepared for the information of the
Executive Board between the annual Article IV consultations, the first of which following a mission
that is scheduled to visit Jamaica next fall. During the discussions, the authorities were encouraged to
publish the Article IV reports and the interim reports.
• Political setting: The People’s National Party, led by Prime Minister Patterson, won a fourth
consecutive term in office in October 2002, with a reduced but still comfortable majority. However,
in municipal elections held in June 2003, the opposition Jamaica Labor Party won control of 12 of
14 municipal councils (it controlled none before). The authorities have been trying to forge a broad
consensus on economic adjustment and reform policies through consultations with trade unions and
the business community.
• Last Article IV consultation: At the Board discussion of June 9, 2003, Directors expressed
concerns about the high levels of the fiscal deficit and public debt, and recommended a strong
fiscal adjustment effort to reduce vulnerabilities associated with the large debt burden. Directors
recommended greater flexibility in the management of the exchange rate, along with an acceleration
of structural reforms.
• Exchange system: Jamaica has accepted the obligations of Article VIII. A multiple currency
practice remains, which is subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII. Relations with the Fund
are detailed in Appendix I (and those with other IFIs in Appendices III–V).

-3EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

The authorities succeeded over the past year in stabilizing the economy and
improving market confidence, despite Jamaica’s extraordinarily high public
debt burden. Following a near crisis in early 2003, the foreign exchange market
stabilized, inflation decelerated, domestic interest rates declined, and growth
improved, while Jamaica returned to the international capital market. Although the
external environment was favorable, a key contributor to this outcome was the
government’s renewed fiscal adjustment effort. The primary budget surplus reached
11 percent of GDP, while the public debt ratio declined slightly, to 145 percent of
GDP. Bank soundness indicators have remained favorable.

•

In the context of the authorities’ request for intensified surveillance, the
discussions centered on their strategy aimed at a gradual reduction in the debt
ratio, through an ambitious and prolonged fiscal adjustment. The authorities’
fiscal strategy calls for reducing the fiscal deficit in FY 2004/05, balancing the budget
in the next fiscal year, and maintaining small overall surpluses thereafter. These
objectives are predicated on primary surpluses of about 14 percent of GDP over the
medium term. The public debt would decline gradually to just above 100 percent of
GDP by FY 2008/09.

•

While supporting the authorities’ fiscal consolidation efforts, the mission
underscored the need for structural reforms to mitigate implementation risks,
reduce vulnerability to shocks, and in particular to promote higher growth. As
the staff’s projections point to a gap of about 1½ percent of GDP relative to the
authorities’ balanced-budget target for FY 2005/06, the mission encouraged the
government to move quickly to identify policies to close this potential gap. The
mission welcomed the authorities’ plans for a major tax reform and encouraged them
to proceed with efforts to improve tax administration, rationalize government
employment, and improve the public expenditure management system. The social
safety net should be strengthened to mitigate the short-term social impact of the fiscal
adjustment and related reforms.

•

The current level of the exchange rate appropriately reflects market forces.
While the authorities have not been intervening in the foreign exchange market, the
exchange rate has remained quite stable, despite a substantial decline in domestic
interest rates. The mission supported a flexible and balanced use of monetary and
exchange policies. It cautioned, however, that these policies will remain constrained
by the size of the public debt and the high share of variable rate and foreign currencylinked debt.

•

The mission stressed the mutually reinforcing links between higher growth and
achieving greater debt sustainability. The authorities concurred that a host of
structural and social weaknesses still discourage private investment and hamper
external competitiveness and limit Jamaica’s growth potential. In the period ahead,
they will focus on further trade liberalization, addressing remaining vulnerabilities in
the financial sector, reducing labor market rigidities, improving the education system,
and combating crime.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Jamaica has a history of high public indebtedness, with large swings in the
public debt-to-GDP ratio. After exceeding 120 percent of GDP in the late 1980s, the public
debt was reduced to 80–90 percent of GDP in the mid-1990s. This reflected sustained overall
fiscal surpluses under Fund programs, with primary surpluses exceeding 10 percent of GDP
for five consecutive years. However, a subsequent return to fiscal deficits, and a major bailout of domestic financial institutions that cost approximately 40 percent of GDP, led to a
rebound in the public debt ratio (Figure 1).
2.
Jamaica’s growth performance has been generally poor. While liberalization and
structural changes during the last decade have resulted in more openness and marketorientation, economic growth has been anemic, averaging around 1 percent during 1990–
2002. The major impediments to growth have been the crowding out of the private sector and
deterioration in economic infrastructure associated with high fiscal deficits and public debt;
weaknesses in the financial sector, culminating in a major banking crisis in the mid-1990s;
rigidities in the labor market; and a high incidence of crime.
3.
Fiscal slippages and a worsening external current account position led to acute
pressures in the foreign exchange market in FY 2002/03 and early FY 2003/04.1 From
March 2002 to June 2003, the cumulative reserve loss amounted to about US$800 million
(about 40 percent) while the currency depreciated against the U.S. dollar by 24 percent
(Figure 2). In response, the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ) sharply increased interest rates on its
open market instruments to around 35 percent. Higher interest rates and depreciation
contributed to a marked increase in the public debt-to-GDP ratio, which peaked at
146½ percent in FY 2002/03. Inflation also accelerated, affected by the high exchange rate
pass through.
4.
Fund surveillance has focused on the need for policies to contain Jamaica’s large
public debt burden and to achieve sustained higher growth over the medium term. The
authorities’ views mostly coincided with those of the staff, as reflected in agreements on staff
monitored programs (SMPs) that spanned the period FY 2000/01–FY 2002/03. However,
progress in implementing agreed policies has been uneven, reflecting policy slippages and
negative external shocks. In particular, fiscal deficit targets were missed on account of
overruns in the wage bill and other current expenditure, as well as higher interest outlays.
Moreover, much of the fiscal adjustment undertaken in recent years has relied heavily on
distortionary tax increases and unsustainable cuts in capital expenditure.

II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
5.
Following the near crisis in the first half of 2003, the authorities have succeeded
over the past year in stabilizing the economy and restoring market confidence. The
foreign exchange market stabilized in mid-2003, inflation has decelerated, domestic interest
rates have declined, and growth improved, while Jamaica has returned to the international
capital market. Although the external environment was favorable, a key contributor to this
outcome was the government’s renewed fiscal adjustment effort in FY 2003/04. In particular,
the increase in the primary fiscal surplus, reflecting both expenditure savings and revenue
measures, allowed the budget deficit target to be met despite higher-than-budgeted interest
payments.
6.
After more than a decade of virtual stagnation, real GDP growth reached
2 percent in FY 2003/04 (Table 1). The improvement was led by strong performance in the
key tourism and mining sectors. The agricultural sector rebounded from the effects of
widespread flooding in the previous year, and utility, communication, and financial sectors
also turned in good performances. Reflecting the significant exchange rate depreciation in
late 2002 and early 2003, as well as the impact of tax measures introduced with the
FY 2003/04 budget, twelve-month (as well as year-on year) inflation increased to double
digits. However, annualized monthly inflation has declined to single digits in recent months.
7.
In FY 2003/04, the government contained the budget deficit in relation to GDP
slightly below the preceding year’s outturn, despite a much higher interest bill. The
primary surplus (excluding privatization-related receipts) increased by 4 percentage points of
GDP, to 11 percent of GDP, compared to 7 percent of GDP in FY 2002/03 (Table 2).2
Revenue increased by about 2 percentage points of GDP, to 30 percent of GDP, reflecting
higher receipts from the general consumption tax, personal income tax, and taxes on interest
as a result of measures introduced in the FY 2003/04 budget, as well as the imposition of an
import surcharge. Primary expenditure declined by 2 percentage points, to 19 percent of
GDP, as cuts in nonwage current spending and capital outlays were implemented.3 While the
deficit was initially financed largely from domestic sources, the government was able to
secure, towards the end of the fiscal year, foreign currency financing of around

2

In the authorities’ presentation of the fiscal accounts, the FY 2003/04 capital revenue
includes J$4 billion that originated from the sale of future privatization receipts associated
with sale of intervened financial institutions in previous years.
3

Regarding other fiscal operations, extra-budgetary expenditure declined to 2 percent of
GDP reflecting lower central bank losses and broadly unchanged expenditure through the
deferred financing scheme. Taking such expenditure into account, the overall government
deficit narrowed by 1½ percentage points of GDP, to 9.3 percent of GDP. Meanwhile, the
consolidated overall surplus of the major public sector bodies improved to 1.7 percent of
GDP in FY 2003/04. Except for significant losses of National Water Commission (NWC),
most other large entities delivered good results last year.

-8US$450 million (including a €200 million Eurobond issue in February 2004).4 The public
debt ratio declined slightly, to 145 percent of GDP.5
8.
Monetary policy has continued to rely on open market operations guided by
inflation and NIR objectives. Following the sharp increase in interest rates on its open
market instruments at the end of FY 2002/03, the BOJ has substantially reduced its interest
rates to 14–17 percent by June 2004—less than half the March 2003 peak. Nonetheless,
given improved confidence, the BOJ succeeded not only in rolling over maturing CDs, but
also in mopping up additional liquidity, associated mainly with government external
borrowing. The resulting contraction in the central bank’s NDA contained base money
growth at about 11½ percent while providing room for a partial recovery in NIR during
FY 2003/04 (Table 4).
9.
Developments in the banking system have reflected improved confidence. Broad
money growth exceeded that of nominal GDP, with a significant buildup in foreign assets
(Table 5). Private sector credit, mainly to the tourism and telecommunications sectors,
showed strong recovery after a prolonged post-financial crisis slowdown. Bank soundness
indicators continued to improve: the percentage of past due loans stands at 3 percent, while
provisioning for loan losses, capital adequacy, and profitability remain well above minimum
international standards (Table 6). While deposit dollarization increased somewhat,6 banks
have maintained a roughly balanced foreign exchange position.7
10.
The external current account deficit narrowed by 4 percentage points of GDP to
11 percent of GDP in FY 2003/04 (Table 7). Tourism completed its recovery and alumina
exports rose in the context of capacity expansion, increased international demand, and better
export prices. Agricultural exports experienced a weather-related improvement while

4

This bond issue had a five-year maturity and a yield of 10.5 percent. More recently, the
government issued a €200 million Eurobond with an eight-year maturity and a yield of
11 percent.
5

Over 50 percent of the total debt is in foreign currency or indexed to the U.S. dollar, while a
further 25 percent consists of variable-rate instruments linked to the six-month Treasury bill
yield (Table 3).
6

Interest rates on local currency time deposits have remained in the 8–9 percent range, even
during the period of rapid depreciation and high inflation in the first half of 2003, compared
with 5–6 percent on foreign currency deposits. Lending rates in local currency also remained
stable. Meanwhile, rates offered by securities dealers, whose very large funding base is more
interest-sensitive, paralleled the BOJ policy rates.
7

Banks have continued to use their foreign currency resources primarily to invest in
government dollar-denominated debt and to lend to private sector clients with foreign
exchange revenue.

-9reported remittances also rose.8 Imports declined reflecting currency depreciation and the
winding down of investments in the telecommunication sector.9
11.
The exchange rate of the Jamaican dollar has continued to be determined in an
interbank market that is free of restrictions on current payments, and in the context of
an open capital account. The exchange rate has remained around J$60 per U.S. dollar over
the past year, in the context of declining domestic interest rates and broadly unchanged
official international reserves. The real effective exchange rate has risen somewhat following
the steep depreciation in late 2002/early 2003, but remains well below its range in the sixyear period through 2002 (Figure 3).
III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
12.
In the context of the authorities’ request for intensified surveillance, the
discussions centered on their strategy for bringing down the public debt-to-GDP ratio,
the major vulnerability to Jamaica’s economy. The mission emphasized that a serious
attack on the fiscal deficiencies was also key to promoting growth. The authorities are aware
that Jamaica’s extremely high levels of public debt, coupled with high exposure to interest
and exchange rate volatility, constitute an impediment to rapid growth as well as threatening
the stability of the economy and the financial sector. It is with this in mind that they have
embarked on a strategy, of ambitious and prolonged fiscal adjustment, aimed at a gradual
reduction in the debt ratio. They continue to rule out seeking a rapid reduction in the debt
ratio through a comprehensive debt restructuring involving a substantial cut in NPV. The
authorities believe that such a debt restructuring would be highly detrimental both in its
immediate impact on the economy given the large holdings of public debt by the financial
system10 and because of the damage it would inflict on Jamaica’s access to international
capital markets.

8

Remittances are believed to remain underestimated, partly due to misclassification of
capital inflows.
9

A change in government guidelines on duty concessions to public sector workers for motor
vehicle imports also contributed to the decline in imports.
10

About 70 percent of the total public debt is held domestically, including an estimated
10 percent in residents’ holdings of global bonds. The financial system holds close to threequarters of the domestically issued debt plus some of the residents’ holdings of global bonds.
Thus, 50–55 percent of total public debt is held on the balance sheet of the financial system,
about one-half of which by securities dealers. The externally held debt (about 30 percent of
GDP) is roughly equally split between official and commercial creditors.

While supporting the authorities’ fiscal consolidation efforts, the mission
underscored the need for structural reforms to mitigate implementation risks and
reduce vulnerability to shocks, as well as to promote higher growth. The mission
indicated that it shared the authorities’ concerns over the potentially disruptive effects of a
debt restructuring. However, it stressed that the authorities’ strategy required structural
reforms in the fiscal area to help mitigate the major implementation risks involved in
targeting very high primary surpluses for an extended period. The mission noted that the
economy will, in any case, remain vulnerable to shocks over the medium term because of the
elevated public debt ratio, large gross financing requirements,11 and high degree of
indexation of the domestic debt to the U.S. dollar and to short-run interest rates. The high
public debt will also imply a continued vulnerability for the heavily exposed financial
system. Furthermore, although the envisaged fiscal consolidation and reduction in the debt
burden will improve the environment for private investment, it will limit the government’s
ability to spend on social programs and infrastructure without a major additional revenue
effort. In this context, the staff urged the authorities to take steps to raise Jamaica’s growth
potential through reforms to promote private sector initiative and reduce impediments to
investment and employment, including tax and labor market reforms.
A. Fiscal Policy Framework
14.
The authorities’ fiscal strategy calls for balancing the budget by FY 2005/06, and
maintaining small overall surpluses thereafter in order to bring about a sustained
reduction in the debt ratio. This strategy is predicated on primary surpluses of about
14 percent of GDP over the medium term. On this basis, the public debt would decline
gradually to just above 100 percent of GDP by FY 2008/09. As a first step, the government is
targeting a reduction in the budget deficit to below 4 percent of GDP in FY 2004/05, in the
context of a macroeconomic program whose objectives include real GDP growth in the range
of 2–3 percent, a reduction in twelve-month inflation to single digits, and maintenance of
broadly unchanged NIR. The public debt ratio is projected to decline by 8½ percentage
points of GDP in FY 2004/05, to 136½ percent of GDP.12
15.
The targeted reduction in the budget deficit in FY 2004/05 would be achieved
mostly through an increase in the primary surplus. The primary surplus is expected to
rise by 2.7 percentage points of GDP, to 13.8 percent of GDP. Budgetary revenue is
projected to increase by 1.9 percentage points of GDP, reflecting stepped-up collection of
arrears (1.0 percent of GDP), expected grant disbursements from the EU (0.7 percent of
GDP), and the full-year impact of measures introduced in the FY 2003/04 budget
(0.2 percent of GDP). Primary expenditure is projected to decline by 0.8 percent of GDP. In
11
12

The gross financing requirement for FY 2004/05 is estimated at 31 percent of GDP.

Extra-budgetary expenditure is projected to rise by 1 percentage point of GDP, to 3 percent
of GDP in FY 2004/05, before declining over the medium term. The bulk of this expenditure
is related to central bank losses (2.7 percent of GDP in FY 2004/05), which are expected to
decline over the medium term reflecting lower domestic interest rates and higher
international reserves (see Table 2).

- 12 particular, reflecting the wage moderation agreed under an Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) with the trade unions,13 the wage bill is projected to decline by 1.1 percentage points
of GDP (to 11.3 percent of GDP).14 The budget provides some room for an increase in public
investment. The interest bill is projected to decline only slightly as interest payments on
certain debt instruments will continue to reflect high interest rates that prevailed last year.
16.
The mission expressed the view that the fiscal targets for FY 2004/05 appear
ambitious, but achievable with a determined policy effort. A successful fiscal outturn will
hinge on unwavering efforts at tax collection, including the collection of tax arrears
(particularly from larger tax payers), and expenditure control, especially considering
potential pressures on expenditure from sustained high oil prices.15 The latter could have
implications for implementation of the MOU with the trade unions, strict adherence to which
is critical for the achievement of the fiscal targets. Priority expenditures, including on the
social sector (particularly education-related), should be protected.
17.
Regarding the medium term, however, the mission’s projections pointed to the
need for additional measures to secure the authorities’ budgetary targets. The shortfall
relative to the target, on the basis of unchanged policies, partly reflects the non-recurrence of
one-off factors included in this year’s revenue projections (foreign grants and tax arrears). In
addition, the mission projected somewhat higher interest expenditure than the authorities, on
account of a slower assumed decline in interest rates. As a result, a gap of about 1.7 percent of
GDP would emerge in FY 2005/06 relative to the authorities’ balanced-budget target (see
Table 2). The mission encouraged the government to move quickly to identify policies to
close this potential gap, for example in the context of the forthcoming tax reform. The
authorities indicated that they expected to continue to collect tax arrears in FY 2005/06, and
that, in any event, they would keep the fiscal outlook under review and stood ready to take
measures to ensure achievement of the medium-term budgetary targets.
18.
More fundamentally, the mission underscored that it would be unprecedented for
a country to sustain, for a protracted period, the stringent fiscal discipline envisaged by
the authorities. In view of the major implementation risks to their fiscal strategy, the mission
encouraged the authorities to elaborate a comprehensive fiscal reform agenda to strengthen the
budgetary outlook. In particular, the envisaged reduction in the wage bill, by 3 percentage
points of GDP over the medium term, will need to be underpinned by policies to rationalize
government employment and thus solidify the savings achieved through the recently agreed
two-year wage restraint.

13

The MOU caps annual wage increases at 3 percent for two years.

14

Adjusted for a budgeted payment of arrears on wage-related payroll contributions, the
decline in the wage bill would be 1.7 percentage points of GDP.
15

The pricing mechanism for petroleum products permits an automatic pass-through of
higher import prices.

- 13 Fiscal reforms
19.
While revenue collection in Jamaica is at levels comparable to other middleincome countries, important distortions are present in the tax system. Reforms
introduced in the late 1980s resulted in a simple system with broad consumption and income
tax bases and few rates. However, over time, the system has become more complex, on
account of a series of ad-hoc measures and exemptions. Against this background, the
government plans to reform the tax system in the context of next year’s budget with a view to
increasing its efficiency and equity. The mission advised that the authorities design the tax
reform in a manner that helps achievement of the balanced budget target for next year, and
provides for a stable ratio of tax revenue to GDP over the medium term.16 The mission also
suggested the removal of the many exemptions that narrow the consumption tax base and the
elimination of reduced rates and other features that complicate the tax system.
20.
Revenue administration has been strengthened through recent major reforms
and remaining weaknesses are being addressed. The recent reorganization of the revenue
administration department along functional lines has improved audit and assessment
functions, in combination with the development of an integrated tax administration computer
system. In the area of customs administration, recent reforms introduced service automation
and online payments of duties and taxes, quality control systems, more efficient goods
clearance procedures (based on risk assessment of goods to be inspected and fast-track
release for compliant importers), and electronic links with tax administration. The authorities
were of the view that these measures had played an important role in the increase in revenue
to GDP in FY 2003/04. During FY 2004/05 the authorities plan to establish a comprehensive
tax arrears collection plan with specific annual targets; strengthen the monitoring of arrears
collection; and review the related administrative procedures. The mission encouraged the
authorities to proceed with these reforms and to focus the tax arrears collection efforts on
larger taxpayers.
21.
The government intends to advance reforms in the public expenditure
management system over the medium term. The plan for the current year is to extend
modernization measures implemented in the pilot ministries to the rest of the central
government. These measures aim at establishing output-based budgeting, and linking salary
increases to performance by the end of this fiscal year, and moving toward accrual
accounting over a three-year period. In addition, the authorities plan further to strengthen the
cash management system. The mission noted that, while these measures are important, they
would require adequate time and resources to be implemented; and that emphasis should also
be given to strengthening reporting of public enterprise finances and contingent fiscal
liabilities.
22.
Effective public expenditure allocation is constrained by the size of the wage and
interest bills, which, together, represent over 80 percent of budgetary expenditure.
Spending on wages exceeds 12 percent of GDP, while capital outlays are comparatively low.
16

The medium-term projections show a decline in the tax revenue-to-GDP ratio (see
Table 2), reflecting lower receipts from the tax on interest income as the government’s
interest bill declines in relation to GDP.

- 14 This reflects, in large part, high public sector employment levels. The MOU will reduce
public sector wage growth in the period April, 2004 to March 2006—by freezing
employment and capping nominal public sector salary increases below inflation. It also calls
for a modernization and rationalization of public sector activities but no specific plans have
been prepared so far. The mission urged the authorities to use the opportunity provided by
the MOU to rationalize public sector employment concurrent with wider structural reforms
aimed at fostering private sector activity. At the same time, the social protection system and
the social safety net should be strengthened to mitigate the short-term social impact of these
measures.
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
23.
The BOJ indicated that it will continue to rely on open market operations to
target a base money growth compatible with its inflation and balance of payments
objectives. In this connection, the BOJ will operate on the assumption that the demand for
broad money (M3) will grow in FY 2004/05 at least in line with nominal GDP. Taking into
account the fiscal outlook, this would provide resources for continued strong growth in credit
to the private sector. The BOJ’s NIR target for end-March 2005 is US$1.4 billion—
somewhat less than the March 2004 level, which reflected recent external bond placements in
anticipation of upcoming debt repayments.17 On the further assumption that the demand for
base money will parallel that for M3, the BOJ has set an NDA target whose achievement will
require only a small increase in the stock of open market instruments. This would facilitate
some further decline in interest rates on open market instruments. The BOJ indicated that it
will exercise flexibility in its conduct of exchange rate policy, and believes that the monetary
projections are consistent with a roughly unchanged real effective exchange rate.
24.
The authorities’ NIR target is consistent with a projected widening in the
external current account deficit in FY 2004/05. Historically, Jamaica’s current account
deficit has been large, reflecting imports for the tourism and mining sectors, which have been
financed largely by foreign direct investment in these sectors. In FY 2004/05, the current
account deficit is projected to widen by 2½ percentage points of GDP (13.2 percent of GDP),
reflecting mainly a higher oil import bill and an increase in the expatriation of profits and
dividends.
25.
The mission supported the authorities’ inflation and NIR objectives, and
recommended a flexible and balanced use of monetary and exchange policies. The
mission welcomed the fact that, over the past year, the exchange rate had continued to be

17

The authorities’ NIR target for FY 2004/05 is equivalent to about 40 percent of broad
money and is consistent with gross reserves of 12 weeks of imports, or about 70 percent of
the government’s short-term debt obligations.

- 15 market-determined,18 and that the authorities had refrained from intervening in the market
while substantially reducing interest rates. Looking ahead, the mission emphasized that, in
the event of pressures on international reserves, the available policy instruments should be
activated early on, as the room for intervention remained limited. The mission cautioned,
however, that the debt overhang will continue to serve as a constraint on monetary and
exchange rate policy. Given the size of the public debt and the share of variable rate and
foreign currency-linked debt, changes in interest rates or the exchange rate could have a
substantial adverse impact on the debt dynamics. The authorities indicated that their policy
stance for the period ahead was broadly in line with the approach suggested by the mission of
using what flexibility they had to raise interest rates and allow the exchange rate to
depreciate in the event of pressures in the foreign exchange market.
C. Structural Reforms and Social Issues
26.
The mission stressed the mutually reinforcing links between higher growth and
achieving greater debt sustainability. The authorities noted that Jamaica had, over the
years, undertaken several important structural reforms with direct macroeconomic relevance,
including trade liberalization and financial sector deregulation. They concurred, however,
that a host of structural and social weaknesses still discourage private investment and hamper
external competitiveness and limit Jamaica’s growth potential. In addition to the fiscal
reforms discussed above, the authorities will focus in the coming period on reforms relating
to trade liberalization, the financial sector, the labor market, the education system, and
domestic security.
27.
The authorities plan to pursue further regional integration and trade
liberalization in the context of CARICOM, the FTAA, and the WTO. The process of
trade liberalization started in the mid-1980s, and Jamaica has removed all quantitative
restrictions and reduced in stages the maximum common external tariff on non-agricultural
products, under the aegis of CARICOM, to 20 percent by January 1999.19 The government is
putting the necessary administrative structures in place to be in a position to comply with
future FTAA obligations—the Fair Trading Commission; the Anti-dumping and Subsidies
Commission; and the Jamaica Intellectual Property Office. The authorities indicated that the
planned removal of the EU preferential regime for exports of sugar and bananas from the
Caribbean region will have a relatively minor impact on Jamaica, given the small share of
18

Jamaica continues to maintain a surrender requirement under which authorized foreign
exchange dealers and cambios are required to sell 5 percent of their gross purchases of
foreign exchange to the BOJ (see Appendix I). A review of daily exchange rate data for
FY 2003/04 indicates that the surrender mechanism continued to give rise to a multiple
currency practice subject to Fund jurisdiction. While concurring with the authorities that the
foreign exchange market is not materially affected, the mission encouraged them to consider
removal of the surrender mechanism. The mission indicated that, in the absence of a
timetable for removal, the staff would not recommend Fund approval of the resulting
multiple currency practice.
19

The average tariff rate is 10 percent, and the trade regime’s overall rating is 5 on the IMF’s
10-point index of trade restrictiveness (with 10 being the most restrictive).

- 16 these commodities in the country’s exports. Nonetheless, the government is taking steps to
increase productivity in these sectors, with financial assistance from the EU.
28.
The authorities intend to strengthen the regulatory framework for the financial
sector, in particular the prudential framework for securities dealers. The financial
system in Jamaica is relatively large and there are gaps in the related supervisory and
regulatory framework. While supervision of the banking system and bank soundness have
improved significantly since the 1996–97 financial sector crisis, securities dealers remain
vulnerable to interest rate and liquidity risks. This is a concern because the securities industry
intermediates retail funds which are very large in relation to its capital base and that exceed
the deposit base of the banking system. The Financial Services Commission is at an
advanced stage of preparation of prudential requirements for securities dealers, including
capital adequacy and margin requirements that would provide a cushion against such risks.
Against this background, the mission welcomed the government’s recent request for
participation in the joint IMF/World Bank Financial Sector Assessment Program, work on
which is scheduled to start in early 2005. In addition, a new Pensions Act to regulate and
facilitate private pension schemes has been passed by the lower house. In the area of
AML/CFT, the authorities have outlined a legislative agenda which includes the enactment
of a CFT bill, as well as statutes dealing with enhancing the AML framework.
29.
The mission emphasized that reducing rigidities in the labor market will
improve the business and investment environment and help job creation. The authorities
acknowledged the importance of this issue, and indicated that steps are being taken to allow
more flexible work arrangements. The mission noted that, in its discussions with the private
sector, it had emerged that high redundancy costs are a key remaining issue to be addressed
in order to improve the labor regime, and encouraged the authorities to develop appropriate
reforms.
30.
While access to education in Jamaica is at levels comparable to higher income
economies, the quality of secondary education is weak and inequalities persist.20 The
government is planning initiatives during the next fiscal year to improve the teaching of
science and to strengthen vocational training. In line with World Bank advice, the mission
suggested that the authorities consider increasing cost sharing in tertiary education; and that,
over the medium term, the role of the private sector in education be expanded.
31.
Jamaica suffers from a high crime rate, which affects living conditions and is
detrimental to the business climate. The government has made the fight against crime a
priority, and intends to address this issue over the medium term in the context of the National
Crime Plan—comprising social interventions to prevent criminal behavior and improvements
of law enforcement. Anti-drug initiatives will be intensified in cooperation with the U.S.,
British, and Canadian governments.

20

Access to primary education is close to the corresponding Millennium Development Goal
of universal coverage (Table 10).

- 17 D. Medium-Term Outlook
32.
The authorities’ strategy, if fully and successfully implemented, would bring
about a gradual reduction in the public debt-to-GDP ratio, and some further
improvements in growth. The authorities envisage that the Jamaican economy will grow by
about 2½ percent in FY 2004/05, and in the region of 3–4 percent over the medium term. The
mission indicated that this was a plausible growth scenario, on the assumption of continued
expansion in tourism and mining capacity, and growth in tourism-related services. The
authorities’ aim is to balance the budget by FY 2005/06 and to maintain small overall
surpluses thereafter, which—given current interest rate projections—would require
maintaining a primary surplus of around 14 percent of GDP.21 Inflation would moderate
further to single digits and the external current account deficit would narrow substantially.
The envisaged improvement in the external current account is consistent with recent and
expected capacity expansion in the bauxite/alumina and tourism industries, financed mainly
by FDI. Exports are projected to increase significantly as world demand for aluminum
continues to increase. Meanwhile, investments by Spanish companies are expected to open
new markets for Jamaica’s tourism industry. Over the period through FY 2008/09, NIR
would strengthen to about US$2.2 billion, and the public debt ratio would decline to close to
100 percent of GDP.
33.
The authorities’ medium-term scenario is significantly more positive than
developments in recent years, and therefore subject to substantial downside risks. The
mission underscored that—while the more favorable external environment would contribute
importantly to the envisaged growth and developments in the balance of payments—
realization of the medium-term scenario would require steadfast policy implementation.
However, even in this case, the public debt ratio would remain elevated enough to constitute
a major vulnerability. In addition, the economy remains vulnerable to adverse terms of trade
developments (e.g., higher oil prices) and weather-related shocks.
34.
Debt sustainability analysis highlights the major implementation risks and
vulnerability to shocks associated with the medium-term scenario. The debt dynamics
would considerably worsen under a variety of scenarios in which key economic variables are
subject to adverse shocks (Table 8).22 In particular, the debt ratio will worsen significantly in
the face of interest rate and exchange rate shocks, or if the baseline GDP growth rates do not
materialize.23

21

Over the medium term, extra-budgetary expenditure would be broadly constant, at around
2 percent of GDP. Initiatives to improve the financial operations of loss-making entities such
as the NWC, and a tapering off in capital outlays, are envisaged to restore the overall account
of the public bodies to a surplus position.
22

The DSA shows an improvement in the debt dynamics when all key variables are set at
their historical averages—which is unusual and reflects, in this case, the fact that the 10-year
average for the real interest rate is negative.

23

External debt sustainability analysis (Table 9) is made difficult in the Jamaican case by the
presence of a large foreign currency-denominated domestic public debt, as well as by lack of
(continued)

- 18 E. More Intensive Surveillance
35.
The authorities indicated that while Jamaica did not have a balance of payments
need, and therefore did not require an arrangement, it would still benefit from a close
policy dialogue with the Fund. In this context, they requested the Fund staff to undertake
more intensive surveillance of the Jamaican economy and of progress in implementing their
economic strategy. The mission indicated that the Article IV report would describe and
assess the authorities’ program. In addition, semi-annual interim staff reports are expected to
be prepared for the information of the Board between the regular annual consultations. The
first of these would follow a mission that is scheduled to visit Jamaica in the fall. The
mission encouraged the authorities to publish the Article IV report and interim reports.
36.
Consistent with their economic program for FY 2004/05, the authorities have
established semi-annual quantitative targets for the balance sheet of the BOJ and key
budgetary indicators. The following targets have been adopted for September 2004 and
March 2005:

F. Statistical Issues
37.
Jamaica provides core statistics to the Fund that are broadly adequate for the
conduct of surveillance, and formally adopted the GDDS in January 2003 (see
Appendix II). There was consensus that further strengthening of the statistical system
remains a priority. Consistent with the government’s desire to maintain access to
international capital markets, the mission encourage the authorities to commit to a plan to
subscribe to the SDDS within a defined timeframe.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
38.
Over the past year, the Jamaican authorities have achieved significant progress
in stabilizing the economy and setting the stage for a reversal in the highly unfavorable
information on private sector external debt. It may be noted, however, that projected debtcreating inflows are small as the bulk of the external current account deficits are expected to
be financed by foreign direct investment.

- 19 debt dynamics. Following a near-crisis in the first half of 2003, pressures in the foreign
exchange market have subsided, inflation has decelerated and interest rates have declined,
growth has resumed after years of virtual stagnation, and the government has again accessed
the international capital market. While the positive external environment has played a role,
the authorities are to be commended for their policy efforts, which included a substantial
fiscal adjustment and active use of monetary and exchange rate policy.
39.
Having steered successfully through this difficult period, the authorities are
nonetheless still confronted with formidable challenges. In particular, Jamaica’s public
debt-to-GDP ratio remains extraordinarily high, and the associated vulnerabilities of the
economy are exacerbated by the high degree of indexation of the debt to the exchange rate
and short-term interest rates. Despite the sharp decline in domestic interest rates and stability
of the exchange rate since mid-2003, the interest bill remains very large, and seriously
constrains the government’s ability to deliver essential public services and undertake muchneeded spending on critical economic infrastructure. Growth performance has been
disappointing over the past decade, and a renewed emphasis on structural reforms that would
promote private sector growth is needed.
40.
It is understandable that the authorities have placed a reduction in the public
debt-to-GDP ratio as their top policy priority. In working toward this objective, the
authorities have chosen to pursue a gradual reduction in the debt ratio through a prolonged
fiscal adjustment effort, combined with structural policies to promote higher growth. They
have strongly rejected seeking a debt restructuring that would aim at a substantial and upfront
reduction in net present value to a clearly sustainable level, citing the potential impact on the
financial system and the need to preserve domestic and external market access. The staff
understands these concerns and strongly supports the authorities’ efforts at fiscal
consolidation, while stressing that prospects for achieving the envisaged reduction in the debt
ratio will hinge on steadfast fiscal discipline in conjunction with appropriately designed
structural reforms. The staff also stresses that, even if the authorities’ strategy is successfully
implemented, it will still leave the public debt ratio at high enough levels over the medium
term to constitute a major vulnerability to the Jamaican economy.
41.
While the fiscal targets for FY 2004/05 appear achievable, staff projections
based on existing policies pointed to potential shortfalls in relation to the medium-term
fiscal targets. Achievement of the fiscal deficit target of 4 percent of GDP in FY 2004/05
will be helped by the savings arising from the critically important agreement with the public
sector trade unions. Nonetheless, the government must be unwavering in its efforts to
maintain tax collection, including the collection of tax arrears, and control expenditure,
especially in light of potential pressures on expenditure from sustained high oil prices. With
respect to the next fiscal year, the target of balancing the budget is likely to require additional
measures in view of the possible non-recurrence of one-off revenue items—foreign grants
and tax arrear reduction—as well as higher interest payments than currently projected by the
authorities. The staff is therefore encouraged by the authorities’ indication that they will keep
the fiscal outlook under review, and stand ready to take additional measures as may be
needed to ensure adherence to the announced target. Early identification and prompt
implementation of any necessary additional measures will be key.

- 20 42.
It would be unprecedented for a country to sustain, for a protracted period, the
stringent fiscal discipline envisaged by the authorities and reform measures to underpin
the planned adjustment will be critical. In view of the major implementation risks to their
fiscal strategy, the staff encourages the authorities to elaborate a comprehensive fiscal reform
agenda to strengthen the budgetary outlook. In particular, the envisaged reduction in the
wage bill will need to be underpinned by policies to rationalize government employment
following the two-year wage agreement. The social safety net should be strengthened to
mitigate the impact of these policies. The staff welcomes the substantial progress that has
been made in modernizing tax administration in recent years, and attaches importance to the
government’s plan to reform the tax system in the context of next year’s budget. The
authorities are encouraged to design the tax reform in a manner that helps achievement of the
balanced budget target for next year, and provides for a stable ratio of tax revenue to GDP
over the medium term. To this end, they should consider removing the many exemptions that
narrow the consumption tax base, and eliminating reduced rates and other features that
complicate the tax system.
43.
The staff believes that the current level of the exchange rate appropriately
reflects market forces. Over the past year, the authorities have not significantly intervened
in the interbank market, where foreign exchange is available for both current and capital
transactions. The exchange rate has remained quite stable, despite a substantial decline in
domestic interest rates. In the period ahead, the scope for monetary and exchange rate policy
actions will remain constrained by the debt overhang. Within this constraint, however, the
authorities should make a flexible use of monetary and exchange policies, and minimize
intervention in the foreign exchange market, guided by their objectives for inflation and
international reserves.
44.
The staff stresses the mutually reinforcing links between achieving greater debt
sustainability and higher growth. While Jamaica has undertaken, over the years, several
important structural reforms, a host of structural and social weaknesses still discourage
private investment and hamper external competitiveness. The staff therefore attaches the
utmost importance to ongoing structural reform efforts. The planned fiscal structural reforms
will go a long way in creating an enabling environment for private sector development. In the
financial sector, the envisaged introduction of prudential requirements for securities dealers
would help cushion the large interest rate and liquidity risks they carry, and could be
accelerated. More generally, in light of its large exposure to public debt, the prudential
regulation of the overall financial sector needs to be reviewed and strengthened. In this
context, the staff welcomes the ongoing preparatory work on legislation to combat money
laundering and the financing of terrorism, and the plan to undertake a joint IMF/World Bank
FSAP in early 2005. In the labor market, the authorities should develop options for reducing
rigidities, particularly high redundancy costs. This would improve the business and
investment environment and help job creation. In the social area, the staff welcomes the
government’s planned initiatives to improve the education system, and ongoing efforts to
fight crime.

- 21 45.
The staff welcomes the authorities’ request for more intensive surveillance of the
Jamaican economy and of progress in implementing their economic strategy. In
response, the staff envisages producing semi-annual interim staff reports for information of
the Executive Board between Article IV consultations.
46.
Jamaica provides core statistics to the Fund that are broadly adequate for the
conduct of surveillance. However, a further strengthening of the statistical system remains a
priority. Consistent with the government’s desire to maintain access to international capital
markets, the staff encourages the authorities to commit to a plan to subscribe to the SDDS
within a defined timeframe.
47.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Jamaica will be conducted on
the standard 12-month cycle.

currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ Defined as overall fiscal deficit (including off-budget issuance of debt to BoJ) , plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.

Exchange Rate Arrangements:

The external value of the Jamaican dollar has been determined in an interbank market
operated by commercial banks beginning September 17, 1990. The Jamaican dollar has
depreciated significantly since then, though not in a uniform trend. Since January to
September 2002 the exchange rate depreciated gradually from J$47½ to J$48 per U.S. dollar,
but it has depreciated slightly more quickly during September to December as market
uncertainties rose. After the Bank of Jamaica’s intervention, the market has stabilized at
around J$51. The Jamaican dollar depreciated further during the first quarter of 2003 but has
stabilized since May 2003. At March 31 it was trading at around J$61 to the U.S. dollar. A
multiple currency practice (MCP) exists subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII.

- 33 -

APPENDIX I

The MCP arises from the implementation of the surrender requirement where authorized
foreign exchange dealers and cambios are required to surrender at least 5 percent—but not
more than 10 percent—of their purchases of U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars and pound
sterling to the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ). This surrender requirement is effected based on the
previous day’s average selling rate for the U.S. dollar, the Canadian dollar and the pound
sterling respectively against the Jamaican dollar (referred below as “surrender rates”). For the
period of April 2003–March 2004, the surrender rates have resulted in the cross rates
between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar and between the U.S. dollar and the pound
sterling to differ periodically (for more than 5 days) by more than 1 percent from the
midpoint spot exchange rates for those two currency pairs in their principal markets.
VIII.

Last Article IV Consultation and Program Relations:

Jamaica is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle, and the last Article IV consultation
was completed by the Executive Board on June 9, 2003 (IMF Country Report No. 04/76).
In July 2002, the Jamaican authorities requested a staff-monitored program (SMP)
(IMF Country Report No. 02/197) for the period from April 2002 through March 2003.

APPENDIX II

JAMAICA―STATISTICAL ISSUES
In early 2003, Jamaica started participating in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS), which provides participants with a framework for the development of
their statistical systems.
National accounts
There are significant weaknesses in the national accounts and other real sector data. In regard
to estimates of GDP, concerns relate both to its level and growth. Addressing these
shortcomings has been hindered, inter alia, by insufficient legal authority granted to the
Statistical Institute of Jamaica (STAINT) to collect source data, as well as by institutional
weaknesses, including a lack of resources. However, efforts are being made to effect some
improvements to national accounts data, including updating the base year. Assistance on
national accounts methodology was provided by Statistics Canada, and by a STA technical
assistance mission in June 2001. The first publication of quarterly national accounts was
issued in August 2002.
Prices
The outdated weights of the published consumer price index (CPI) are derived from a
household expenditure survey carried out in 1984. However, the price relatives are obtained
for January 1988 and results in an apparent mismatch with the reference period of the
weights. Further, some releases of the index do not adequately explain this inconsistency.
Production
No data on industrial production indices, on wholesale or producer prices, on import
volumes, or on export or import prices have been reported for publication in the
International Financial Statistics (IFS) in recent years.
Government finance statistics (GFS)
In 2001, the authorities reported data on the operations of the consolidated central
government and debt dating back to 1991 for publication in the GFSY. The components of
consolidated central government expenditures by functions have also been published in IFS.
Although the breakdown of financing data by type of debt holder and by instruments has
been provided by the authorities, the inconsistency of the data with the overall deficit/surplus
measures has prevented their publication in GFSY. In 2003, the authorities reported data for
2002 in GFSM 2001 format for publication in GFSY 2003.
Monetary accounts
The published statistics for the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ) are sectorized, classified, and valued
in accordance with international standards, and are published in a timely manner. Following

technical assistance from the Fund, an extensive series on the assets and liabilities of credit
unions is now being compiled and published and there are plans to include data on Financial
Institutions’ Act licensees (merchant banks) and building societies in the expanded coverage
of the published monetary survey. The classification and structure of public entities need to
be updated regularly in order to avoid the mixing of central government’s accounts with the
financial positions of public enterprises and to exclude those entities that are no longer in the
public sector from the monetary accounts of the BOJ and commercial banks. Currently,
information on deposit money banks and monetary authorities is being reported on a regular
basis.
Balance of payments
The BOJ compiles and disseminates balance of payments data on a monthly and annual
basis. Detailed annual balance of payments data are reported by the BOJ for publication in
the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook (BOPSY) and the IFS. At present, Jamaica does
not compile International Investment Position (IIP) statistics. Nevertheless, the authorities,
with European Union assistance, have begun preparatory work and hope to begin collecting
IIP data in 2004.

III. World Bank Assistance Strategy
On September 18, 2002, the World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors discussed the Bank Group’s Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
Progress Report for Jamaica covering the next twelve months. The Bank’s assistance strategy has been closely aligned with the Government’s
own development priorities and reform agenda and remains largely unchanged from the CAS discussed at the Board in November 2000. The
total package amounts to US$129.8 million. New lending is limited to the two projects already identified in the previous CAS—the Bank
Restructuring and Debt Management Program Loan II (US$75 million) and Reform of Secondary Education II (US$39.8 million)—as well as
the National Community Development Project (US$15 million) identified in the aftermath of September 11, 2001. The three projects were
approved by the Board on October 24, 2002.
The Bank's recently completed Country Economic Memorandum (December, 2003) and ongoing Public Expenditure and Institutional
Review—are designed to identify key interventions to support the resumption of broad-based growth in Jamaica, and to provide an analytical
basis for its interventions in the next CAS.
The International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) have also had active programs in
Jamaica, with IFC supporting investments in telecommunications and the airports and MIGA supporting active contracts in the power and
financial sectors.

APPENDIX IV

JAMAICA—RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
Jamaica joined the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) in 1969. Since then, the IDB has
approved 91 loans (76 projects) to Jamaica amounting to US$1.4 billion and 160 technical
cooperation operations totaling US$52.2 million. IDB financial assistance has supported a wide
range of infrastructural, environmental and social sector projects with a view to enhancing
Jamaica’s human resource and absorptive capacity and strengthening the foundation for private
sector-led growth. In addition, the IDB has supported reforms aimed at strengthening the
institutional and regulatory environment.
The IDB is the leading lender to Jamaica among multilateral development partners. As of
March 2004, Jamaica’s outstanding debt to the IDB stood at US$704 million representing
16 percent of Jamaica’s total external debt and 61 percent of Jamaica’s multilateral debt. Out
of this outstanding debt, US$687 million were public sector loans and US$17 million were
private sector loans. With respect to the loan terms, 46 percent is on Ordinary Capital (OC)
terms, 43 percent on Intermediate Financing Facility (IFF) terms and 8 percent on Fund for
Special Operations (FSO) terms (see Table 1). Table 1 provides a breakdown of the
outstanding portfolio by type of lending program showing the applicable weighted average
interest rates which vary between 2 percent and 7 percent. The IFF provides an interest subsidy
on OC lending of up to 5 percentage points of the OC interest rate, provided that the effective
rate does not go below 3.38 percent. With 43 percent of the outstanding debt receiving IFF
terms, this program provides substantial saving to Jamaica. Jamaica’s eligibility to receive IFF
terms is under review at the present time.

At the present time, there are 14 loan projects and 22 technical cooperation projects in
execution with total IDB contributions of US$350 million and US$10 million, respectively
(see Table 2). Thirty-five percent of the IDB project funds and 27 percent of the TC funds
have been disbursed leaving some US$235 million available for disbursement. In addition,
there are US$280 million in the pipeline, divided between 17 loan projects and 7 TCs. Despite
the availability of these funds for disbursement to Jamaica, it is anticipated that the actual
disbursement in 2004 will be small as a result of the fiscal and debt constraints that the
Government of Jamaica faces. For the same reason, there is likely to be a concentration on TC
assistance in order to maintain some level of development assistance to Jamaica. In this regard,
attention may be drawn to a recently approved TC which provides assistance to Jamaica in the

Table 3 below shows the disbursement and repayment flows to Jamaica from 1997 to 2004. it
can be observed that the net cash flow to Jamaica has been overwhelmingly negative during
that period. This situation is expected to persist into the foreseeable future, given existing
limitations on further borrowing from the IDB as a result of the country’s high debt ratio and
fiscal constraints. Table 4 provides five-year projections of loan collections from Jamaica on
IDB loans on the basis of the existing portfolio. These projections take into account both OC
and FSO debt outstanding.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with Jamaica
On August 2, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Jamaica.1
Background
Following the near crisis in the first half of 2003, the authorities have succeeded over the past
year in stabilizing the economy and restoring market confidence. The foreign exchange market
stabilized in mid-2003, inflation has decelerated, domestic interest rates have declined, and
growth improved, while Jamaica has returned to the international capital market. Although the
external environment was favorable, a key contributor to this outcome was the government’s
renewed fiscal adjustment effort in FY 2003/04. In particular, the increase in the primary fiscal
surplus, reflecting both expenditure savings and revenue measures, allowed the budget deficit
target to be met despite higher-than-budgeted interest payments.
After more than a decade of virtual stagnation, real GDP growth reached 2 percent in
FY 2003/04. The improvement was led by strong performance in the key tourism and mining
sectors. The agricultural sector rebounded from the effects of widespread flooding in the
previous year, and utility, communication, and financial sectors also turned in good
performances. Reflecting the significant exchange rate depreciation in late 2002 and early 2003,
as well as the impact of tax measures introduced with the FY 2003/04 budget, 12-month
(as well as year-on year) inflation increased to double digits. However, annualized monthly
inflation has declined to single digits in recent months.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2In FY 2003/04, the government contained the budget deficit in relation to GDP slightly below the
preceding year’s outturn, despite a much higher interest bill. The primary surplus (excluding
privatization-related receipts) increased by 4 percentage points of GDP, to 11 percent of GDP,
compared to 7 percent of GDP in FY 2002/03. Revenue increased by about 2 percentage points
of GDP, to 30 percent of GDP, reflecting higher receipts from the general consumption tax,
personal income tax, and taxes on interest as a result of measures introduced in the
FY 2003/04 budget, as well as the imposition of an import surcharge. Primary expenditure
declined by 2 percentage points, to 19 percent of GDP, as cuts in nonwage current spending
and capital outlays were implemented. While the deficit was initially financed largely from
domestic sources, the government was able to secure, towards the end of the fiscal year,
foreign currency financing of around US$450 million. The public debt ratio declined slightly,
to 145 percent of GDP.
Monetary policy has continued to rely on open market operations guided by inflation and NIR
objectives. Following the sharp increase in interest rates on its open market instruments at the
end of FY 2002/03, the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ) has substantially reduced its interest rates to
14–17 percent by June 2004—less than half the March 2003 peak. Nonetheless, given
improved confidence, the BOJ succeeded not only in rolling over maturing CDs but also in
mopping up additional liquidity, associated mainly with government external borrowing.
The resulting contraction in the central bank’s NDA contained base money growth at about
11½ percent while providing room for a partial recovery in NIR during FY 2003/04.
Developments in the banking system have reflected improved confidence. Broad money growth
exceeded that of nominal GDP, with a significant buildup in foreign assets. Private sector credit,
mainly to the tourism and telecommunications sectors, showed strong recovery after a
prolonged post-financial crisis slowdown. Bank soundness indicators continued to improve:
the percentage of past due loans stands at 3 percent, while provisioning for loan losses, capital
adequacy, and profitability remain well above minimum international standards. While deposit
dollarization increased somewhat, banks have maintained a roughly balanced foreign exchange
position.
The external current account deficit narrowed by 4 percentage points of GDP to 11 percent of
GDP in FY 2003/04. Tourism completed its recovery and alumina exports rose in the context of
capacity expansion, increased international demand, and better export prices. Agricultural
exports experienced a weather-related improvement while reported remittances also rose.
Imports declined reflecting currency depreciation and the winding down of investments in the
telecommunication sector.
The exchange rate of the Jamaican dollar has continued to be determined in an interbank
market that is free of restrictions on current payments, and in the context of an open capital
account. The exchange rate has remained around J$60 per U.S. dollar over the past year, in
the context of declining domestic interest rates and broadly unchanged official international
reserves. The real effective exchange rate has risen somewhat following the steep depreciation
in late 2002/early 2003, but remains well below its range in the six-year period through 2002.

-3Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the authorities’ progress in stabilizing the economy after a nearcrisis in the first half of 2003, noting that in the past year, growth has resumed after years of
virtual stagnation, inflation has slowed, and interest rates have declined significantly. While the
favorable external environment has played a role, the authorities are to be commended for their
policy efforts, which reflected their strong commitment to reform and their efforts to secure a
broad consensus. These policy efforts included a substantial fiscal adjustment and active use of
monetary and exchange rate policies. However, Directors emphasized that formidable
challenges still remain because of the very high level of public debt, and the associated
vulnerabilities of the economy, exacerbated by the high degree of indexation of the debt to
exchange rates and short-term interest rates. Going forward, Directors urged the authorities to
continue to secure consensus on the reforms.
Directors supported the priority placed by the authorities on bringing down the public debt-toGDP ratio. They stressed that prospects for achieving this goal will hinge on steadfast fiscal
discipline in conjunction with structural reforms to promote growth. Some Directors cautioned
that, even if successfully implemented, the authorities’ strategy will still leave the public debt
ratio at a level over the medium term that will continue to constitute an important vulnerability to
the Jamaican economy.
Directors welcomed the government’s efforts to strengthen tax collection and expenditure
management, which they viewed as essential for achieving the ambitious deficit reduction target
for FY 2004/05. Moreover, achieving the balanced budget target for FY 2005/06 is likely to
require additional measures to compensate for the discontinuation of one-off revenue items,
as well as possible higher-than-projected interest payments. Directors were encouraged by the
authorities’ intention to keep the fiscal outlook under review, and urged early identification and
prompt implementation of any necessary additional measures to deal with unforeseen
contingencies.
Directors noted that the magnitude and duration of the fiscal adjustment envisaged by the
authorities is unprecedented, and subject to considerable risks, and emphasized that reform
measures to underpin the adjustment will be critical. They urged the authorities to elaborate
promptly a comprehensive fiscal reform agenda to strengthen the budgetary outlook, including
policies to contain the wage bill and rationalize government employment. In this context,
Directors welcomed the recent understandings in these areas reached with the trade unions.
At the same time, the social safety net should be strengthened to mitigate the potential impact
of adjustment measures on the disadvantaged. Directors welcomed the substantial progress
made in modernizing the tax administration in recent years, and encouraged the government to
design the forthcoming tax reform in a manner that would help to achieve the balanced budget
target, and provide for a stable ratio of tax revenue to GDP over the medium term. In this
context, Directors saw the need to reduce exemptions that narrow the consumption tax base,
and to eliminate reduced rates and other features that complicate the tax system.
Directors observed that the current level of the exchange rate reflects market forces, and that
the exchange rate has remained stable, despite a substantial decline in domestic interest rates.
They encouraged the authorities to continue to minimize intervention in the foreign exchange

-4market and to make flexible use of monetary and exchange policies in the period ahead.
A few Directors encouraged the authorities to eliminate the multiple currency practice
associated with the foreign exchange surrender requirement.
Directors stressed the mutually reinforcing links between achieving greater debt sustainability
and higher growth. They noted that while Jamaica has undertaken several important reforms,
structural and social weaknesses still discourage private investment and hamper external
competitiveness. In this regard, the planned structural reforms in the fiscal area will go a long
way in creating an enabling environment for private sector development.
Directors considered that in the financial sector, prudential regulation needs to be reviewed and
strengthened, given the system’s large exposure to public debt. In particular, the envisaged
introduction of prudential requirements for securities dealers would help cushion the large
interest rate and liquidity risks in this subsector. Directors welcomed the ongoing preparatory
work on legislation to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and the plan to
undertake a FSAP in 2005. Directors urged the authorities to develop options for reducing
rigidities in the labor market, particularly high redundancy costs, and they supported the
government’s planned initiatives to improve the education system, and ongoing efforts to fight
crime.
Directors endorsed the authorities’ request for intensified surveillance of the Jamaican economy
and of progress in implementing their economic strategy. In this regard, they looked forward to
the semi-annual interim reports for information of the Executive Board between Article IV
consultations. Directors considered that the usefulness of intensified surveillance would be
enhanced by the authorities’ firm commitment to and ownership of the economic program,
supported by full communication of the program and its objectives to the public, aimed at
building consensus.
Directors noted that while the statistical information provided by Jamaica is broadly adequate for
surveillance purposes, there remains scope for further strengthening the statistical system.
They encouraged the government to commit to a plan to subscribe to the SDDS within a defined
timeframe.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV
Consultation with Jamaica is also available.

Statement by Ian E. Bennett, Executive Director for Jamaica
August 2, 2004
Key Points
•

Following a fairly challenging period recently, there is clear evidence that the
economy has stabilized.

•

Important challenges remain, particularly, a reduction of the fiscal imbalances over
the medium term, and improvement in the debt dynamics.

•

The authorities have embarked on their own medium term economic program to
eliminate the fiscal deficit by FY 2005/06, and gradually reduce the debt.

•

Recent developments have lent credibility to the authorities’ monetary policy
framework and resulted in renewed confidence in the J$.

•

Continuation of structural reform efforts in the financial sector, the labor market,
and the education system, will be key to sustaining growth.

•

The authorities believe that they can benefit from closer dialogue with the Fund
through more frequent and intensified surveillance.

1. My authorities wish to express their appreciation to the staff for their comprehensive
assessment of developments in Jamaica during the recent Article IV consultations.
They value the relationship with the Fund and welcome the IMF’s assessment of
Jamaica’s overall macro-economic program. They believe that following a fairly
challenging period recently, there is clear evidence that the economy has stabilized,
and the basis for a period of sustained growth and renewed confidence has been laid.
They acknowledge, however, that important challenges remain, particularly, a
reduction of the fiscal imbalances over the medium term and an improvement in the
debt dynamics.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
2. Evidence of unanticipated economic challenges emerged early in 2003, when wider
than projected fiscal deficits developed. External market developments around the
same time necessitated the use of net international reserves (NIR) to meet maturing
debt, creating uncertainty in the foreign exchange market. The result was a
depreciation of the Jamaican dollar (J$) – bottoming out at J$70 to US$1. Monetary
policy intervention, (a hike in interest rates) an indexed bond offer and moral suasion
by the Prime Minister stabilized the market at about J$60 to US$1.
3. Despite these difficulties there were positive signs in the real economy, as the
agriculture, mining and tourism sectors began to rebound. Following adverse weather
events in recent years which significantly disrupted output, the agriculture sector
grew by 5.7 percent in 2003. In the mining sector, international prices for alumina
were higher than my authorities had projected and plants were close to full capacity.

-2Tourism rebounded; visitor arrivals surpassed pre-9/11 levels and new highs were
established in the long-term visitor, cruise-ship passenger and total visitor
expenditure categories. With these developments overall real growth was 2.0 percent
in FY 2003/04.
4. The medium term outlook is positive. Planned expansions in tourism and mining –
5000 new hotel rooms over five years will be added through investment of nearly
US$600m, and around US$700m investment in new capacity in the bauxite/alumina
sector will lay the foundation for higher growth. These investments, complemented
by a program of infrastructure development, and timely implementation of the
structural and fiscal reform agenda form the basis of the country’s economic program
going forward.
Fiscal Policy and Debt
5. My authorities acknowledge that the fiscal deficit is higher than desirable, and at
current levels, the debt needs to be reduced. With this in mind, they have embarked
on a program to eliminate the deficit by FY 2005/06, and gradually reduce the debt to
more manageable levels through the creation of small fiscal surpluses. Achieving the
fiscal and debt targets will require a substantial fiscal effort – a primary surplus in the
range of 14 percent of GDP, however, my authorities are committed to this, and are
pursuing complementary policy options.
6. Through a sustained tax effort which includes continued reform of the tax system to
widen the base and increase efficiency, stepped-up efforts to collect arrears, and along
with anticipated grants, total revenue inflows are expected to average around 32
percent of GDP - up from 28.1 percent in FY 2002/03. My authorities are currently
undertaking a comprehensive review of the tax system, which is slated for completion
in the fall of 2004 and should assist in further improvements to the system. On the
expenditure side, the authorities are committed to tighter management, and halting the
rate of growth of the wage bill. A memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the
major trade unions was signed in February 2004; public sector salary increases will
be kept below inflation, and public sector employment will be capped through 2006.
7. Based on higher interest expenditure projections, and more conservative revenue
collection estimates, the staff projects a small overall deficit in FY 2005/06 compared
to the authorities’ balanced budget target. My authorities remain confident;
preliminary estimates show revenue running ahead of budget, suggesting that a
sustained collection effort will have significant yields and with the implementation of
tax reform measures over the next two years, should enhance revenues. At any rate,
the authorities have committed to take any necessary corrective action early, should
signs of a deficit emerge.
8. The current level of public sector debt - 142 percent of GDP - is high. My authorities
agree with the staff that at existing levels this represents a significant risk to the
economy. However, the authorities’ exemplary record in meeting its debt obligations
has yielded credibility and going forward, the aim is to reduce current debt levels

-3through high primary surpluses and then sustain small overall fiscal surpluses. This
will help reduce existing levels, albeit not as aggressively as might be desired.
Nonetheless, the target reduction to around 100 percent of GDP by 2008/09 is
substantial, but achievable as the debt reduction and the resulting lower interest
payments become mutually reinforcing.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
9. Broadly, Jamaica’s exchange rate policy is to maintain a credible and stable market –
price and financial system stability - while permitting flexibility, consistent with an
emerging market economy constrained by high debt. The turmoil in the foreign
exchange market in early 2003 and its subsequent stability following the intervention
by the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ) has lent credibility to the authorities’ monetary policy
framework and resulted in renewed confidence in the J$. At current levels approximately J$61 to US$1 - the authorities agree with the staff that this
appropriately reflects market conditions.
10. The authorities intend to retain flexibility in the conduct of exchange rate policy and
accept broadly the staff’s recommendation of a flexible and balanced use of monetary
and exchange policy in support of the inflation and NIR objectives. At the same time,
however, the authorities remain cautious about some of the conclusions reached in the
Selected Issues Paper on Monetary Exchange Rate Policy Mix – e.g. that in the
Jamaica case, an alternative monetary policy mix that pays less attention to
smoothing the path of the exchange rate, and more to the impact of the policy mix on
output, could have resulted in reduced output and inflation volatility.
11. Chapter IV of the Selected Issues paper provides some useful insights into the
conduct of monetary policy in Jamaica in recent years. However, my authorities
believe that there are differences of interpretation on policy in certain areas, as well as
data revisions that are not adequately reflected in the paper. In this regard, they are
working with the staff to incorporate suggested changes to the paper.
Structural Reforms and Social Issues
12. My authorities recognize that the continuation of ongoing structural reform efforts in
the areas of the financial sector, the labor market, the education system, and domestic
security will be key to sustaining growth and competitiveness over the medium term.
They are committed to further strengthening the financial sector regulatory
framework through continued enhancements in the legislative framework and
strengthening the overall institutional structure. In particular, the Financial Services
Commission is at an advanced stage of preparation of prudential requirements for
securities dealers. In addition, Jamaica has requested participation in the joint IMF
and World Bank Financial Sector Assessment Program in 2005.
13. The budget for FY 2004/05 outlined further priorities in this area including –

-4•

•

Legislation to provide legal status to the Financial Investigations Division.
This new Division of the Ministry of Finance and Planning is responsible for
all matters relating to economic and financial crimes, including fraud,
breaches against revenue statutes and money laundering.
Executing a public education program on pension reform and embarking on
phase two of pension reform, which will, among other issues, deal with
mandatory preservation and portability of pension rights and voluntary
indexation of pensions.

14. My authorities are committed to and continue to make progress in reducing rigidities
in the labor market with a view to enhancing the business and investment
environment. In the public sector, they are implementing an ambitious reform
program aimed at developing a modern public administration based on optimal use of
resources, as detailed in Chapter I of the Selected Issues paper.
15. In February 2004, a task force was established to review and initiate a transformation
of Jamaica’s education sector and to present an action plan consistent with the
creation of a world-class education system geared toward generating human capital
and producing the skills required for competing successfully in the global economy.
My authorities are also cognizant that tackling crime is especially critical to
advancing economic growth and tackling the issue is a priority.
Intensified Surveillance
16. Having established what they believe to be a credible economic program aimed at
reducing the fiscal imbalances, debt reduction and sustained growth, my Jamaican
authorities believe that they can benefit from closer dialogue with the Fund through
more frequent and intensified surveillance. The intensified surveillance would serve
the dual purpose of monitoring the progress on the implementation of the economic
program and, at the same time, provide some “signaling” to Jamaica’s creditors and
the rest of the international community.
17. My authorities have full and complete ownership of the program. They envision that
the intensified surveillance will involve a frank assessment by the Fund staff of their
economic program and the production of semi-annual reports – on Jamaica’s progress
in meeting the program’s quantitative targets. This Article IV consultation has
fulfilled the first part of the intensified surveillance exercise and my authorities look
forward to the first follow-up mission later this year.
