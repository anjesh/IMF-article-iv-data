INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
JORDAN
Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the 2010 Article IV Consultation with Jordan
Approved by David Owen and Thomas Dorsey
August 27, 2010
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
As one of the most open economies in the Middle East, Jordan has been adversely affected by the
global and regional economic crisis. However, prudent fiscal and monetary management has minimized
the effects of these external shocks on the domestic economy. There has been progress in reducing
near-term risks and in advancing structural reforms, and further fiscal consolidation over the medium term
will be critical to achieving private sector-led growth and reducing vulnerabilities.
Policy challenges
The key challenges facing the authorities are to cautiously manage the downturn in the economy,
continue to advance structural reforms that will entrench stability and sustain medium-term employment
and potential output growth, and in so doing lower Jordan’s underlying fiscal and external vulnerabilities.
Key recommendations
•

Undertake fiscal consolidation in 2010, narrowing the overall deficit relative to the 2009 outturn,
reaching a deficit of about 6 percent of GDP.

•

Target an overall deficit of about 3 percent of GDP over the medium term, to reduce vulnerabilities
affecting the economy. This is consistent with a decisive further decline in the public debt-to-GDP
ratio, maintaining the ratio below the legislated 60 percent limit. Such an outturn will require further
rationalization of public expenditures (particularly the size of the civil service wage bill) and
additional revenue-raising measures.

•

While an accommodative monetary policy stance in 2009–10 has been appropriate, there is likely
little room for further monetary stimulus. The authorities should continue to stand ready to tighten
monetary conditions if inflation accelerates or there are pressures on the balance of payments.

•

Maintain the pegged exchange rate regime, which remains appropriate for Jordan, and has been a
key pillar of financial stability. The dinar real exchange rate is broadly in line with medium-term
fundamentals.

•

Continue to strengthen banking supervision to enable Jordanian banks to remain robust to internal
and external shocks.

•

Implement structural reforms, including further liberalization of the water and energy sectors, and the
structure of the civil service. Further improve the business environment for the private sector,
including by putting in place a sound framework to control for fiscal risks involved in public-private
partnerships.

•

Further improve the coverage, quality, and timeliness of economic statistics, particularly for labor
and property markets, which would aid policy formation and economic monitoring.

I.

BACKGROUND 1

1.
Following a decade of strong growth, the Jordanian economy has slowed
considerably, largely due to the global and regional downturn. Annual real GDP growth
averaged about 6 percent between 2000–08, supported by the implementation of sound
economic policies and favorable external conditions. Consistent with the global economic
slowdown, output growth in Jordan fell sharply in 2009, and economic activity is expected to pick
up modestly in 2010, in line with the recovery of key regional trading partners.
2.
The global economic downturn adversely affected economic activity. Real GDP
growth fell from almost 7⅓ percent in 2008 to 2⅓ percent in 2009, mainly due to weaker activity
in the finance, manufacturing, and trade sectors (Table 1 and Figure 1). The unemployment rate
remains stubbornly high (13 percent at end-2009). The output gap widened in 2009 and is
expected to remain negative in 2010. Headline inflation declined steadily through 2009 to near
zero, in line with lower world commodity prices, although core inflation has remained stable at
around 3 percent y-o-y. For 2010 headline inflation is projected to increase in line with imported
commodity (energy and food) prices.
3.
In common with many emerging market countries adversely affected by the global
growth downturn, Jordan’s already-difficult 2009 fiscal position was made worse by a
significant deterioration in external grants. While an increase in capital spending—to support
domestic activity—was largely offset by lower commodity subsidies, a cyclical weakening in
domestic revenues and a dramatic downturn in external grants induced a widening of the overall
deficit by more than 3 percentage points of GDP, reaching 8½ percent of GDP in 2009. As a
result, the debt-to-GDP ratio rose to about 56 percent at end-2009 (Tables 2–3, and Figure 2).
4.
Lower commodity prices helped to improve Jordan’s external position. The current
account deficit narrowed to 5 percent of GDP in 2009 (from 9½ percent in 2008), on the back of
strong tourism receipts and remittances and lower oil import spending that more than offset a
decline in exports (Table 4 and Figure 3). Foreign direct investment (FDI) and other inflows
comfortably financed the current account deficit, and allowed official foreign reserves to reach a
record high of $11 billion (equivalent to 8 months of imports) by end-2009. In recent months the
authorities have revised their historical balance of payment accounts for 2000–08, in order to
better account for FDI flows and reduce the size of errors and omissions.
5.
The government (formed in December 2009) supports an ambitious program of
structural reforms designed to develop the private sector. The Jordanian parliament was
dissolved by King Abdullah in November 2009, allowing the government to progress with
previously-stalled market reforms. The main policy priorities for the government (led by
Prime Minister Rifai) include: stimulation of economic growth and private investment;
development of a skilled labor force; enhancing political participation; protection of the poor;
facilitating growth and security through large-scale infrastructure investments; and improving the

El Said, and Poghosyan, Mmes. Ter-Martirosyan and Wolde (all MCD) and Mr. Arslanalp (MCM). Ms. Abdelati (OED) and
Ms. Sahay (MCD) also joined the discussions. Staff met with the Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance, the Governor of the
Central Bank of Jordan, a number of other members of cabinet, senior government officials, private sector representatives, and
donors. The mission issued a Concluding Statement, and participated in a joint press conference with the authorities.

level and quality of public services. New parliamentary elections are due to take place on
November 9, 2010.
6.
Near-term risks to the economic outlook remain tilted to the downside, given
uncertainties regarding world commodity-price developments, as well as fragile regional
and global economic conditions. If the economic recovery in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
countries—to which the Jordanian business cycle is closely linked—proves to be slower than
anticipated, this may adversely affect external flows (Box 1). Developments in Southern Europe
will likely have little impact on Jordan—any direct spillover through financial channels would be
limited since Jordan’s financial sector has no substantial links to European assets.

II.

THE CURRENT STATE OF JORDAN’S ECONOMY

7.
Despite an expected modest rebound in economic growth in 2010 to about
3½ percent, output growth remains well below potential, reflecting slowly-recovering
global and regional conditions (Box 2). 2 Real GDP increased by only 2 percent y-o-y in the
first quarter of 2010,3 while inflation picked up to 5⅓ percent y-o-y in June 2010, driven mostly
by higher international fuel and food prices. The external current account deficit is expected to
widen in 2010 (reaching 7 percent of GDP), as expenditure on imported commodities rises, and
is only partially offset by healthy tourism receipts and a rebound in exports. Official foreign
exchange reserves, a comfortable $10.4 billion (equivalent to 7¼ months of imports) as at
end-June 2010, have fallen slightly from the record-high levels reached in March 2010.
8.
The Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) has taken measures to moderate the impact of
the slowdown and support domestic credit. A full guarantee of bank deposits has been
extended until end-2010; liquidity-withdrawal operations (through CBJ sales of certificates of
deposit) ceased in October 2008; and reserve requirements and policy interest rates were cut
gradually between November 2008 and February 2010, reducing the interest rate differential
against the U.S. Federal Reserve’s funds rate from 450 to 200 basis points (Tables 5–6 and
Figure 4). Despite these efforts, excess reserves in the banking system—maintained as
overnight deposits with the CBJ—increased to almost one quarter of 2009 GDP. Deposit growth
has remained healthy, and the share of dinar-denominated deposits has continued to increase.
However, in the wake of the global financial crisis, bank credit growth to the private sector
slowed to near-zero at end-2009 (see Appendix 1).

2

Staff estimates that potential output growth in the period 2009–12 will average about 4 percent per year. It is expected that
the recovery of potential output growth in trading-partner countries will raise potential growth in Jordan to about 5½ percent per
year over the medium term.

3

The Department of Statistics of Jordan has recently made revisions to historical nominal and real GDP numbers for 2008
and 2009. Revised nominal GDP numbers are about 10 percent higher, while real growth has been revised down from 7.8 and
2.8 percent to 7.2 and 2.3 percent, for 2008 and 2009 respectively.

Box 1. Business Cycle Linkages Between Jordan and Major Trading Partners
Jordan’s growth cycle movements are closely linked to those of its regional neighbors and other
large trading partners:


The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) economies (particularly Saudi Arabia) continue to have the
most important effect on Jordan’s output cycles, as they account for the largest share of Jordanian trade,
remittances, grants, FDI, and tourism receipts. In comparison with other oil-importing economies in the
region Jordan’s output growth has the strongest correlation with the growth in GCC non-oil output.



In recent years emerging Asian countries have become increasingly important for the Jordanian economy,
because of increased trade links (including for mining exports from Jordan). The contemporaneous
correlation between Jordan’s growth and average growth in China and India for 1990–2009 is about 0.5.



While correlations with business cycles in Europe and the U.S. have become stronger in the last decade,
they are still lower than for other oil importers in the region, particularly Maghreb countries.

Shocks to the cyclical component of Saudi Arabia’s output have a large, long-lasting, and significant
impact on Jordan’s growth path. An impulse response function projects that a one percentage point (ppt)
increase to Saudi Arabian output increases growth in Jordan by about 0.8 ppt. A similar exercise for China
suggests an impact of about the same magnitude but it is only short lived. Interestingly, oil price shocks have only
a marginal negative effect on Jordan’s growth, as they are mitigated by higher FDI, remittances and grants
coming from the GCC region.

Box 2. Jordan’s Economic Recovery
Jordan’s economic recovery from its 2009 growth downturn has been slow. According to a “heat map”
of key economic indicators, economic activity remained below potential in the second half of 2009. Since
December 2009, an anemic recovery has been led by rebounding merchandise exports—particularly related to
the food, pharmaceuticals, and mining sectors—and construction activities. Demand for imports (excluding
food and fuel) and consumer confidence have remained relatively weak, and industrial production has
registered a moderate decline in the period January–May 2010.

MANAGING THE ECONOMY IN 2010

9.
The near-term policy focus centers on addressing Jordan’s underlying fiscal and
external vulnerabilities. Given the significant slowdown in external financing and the need to
mitigate risks related to Jordan’s already-high public debt, fiscal policy focuses on the speed of
fiscal consolidation. Monetary policy seeks enhancements to financial sector regulation and the
efficacy of monetary measures, to resuscitate credit growth. These broad policy initiatives will
help address Jordan’s underlying fiscal and external vulnerabilities, while boosting the
economy’s growth and employment potential.
A. Fiscal Policy: Consolidation Amidst a Cyclical Downturn
10.
To reduce fiscal risks, the 2010
Budget envisages substantial fiscal
consolidation. Based on the latest
developments and macroeconomic
assumptions, the 2010 overall deficit is
expected to narrow by more than 2 percent
of GDP relative to the 2009 outturn,
reaching about 6 percent of GDP. With
lower projected grant receipts and the
continued cyclical decline in tax revenues,
the consolidation will come mainly from the
spending side—involving greater
prioritization of capital spending and
savings in current expenditures, including
from containment of the public sector wage
bill and reductions in the operating costs of
public institutions and independent

agencies. Additional revenue measures were introduced in June 2010, including raising indirect
taxes on petroleum and other commodities, and reversing the GST exemption for coffee. These
measures will partially offset spending additional to those set out in the 2010 budget, on social
assistance, commodity subsidies, and teachers’ remuneration. Implementation of these fiscal
plans would result in a modest uptick in the public debt-to-GDP ratio, which would nonetheless
remain below the 60 percent legislated debt ceiling.
11.
Policy actions for 2010 which demonstrate the Government’s commitment to fiscal
consolidation include: reducing operational costs (particularly transportation costs) of
Ministries and autonomous public agencies; cessation of construction of new government
buildings, excepting schools and hospitals; and cutting Ministerial salaries by 20 percent. The
authorities emphasized that they stand ready to further curtail spending, as necessary, to
achieve their fiscal target for 2010 of an overall deficit of about 6 percent of GDP. Indeed, in the
first six months of 2010 the overall deficit (excluding grants) fell by almost half vis-à-vis the same
period in 2009.
12.
The authorities agreed with the mission that there is little room for further
countercyclical fiscal policy, given the significant slowdown in external financing and the
need to mitigate risks related to Jordan’s already-high public debt. In addition, there are
downside risks related to implementation of the budget, including emerging spending pressures
linked to the forthcoming elections. The mission argued for expeditious elimination of the
remaining GST exemptions which were put in place in 2008 in response to the sharp increase in
food and fuel prices. The mission also argued that as output growth recovers and comes closer
to potential, automatic fiscal stabilizers should be allowed to work so that further fiscal
consolidation can occur to help ensure the sustainability of public debt (see Appendix 2). The
authorities expected that economic growth would rebound more strongly than projected by the
staff, and if that occurred they agreed there would be scope for greater fiscal consolidation than
is currently set out in the staff’s medium-term projections. The authorities also explained their
revised approach to capital spending, whereby a Ministerial Committee prioritizes the allocation
of spending within an approved budget allocation—they expected that this process would enable
the realization of greater efficiencies in capital spending over the medium term.

Fiscal balance

13.
As output growth recovers and comes closer to potential in 2011–13, further
fiscal consolidation should be undertaken. Without substantial consolidation, the fiscal
deficit would remain sizable and the public

one percent of GDP per year (depending on
the level of economic activity), and help
achieve an overall deficit of about 3 percent over the medium term. Priorities underpinning this
adjustment include removing remaining tax exemptions on commodities, continuing moderation

8
of the wage bill, improving the efficiency of current spending, and ongoing prioritization of capital
spending. The authorities preferred to weight consolidation toward expenditure-reduction
measures, as they did not want to discourage domestic and foreign investment through higher
taxes. The authorities also considered that already-enacted income tax and pension reforms, as
well as proposed civil service reforms, would support medium-term fiscal consolidation. In the
staff’s view, full implementation of the authorities’ proposed set of policies would reduce the
debt-to-GDP ratio to about 53 percent by 2015. Such adjustment will be crucial to maintain
investor confidence, preserve macroeconomic stability, and create scope for potential future
countercyclical fiscal policy.
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy: Resuscitating Private Credit
and Maintaining External Competitiveness
14.
A slow-moving recovery in the extension of bank credit is underway. Private
sector credit growth turned positive at end-2009, reaching 5½ percent y-o-y in May 2010.

The Jordanian dinar real effective
exchange rate has appreciated by 2½ percent between December 2008 and June 2010, mainly
due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies.
15.
While monetary easing in 2009–10 to stimulate domestic demand has been
appropriate, there is likely little room for further monetary stimulus. Since late 2008,
the authorities have taken several prudent steps to sustain confidence and support the domestic
financial system. With international reserves large and stabilizing, and given the continuing
revival of bank private sector credit, further easing of monetary policy is likely to have a limited
policy impact as the interest differential with U.S. rates has fallen to a low level, and inflationary
pressures are emerging. The authorities agreed with the staff that imperfect monetary
transmission and uncertainty in transmission lags warrant a cautious approach to further policy
interest rate changes.
16.
The authorities concurred with the staff’s recommendation that the CBJ should
continue to stand ready to tighten monetary conditions if inflation accelerates or there are
signs of pressure on the balance of payments. Recent increases in headline inflation have
been largely due to rising international food and energy prices, which are not likely to be driven
by excessive domestic demand. However, persistently high headline inflation does risk inducing
inflationary momentum through its effect on inflation expectations. Balance of payments
pressures could also call for a tightening of monetary policy in support of the international
reserve position. Monetary tightening could be implemented by increasing reserve requirements
(to reduce excess reserves held at the overnight window), by operations to soak up excess

9
banking system liquidity (through resumption of issuance of certificates of deposit), and by
raising the policy rate. The authorities also agreed with staff that recent events in Europe had
most likely raised sovereign risk premia for all emerging market countries, which would likely be
reflected in a widening of Jordanian interest rate spreads over U.S. rates going forward.
17.
The exchange rate peg provides an appropriate nominal anchor and remains the
key pillar of financial stability. The Jordanian dinar’s peg to the U.S. dollar has played an
indispensable role in anchoring inflation expectations and providing for financial stability in a
volatile region. The authorities agreed with staff’s assessment that, although the recent strength
of the U.S. dollar has led to some real appreciation of the Jordanian dinar, the real effective
exchange rate remains broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals (Box 3). They agreed with
the staff that the external current account deficit is expected to widen in 2010 as expenditure on
imported food and energy commodities rises, and noted that improvements in the recording of
capital account transactions (particularly foreign direct investment) had reduced the previouslylarge errors and omissions in the balance of payments. They stated that the exchange rate peg
had been crucial in maintaining confidence in the Jordanian economy during the recent period of
turmoil in global and regional financial markets.
18.
The risk of external instability emanating from the capital account is lowered by
the fact that most external debt consists of obligations to official creditors, and reserves
far exceed short-term external liabilities. The authorities welcomed the dramatic rise in
international reserves in recent years (rising from US$6.9 billion at end-2007 to US$10.4 billion
at end-June 2010), and the ongoing switch from dollar-denominated to dinar-denominated bank
deposits, both of which reflect continuing confidence in the peg.
19.
The authorities outlined that they plan in the coming months to access substantial
external financing, prospectively through a U.S. dollar-denominated Eurobond issuance.
The staff urged the authorities to carefully consider opportunities to secure external financing at
competitive interest rates and for long tenors, which will reduce near-term rollover needs. Such
financing would improve the debt profile, support an accumulation of international reserves, and
allow domestic financial resources to be allocated to the private sector. The staff acknowledged
the authorities’ plans to bolster domestic debt markets through the establishment of sukuk as a
source of Islamic financing. Going forward, and following IMF technical assistance, the
government is working towards resolving several legal issues which are at present impeding the
issuance of sukuk in Jordan.
C. Financial Sector Policy: Enhancing Regulation of a Robust Banking System
20.
The Jordanian banking system remains sound and has proven resilient to the
global financial crisis. The CBJ’s prudent banking regulation and supervision, and banks’
conservative funding practices (with loan/deposit ratio near 75 percent) have shielded domestic
banks from exposure to troubled international banks, structured products, and wholesale
financial markets. The banking sector’s macroprudential indicators remain strong—banks remain
profitable and well capitalized, deposits continue to be the major funding base, liquidity ratios
and provisioning remain high, while NPL ratios increased modestly to 6 ⅔ percent of outstanding
loans at end-2009 (Table 7; see Appendix 4). However, banks could be exposed to higher
non-performing loans and provisioning requirements over the medium term, as Jordan’s growth
path is likely to remain below potential in the near-term. The authorities acknowledged that while
a further near-term deterioration in loan quality may occur, both the CBJ and banks are closely
monitoring such exposures and stand ready to take appropriate actions.

Box 3. Exchange Rate Assessment1
Staff estimates suggest that the real exchange rate of the dinar is broadly in line with
medium-term fundamentals. Trajectories of the trade-weighted nominal effective (NEER) and real
effective exchange rates (REER) and tourism-based measures of the real exchange rate index2
indicate further depreciation—ranging from 3 percent to 6 percent—relative to their end-2008 values.

Jordan’s robust export performance in recent years also suggests that the country does not
face major competitiveness problems. Both goods and services export receipts are estimated to
have grown by close to 17 percent on average over the past five years (2005-09). Among services
exports, the important tourism receipts, which accounts for one quarter of exports of goods and
services, has been particularly dynamic in 2009 and thus far in 2010, as reflected in significantly
higher tourist arrival numbers.
Estimates from the IMFs’ three Consultative Group on Exchange Rate (CGER)-based
methodologies for exchange rate evaluation indicate modest overvaluation (the macroeconomic
balance, equilibrium real exchange rate and external sustainability approaches point to a somewhat
overvalued exchange rate in the medium term (between 1 and 13 percent)). On average, there is
little indication of a marked misalignment of the Jordanian dinar’s real effective exchange rate for the
medium term (2015), with the actual REER calculated as overvalued by less than 7 percent vis-à-vis
the equilibrium REER.

Box 3. Exchange Rate Assessment (concluded)
Estimates from alternative
exchange rate evaluation
methodologies3—based on a
developing country-specific
(including Middle East countries)
version of the CGER
macroeconomic balance approach
to the current account—indicate
that while Jordanian current
account imbalances have exhibited
large fluctuations over time, these
have narrowed since 2007, pointing
to a current account position close
to the current account norm.
Using the macroeconomic
balance approach, Fund staff
estimate Jordan’s equilibrium current
account deficit under current policies
(the current account ‘norm’) at around
8 percent of GDP. Jordan’s projected
medium-term (2015) deficit of 7¼
percent of GDP is within one
standard error of the estimated
current account norm. This implies
that the medium-term current account
imbalance—largely financed by
private capital flows (particularly
FDI)—appears sustainable, and is in
line with the equilibrium level
predicted by fundamentals.
Accordingly, as with the standard
CGER approaches, there is little
evidence of real exchange rate
misalignment, as the medium-term
current account balance is close to
the current account norm.

Effective banking supervision has strengthened the capacity of Jordanian banks
to withstand shocks. The mission welcomes measures taken by the CBJ to further enhance its
effective banking regulation and supervision, including: (i) introduction of Basle II (Pillars I and III)
regulations in 2008, and ongoing efforts to ensure compliance of banks with Pillar II guidelines
for risk management (issued in February 2010); (ii) requiring semi-annual stress testing of banks
(issued in September 2009), examining in particular credit risk and concentration risk, with
aggregated results reported transparently in the CBJ’s Financial Stability Report; (iii) introduction
of an automated data collection system, to improve off-site monitoring of banks (June 2010);
(iv) enhanced cross-border bank regulation through regular supervision and on-site inspections
of international branches and subsidiaries of Jordanian banks; and (v) improvements to its early
warning system. IMF technical assistance has provided further support and training in Basle II
implementation (July 2010). In addition, the authorities passed the law establishing a private
credit bureau (June 2010), which will be supervised by the CBJ and should promote bank and
non-bank private credit flows. The authorities noted that they continue to take steps to guard
against risks in the banking system, and concurred with the staff that they have implemented
many of the recommendations contained in the FSAP Update (Appendix 5).
22.
The authorities have recently strengthened their Anti Money
Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework. Jordan is
working towards strengthening its AML/CFT system according to the standards of the Financial
Action Task Force (FATF). Major components of this strengthening involved: amending the
anti-money laundering law in May 2010; issuing regulations that grant the Financial Intelligence
Unit greater independence; the adoption of AML/CFT inspection manuals by the CBJ and the
Insurance Commission; and instituting a cash declaration system at the borders in March 2010.

IV.

THE MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK

23.
Over the medium term, macroeconomic stability will continue to hinge upon a
prudent fiscal policy. Output growth is expected to pick up in line with the global and regional
recovery, with the output gap expected to close by 2012. Core inflation is projected to remain
low. Rebounding demand for imports and still-high commodity prices will result in a modest
widening of the current account deficit to around 8⅓ percent of GDP by 2011, with a recovery of
activity in trading partners and associated increase in exports narrowing the deficit to about
7 percent of GDP by 2015. However, without substantial fiscal consolidation the fiscal deficit will
remain sizable and the public debt-to-GDP ratio will continue to edge up (Appendix 6). Main risks

13
are the continued fluctuations in international oil prices and external grants, with their
consequent impacts on the fiscal and external accounts (Appendix 7).
24.
A key medium-term policy goal is to reduce fiscal and external vulnerabilities
while achieving higher economic growth and employment.
•

Progress in structural reforms is a major policy goal to reduce fiscal and external
vulnerabilities, while achieving higher economic growth and employment over the
medium term. Further improving the business environment for the private sector should
help raise productivity and reinforce Jordan’s competitiveness. In this connection, the
mission acknowledged progress in implementing reforms—in early 2010 the Jordanian
Cabinet passed legislation that lowers the average tax burden, and enhances the
investment climate. The mission noted that these are steps in the right direction and
need to be supported by additional reforms to further improve the business climate to
attract private investment and enhance future competitiveness. In May 2010, the
authorities reformed the social security system to improve the sustainability and actuarial
soundness of their pension scheme. In addition, the revised social security law
introduces unemployment insurance to social security recipients, which should enhance
labor market flexibility (commencing July 2011). The mission recommended that other
structural reform priorities should include further liberalization of the water and energy
sectors, and completion of civil service reforms (which the authorities are embarking
upon with technical assistance from the World Bank and USAID).

•

Greater openness to trade in goods and services, along with reduction in the cost of
public services, will raise the rate of growth of potential output. The authorities are close
to completing their National Trade Strategy for 2011–15, which will guide their export and
import initiatives over the medium term; Jordan is also negotiating with Mercosur
countries in seeking to establish a free trade agreement. The tourism sector has
performed extremely well in 2009–10, with tourist arrivals and tourism receipts increasing
by about 30 percent in the first half of 2010 vis-à-vis the same period in 2009. Going
forward, continued training of local labor and reductions in the cost of key inputs (power
and water) will be essential to attract foreign direct investment and boost tourism
capacity.

•

With a sound institutional framework in place to control for fiscal risks, public-private
partnerships (PPPs) can provide a useful vehicle to address infrastructure bottlenecks in
a tight fiscal environment. The authorities have an ambitious program of large-scale
infrastructure development, particularly in the provision of power, water, and rail
transportation infrastructure, to be financed by PPPs. While PPPs can offer better value
for money in the provision of public infrastructure, international experience has
demonstrated that they can also generate potential fiscal liabilities. The mission
recommends that a number of preconditions be put in place, including improving existing
PPP regulations to approve a legal framework that ensures adequate risk transfer to the
private sector and prescribes a clear process for the evaluation and approval of PPPs.
Other elements of a sound PPP framework would include competitive bidding
procedures, capacity-building at the government level, and proper accounting and
reporting of fiscal implications. The authorities stated that they are currently in the
process of strengthening an earlier framework law for PPPs, which will be submitted to
Cabinet later in 2010.

14
•

Fiscal institutions should continue to be strengthened. Progress in public sector structural
reforms is critical to enhance the business environment for private sector-led growth. The
mission recommended that accelerated steps be taken to improve public sector financial
management through: further strengthening the medium-term framework for budget
formation and implementation; introducing the Government Financial Management
Information System across government ministries; and improving cash management
through full implementation of the Treasury Single Account. In addition, as the number of
autonomous public agencies had increased to 61 by end-2009, structural reform of
overall public expenditure policies will be needed to reduce the burden of government
entities on the budget. The authorities broadly agreed with the staff’s recommendation on
reducing the number of autonomous agencies, and are moving to merge several
agencies to reap cost savings and efficiency gains, in the context of ongoing civil service
reforms.

•

Given Jordan’s large stock of public debt, formation and communication of the
government’s debt reduction and debt management strategy will be critical. The
authorities have taken steps to enhance the efficiency of debt issuance by increasing the
number of Treasury bill and bond auctions and reducing the size of offers, and by moving
toward the establishment of a debt auction calendar. Going forward—in line with IMF
technical assistance recommendations—the government should accelerate its efforts to:
formulate and communicate a medium-term debt management strategy; establish a
robust middle-office function within the Ministry of Finance’s Public Debt Department;
and enhance the primary and secondary market for government securities.

25.
Further improvements in economic statistics will support the quality of policy
formation and economic monitoring. Substantial progress in improving data quality and
coverage—particularly for budget revenues and expenditures—led to Jordan’s subscription to
the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) in January 2010. The mission
welcomed the finalization of SDDS subscription, as well as recent revisions to the historical
balance of payments statistics which better accounted for FDI flows and thereby reduced the
size of errors and omissions. The mission supports the authorities’ plans to seek follow-up
technical assistance on improvements to its balance of payments statistics. Further
enhancements in the frequency and timeliness of expenditure-based national accounts data, and
in the quality of high-frequency production-based national accounts, would assist policy
formulation. The development of regular and timely wage, employment and real estate statistics
would also enhance monitoring of labor and asset markets.
26.
A joint CBJ-IMF research workshop was held at the conclusion of the Article IV
consultation. The main themes of the research workshop included: presentation of MCD’s
Regional Economic Outlook for the Middle East; determinants of the Jordanian business cycle
(Box 1); analysis of the slowdown in credit flows (Appendix 1); and development of a financial
conditions index (Figure 4) and general equilibrium model for Jordan (Appendix 7). The
authorities were pleased with the structure and content of the workshop, and requested that this
exercise be repeated during future Article IV consultations.

15

V.

STAFF APPRAISAL

27.
Following a decade of strong growth, the Jordanian economy has slowed, largely
due to the global and regional downturn. Economic activity is expected to pick up modestly in
2010, and accelerate further over the medium-term, as growth revives in key regional trading
partners, bringing Jordanian output closer to potential.
28.
The authorities have implemented prudent fiscal and monetary policies, which
have ensured fiscal sustainability and supported the domestic financial system. Even in
the presence of a cyclical downturn in economic activity, the government has proceeded with its
fiscal consolidation plans for 2010 and the medium term. Fully implemented, this should
contribute to a significant reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio, and provide for a major amelioration
of fiscal vulnerabilities. Similarly, the monetary authorities implemented cautious monetary
easing in the period between late-2008 and early-2010, in an effort to raise private sector credit
flows, and also took the opportunity provided by abundant capital inflows to bolster international
reserves.
29.
In view of the shortfall in external grants and the authorities’ desire to signal to
markets their seriousness in ensuring fiscal sustainability, the staff supports the fiscal
consolidation envisaged in the 2010 Budget. Staff believes that the decline in the overall
deficit of about 2 percent of GDP this year is both appropriate and achievable, and would leave
fiscal room for an envisaged increase in social expenditures, while maintaining sizeable capital
expenditures. While implementation of these fiscal plans would result in a small rise in the public
debt-to-GDP ratio in 2010, it would still remain below the 60 percent legislated debt ceiling.
30.
The authorities’ objective of reducing the fiscal deficit to about 3 percent of GDP
over the medium term is critical to achieving private sector-led growth and reducing
vulnerabilities. Reducing the overall deficit by about 3 percent of GDP over the next five years
is feasible, based on the experience of other countries, and would lead to a further 5 percentage
point decline in Jordan’s debt-to-GDP ratio. Such adjustment will be crucial to maintain investor
confidence, preserve macroeconomic stability, and create scope for future countercyclical fiscal
policy. Efficiency gains in both revenue-raising and expenditure will help durably address
Jordan’s main fiscal vulnerabilities. Priorities include removing remaining tax exemptions on
commodities, ongoing prioritization of capital spending, and continued moderation of growth in
the public sector wage bill.
31.
Significant progress has been made in advancing structural reforms, yet the
Jordanian authorities continue to face a number of policy challenges. In the near-term,
further improvement in the business environment for the private sector will be key to raising
productivity and building upon Jordan’s external competitiveness. Staff supports the recent
enhancements to income taxation and investment policy, and recommends that additional reform
priorities include further liberalization of important business inputs (particularly energy and water
sectors), as well as the achievement of greater public sector efficiencies through implementation
of civil service reforms.
32.
The medium-term fiscal strategy should be supported by a number of institutional
reforms. These include strengthening tax administration and reenergizing the implementation of
public sector financial management reforms. In an effort to relieve infrastructure bottlenecks, the
authorities plan an ambitious medium-term program of large-scale infrastructure development, to

16
be largely financed by public-private partnerships (PPPs). As an important prior action, the staff
recommends that a strong framework needs to be put in place to minimize the risk of contingent
liabilities stemming from PPPs.
33.
Monetary policy has rightly focused on monetary easing in 2009–10 to stimulate
domestic demand, yet there should now be a pause on further monetary stimulus. Since
late 2008 the authorities have taken several steps to support the domestic financial system,
including multiple reductions in the policy rate and cessation of issuance of certificate of
deposits. Jordan’s current stock of international reserves is large and stable, and given the
growing turnaround in private sector credit flows and some evidence of emerging inflationary
pressures, the staff recommends that the monetary authorities stand ready to tighten monetary
conditions as appropriate.
34.
The fixed exchange rate regime remains important for financial stability. The
Jordanian dinar’s peg to the U.S. dollar has acted as an appropriate nominal anchor for the
economy. Analysis by the staff of the real effective exchange rate indicates that the dinar
remains broadly aligned with its medium-term fundamentals. In addition, the risk of external
instability emanating from the capital account is lowered by the fact that most external debt
consists of obligations to official creditors, and reserves far exceed short-term external liabilities.
35.
Bank regulation and supervision should continue to focus on preventing
excessive risk taking. The banks’ conservative funding and asset structures, underpinned by
effective banking supervision and regulation, have limited exposures to adverse global liquidity
conditions. As a consequence, the banking sector’s macroprudential indicators remain strong.
Nonetheless, bank supervision and regulation should remain vigilant, as Jordanian banks could
be exposed to higher non-performing loans and provision requirements in the coming years, as
output growth is likely to remain below trend until 2012.
36.
Given Jordan’s large stock of debt, it will be important to have clear, timely and
proactive communication of policy intentions for debt reduction and debt management, in
large part to build ownership for necessary fiscal reforms. Communication of the
government’s medium-term debt management strategy will be particularly relevant, as will
enhancements to the primary and secondary markets for public debt.
37.
While substantial progress in improving data quality and coverage has occurred in
recent years, the statistical system needs to be further improved. Jordan is to be
congratulated for its January 2010 subscription to the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination
Standard. Nonetheless, data inadequacies persist, particularly in the areas of the expenditure
side of the national accounts, and in employment and wage statistics, which continue to hamper
economic analysis and policy formation. The staff urges greater progress in resolving these
inadequacies.
38.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

Appendix 1. Credit Slowdown: Supply or Demand Driven? 1
The purpose of this Appendix is to analyze the slowdown in credit activity in Jordan
following the global financial crisis, which has corresponded with a widening gap between Central
Bank of Jordan (CBJ) and U.S. Federal Reserve policy rates, an increase in the real lending rate, and
mounting excess reserves of banks. The importance of the credit slowdown for Jordanian economic
development cannot be

relaxing prudential norms may be needed to remove the obstacles for credit growth. Alternatively,
if the reduction in credit flows is mostly driven by the decline in credit demand amid slower business
activity, then economic policies aimed at expanding aggregate demand might be more effective in
stimulating credit growth.
To disentangle the relative role of credit and demand factors, we apply the methodology of
3
Laffont and Garcia (1977). According to this framework, at a given point in time the credit market
can exhibit temporary disequilibrium (excess supply or excess demand) owing to imperfect flexibility
in the interest rate. Hence, the observed decline in real credit can be either due to falling supply of
credit, or falling demand for credit, or both. The identification problem is solved by using exclusion
restrictions on the supply and demand functions (e.g., banks’ lending capacity affects the supply of
credit, but not demand for credit). Maddala and Nelson (1974) discuss the appropriate maximum
likelihood method for this class of disequilibrium models, which has been used for empirical analysis
of credit markets in different countries.

Among others, this view has been advocated by those favoring countercyclical regulation of banks, according to which capital
requirements imposed on banks should be relaxed in times of economic slowdown and strengthened in times of economic
boom.

3
See Laffont, J-J., and Garcia, R. (1977), “Disequilibrium Econometrics for Business Loans,” Econometrica, Vol. 45(5):
pp. 1187–1204. This approach was applied for analyzing credit slowdown in Finland (Pazarbasioglu, C., 1997, “A Credit
Crunch? Finland in the Aftermath of the Banking Crisis,” IMF Staff Papers, Vol. 44(3): pp. 315–27), East Asia (Ghosh, A., and
Ghosh, S., 1999, “East Asia in the Aftermath: Was There a Crunch?,” IMF Working Paper 99/38), and Latin America (Barajas,
A., and Steiner, R., 2002, “Credit Stagnation in Latin America,” IMF Working Paper 02/53), among others.

29
We use the following variables as determinants of credit supply:
l

•

Return on credit (i ). This variable, approximated by the real lending rate (nominal loan rate
4
minus smoothed inflation ), indicates the rate of return raised by banks from credit provision
(positive coefficient expected).

•

Differential between CBJ re-discount rate and the U.S. Federal Reserve’s (Fed) funds rate
(im). Given the peg of the Jordanian dinar against the U.S. dollar, monetary policy in Jordan
is closely linked to monetary policy in the U.S. Hence, the interest differential between policy
rates in Jordan and the U.S. indicates the relative stance of monetary policies in these two
countries (negative coefficient expected).

•

Future economic prospects (IP ). Banks are expected to expand credit supply when
expecting brighter economic prospects for the economy. We proxy economic prospects by
the smoothed industrial production index taken with a lag (positive coefficient expected).

•

Lending capacity (LC). Given expected returns on lending, banks should take into account
the amount of available resources in deciding the amount of their credit portfolio. We proxy
the real lending capacity of banks by the difference between total deposits and required
reserves in the CBJ overnight facility deflated by the CPI (positive coefficient expected).

•

Economic uncertainty (UNC). We proxy economic uncertainty by using a rolling standard
deviation of the log difference between the monthly Amman Stock Exchange index and its
smoothed value taken with a lag (negative coefficient expected).

e

Credit demand is modeled as a function of the following variables:
l

•

Cost of credit (i ). The demand for bank credit is expected to depend negatively on its cost as
proxied by the real lending rate (negative coefficient expected).

•

Future economic prospects (IP ). Developments in the macroeconomic and business
environment influence the decision of firms to expand or contract their business, which is
crucial for credit applications (positive coefficient expected).

•

Lagged growth of real Amman Stock Exchange index (ASE). The impact of stock market
activity on demand for bank credit is a priori unclear. On the one hand, expansion in stock
market activity may increase demand for credit due to improved economic prospects. On the
other hand, a rising value of stocks might improve the ability of businesses to acquire
external funding from the financial market and reduce their demand for bank credit (the sign
of the coefficient is uncertain).

•

Iraq war effect (T and Tsq). The demand equation also features a linear trend and its square,
beginning in 2004 (in logs). These variables enter to capture the impact of the inflow of Iraqi
refugees on credit demand in Jordan, as evidenced by a rapid acceleration of observed credit
volumes since the beginning of the war. The inclusion of the quadratic term ensures that the
marginal effect of the trend is diminishing over time, as refugees are expected to return to
Iraq after stabilization of its economic situation, or to move to other countries outside the
region.

4

e

Inflation is smoothed using MA (4,1,4) representation using the following formula: 1/9*(xt-4+xt-3+xt-2+ xt-1 + xt+xt+1+xt+2+xt+3+ xt+4),
where xt is monthly CPI inflation. This approach was applied also for smoothing the growth of the industrial production and stock
market indices.

30
Table 1 displays estimation results of the disequilibrium model of credit for Jordan, using data
for the period December 1998 to January 2010. Most of the coefficients are significant and all have
expected signs. Standard deviation errors in both supply and demand equations are significantly
different from zero, providing support for the chosen model specification.

The estimations suggest that both supply and demand for credit in the Jordanian banking
system are positively affected by expected economic prospects. Similarly, the real lending rate
has a positive impact on credit supply, while its impact on credit demand is negative. In addition to the
lending rate, the supply of credit is also affected by the differential between the CBJ rediscount and
the U.S. Federal Reserve’s (Fed) funds rate, which proxies the tightness of CBJ monetary policy
relative to the Fed’s monetary policy. Hence, a higher CBJ policy rate increases bank returns on
excess reserves, further discouraging lending to the real sector.
In addition to the price effects, we single out two possible motives governing the supply of
bank credit: availability of lendable resources (ability to lend) and risk aversion (willingness to
lend in uncertain times). The coefficient of lending capacity is strongly significant and positive,
suggesting that higher lending capacity expands banks’ potential to lend. Similarly, economic
uncertainty has a negative impact on banks’ willingness to lend. The magnitude of the latter
coefficient is small (and statistically insignificant) relative to the former (0.47), suggesting that while
banks slightly reduce credit supply in times of financial market volatility, the main factor driving credit
supply is the availability of funds.
Finally, we find negative association between stock market activity and demand for credit. This
implies that sluggish stock market developments put additional pressure on the ability of firms to
acquire external funding, generating additional demand for bank credit. Credit demand has also been
affected by the war in Iraq, as shown by the significant coefficients of trend variables.

Summary and policy implications
•

The recent slowdown in credit activity in Jordan has been mainly driven by supply factors.
These include tighter lending standards exercised by banks following the global financial
crisis, and a widening of the interest differential between monetary policy rates in Jordan and
the United States.

•

These results suggest that economic policies targeted towards stimulating credit supply
are likely to be a more effective tool for expanding credit flows in Jordan relative to
demand-stimulating policies. In particular, the monetary easing which occurred between
November 2008 and February 2010, by narrowing the gap between policy rates in Jordan
and the U.S., looks to have assisted in expanding the supply of bank credit.

32
Appendix 2. Fiscal Consolidation 1
A key policy issue is how to reduce Jordan’s fiscal deficit. In 2009, the deficit including grants
rose to about 8½ percent of GDP, a historic high since 1991. The 2010 budget envisages substantial
fiscal consolidation. With lower projected grants receipts and the continued cyclical decline in tax
revenues, consolidation will have to largely come from the spending side. This Appendix summarizes
recommendations of two recent technical assistance reports by the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department
(FAD) to: (i) re-examine tax policy; and (ii) to offer advice on how to develop expenditure
rationalization measures in the short and medium term in the context of declining resources.
Introduction
Since 2006, various pressures on the fiscal position have contributed to a widening of the
overall deficit. High fuel and food prices also increased the pressure on spending. At the same time,
the slowdown in economic activity and tax policy changes to accommodate high commodity prices
weakened domestic revenue. In 2009, a stimulus to alleviate the impact of the global crisis entailed a
sizable increase in capital spending. Along with a significant shortfall in external grants, the overall
deficit including grants widened to around 8½ percent of GDP.
As a response to the worsening deficit, a tight budget was adopted for 2010. The overall deficit
is expected to narrow by over 2 percentage points of GDP to about 6 percent of GDP. This reflects
greater prioritization of capital spending and savings in current expenditures, including from
containment of the public sector wage bill. Supplementary revenue measures—raising indirect taxes
on petroleum and other commodities, and reversing the GST exemption for coffee—will partially
offset additional social expenditures on the National Aid Fund, commodity (LPG and bread) subsidies,
and teachers’ remuneration. With these tightening measures, the public debt-to-GDP ratio will slightly
increase, but nonetheless would remain below the 60 percent legislated debt ceiling. Over the
medium term, the authorities announced that their objective is to achieve a deficit target of 3 percent
of GDP.
Tax policy recommendations
The revenue outlook is challenging. New positive structural changes in the revised income tax law
will reduce revenue, at least in the short run, undermining the move to consolidate the fiscal
accounts. Revenue from the general sales tax (effectively a VAT and the most important source of tax
revenue) declined in 2009. The expansion in exemptions and zero-rated commodities, largely in
response to the food and fuel price surge of 2008, undermines tax integrity, narrows the revenue
base, and increases both taxpayer compliance and administrative costs. In addition, tax incentives
across several different investment regimes and the continued expansion of development zones
offering income and sales tax relief places income and sales tax revenue at risk.
A recent FAD review of tax revenues offered a number of recommendations designed to
strengthen the tax regime. It identified steps that can be taken in the short term, and other
measures that could form part of a medium-term program for tax reform.
•

1

Short term: For the income tax, if the revenue loss from the new income tax law is too large, the
government could temporarily scale back the personal allowance or introduce a tax rate
surcharge. There is also potential for additional revenue from better administration, through
Prepared by Moataz El-Said (MCD).

33
efforts to concentrate on higher-income individuals. For the sales tax: (i) reverse the exemptions
introduced in 2008, capitalizing on the opportunity given by the substantial income tax relief
provided in the new income tax law; and (ii) reduce the number of sales tax rates, reverse the
proliferation of zero rated transactions, and rationalize exemptions. For tax incentives, resolve
the tension in investment policy between enhancing the overall investment climate and the
continued expansion of targeted fiscal incentives by providing preferential treatment to specific
sectors in certain geographic areas.
•

Medium term: There are several options for revenue-enhancing reforms that aim at restoring
tax revenues to pre-crisis levels without undermining gains in competitiveness. For the income
tax, taxing capital gains would remove existing tax distortions in the treatment of capital, would
improve equity, should facilitate a reduction in the high land transfer tax, and would allow
treating agriculture like other sectors—while protecting low income agricultural producers. For
the sales tax, enhance administration and compliance by unifying the multiple sales tax
thresholds and over time, increase the unified threshold, with the introduction of a simplified
turnover tax regime catching small taxpayers. For other taxes, there is scope to simplify the
customs duties tariff schedule in a revenue-neutral manner. Stamp duties could be narrowed,
concentrating on the main contributors to revenue. The complex property tax system, that yields
little revenue, could be simplified and accompanied by improved valuation practices. Given the
low corporate tax rate applied to mining, it is desirable to introduce a closer link between
profitability and revenue from royalties on minerals (e.g. potash).

Expenditure rationalization measures
As noted above, envisaged fiscal consolidation will have to come largely from the spending
side. Reviewing the composition of central government spending sheds light on areas large enough
to have the potential to generate savings. These include wages, pensions, investment spending,
transfers to government agencies, and other areas of spending. Measures outlined in a recent FAD
technical assistance mission to rationalize expenditures and contain the fiscal deficit to sustainable
levels over the short and medium term are summarized below.
•

Wages: in the short term, to rationalize the wage bill, the authorities should: (i) adopt a full
hiring freeze—including health and education; and (ii) contain wage increases through fixing
wages and allowances at current nominal levels. Beyond the short term, at a minimum,
conduct a review of eligibility for allowances and target them effectively. In addition, consider
a review of civil service legislation, to contain costs and improve recruitment, performance
incentives, and retention.

•

Pensions: the budget burden of the pension system could be reduced by: (i) decreasing the
contribution rate but applying it on a wider base—such as total compensation (basic wages
and allowances); (ii) unifying indexation policy across all schemes as proposed for the Social
Security Corporation (the lower of inflation and JD20); (iii) streamlining special category civil
servants privileges; and (iv) tightening the disability eligibility criteria and requiring
recertification for eligibility. Over the medium term, consider changing the accrual formula for
military pensions and ensure that the SSC pension scheme is in long-term actuarial balance.

•

Investment spending: the authorities should: (i) improve prioritization across sectors and
analyze ongoing projects to allow for targeted cuts; (ii) review ongoing projects and
acquisition decisions with a view to update and discontinue redundant ones, and decrease
costs related to interest and penalties; and (iii) review the road network with the aim of
building essential roads and consider a delay in the initiation of the second phase of the
Amman ring road.

34
•

Transfers to government units: reducing the consolidated deficit of the current
61 government units requires structural reforms and a change in their tariff structure to
achieve financial independence. Such improvements will result in efficiency gains and will
eventually achieve substantial gains over the medium term. Specifically, there is a need to
address the administrative losses of the Water Authority of Jordan (WAJ), with a view to
achieving cost recovery through tariff restructuring, and collection improvement. In addition,
review and merge units with duplicative functions, impose hard budget constraints while
improving their financial autonomy, and strengthen the role of the Ministry of Finance in
approving projects.

•

Other spending: (i) social assistance—consider phasing out LPG and wheat subsidies, and
revising the electricity tariff schedule to reduce the subsidy burden and limit it to low-income
households through lifeline tariffs. At the same time, review National Aid Fund (NAF) eligibility
criteria to improve its coverage of the poor and minimize leakage to higher-income
households. (ii) education—the authorities should extend the hiring freeze to include
teachers, consolidate schools and reconsider legislation to avoid building of new facilities,
and expand the private sector role in training; and (iii) health—the authorities should increase
public insurance premia and/or copayments, and rationalize the use of pharmaceuticals.

Appendix 3. Optimal Level of International Reserves 1
Not unlike many countries in the region, in recent years Jordan’s international reserve level
has increased markedly, reaching $11.1 billion as of end-2009 (equivalent to more than 8 months
of imports). This Appendix analyses Jordan’s international reserve dynamics based on traditional
benchmarks, and the “optimal” reserve level, as well as relative to other countries in the region.
High FDI and other inflows and continued de-dollarization in the banking system have allowed
Jordan’s stock of reserves to almost double in the past three years. The accumulation would
have been even higher had it not been for the $2.1 billion buyback of non-concessional Paris Club
debt in March 2008, which was partially financed from international reserves held by the Central Bank
2
of Jordan (CBJ). The most rapid buildup in reserves—almost $5 billion—occurred after April 2008
when the differential between the CBJ policy rate and the U.S. Federal Reserve’s funds rate
increased to above 200 basis points.
In the case of such an open economy as that of Jordan, holding international reserves is
desirable both to deal with current and capital account shocks and to support the pegged
exchange rate, which has been in place since 1950. A substantial current account deficit, a high
import bill—particularly commodity related—and dependence on remittances, FDI, and other external
flows make Jordan vulnerable to changes in world commodity prices and the global and regional
liquidity situation. In addition, in the current global environment with heightened sovereign risk premia
for emerging economies, a higher level of precautionary balances may be required to insure against
adverse capital movements and to provide confidence to investors and market participants.

The buyback was financed by a land sale (about $500 million) and the proceeds from the government’s privatization accounts
(about $1.6 billion). The latter was reflected in a drawdown of foreign reserves.

Jordan’s foreign reserve coverage has been comfortable in recent years, based on traditional
reserve adequacy measures such as import coverage, and ratios to GDP, external debt, and the
money stock. It has improved further in 2009 covering more than eight months of prospective imports
and 200 percent of external debt. Based on the latest data, Jordan also compares favorably with
other countries in the region.

A comparison of actual reserve holdings relative to the optimal reserve level required to
withstand various shocks confirms that Jordan’s international reserves are above the optimal
3
range:
•

Current account shocks. The level of optimal reserves sufficient to withstand current account
shocks—expressed in months of imports or as a substantial decline in remittances, grants and
other external inflows—has been consistently below the actual level of reserves for the last
4
several years.

•

Capital account shocks. Starting from 2005, actual international reserves became more than
sufficient to cover short-term capital outflows (short term external debt and foreign currency

the last two years.
•

Financial crisis. Recent reserve accumulation has also made actual reserves sufficient to
withstand potentially very large deposit outflows. In particular, an optimal level of reserves for a
shock equivalent to withdrawal of 40 percent of banking system deposits (as was observed in
Uruguay in 2002) is below the actual level of reserves for 2009.

Extending the same methodology to other countries in the region confirms a general

preference for higher reserve holdings for economies in the Mashreq/Maghreb regions. Most
of the countries hold higher reserves than the optimal level predicted by the Jeanne (2007) model,
and the “excess reserve” holdings—equal to the difference between the actual and optimal reserve
levels—have generally increased between 2000 and 2009, pointing to potentially higher demand for
precautionary balances in a more open external environment.

1/ The dashed line corresponds to actual reserves equal to the optimum level. Observations above the dashed line indicate that the actual
reserve holdings exceed the optimal level. Observations for 2000 are marked with the empty diamond, and for 2009 with the solid diamond.

To conclude, the current level of foreign reserves is sufficient to cover severe potential capital
and current account shocks, and ranks Jordan higher than most comparator countries in the
region based on both traditional reserve adequacy measures and some benchmarks for optimal
reserve holdings. This comfortable reserve position—relative to both potential stocks and to other
economies in the region—provides a substantial cushion against potential risks, makes the economy
less vulnerable to future fluctuations in the level of international reserves, and allows more flexibility
for the future conduct of monetary policy in a challenging global environment.

Appendix 4. Interest Margin Determinants in the Jordanian Banking System 1
This Appendix examines the determinants of the interest margin in Jordan by decomposing it
into its profit and cost components, including reserve requirement costs, operational costs,
and provision for loan losses. The net interest margin, measured as the difference between lending
and deposit rates, is a commonly-accepted measure of bank intermediation costs. The importance of
the bank interest margin as a measure of financial intermediation costs is particularly pronounced in
emerging economies, including Jordan, where in the absence of highly-developed stock markets
firms are largely dependent on bank financing as a source of external funding.
The trajectory of the interest margin in Jordan displays diverging dynamics (Figure 1). The
margin between lending and time deposit rates increased from 4½ percent at the beginning of 2000
to 6½ percent in mid-2003, then declined to 3 percent in mid-2006, and then has risen again to reach
4½ percent at the end of 2009. The increase has been particularly sharp during the past year, in the
aftermath of the global financial crisis. The margin between lending and saving deposit rates is larger
in magnitude, but has similar dynamics.

The interest margin decomposition is based on the methodology proposed in Randall (1998).
The income statement of banks defines profits before taxes (P) as interest income (II), plus
non-interest income (NII), minus interest expense (IP), minus operating costs (OC), and minus
provision for loan losses (Prov). After rearranging this identity, the net interest revenue can be
expressed as:
II – IP = OC + Prov + P – NII .

Dividing this expression by the interest bearing liabilities (average deposits) (D) and using average
interest bearing assets (L) and total assets (A), the following expression can be obtained:

Assuming that banks invest one minus the required reserve ratio (ρ) component of their interest
bearing liabilities into interest bearing assets (L/D = (1-ρ)), and defining the interest margin as the
difference between the implicit lending rate (II/L = iL) and implicit deposit rate (IP/D = iD), the above
expression can be written as:

iL − iD = ρ * iL +

OC Pr ov

+ ROA * −

where ROA = P/A denotes bank profitability (gross return on assets), and the error term ε results from
combining flow (income statement) and stock (balance sheet) data, as well as making the simplifying
assumption about the reserve requirement holdings by banks. The above expression decomposes
the margin into the following cost and profit components: reserve requirement costs (ρ*iL), operational
costs (OC/D), loan loss provision costs (Prov/D), profitability (ROA*A/D), and non-interest income
(NII/D, with negative sign).
To decompose the interest rate margin, we use semi-annual data on consolidated balance
sheets and income statements of the Jordanian banking industry for the period 2003–09, as
provided by the Central Bank of Jordan. Figure 2 displays the implicit interest margin and its
components for the analyzed period. Several conclusions can be drawn from the results contained in
Figure 2.

First, the implicit interest margin is much smaller (in the neighborhood of 1–2 percentage
points) than the simple difference between lending and deposit rates presented in Figure 1.
This difference is mainly driven by the negative effect of the non-interest component of bank earnings
and lower interest revenue on interbank deposits (counted as interest-bearing assets in the former
measure).
Second, profits constitute a substantial portion of the margin. Banks in emerging market
countries like Jordan need to generate sufficient profit to compensate for the risk undertaken in a
relatively less stable economic environment than that found in advanced countries. However, the
share of profits has been declining over time, especially following the global financial crisis.
Interestingly, bank profitability decreased and the margin slightly rose following the increase in
loan-loss provisioning in 2008-09. This implies that part of the additional costs associated with the
deterioration of banks’ loan portfolios were passed through to bank clients by an increase in the
interest margin, while the remaining costs were incurred by banks themselves in terms of lower
profitability.
Third, related to the previous point, the share of loan-loss provision costs in the margin has
risen in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. Since the crisis is not over as yet, it is possible
that banks will attempt to pass through the loan loss provision costs in the coming months, in which
case the interest margin might increase further. Forthcoming data on the first part of 2010 will help to
clarify this point.
Fourth, the share of operating costs in the margin has been broadly constant over time. These
include personnel costs, among other components, and can be considered as a proxy for the
efficiency of banking intermediation in Jordan. The relatively large share of this component in the
margin implies that there is potential room for further reduction in the interest margin that may arise
from an increase in the efficiency of banking operations.
Fifth, reserve requirement costs have been reduced following the decline of the reserve
requirement ratio from 10 to 7 percent of deposits in the second half of 2009. Overall, the share
of this component is not very large, given the relatively low reserve requirement ratio in Jordan.
Finally, Figure 2 suggests that the interest margin is substantially reduced due to the ability of
banks to generate income from non-interest sources, such as fees and service charges.
However, the magnitude of non-interest sources of income has progressively declined from mid-2005
onwards.
To conclude, the analysis in this Appendix suggests that operational costs constitute a large
share of the margin, implying the existence of room for its further reduction due to improvements in
the efficiency of financial intermediation. The bank profitability component of the margin has been
declining over time, especially following the increase in loan loss provisions in the wake of the global
financial crisis. The recent reduction in the reserve requirement ratio has decreased its share of costs
in the margin.
The above analysis provides the following policy implications:
•

the reserve requirement ratio can be used as a tool by the Jordanian monetary authorities to
influence the magnitude of the interest margin; and

•

the recent build up of non-performing loans by banks may be passed through to their
customers through an increase in the interest margin.

Appendix 5. FSAP Recommendations and Banking Supervision Reforms 1
The Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) has undertaken significant reforms to enhance its banking
supervision, in line with the recommendations of the 2008 Financial Sector Assessment
Program (FSAP) Update. This Appendix provides a summary of the main reforms. These include:
(i) ongoing efforts to ensure compliance of banks with Basel II principles; (ii) requiring semi-annual
bottom-up stress testing of banks, examining in particular credit risk and concentration risk;
(iii) reporting the aggregate results of stress tests in the CBJ’s annual Financial Stability Report;
(iv) introducing an automated data collection system to improve off-site monitoring of banks;
(v) enhanced cross-border bank regulation through regular supervision and on-site inspections of
international branches and subsidiaries of Jordanian banks; (vi) improvements to its early warning
system; and (vii) improving access to finance by expanding the public credit registry and passage of a
private credit bureau law.
Basel II implementation. The CBJ has now issued all the regulations for Basel II implementation.
The regulations for Pillars I and III were issued in 2008. The Pillar II regulations were issued in
February 2010. The banks are in the process of applying these regulations.
Stress testing. The bottom-up stress testing exercise, as part of Pillar II, is underway. The CBJ
issued stress testing regulations in September 2009 and requested banks to run stress tests based
on a number of standard scenarios related to different types of risks (especially credit risk and
concentration risk). The CBJ also requested banks to identify some additional scenarios taking into
consideration the risk profile of each bank. The CBJ is finalizing the validation process of the stress
tests conducted by banks, and will work on reflecting regular stress tests in CAMELS scoring.
Financial Stability Report. The third Financial Stability Report was published in 2009. The CBJ will
draw on the main findings of the bottom-up stress tests and report their results in forthcoming reports.
Automated data collection system. The CBJ is working towards finalizing the development of a
comprehensive and automated database, possibly by year-end, to help in strengthening banking
supervision and enhance the Early Warning System.
Enhanced cross-border regulation. In order to strengthen global consolidated supervision, the CBJ
has performed on-site cross-border examinations on complex groups. The CBJ visited Arab
Bank/London, Arab Bank/Switzerland and branches of three Jordanian banks operating in Cyprus. In
2010 the CBJ will visit branches of banks operating in the Gulf area (Qatar and UAE). The CBJ plans
to continue visiting Jordanian banks with a material presence abroad. Banks with branches in
Palestine already provide monthly reports to the CBJ.
Early Warning System. The CBJ has continued to monitor financial soundness indicators on a
semi-annual basis, and is working on improving the Early Warning System by developing a statistical
model to be used as an early warning system, in addition to the two approaches that are already
being used (Financial Ratio Analysis and Peer Group Analysis and CAMEL).
Improving access to finance. The CBJ has lowered the threshold for the public credit registry from
JD 30,000 to JD 20,000. In the meantime, a private credit bureau law has been approved. The CBJ is
working towards drafting the regulations and by-laws, with technical assistance from the Middle East
Technical Assistance Center (METAC).

• Prepare contingency plans to deal with stress in the banking system.

The CBJ has a prompt corrective action framework to deal with
any weaknesses or breaches of laws and regulations at an early
stage, in addition to the tools available for CBJ by laws and
regulations to deal with stress in the banking system. These are
seem to be broadly sufficient and, as such, the CBJ does not have
a formal contingency plan in this regard.

• Continue to strengthen monitoring of financial soundness indicators
(FSIs) and build early warning systems.

The CBJ monitors financial soundness indicators on a semi-annual
basis, and is working on improving the Early Warning System
adopted by CBJ towards developing a statistical model to be used
as an early warning system, in addition to the two approaches that
are already being used (Financial Ratio Analysis and Peer Group
Analysis and CAMEL). The CBJ is working towards finalizing the
development of a comprehensive and automated database,
possibly by year-end, to help in strengthening banking supervision
and enhancing the Early Warning System.

• Strengthen the staffing of the supervisory department of the CBJ.

The Banking supervision department has hired a number of fresh
graduates and some experience personnel. There are currently 80
staff in the department (end-June 2010).

• Enhance monitoring of broker-dealers and introduce procedures for
early intervention.

Status of Implementation 2/

• Develop explicit exit procedures both for dealing with unsound banks
and to make room for a more open entry policy consistent with greater
contestability in the system.

In CBJ's view, the CBJ already has licensing criteria issued to
banks to deal with entry policy and CBJ regulations are sufficient to
deal with entry and exit procedures.

• Enhance the stress testing capacity of the CBJ and commercial
banks, focusing in particular on credit risk. Reflect regular stress tests
in CAMELS scoring.

The CBJ issued stress testing regulations in September 2009, in
order to measure the ability of the banks to withstand a range of
severe but plausible shocks, and requested banks to run stress
tests based on a number of standard scenarios related to the
different types of risks (especially credit risk and concentration
risk). The CBJ also requested banks to identify some additional
scenarios taking into consideration the risk profile of each bank.
After finalizing the validation process of the stress tests conducted
by banks, the CBJ will work on reflecting regular stress tests in
CAMELS scoring. They have also conducted training courses on
stress testing for CBJ and banks' staff.

• Pass the draft insurance law, which will improve the governance of
the Insurance Commission and its independence from government.

• Introduce legislation on mutual funds.
• Restructure the motor third party liability insurance.
• Introduce financial literacy training and regulations for households.

The CBJ issued Pillar II guidelines and requested banks to
submit their capital plans by the end of June 2010 and the
Internal Capital Adequacy Process/ICAAP by the end of
2010. CBJ will conduct the Supervisory Review and
Evaluation Process (SREP) on the submitted ICAAPs to
ensure that banks have adequate risk management

their operations and to ensure that banks have adequate
capital against all their material risks.

environment to move to the more advanced approaches.

• Adopt and adapt COREP and FINREP for your reporting (and for
disclosure under Pillar 3).

The CBJ is working towards finalizing the development of a

Appendix 6. Debt Sustainability Analysis 1
A. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
As a result of the implementation of fiscal consolidation measures in 2010 and the
2
medium term, Jordan’s public debt is expected to decline to around 53 percent of GDP in 2015.
Following a steady decline in 2003–08 the debt ratio increased by about 3 percentage points in 2009
due to a substantial widening of the fiscal deficit caused by a moderate fiscal stimulus, cyclical decline
in revenues, and a shortfall in external grants. Based on the 2010 budget and assuming that fiscal
consolidation measures will continue over the medium term, the debt ratio is projected to increase
slightly in 2010-11 and then decline by about one percentage point per year over the medium term.
The debt outlook remains vulnerable to adverse shocks. Standard bound tests reveal the
following (Figure A.1):
•

A contingent liabilities shock—an increase in the debt ratio by 10 percent of GDP in 2010—
would cause the debt path to remain about 10 percentage points above the baseline
throughout the projection period.

•

As about one third of the debt is foreign-currency denominated, a 30 percent real exchange
rate depreciation would increase the debt-to-GDP ratio by around 10 percentage points
relative to the baseline in 2010.

•

Even under smaller shocks—individual one-half standard deviation shocks to real growth,
interest rates, and the primary balance—the debt-to-GDP ratios would exceed 60 percent by
the end of the projection period.

Public debt sustainability and containing these vulnerabilities is contingent on appropriate
adjustment policies. Under the baseline outlook, the average primary deficit (including grants)
declines from about 4 percent of GDP in 2010 to 0.6 percent by 2015. In contrast,
•

holding the primary deficit constant at 6.3 percent of GDP (its 2009 level) over 2010–15 would
cause the debt ratio to grow to 85 percent by 2015;

•

the debt ratio would decline (approaching 42 percent by 2015) if key assumptions are held at
their historical averages, reflecting that the primary deficit (including grants) was, on average,
below one percent of GDP in 2000–09.

B. External Debt Sustainability Analysis
Jordan’s external debt is relatively low but remains vulnerable to adverse shocks. The external
debt ratio declined sharply to 25 percent of GDP following the $2.1 billion buyback of Paris club debt
in 2008 and is expected to fall below 20 percent by end-2010. The projections are based on the
current outlook for commodity prices—particularly for food and fuel—and expectations that Jordan will
continue to pursue cautious external borrowing policies, relying predominantly on concessional
sources of external financing from multilateral and regional development banks.
The envisaged debt path is somewhat sensitive to assumptions regarding current account
flows and the outlook for private capital flows (Figure A.2):
•

The standard bound tests reveal that external debt sustainability is most vulnerable to
developments in the current account position. If the actual current account were one-half
standard deviation worse than currently assumed, the debt ratio would edge up throughout
the projection period (reaching 23 percent of GDP by 2015).

•

An important source of risk is a sharper slowdown in current account inflows and FDI if the
global/regional downturn proves deeper than currently expected. An impact of such a
slowdown is illustrated in an alternative scenario that envisages a 20 percent decline in
3
2010–11 in remittances and tourism flows, as well as FDI, relative to the baseline. Under this
scenario, the debt ratio deteriorates to about 28 percent by end-2011.

•

Bound tests show that the debt-to-GDP ratio is robust to shocks in the external interest rate
or GDP growth. A sharp depreciation would lead to an immediate deterioration in the debt
ratio but would not have a major adverse impact over time because of the relatively low stock
of projected external debt.

3

The total impact of the shock is likely overstated, since imports are assumed to be unaffected by the decline in inflows.

Appendix 7. DSGE Model of the Jordanian Economy1
Introduction
This Appendix describes a small open-economy dynamic stochastic general equilibrium
(DSGE) model developed by staff, which is used to analyze the impact of external shocks on
the Jordanian economy. In line with the new-Keynesian tradition, the model features nominal and
real wage and price rigidities, imperfect competition, and a Taylor-type monetary policy reaction
function. To better account for the Jordanian economy’s specific characteristics, the model
incorporates a fully exportable commodity-producing sector (phosphate/potash), oil as an input in the
production process and household consumption basket, and real exchange rate changes in the
monetary policy reaction function. The impact of oil subsidies is modeled in the form of a wedge
between international and domestic oil prices. Estimations are performed using Bayesian estimation
techniques on quarterly data covering the period 1992–2009.
Estimation results
The model provides a good fit and yields plausible parameter estimates relative to DSGE
models generated for other emerging economies. Estimations suggest a low degree of
substitution between oil and other goods in the household consumption basket, and between oil and
other inputs of production, underscoring the importance of oil price shocks affecting economic activity.
Price and wage rigidity estimates are in line with findings in other emerging economies. The central
bank policy interest rate reacts not only to the output gap and inflation, but also to real exchange rate
changes. The importance of the real exchange rate for monetary policy purposes is common to other
open emerging economies with fixed exchange rate regimes.
Estimation results and impulse response analysis indicate high persistence of
macroeconomic variables to external shocks. The autoregressive coefficients of external shocks
are above 0.7. Strong persistence of external shocks implies that the Jordanian economy is highly
vulnerable to external conditions. Illustrated below are the response of major macroeconomic
variables to shocks in: (i) the international oil price; (ii) foreign demand; and (iii) demand for the
exportable commodity.
International oil price shock
An international oil price shock induces a negative income effect, which translates into lower
consumption of both home and foreign goods (including oil). Given low substitutability between
production inputs and unchanged productivity, firms cannot substitute oil with labor and thus output
declines, putting downward pressure on wages. Lower output and wages restrict household budgets
and exert downward pressure on prices. The real exchange rate depreciates accordingly, and slightly
improves the external position. Monetary policy reacts to the economic slowdown by reducing the
nominal interest rate (see the impulse response functions of Figure 1).

Foreign demand shock
A foreign demand shock increases domestic production and induces a positive income effect,
which translates into higher consumption of both home and foreign goods. With productivity
held unchanged, firms expand their output capacity by utilizing more labor and oil inputs. Given
relatively low wage indexation, higher demand for labor leads to an increase in real wages, placing
upward pressure on prices of home goods and inflation. The real exchange rate appreciates, slightly
deteriorating the external position. Monetary policy responds to the overheating economy by raising
the nominal interest rate (see Figure 2).

Shock to demand for the exportable commodity
A shock to demand for the exportable commodity (potash/phosphate) increases its production
and induces a positive income effect, which results in higher consumption of both home and
foreign goods. Firms facing higher demand for home goods increase demand for production inputs
(labor and oil), leading to an increase in real wages and inflation. As with any expansion biased
towards tradable goods, a boom in this sector induces a real appreciation of the exchange rate. While
exports of commodity rise, net exports do not grow since the appreciation harms non-commodity
exports. The real exchange rate appreciates, slightly deteriorating the external position. Monetary
policy responds to the overheating economy (output and inflation) by raising the nominal interest rate

(see Figure 3).

Conclusion and next steps
The analysis in this Appendix—as evidenced by the relevant impulse response functions—indicates
that the estimated model describes well the main features of the Jordanian economy, particularly its
openness to external shocks. Future work will focus on augmenting the model to incorporate
calibrated fiscal policies in the form of a fiscal rule. In addition, capital could be added to the
production function of firms, to better account for the monetary policy transmission mechanism
working through interest rate changes. These modifications will improve the usefulness of the model
to the Jordanian authorities as an input to economic analysis and policy formation.

Safeguards Assessment: Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the CBJ was
subject to a full assessment with respect to the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA), which was approved
on July 3, 2002 and expired on July 2, 2004. The assessment was completed on June 27, 2003 and
concluded that the CBJ has made progress in strengthening its safeguards, as recommended in the
previous assessment of May 2001. The assessment proposed a set of measures, the majority of
which have been implemented.
VIII. Exchange System: The Jordanian dinar is fully convertible and is officially pegged to the
SDR. In practice, the authorities have an exchange rate regime which is pegged to the U.S. dollar
since October 1995 at JD 1 = $1.41044. Jordan accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2,

3
3, and 4 in 1995 and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers
for current international transactions.

Annex II. Jordan: World Bank Group Strategy and Operations
1.
As of July 8, 2010, the World Bank has approved 66 loans, 15 credits and five grants for a
total of US$3,007.2 million. Of the 66 loans, nine are for budget support operations (Development
Policy Loans (DPLs)).The most recent DPL for US$300 million was approved by the Bank’s Board
on November 19, 2009. The current portfolio consists of seven active investment projects and one
guarantee operation for a total net commitment of US$288.5 million with an undisbursed balance of
US$164.9 million. Overall performance of the portfolio is good, both from the perspective of
implementation and development impact. This reflects the generally good project implementation
capacity of Jordanian institutions, Jordan’s strong ownership of the program, and the quality of the
dialogue between the Bank and the Government of Jordan (GoJ).
2.
The Joint World Bank-IFC country assistance strategy (CAS) for FY 2006–10, endorsed by
the Bank’s Executive Board in May 2006, was aligned with the government priorities of poverty
alleviation and the creation of higher productivity jobs, while assisting the country in its transition
through the medium-term economic shocks. The CAS set out a four-year program organized in four
cross-sectoral clusters:
•
•
•
•

strengthening the investment environment and building human resources for value-added, skillintensive, and knowledge-based economy;
supporting local development through increased access to services and economic
opportunities;
reforming social assistance and expanding inclusion; and
restructuring public expenditures and supporting public sector reform.

3.
In the CAS period (FY2006–10), the Bank approved six investment loans, one
supplemental, and one development policy loan for a total commitment amount of US$505.5 million.
The loans focus on assisting Jordan achieve regionally balanced and equitable growth including
access to services, employment opportunities, and private investments outside Amman, enhancing
social protection, reforming the vocational and training sector, and on supporting the
implementation of the Government’s medium-term development program in the context of the
current global financial crisis and economic slowdown. The GoJ has also sought technical support
from the Bank (many underpinned by diagnostic work). The Bank provided programmatic technical
support in key areas, including public expenditure management, social insurance, poverty
monitoring, and energy sector reform.
4.
The World Bank Group (WBG) team is currently preparing a new Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) for FY 2011–14 with the overarching goal “strengthening resilience for sustainable
growth”. It envisages supporting the Jordanian economy by seeking sources of endogenous growth
that maximize the country’s comparative advantages in the region while reducing its dependence
on external financial flows (aid, investment, remittances). It supports the Government’s central
objectives of growth generation, poverty reduction and social inclusion as expressed in the National
Agenda and the newly developed Executive Plan.
5.
The following three interlinked strategic clusters, which build on the new Executive agenda
of the GoJ and are directly aligned with the overarching objective of the CPS, are proposed to guide
the consultation process:

7
•

Cluster 1: Greater efficiency and capacity of public sector (including public expenditures,
improved fiscal management and improved service delivery to all stakeholders);

•

Cluster 2: Enabling environment for private sector development, including investment in
strategic infrastructure through the use of PPPs and improvements to the investment
climate as well as reforming and modernizing public procurement.

•

Cluster 3: Enhanced human development and social stability through better quality
education (better matched to labor market needs) and targeted assistance to the poor.

6.
Although the clusters are presented separately, the linkages between the sectors and the
interlinked reform agendas will be emphasized. Throughout the preparation and implementation of
the CPS, the WBG will make use of its comparative advantage of working in an integrated manner
on the cross-sectoral issues such as gender and regional integration. The CPS envelope is at this
stage indicative but will possibly include technical assistance, budget support and analytical
services that reflect the emerging needs with respect to short-term financial challenges and
longer-term institutional developments.
7.
World Bank Group support to private sector development will continue to focus on
improving the investment environment, public private partnership, partial risk guarantees for major
projects (envisaged to attract private sector participation and to provide a better financial package
for critical projects in water and energy), and, in the case of IFC, direct investment. IFC is playing a
key role in supporting most of the strategic projects in Jordan. The GoJ has brought a number of
key infrastructure projects to the market for private participation. IFC is well positioned to support
and mobilize financing to a number of these projects. The IFC’s advisory activities in Jordan intend
to fill the gaps and address critical areas for private sector development, such as improving the
investment climate.

8

8.

Annex III. Jordan: Statistical Issues
(As of July 30, 2010)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance purposes.
National Accounts: During the past few years, progress has been made toward enhancing
the quality of national accounts statistics. Continued improvement requires a strong
commitment and allocation of additional resources. Additional efforts are needed to improve
quarterly estimates of the national accounts from the production approach and the annual
estimates from the expenditure approach, as well as the coverage of informal activities.
Also, discrepancies between the industrial production index and the gross value added
estimates for the manufacturing sector need to be addressed. New surveys have been
implemented to improve the compilation and timeliness of wages and earnings data.
Government finance. The authorities have initiated work aimed at developing a financial
balance sheet in accordance with the classification and sectorization systems recommended
by the GFSM 2001 aimed at further strengthening the stock and flow data that serve as a
source for compiling government finance statistics and for verification of internal and
intersectoral consistency.
Monetary statistics: The Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) informed the 2003 data ROSC
Update mission that the CBJ Research Department, which is responsible for the collection
and compilation of the monetary statistics, proposed the establishment of an interagency
group to monitor the intersectoral consistency of macroeconomic statistics. However,
consistency checks between government finance statistics and monetary statistics are not
yet conducted. Timeliness of reporting monetary data for publication in International
Financial Statistics is satisfactory. However, little progress has been achieved so far in
implementing the Standardized Report Forms for reporting monetary data to the Fund.
Balance of payments: The CBJ has adopted the methodology of the fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5) for the compilation of the BOP statistics and the
international investment position (IIP), and has disseminated data in the BPM5 format. The
implementation of surveys in the area of services is important for further improving the
quality of the BOP statistics. In mid-2010 the CBJ revised the historical BOP data (2000–08)
to address the sharp increase in errors and omissions.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Subscriber to the Fund’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since
January 2010. Uses SDDS flexibility option on
the periodicity and timeliness of the labor
market wages/earnings data.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with Jordan
On September 15, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the 2010 Article IV consultation1 with Jordan on a lapse of time basis. Under the
IMF’s lapse of time procedures, the Executive Board completes Article IV consultations without
convening formal discussions.
Background
The global economic downturn adversely affected economic activity in Jordan. Real Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) growth fell from almost 7⅓ percent in 2008 to 2⅓ percent in 2009,
mainly due to weaker activity in the finance, manufacturing, and trade sectors. Headline inflation
declined steadily through 2009 to near zero, in line with lower commodity prices worldwide,
although core inflation has remained stable at around 3 percent year on year by
December 2009. For 2010 headline inflation is projected to increase in line with imported
commodity (energy and food) prices.
Lower commodity prices helped improve Jordan’s external position. The current account deficit
narrowed to 5 percent of GDP in 2009 (from 9½ percent in 2008), on the back of strong tourism
receipts and remittances and lower oil imports. Foreign direct investment (FDI) and other

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

inflows comfortably financed the current account deficit, and allowed official foreign reserves to
reach a record high of US$11 billion (equivalent to eight months of imports) by end-2009.
Similar to many emerging market countries adversely affected by the global growth downturn,
Jordan’s already-difficult 2009 fiscal position worsened due to a significant deterioration in
external grants. While an increase in capital spending—to support domestic activity—was
largely offset by lower commodity subsidies, a cyclical weakening in domestic revenues and a
dramatic downturn in external grants induced a widening of the overall deficit by more than
3 percentage points of GDP, reaching 8½ percent of GDP in 2009. As a result, the debt-to-GDP
ratio rose to about 56 percent at end-2009.
The government responded to the growth downturn with effective fiscal consolidation measures.
Based on the latest developments and macroeconomic assumptions, the 2010 overall deficit is
expected to narrow by more than 2 percent of GDP relative to the 2009 outturn, reaching about
6 percent of GDP. With lower projected grant receipts and the continued cyclical decline in tax
revenues, the consolidation will come mainly from the spending side—involving greater
prioritization of capital spending and savings in current expenditures, including from
containment of the public sector wage bill and reductions in the operating costs of public
institutions and independent agencies. Implementation of these fiscal plans would result in a
modest uptick in the public debt-to-GDP ratio, which would nonetheless remain below the
60-percent legislated debt ceiling.
The Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) has successfully maintained financial stability by undertaking
a series of forceful measures to support growth of private sector credit and moderate the impact
of the slowdown. Starting in 2008, the authorities responded to the downturn in domestic credit
by: issuing a full guarantee of bank deposits, which has been extended until end-2010; ceasing
liquidity-withdrawal operations (through CBJ sales of certificates of deposit) in October 2008;
and gradually reducing reserve requirements and policy interest rates between November 2008
and February 2010, thereby reducing the interest rate differential against the U.S. Federal
Reserve’s funds rate from 450 to 200 basis points. Deposit growth has remained healthy, and
the share of dinar-denominated deposits has continued to increase.
Private sector credit growth turned positive at end-2009, reaching 5½ percent year on year
in May 2010. Contributions from credit to construction, tourism, and trade sectors
have been increasing since their lowest point in September 2009. Following the
latest (February 2010) cuts in the policy rate, the accumulation of excess liquidity in the
overnight window of the CBJ has reversed. Encouraged by declining interest rate spreads
relative to advanced countries, international reserves have stabilized at historically-high levels.
The Jordanian dinar real effective exchange rate has appreciated by 2½ percent between
December 2008 and June 2010, mainly due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against
major currencies.

3

The Jordanian banking system remains sound and has proven resilient to the global financial
crisis. The CBJ’s prudent banking regulation and supervision, and banks’ conservative funding
practices (with loan/deposit ratio near 75 percent) have shielded domestic banks from exposure
to troubled international banks, structured products, and wholesale financial markets. The
banking sector’s macroprudential indicators remain strong—banks remain profitable and well
capitalized, deposits continue to be the major funding base, liquidity ratios and provisioning
remain high, while non-performing loans (NPL) ratios increased modestly to 6⅔ percent of
outstanding loans at end-2009.
Effective banking supervision has strengthened the capacity of Jordanian banks to withstand
shocks. The CBJ has taken steps to further enhance its effective banking regulation and
supervision by: (i) introduction of Basle II (Pillars I and III) regulations in 2008, and ongoing
efforts to ensure compliance of banks with Pillar II guidelines for risk management; (ii) requiring
semi-annual stress testing of banks, examining in particular credit risk and concentration risk;
(iii) introduction of an automated data collection system, to improve off-site monitoring of banks;
(iv) enhanced cross-border bank regulation through regular supervision and on-site inspections
of international branches and subsidiaries of Jordanian banks; and (v) improvements to its early
warning system.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2010 Article IV consultation with Jordan, Executive Directors endorsed staff’s
appraisal, as follows:
Following a decade of strong growth, the Jordanian economy has slowed, largely due to the
global and regional downturn. Economic activity is expected to pick up modestly in 2010, and
accelerate further over the medium-term, as growth revives in key regional trading partners,
bringing Jordanian output closer to potential.
The authorities have implemented prudent fiscal and monetary policies, which have ensured
fiscal sustainability and supported the domestic financial system. Even in the presence of a
cyclical downturn in economic activity, the government has proceeded with its fiscal
consolidation plans for 2010 and the medium term. Fully implemented, this should contribute to
a significant reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio, and provide for a major amelioration of fiscal
vulnerabilities. Similarly, the monetary authorities implemented cautious monetary easing in the
period between late-2008 and early-2010, in an effort to raise private sector credit flows, and
also took the opportunity provided by abundant capital inflows to bolster international reserves.
In view of the shortfall in external grants and the authorities’ desire to signal to markets their
seriousness in ensuring fiscal sustainability, the staff supports the fiscal consolidation envisaged
in the 2010 Budget. Staff believes that the decline in the overall deficit of about 2 percent of

4

GDP this year is both appropriate and achievable, and would leave fiscal room for an envisaged
increase in social expenditures, while maintaining sizeable capital expenditures. While
implementation of these fiscal plans would result in a small rise in the public debt-to-GDP ratio
in 2010, it would still remain below the 60 percent legislated debt ceiling.
The authorities’ objective of reducing the fiscal deficit to about 3 percent of GDP over the
medium term is critical to achieving private sector-led growth and reducing vulnerabilities.
Reducing the overall deficit by about 3 percent of GDP over the next five years is feasible,
based on the experience of other countries, and would lead to a further 5 percentage point
decline in Jordan’s debt-to-GDP ratio. Such adjustment will be crucial to maintain investor
confidence, preserve macroeconomic stability, and create scope for future countercyclical fiscal
policy. Efficiency gains in both revenue-raising and expenditure will help durably address
Jordan’s main fiscal vulnerabilities. Priorities include removing remaining tax exemptions on
commodities, ongoing prioritization of capital spending, and continued moderation of growth in
the public sector wage bill.
Significant progress has been made in advancing structural reforms, yet the Jordanian
authorities continue to face a number of policy challenges. In the near-term, further
improvement in the business environment for the private sector will be key to raising productivity
and building upon Jordan’s external competitiveness. Staff supports the recent enhancements
to income taxation and investment policy, and recommends that additional reform priorities
include further liberalization of important business inputs (particularly energy and water sectors),
as well as the achievement of greater public sector efficiencies through implementation of civil
service reforms.
The medium-term fiscal strategy should be supported by a number of institutional reforms.
These include strengthening tax administration and reenergizing the implementation of public
sector financial management reforms. In an effort to relieve infrastructure bottlenecks, the
authorities plan an ambitious medium-term program of large-scale infrastructure development,
to be largely financed by public-private partnerships (PPPs). As an important prior action, the
staff recommends that a strong framework needs to be put in place to minimize the risk of
contingent liabilities stemming from PPPs.
Monetary policy has rightly focused on monetary easing in 2009–10 to stimulate domestic
demand, yet there should now be a pause on further monetary stimulus. Since late 2008 the
authorities have taken several steps to support the domestic financial system, including multiple
reductions in the policy rate and cessation of issuance of certificates of deposit. Jordan’s current
stock of international reserves is large and stable, and given the growing turnaround in private
sector credit flows and some evidence of emerging inflationary pressures, the staff recommends
that the monetary authorities stand ready to tighten monetary conditions as appropriate.

5

The fixed exchange rate regime remains important for financial stability. The Jordanian dinar’s
peg to the U.S. dollar has acted as an appropriate nominal anchor for the economy. Analysis by
the staff of the real effective exchange rate indicates that the dinar remains broadly aligned with
its medium-term fundamentals. In addition, the risk of external instability emanating from the
capital account is lowered by the fact that most external debt consists of obligations to official
creditors, and reserves far exceed short-term external liabilities.
Bank regulation and supervision should continue to focus on preventing excessive risk taking.
The banks’ conservative funding and asset structures, underpinned by effective banking
supervision and regulation, have limited exposures to adverse global liquidity conditions. As a
consequence, the banking sector’s macroprudential indicators remain strong. Nonetheless,
bank supervision and regulation should remain vigilant, as Jordanian banks could be exposed
to higher non-performing loans and provision requirements in the coming years, as output
growth is likely to remain below trend until 2012.
Given Jordan’s large stock of debt, it will be important to have clear, timely and proactive
communication of policy intentions for debt reduction and debt management, in large part to
build ownership for necessary fiscal reforms. Communication of the government’s medium-term
debt management strategy will be particularly relevant, as will enhancements to the primary and
secondary markets for public debt.
While substantial progress in improving data quality and coverage has occurred in recent years,
the statistical system needs to be further improved. Jordan is to be congratulated for its January
2010 subscription to the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard. Nonetheless, data
inadequacies persist, particularly in the areas of the expenditure side of the national accounts,
and in employment and wage statistics, which continue to hamper economic analysis and policy
formation. The staff urges greater progress in resolving these inadequacies.
