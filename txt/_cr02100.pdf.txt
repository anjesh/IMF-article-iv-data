Box 5. Medium-Term Fiscal Outlook
While recent budget deficits are partly cyclical, there has also been a structural deterioration in
the fiscal position. A government Task Force on the Review of Public Finances has found rising
structural deficits in recent years that will continue in the future unless corrective measures are taken:
•
•
•
•
•

Revenues from land sales and taxes will remain much lower than during the asset bubble of the
mid-1900s. Lower property prices and active competition have also eroded profit tax revenue.
Investment income from fiscal reserves has fallen as a share of revenues, and would fall further
if fiscal deficits persist.
Direct tax revenue may decline as Hong Kong SAR businesses increase investments abroad, as
only Hong Kong SAR-based profits and salaries are subject to tax.
The government expenditure deflator has tended to rise faster than the general price level,
raising the expenditure/GDP ratio even if real spending growth has not exceeded real GDP
growth.

Without measures, continued sizable deficits are
projected into the future (Chart A). Assuming
unchanged revenue and expenditure policies and a
return to a trend growth of about 3-3.5 percent, fiscal
deficits of 4-5 percent of GDP are projected in the
medium term. This would exhaust fiscal reserves by
2008/09, followed by a rising debt burden.

The FY2002 budget proposed in March outlines the government’s strategy for returning to a
balanced budget over the next four years (Chart B). It envisages to eliminate the overall budget
deficit as well as that on current operations; reduce the public expenditure/GDP ratio to 20 percent or
lower; and stabilize fiscal reserves at the level of one year’s expenditures.
To achieve these goals, measures averaging about 1 1/2 percent of GDP per annum will be
required. The government’s medium-term plan emphasizes expenditure restraint, limiting real spending
growth to 1.5 percent per year starting in FY2003.
Chart B. Government Medium Term Budget Projections, 2001-2006
The authorities intend to review the entire public
(percent of GDP)
administration for possible cost savings (with an upfront 4.75 percent cut of civil service pay assumed in
late 2002). On revenues, an Advisory Committee on
New Broad-Based Taxes has concluded that a lowrated broad-based goods and services tax (GST) is
the best choice for broadening the tax base, with
higher taxes on the assessed rental value of
properties, lower personal income tax deductions,
and a land and sea departure tax cited as additional
options (albeit with significantly smaller yields than
GST). The government proposed to introduce a land
departure tax in FY2003 and explained that it would consider the other options carefully, for
implementation if necessary.

published in early March, that a low-rate broad-based goods and services tax (GST) would be
the best option to broaden the tax base. The staff noted that while the strong fiscal track
record provided a cushion to absorb temporary deficits, a comprehensive medium-term
deficit reduction plan was needed to address the underlying structural fiscal problem.
1.
The FY 2002 budget spells out the government’s commitment to balance the
budget over the next four years. This is to be achieved by reducing, from FY2003 onward,
the growth of public expenditure and modestly raising revenue, with a view to stabilizing
fiscal reserves at around one-year’s expenditures level (from 1.3 times expenditures
currently—Table 2). While this plan does not contain further specific measures (beyond the
FY2002 budget) in support of those goals, the authorities emphasized their commitment to
taking the necessary steps, including a comprehensive review of the public administration for
possible cost savings and careful consideration of all the options proposed by the Advisory
Committee on broadening the tax base. The staff agreed with the authorities that the current
cyclical juncture was not propitious for introducing a GST, but stressed that because of the
substantial lead time required, preparations for it should start as soon as possible.
A. Exchange Rate Policy
2.
The authorities remain firmly committed to the linked exchange rate system,
which has served Hong Kong SAR well. They noted that the record of strong fundamentals,
including prudent fiscal management and large reserves, flexible markets, and a strong
financial system had enabled the economy to adjust well to shocks under the link. In turn,
they agreed with the staff that keeping those conditions in place was critical to the continued
smooth operation of the link in the future. The authorities also observed that the link
underpinned confidence in Hong Kong SAR as a stable financial center, and provided a
transparent anchor for economic decision-making and market expectations.
3.
The linked exchange rate system is likely to remain the best option for Hong
Kong SAR, even with growing integration with the Mainland. The authorities explained
that the conditions in favor of a link with the U.S. dollar were likely to remain, including the
high correlation of cyclical movements between the two economies (given the importance of
entrepôt trade with the United States); the different stages of development of the Hong Kong
SAR and Mainland economies; and the role of the link as an anchor of expectations,
economic policy decisions, and confidence in Hong Kong SAR as a regional financial center.
The authorities considered that, based on fundamental economic linkages, a wider renminbi
trading band should not have adverse effects on the Hong Kong dollar, given the negligible
amount of trade competition with the Mainland and the limited impact of exchange rate
differentials on Hong Kong SAR’s major export to the Mainland—financial services. They
noted that while a wider trading band for the renminbi might attract more speculative proxy
trading of the Hong Kong dollar, the correlation between the Hong Kong dollar forward rates
and the renminbi non-deliverable futures rates had become substantially decoupled in recent
years.
