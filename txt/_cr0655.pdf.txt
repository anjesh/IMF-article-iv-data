INDIA
Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2005 Consultation with India
Approved by Wanda Tseng and Matthew Fisher
December 22, 2005
•

A staff team visited India from October 4–19 and met with Reserve Bank of India
Governor Reddy, Deputy Governor Mohan, Chairman, Prime Minister’s Economic
Advisory Council Rangarajan, Ministry of Finance Secretary Jha and other senior
officials as well as representatives from the private sector.

•

The team comprised Ms. Tseng (Head), Messrs. Schiff and Fernandez,
Mmes. Purfield and Poirson (all APD), and Messrs. Flanagan (FAD), Rozhkov
(MFD), and Wattleworth (Senior Resident Representative). Messrs. Misra, Executive
Director, and Prasad, Advisor, also participated in the discussions.

•

The last Article IV consultation was concluded on January 24, 2005 and the staff
report published as IMF Country Report No. 05/86. Since then, India has conducted
monetary policy prudently and met fiscal targets in the first year of the fiscal
responsibility law, in line with Board recommendations. Tariff reductions and capital
account liberalization continued, and a state VAT and other reforms were introduced
to reduce states’ deficits. These have also been the Fund’s consistent advice.
However, while India remains committed to medium-term fiscal consolidation, tax
base broadening and subsidy reform have not proceeded as fast as planned. Moreover,
oil price pass-through has remained partial, although plans for an automatic pricing
mechanism are under consideration. Some structural reforms advocated by the Fund,
including liberalization of labor laws and privatization, have stalled, and further
opening of the banking sector to private and foreign participation has been delayed.

•

India has accepted the obligations of Article VIII Sections 2, 3, and 4. One restriction
subject to Article VIII provisions was removed, but others remain in place. India’s
exchange rate regime is a managed float.

•

India subscribes to, and is currently in observance of, the Special Data Dissemination
Standard. India has undertaken an FSAP and a fiscal ROSC in the context of the 2001
Article IV consultation, and is participating in the coordinated compilation of
financial sector indicators. A Data ROSC was published in April 2004.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

India’s economic performance continues to be impressive for the third year
running. Real GDP growth exceeded 8 percent y/y in the first half of 2005/06, led by
strong domestic demand. Inflation remained low through August 2005, but has risen
in recent months reflecting higher pass-through of world oil price increases and
robust demand. Real GDP growth should moderate to 6¾ percent in 2006/07 as the
economy adjusts to high oil prices and rising domestic and global interest rates.
Stronger-than-expected domestic demand supported by fast credit growth poses key
upside risks to growth and inflation.

•

Macroeconomic policies in the near term need to remain focused on warding off
inflationary pressures. Overperformance on the budget would help address demand
pressures and also strengthen the credibility of the Fiscal Responsibility Law
(FRBMA). The October hike in interest rates was appropriate, and staff encouraged
the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to remain vigilant in view of upside risks. Staff also
welcomed the RBI’s commitment to increased exchange rate flexibility.

•

The government’s medium-term fiscal strategy is broadly appropriate and faster
implementation is key. There was agreement on the need for tax base broadening.
However, staff noted that implementation of the government’s 2004 roadmap to
increase tax revenue had fallen behind schedule, and reiterated the need to broaden
the revenue base by quickly removing exemptions and introducing a goods and
services tax. To help create fiscal space for infrastructure and priority social spending,
the authorities should also implement subsidy reform and address fast-rising pension
outlays through parametric changes. Recent changes in center-state relations should
support state-level adjustment. There was agreement that strengthened conditionality
and tighter global borrowing limits may be required if all states are to achieve the
fiscal consolidation targets.

•

India’s growth spurt provides a golden opportunity to fast-forward the
government’s structural reform agenda. The government is rightly focused on
improving infrastructure, opening and liberalizing further the Indian economy, and
alleviating poverty. Tariff reduction and liberalization of foreign investment could be
further accelerated. Steps to improve the business climate and regulatory
environment, and reform of restrictive labor laws could have large pay-offs in terms
of foreign investment and job creation. Such reforms will require building political
consensus but are key for India to fully utilize its positive demographics.

•

Banking sector health continues to improve, but rapid credit growth present a
new challenge. The credit boom is a welcome sign of financial deepening, although
regulations could be further tightened, in line with best international practices, to
prevent a possible deterioration in credit quality.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
India’s economic performance continues to be impressive. For the third year
running, growing openness and rising consumer and investor confidence are helping sustain
rapid growth, buoying foreign investor interest. Real per capita incomes have risen by over
50 percent over the past decade,
igniting consumer expenditure, and

India’s total exports rose to about
one–third, up from less than one–
fourth in 2000.
2.
However, the evolving macroeconomic situation is presenting policy challenges.
Rapidly rising domestic demand, a widening trade and current account deficit, and
inflationary pressures are key risks to the near-term outlook. The Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) has recently raised interest rates, but fiscal policy is adding to demand pressures,
reflecting higher outlays on priority infrastructure and social programs and higher transfers to
the states.
3.
In the medium term, bridging the income and poverty gap will require India to
sustain and improve on current growth rates by forcefully addressing its entrenched
structural problems. Poverty remains high and concentrated in the rural areas, with
35 percent of the population living on less than a dollar a day in 2000. India’s social
indicators continue to lag those of many East Asian countries a quarter of a century ago
(India Planning Commission, Mid-Term Appraisal of the Tenth Five Year Plan (2002–
2007)), and achieving the Millennium Development Goals will be difficult (Table 1). Despite
facing some of the region’s lowest labor costs, inadequate infrastructure and power, and
burdensome red tape have hampered competitiveness. The structural reform agenda is
well-known to the authorities. Continued priorities of the Congress-led coalition government
include further opening and liberalizing the Indian economy, addressing infrastructure
weaknesses, and alleviating rural poverty.
4.
Building political consensus for major reforms remains a challenge. After a
promising start under the Congress-led government—including the introduction of VAT, the
lifting of several FDI restrictions, and continued tariff reductions over the past year—reforms
have slowed. Opposition from several political parties that support the governing coalition
from outside have halted privatization, slowed liberalization of foreign investment and power

–6–

sector reform, and stalled labor and agricultural reform. With the opposition winning an
absolute majority in recent state assembly elections in Bihar, and elections forthcoming in the
Left Front strongholds of Kerala and West Bengal, the near–term prospects for moving ahead
with broader reforms are uncertain.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
5.
India’s growth is robust and
becoming more broad–based. GDP
growth in 2004/05, at nearly 7 percent,
was again above trend, as rapid growth in
services broadened to encompass
industry.1 The contribution to growth of
domestic demand has been larger than in
most emerging markets in Asia. Strong
momentum in manufacturing and
services continued in the first half
of 2005/06 and GDP growth accelerated
to over 8 percent y/y (Table 2). Capacity
utilization has risen, and business
confidence has soared to a 10–year high
(Figure 1). Growth is set to exceed
7½ percent in 2005/06, led by private
investment and household demand, and
supported by fast credit growth, a normal
monsoon, and accommodative monetary
and fiscal policies.

The external current account
has shifted into deficit reflecting strong
domestic demand and high oil prices.
The trade deficit widened to over 5¼ percent of GDP in 2004/05 and the current account
reverted into deficit for the first time in three years notwithstanding high growth in exports of
goods and services (Figure 2 and Table 3). In the first quarter of 2005/06, goods exports
continued to grow robustly—up 22 percent y/y led by engineering and chemicals—but a
large increase in both oil and non–oil imports caused the trade deficit to reach 2 percent of
projected annual GDP.2 Since then, exports and imports have remained buoyant, growing by
21 percent and 30 percent y/y, respectively, in July-October.

Non–customs imports —in part, defense–related— rose sharply, accounting for about two–

7.
Continued strong capital inflows have offset the impact of the widening external
deficit on the balance of payments. In 2004/05, almost one-half of inflows were
debt-creating as Indian corporates took advantage of favorable global interest rates, an
appreciating rupee, and the liberalization of restrictions on external commercial borrowings
to borrow abroad. FDI inflows remained weak, but portfolio inflows have gained importance
since late 2003. Capital inflows remained strong and reserves rose modestly so far this fiscal
year ($1.6 billion) despite the widening current account deficit. Although growing reliance
on more volatile debt–creating and portfolio inflows has increased India’s susceptibility to
changes in investor sentiment, ample reserve coverage and remaining capital controls
mitigate the impact of potential reversals (Box 1 and Table 4).
8.
The RBI has allowed increased two–way flexibility in the exchange rate. In the
eight months to June 2005, the RBI scaled back intervention in foreign exchange markets,
and the rupee appreciated by 4 percent against the dollar (6½ percent in real effective terms).
Since then—with the exception of a six–week period following China’s July 21 revaluation,
when the RBI intervened in response to a pickup in capital inflows—the rupee has
depreciated, reflecting pressures from the growing current account deficit and renewed
U.S. dollar strength, and the RBI has largely refrained from intervening.

Box 1. How Vulnerable is India to a Change in Investor Sentiment?
Capital flows into India have surged in recent years
tripling to about $32 billion per annum. These inflows
had contributed to the accumulation of international
reserves, but with rising world oil prices and the pickup in
domestic demand, capital inflows are now financing a
growing current account deficit.

Private capital flows
(Left axis)

Debt-creating flows dominate private capital inflows.
Debt-creating-non-portfolio flows primarily reflect banking
capital and external commercial borrowings (ECBs), and to
a much smaller extent, trade-related credits. India attracts
relatively little FDI, and as Indian firms invest abroad, the
share of net FDI in total private capital inflows has fallen to
about 10 percent. However, portfolio investments are
becoming increasingly important and they now account for
about one-third of total private capital inflows. These flows
mainly enter the equity market—capital controls limit
foreign investors access to debt markets—where they
account for about 6 percent of market turnover and about
13 percent of market capitialization.1/ As debt-creating and
portfolio inflows are more volatile than FDI, growing
reliance on such flows to finance the current account deficit
leaves India more susceptible to reversals.

Large international reserves and capital controls provide a buffer against reversals. Reserves exceed the
stock of portfolio investments, NRI deposits, and short-term residual maturity external debt by about $50 billion.
In addition, capital controls, particularly on volatile inflows like ECBs, remain in place. ECB approvals are
capped at $9 billion per annum, and are subject to end-use, term, and prepayment restrictions that help limit
vulnerability. Foreign investment in debt is capped at $2.25 billion. Nonetheless, while reserves provide a
cushion, especially in the context of a system of capital controls, the growing reliance on capital inflows further
underscores the need for sound macroeconomic policies.

including high vacancy rates in new

in selected sectors. Concerned with
speculative pressures, the RBI has raised
risk–weights on housing and real estate

investments aimed at curbing speculative
FDI inflows (see paragraph 33).

tightening (Figure 4).

Following three years of declining
fiscal deficits, a “pause” in deficit
reduction was announced for 2005/06.
The central government fiscal deficit came
in below target in 2004/05 for the second
consecutive year, helped by a cyclical
rebound in revenue and expenditure
compression, but also reflecting greater
recourse to off–budget petroleum subsidies
(Table 6).3 The current deficit was reduced

Box 2. The Impact of Higher Oil Prices
Despite recent price increases, the passthrough of international prices remains
incomplete. After an increase of about
7 percent in September, domestic gasoline
and diesel prices remain around 10 percent
below import parity levels (nevertheless, at
$0.96 and $0.67 per liter respectively, they
are relatively high because of taxes). Prices
of kerosene and LPG, however, require
much larger increases. To limit price
increases, the government has also lowered
oil taxes and partly replaced ad valorem
with specific excises. The average price
adjustment required in India to achieve full
pass-through is similar to that in other
countries in Asia.

required under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBMA).4 With
higher revenue and expenditure compression also helping states reduce their deficits, staff
estimates that the general government actual and structural deficit fell below 7½ percent of
GDP, enough to stabilize public debt at around 86 percent of GDP (Table 7).5 In 2005/06, the
central government overall and current deficit targets of 4.3 percent of GDP and 2.7 percent
of GDP, respectively, fall short of the minimum reductions required by the FRBMA. This
reflects increased social and infrastructure outlays and higher transfers to states
recommended by the Twelfth Finance Commission (TFC)6 (Box 3 and Figure 5). The budget
implies a rise in the general government actual and structural deficit to 7¾ percent of GDP,
imparting a pro–cyclical impulse to the economy. The higher deficit has been comfortably
financed—largely domestically—so far, with nearly 70 percent of government market
borrowings completed by end-October. Reflecting easy liquidity conditions, yields on the
10-year benchmark bond have softened by 13 basis points since end-April.
12.
The banking sector continues to strengthen but risks remain. Commercial banks
have continued to reduce NPAs, largely reflecting the pickup in credit but also gains in NPL
recovery7 and favorable economic conditions, and aggregate capital adequacy remains high
(Table 8 and Figure 6). Banks have reduced their exposure to interest rate risk, decreasing
their holdings of government paper and shortening maturity. Declining profitability due to
rising interest rates has been in part offset by higher credit growth. However, interest rate risk
remains a concern with bank holdings of government paper (at 38 percent of assets) still in
excess of statutory requirements; rapid credit growth raises concerns about credit quality
(Box 4); and cooperative banks (accounting for about 6 percent of banking system assets)
remain in poor health.
13.
Looking ahead, staff expects economic activity to moderate and inflation to rise
in the near–term. Real GDP growth is projected at 7½ percent in 2005/06, and is expected
to decline slightly to below 7 percent in 2006/07, reflecting further pass-through of higher oil
prices and rising global and domestic interest rates (Table 9). Inflation should rise from
5¼ percent in 2005/06 to 6¾ percent in 2006/07, reflecting the expected upward adjustment

The incentive to take part in the TFC’s

states. The combined incentive for all
states is larger than that in previous
finance commissions, but it varies state by
state. Some states will receive
comparatively little debt relief in relation
to the primary adjustment they need to
achieve. The center will ensure that all
states adhere to their fiscal adjustment
paths by enforcing a tighter state

India had the fastest rate of credit growth in Asia in 2004/05. In the year ending in March 2005,
bank credit grew by over 30 percent, the ratio of private sector credit to GDP grew to around
40 percent, and the aggregate credit-to-deposit ratio exceeded 60 percent. However, credit remains

nonperforming loans (8 percent on average) and reports of unfair market practices, point to the
possibility of future problems.1/

in fuel prices.8 The possibility of an acceleration in domestic demand supported by credit
growth poses a key upside risk to growth and inflation. A more rapid than expected rise in
world interest rates, either because of a disorderly global rebalancing or inflationary
pressures in the United States, would hit India’s exports, but the impact would likely be more
modest than elsewhere in Asia, as India is still relatively closed.
14.
India’s medium-term prospects are bright provided that key fiscal and
structural reforms are implemented. Staff projects growth at 6½ percent annually in the
medium–term, but agreed with the authorities that growth could reach their objective of
8 percent in a reform scenario where successful fiscal adjustment creates space for needed
infrastructure and social spending and structural reforms accelerate. Long-term growth
prospects are aided by favorable demographics, which has the potential to raise savings and
employment substantially over the next several decades. However, job creation and
commensurate investments in human capital and infrastructure are key to realize this
potential, especially as 60 percent of the increase in working age population over the next 40
years is projected to occur in the four slowest growing states. Slow reforms would leave
growth closer to its recent historical average of 6 percent. The fiscal outlook would worsen in
such a scenario, with the general government deficit rising, and the positive growth–interest
differential fading by 2010/11. The resulting rise in debt from already high levels would
increase vulnerabilities, and continued high deficits could stunt financial sector reform and
capital account liberalization, and crowd–out private investment.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
15.
Discussions focused on the policies needed to address inflationary pressures and
to achieve India’s medium–term growth potential. Staff noted that, while short-term
prospects are favorable, risks have increased since the last Article IV consultation, with
higher oil prices, rising inflation and current account deficits, and fast credit growth. In this
light, macroeconomic policy in the near term needed to be geared toward keeping
inflationary pressures in check. The authorities were in broad agreement regarding the
economic outlook, but were somewhat less concerned about domestic demand pressures,
arguing that India’s potential growth had increased in the last several years. Over the medium
term, far-reaching structural reforms would also be needed to address long-standing
constraints on growth and absorptive capacity. Acknowledging political constraints, the staff
sought to focus on issues where near-term progress is most likely, and to bring value added
by presenting international experience in specific areas, including tax base broadening,
energy policy, and dealing with risks from rapid credit growth.

A. How Can India Deal with Short-Term Risks?
Fiscal Policy
16.
Overperformance on the 2005/06 budget would be appropriate. Staff stressed that
this would not only counter demand pressures and help achieve a more balanced policy mix
to address inflationary risks, but also allow the authorities to meet targets envisaged by the
FRBMA and strengthen its credibility. The authorities noted that they were seeking to do so,
pointing to the potential for revenue overperformance and limited expenditure savings. In
particular, VAT introduction on April 1 in 20 states has proceeded well so far, and
compensation needs are expected to be less–than–budgeted.9 However, they noted that
expenditure pressures, including higher social and infrastructure outlays and transfers to
states mandated by the TFC, would likely limit the reduction in the overall deficit to about
0.2 percentage points of GDP, maintaining a downward trend in the deficit as a percent of
GDP, but not sufficient to meet FRBMA targets.
17.
Staff argued that incomplete oil price pass–through was adding to budgetary
pressures and preventing adjustment of demand to permanent price changes. With high
oil prices likely to be permanent, a move to full pass–through with adequate compensation
mechanisms for the poor would serve India well by curbing rising quasi–fiscal costs, 10 and
encouraging improvements in energy efficiency, which would also help preserve India’s
competitiveness over time. Staff supported the recommendations of the government’s 2004
report on central subsidies to phase-out LPG subsidies, which are regressive, and to improve
the targeting of kerosene subsidies, given large leakages. In the short run, the latter could be
achieved by restricting subsidies to below-poverty-line (BPL) households under the existing
ration card system. Over time, staff encouraged the authorities to replace subsidies with
targeted support, such as cash transfers to the poor. Together with the reintroduction of an
automatic pricing mechanism (APM) for petroleum products, these steps would pave the way
to eventual full price liberalization. To avoid high ad valorem taxes amplifying price shocks,
staff advised a switch to specific petroleum taxation, in a revenue neutral manner and with
annual automatic inflation indexation.
18.
The authorities recognized that high oil prices were likely to last, something to
which policies had to adjust. A committee headed by the chairman of the Prime Minister’s
Economic Council is looking into the issue of petroleum pricing and taxation. However, such
measures faced political obstacles in the near–term, and compensating the poor could be
technically difficult. In the interim, ad hoc and partial adjustments were likely to continue
9

VAT receipts rose 14 percent y/y in the first half of 2005/06. These preliminary estimates
may overstate revenues as some states’ VAT laws delay provision of refunds by up to a year.

and the central government was considering compensating oil companies for part of their
losses by issuing them bonds. The authorities also called for more transparency in world oil
markets. Over time, acquisition of oil assets abroad by state-owned oil companies and efforts
to develop alternative energy sources would help India bolster energy security. Staff
cautioned against quasi-fiscal risks arising from asset acquisitions and pressed the need to
record the oil bond transaction transparently as a budgetary subsidy.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
19.
A monetary policy response was needed to ward off inflationary pressures. Staff
suggested that a modest interest rate hike would help keep inflation expectations in check,
and allow India to adjust to an environment of rising global interest rates. The RBI
acknowledged that the oil price rise made it difficult to contain inflation in the range of
5-5½ percent projected earlier without an appropriate policy response, and stood ready to
respond to evolving circumstances as warranted. In the event, RBI raised the reverse repo
rate, its key policy rate, to 5¼ percent at its mid-term October policy review, pointing to
upside inflationary pressures from oil prices in the context of incomplete pass-through, and
also noting higher world interest rates. With risks to demand and inflation still on the upside,
the RBI needs to monitor conditions closely and stand ready to tighten further if needed.
20.
There was agreement that appreciation of the rupee over the past year had not
undermined competitiveness. In particular, staff estimates of the real equilibrium exchange
rate derived using an extended PPP approach suggest that the exchange rate was fairly valued
at end-2004 and India’s rising share in global export markets suggests that competitiveness is
not a problem.11 Staff welcomed the RBI’s commitment to two–way flexibility in the
exchange rate—as demonstrated by its absence from foreign exchange markets for much
of 2005—which should boost incentives for corporates to hedge foreign exchange exposures.
The large stock of reserves had enabled India to weather successfully a number of exogenous
shocks and the RBI did not see the current level of reserves as excessive. Given increased
reliance on more volatile capital inflows and a widening current account deficit, staff agreed
that the current level of reserves provided a useful buffer shock against potential reversals,
but underscored that given increased openness continued progress in structural reforms and
supporting macroeconomic policies were also needed to underpin investor confidence.
B. How Will the Targeted Fiscal Adjustment Be Achieved?
21.
The authorities’ medium–term fiscal roadmap provides a good framework for
reform, but accelerated implementation is key to achieve FRBMA targets. The
authorities envisage a revenue–led adjustment, as large spending needs—in particular for
infrastructure and priority social spending—limit the scope for closing the fiscal gap by
compressing outlays. On the spending side, the emphasis would be on improving efficiency,
including via the publication of an outcomes budget. Staff supported the revenue-led

level of the rupee, with large
uncertainties associated with each of these estimates. Determining the equilibrium exchange
rate is a daunting task particularly for an economy like India that is undergoing structural
change. Staff investigations using vector-error-correction models are a case in point. A
specification that incorporates trends in relative productivity, openness, and net foreign assets
suggests that at end-2004 the rupee was undervalued by about 15 percent. However, a similar

projections suggest that the mediumterm rise in tax revenue would be more
modest than targeted by the authorities. As a result, an additional ¾ percent of GDP in
non-interest current expenditure savings would be required to meet FRBM targets.
22.
The authorities agreed that expanding India’s narrow tax base was a key
priority of their medium-term fiscal strategy. While the 2004 roadmap envisaged
front-loaded measures—including the quick removal of exemptions and early introduction of
a national goods and services tax (GST)—the authorities have adopted a more gradual
approach. They would allow existing exemptions to lapse over the next four years, while
taking steps to track and publish tax expenditure estimates. In addition, ongoing expansion of
the services tax base and efforts at strengthening compliance via IT enhancements for tax
administration were already boosting revenue. The introduction of GST remained a
medium-term objective, which would require bringing remaining states into the VAT. Noting
that exemptions were pervasive,13 staff underscored that their removal—with grandfathering
if needed—and limits on the scope of tax incentives under the Special Economic Zones
Act 2005 were key to meet revenue needs. Given the necessary lead time, preparations for
the introduction of a GST with few exemptions should be accelerated, including by phasing–
out as planned the inter–state sales tax (CST) and by reaching agreement with states on
sharing of GST revenues. In the medium–run, staff advised a lowering of the personal
income tax exemption threshold, which is high compared to higher-income emerging
markets.

Management Act, 2003, July 2004, Ministry of Finance, India; and Central Government
Subsidies in India, December 2004, Ministry of Finance, India.

A recent study by the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy commissioned by the
Finance Ministry estimates that the annual cost of key tax exemptions, including for
small-scale enterprises, exports, underdeveloped regions, housing, and agriculture, exceeds
1½ percent of GDP. See also Chapter III of the Selected Issues.

– 19 –

23.
Expenditure restructuring would be needed to create fiscal space for priority
social and infrastructure spending. The government recently approved a rural employment
program (REGS) guaranteeing 100 days of public works employment per year per family
head.14 In addition, the 2005/06 budget provides for continued increases in education and
health spending, and a four-year program to provide basic infrastructure for the poor. The
staff pointed out that to make room for these priority expenditures, more progress was
needed in reforming subsidies, as recommended in the government’s 2004 report.15 The
authorities explained that these reforms face strong public resistance, and that they intended
to keep a lid on subsidies through efficiency improvements. They also remained committed
to containing the wage bill, although wage pressures were increasing, with the last civil
service pay awards in 1998. Although the REGS was not explicitly targeted to the poor, the
authorities’ plan to start the program on a pilot basis and ensure self–targeting through low
wages and strict work requirements. Over time, the staff suggested that consideration be
given to replacing the large number of welfare programs and implicit and explicit
subsidies—many of which are not well targeted—with a more formal social safety net.
24.
Center–state fiscal relations are being reformed to strengthen states finances.
The authorities expected that new debt relief incentives would induce states to pass and
implement fiscal responsibility laws targeting current balance by 2009, consistent with the
center’s own law. In addition, the center intended to enforce a global borrowing constraint
and promote greater reliance on market borrowing. While welcoming these measures, staff
noted that some states would remain under fiscal stress even after reaching deficit reduction
targets, while others would have difficulty achieving the targets.16 Addressing this would
require stronger adjustment paths for some states and tighter borrowing caps, supported by
better fiscal reporting by the states and a tighter link between grants and fiscal performance.
Recent steps to curb the growth of small savings deposits―against which states can borrow
without restrictions―are welcome.17 The staff also advised linking administered interest
rates on these savings schemes to market rates―something advocated by a series of
government reports—as a move toward their eventual elimination. The authorities agreed
that incentives were only part of the solution to state fiscal problems, in particular as
conditional grants were limited under India’s federal system. Nevertheless, harder budget
constraints would force states to undertake adjustment.

14

The annual cost of the program is estimated at about 1 percentage point of GDP once
implemented in all states, 90 percent of which would be borne by the central government.

15

The government’s 2004 subsidy report noted that the major subsidies are costly and not
well targeted, and advocated fundamental reforms to food and fertilizer subsidies.

25.
The pending passage of a Pension Bill will help improve long-term fiscal
sustainability and contribute to the development of the financial sector. In January 2004,
a mandatory defined contribution scheme for newly–recruited central government civil
servants was introduced, which 15 state governments have joined so far. The Pension Bill
would set up a new pensions regulator, and set guidelines for pension fund managers,
prudential norms, investments, and capital requirements. Pension coverage is expected to
increase over time as the system is extended on a voluntary basis to all states and parts of the
private sector. While welcoming these measures, staff pointed out that parametric changes to
the existing defined benefit pension system for civil servants—recommended in earlier
government reports—are also needed to ease the fiscal burden of budgetary pension outlays
and to control the size of unfunded pension liabilities.18 The authorities acknowledged the
fast growth of pension payments, and noted that some states had already undertaken
parametric reforms; but the central government favored waiting until the NPS was well
established before making changes.
C. How Can the Government Ease Infrastructure Bottlenecks?
26.
The government is attempting to close part of India’s infrastructure gap through
public-private partnerships (PPPs). The pace of infrastructure development has recently
increased in some sectors—including telecommunications, ports, and roads in and around
major cities. To encourage further private sector involvement, the authorities have issued
new sectoral guidelines, including model concessionary agreements for roads and ports; and
set up a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to help address the lack of long–term infrastructure
financing. The SPV would borrow domestically with government guarantee to finance
commercially viable projects with private participation.19 Staff welcomed these measures,
while emphasizing that better and more consistent regulatory practices, including
independent regulators in all sectors, would be key to increase private participation. While
the SPV provides a partial solution, it should be accompanied by financial reforms to expand
the investor base. In this context, key steps to develop long-term corporate debt markets
would include greater transparency in the issuance process, streamlining of registration
procedures and tax provisions, lower barriers to domestic and foreign institutional
participation, and development of derivatives trading.20 Staff also underscored the need to
reflect in the fiscal accounts all future fiscal risks, including those related to guarantees.
18

Following the 1990s civil service pay awards, pension outlays have risen to 2¼ percentage
points of GDP in 2004/05. The World Bank estimates that the unfunded pension liability of
central and state governments exceeds one–third of GDP.
19

The SPV borrowing limit for 2005/06 is set at Rs. 100 billion ($2.2 billion). The lead
banker will be responsible for project appraisal.

27.
Power bottlenecks remain a key constraint on growth. Technical and commercial
losses remain high, electricity shortages widespread, and tariff rates for industrial users are
not internationally competitive. Losses of state utilities, although diminishing, remain a large
drain on state finances. The government has continued implementation of the 2003
Electricity Act, which would allow for private operators in the sector but reforms have been
uneven at state-level, with a few states recently reintroducing free power for farmers.
The staff pressed the need for faster implementation of the Act—including the introduction
of regulatory guidelines to catalyze the restructuring of State Electricity Boards and increase
private participation. Although investor interest appears to be increasing recently, especially
in generation, regulatory uncertainties and doubts about the independence of state regulators
remain important constraints. The authorities were confident that the introduction of the
National Electricity Tariff Policy—which will set pricing rules and provide guidelines on
phasing out cross-subsidy surcharges—would help clarify the regulatory environment, and
that good outcomes in reforming states would put pressure on other states to enact reforms.
D. How Can India Develop a World Class Banking System?
28.
Enhancing financial intermediation and ensuring broader access to financial
services are key to promoting growth and poverty reduction in India. The health of the
banking system has improved dramatically in recent years. However, private credit at under
40 percent of GDP remains low, compared to over 100 percent for countries such as Korea
and Malaysia. Moreover, while a large branch network ensures an overall level of access to
banking services comparable with other
Demographic Branch Penetration
developing countries in the region, large
(In number of branches per 100,000 people)
segments of the population lack any
such access.21 Indian banks continue to
have one of the largest exposures to
government securities in the world, and
the banking sector is dominated by
public sector banks (PSBs) whose
prudential indicators, despite recent
improvements, remain less favorable
than those of new private and foreign
banks.

While the pickup in credit growth is a welcome sign of financial deepening, it
also raises concerns about credit quality. The authorities were well aware of risks from
rapid credit growth, and had taken steps to tighten prudential regulations. They noted that
banks have continued to show strong profitability and low impaired loans, the latter
reflecting improvements in risk management. The risks for banks’ asset quality from surging
21

No. 30740-IN.

– 22 –

asset prices were being handled with prudential measures, notably by tightening capital
market exposure limits and prudential norms on housing loans. Staff advised additional
prudential measures in selected sectors to bring regulations in line with best international
practices and raising risk weights on “priority sector” lending where NPLs were higher than
the average.22 Staff also expressed concern about fast-rising credit card debt and the high
delinquency rates in the sector. While welcoming the RBI’s close monitoring and steps to
curb unfair lending practices, staff stressed the need for greater consumer education.
Following the mission, the RBI announced an increase in general provisioning (with an
exemption for agricultural and SME sectors) and tighter supervision on lending to real estate
and other high risk sectors. The RBI is also considering the scope for additional steps,
including the tightening of loan classification norms and for introducing “special mention”
loans that would require provisions.
30.
The authorities plan to commence implementation of Basel II in 2007. Banks are
required to adopt the Standardized Approach for credit risk and Basic Indicator Approach for
operational risk by end–March 2007. In preparation for this move, the RBI is taking steps to
train supervisors, enhance monitoring of banks’ risk management systems, and improve
market discipline and disclosure practices of banks. In particular, the RBI plans to extend the
pilot project for risk–based supervision―currently covering 23 banks―to more banks. The
RBI also indicated that many banks would need to raise additional capital to satisfy the new
capital requirements.23 Staff emphasized that this was a more ambitious schedule than in
most other emerging market economies and noted that meeting the 2007 deadline would
require a rapid pace of skill advancement in the RBI and commercial banks.
31.
Cooperative banks do not present a systemic risk but the failure of a number of
such banks could affect confidence in the banking system. Staff urged the authorities to
align prudential regulations of urban cooperative banks with those of scheduled commercial
banks, which was in line with the RBI’s longer–run objective. Meanwhile, the RBI was
negotiating with key states to resolve the problem of dual oversight and developing a
supervisory framework for urban coops. Rural cooperative banks also remain in financial
distress, with NPAs reaching 35 percent in some banks, more than a third of rural coops
under–capitalized, and about a quarter unprofitable. Staff advised quick implementation of
recent recommendations to bring such institutions under RBI supervision with the regulatory
norms on par with those of scheduled commercial banks.
32.
The improving financial soundness of the banking sector provides an
opportunity to accelerate banking reforms. To encourage financial development, the RBI
22

Discussions with private sector banks suggest that implementation of Basel II norms would

capital.

– 23 –

has recently initiated banking reforms aimed at increasing public sector banks (PSBs)’
autonomy and gradually lifting restrictions on foreign competition (Box 6). While
acknowledging the authorities’ concerns regarding PSBs’ capacity to withstand increased
foreign competition in the near term, staff observed that international experience has shown
that increased foreign presence can be effective in improving banks’ performance by
increasing technical know–how and efficiency. Bringing forward the 2009 target date for
expanding FDI in domestic banks to include non-distressed banks and lifting the 10 percent
cap on voting rights—the latter contemplated under amendments to the Banking Act
currently in Parliament—would help accelerate foreign participation.. More generally,
increasing private involvement could spur efficiency gains. In the short run, allowing some
PSBs to raise additional capital by reducing their government share below the 51 percent
requirement would further this objective.24
33.
Greater emphasis should be given to addressing other impediments to the
development of the financial system. Staff advised the authorities to shift from a heavy
reliance on priority lending to removing roadblocks to lending such as remaining difficulties
in recovering assets, lack of well–developed credit registries, and weak accounting practices
in SMEs. The Securitization and Debt Recovery Act and the new credit registry were
positive developments but collateral requirements and limits on microfinance continue to
constrain potential. Measures considered by the RBI to develop the government securities
market via primary dealers and introduction of short selling are welcome. However, it will be
important to ensure that interest rates are market–determined—the government currently
retains the right to determine cut–off rates—and that steps are taken to deepen the market,
including expanding the institutional investor base and accelerating the use of derivatives.
Recent proposals to permit limited investment by domestic pension funds in local equity
markets would also help deepen India’s financial markets.
E. How Can India Benefit More from Globalization?
34.
The authorities were committed to decreasing customs duties to ASEAN levels
(9 percent) by 2009. Tariff reductions have continued in 2004/05, with the peak
non-agricultural tariff rate declining from 20 percent to 15 percent, and average tariffs falling
by 5 percentage points to 17 percent. Staff welcomed these developments and encouraged
faster liberalization. More rapid convergence to ASEAN levels would enhance
competitiveness and help the authorities reach their objective of doubling India’s share in
world trade.25 Efforts to streamline customs procedures—notably, through pilot projects to
24

With rapid credit growth and the need to meet Basel II capital norms, a number of public
banks with government ownership close to the 51 percent floor would need additional
capital.

25

Despite robust export growth in the last several years, India still only accounts for
2½ percent of the global trade in goods and services.

– 24 –

Box 6. Foreign Banks in India
In early 2005, the RBI announced a series of banking reforms, designed to give public banks
greater autonomy and to provide guidelines for foreign bank expansion. The authorities see it as
a new step in the continuing process of financial market liberalization. The intention of the reforms is
to increase public banks’ efficiency, while providing them breathing space by keeping some
restrictions on foreign competition until 2009. From 2005, foreign banks are allowed to establish
wholly-owned subsidiaries (previously only
Credit of Foreign Banks to Total Bank Credit, 2003 1/
branches were allowed). In addition, the RBI
plans to amend legislation to eliminate the
10 percent cap on the voting rights of foreign
banks. However, any acquisition of 5 percent
or more by a foreign bank will still require
RBI approval, and FDI is limited to private
banks identified for restructuring, with a limit
of 74 percent. Full national treatment for

Foreign banks currently account for about 7 percent of total assets of the banking system, and
5 percent of deposits. Although foreign banks can engage in all financial sector activities, foreign
presence in the Indian banking system (as captured by balance sheet data) is lower than in some other
emerging Asian countries, and significantly lower than in Latin America and Eastern Europe. In
contrast, foreign shareholders account for 21 percent of total trading in the Indian stock market—a
level similar to other Asian countries.
Empirical studies show that larger foreign bank presence can enhance the competitiveness of
the banking sector, and

improve risk-based assessments and reduce costly inspections—are also important, and
should be expanded together with reduction of nontariff barriers. The authorities supported
the Doha Round as the best forum for addressing agricultural issues and expanding market
access. However, they noted that the developed countries’ reluctance to reduce farm support
in exchange for market access undermined the reaching of an agreement. The authorities saw
the South Asian Free Trade Agreement and other regional and bilateral agreements as an
important aspect of trade policy, noting that such initiatives enhanced economic cooperation
and helped build support for multilateral liberalization. Staff supported efforts to enhance
intra-regional trade, but

The authorities aim to continue the gradual liberalization of capital flows. In
addition to further liberalization of the FDI regime, proposals are under consideration to
progressively ease quantitative limits on foreign investors’ access to domestic equity and
debt markets. However, there remains a range of views among the authorities regarding the
scope and pace at which such liberalization should take place, reflecting concerns about the
origin of the inflows and their potential impact on macroeconomic volatility.26 Liberalization
of outflows has been proceeding and further liberalization would be achieved through
gradually lifting remaining restrictions.27 While pension funds are not allowed to invest
abroad under the draft Pension Bill, the authorities indicated this provision could be

India rates among the top three
potential destinations for FDI in a number of surveys—but actual FDI raised remains low
relative to many other emerging market economies. In this context, staff welcomed the
raising of FDI limits in some sectors, and urged other such increases, including for insurance
and retail. Even more important, a continued improvement in the overall business climate
could have a large pay-off.28 The authorities are pinning their hopes in the near term on the
expansion of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) to spur FDI, pointing that in addition to tax
incentives and good infrastructure, businesses in SEZs will have access to a single window
clearance office.
37.
Less restrictive labor laws would enhance prospects for much needed
employment gains. Despite rapid economic growth in recent years, employment has
remained flat, and with some 100 million new labor market entrants expected in the next
decade, the expansion of labor–intensive manufacturing is critical. However, India’s labor
laws are widely perceived as more rigid than in other countries in the region, stalling the
development of large-scale manufacturing.29 The authorities acknowledged that restrictive
labor laws impeded FDI in manufacturing, but did not see them as the key constraint for most
Indian corporates. A move toward “hire and fire” flexibility would face stiff political

opposition, in particular in light of the lack of an adequate social safety net. However, the
authorities were considering some reforms supported by the staff, including amending the
contract labor law to expand the number of industries that can hire contract workers,
streamlining labor regulations, and raising the cutoff size for firms exempt from certain labor
laws, inspections, and reporting requirements.
38.
Staff pointed to the post–MFA performance of the Indian textile sector as
evidence both of the potential of Indian manufacturing as well as the need for further
reforms. While recent performance is encouraging—textile and clothing production has
grown by over 11 percent y/y in January-October, and exports to U.S. markets have grown
by 23 percent y/y according to U.S. Bureau of Census data—important roadblocks remain.
The private sector points to labor market rigidities—which limit the ability of Indian firms to
respond nimbly to rapid changes in demand—as a key issue. In addition, poor infrastructure
raises the cost of manufacturing and exporting, while the legacy of small–scale industry
reservation has meant that firms typically do not benefit from economies of scale.
F. Other Issues
39.
India eliminated a restriction on payments for current account transactions
subject to approval under Article VIII (Annex II, Section VII). However, other restrictions
remain in place and the staff encouraged their removal.
40.
Staff welcomed progress made in improving economic statistics. In particular, the
staff looked forward to the planned publication of a CPI with a 2000 base year and a new
producer price index.30 Staff also welcomed the planned creation of a National Statistical
Office in 2006, merging the Central Statistical Office with the National Sample Survey
Organization. While India’s statistics are adequate for surveillance purposes, weaknesses
remain in timeliness and coverage of statistical series (Annex V). The authorities were
encouraged to address the main issues identified by the 2004 data ROSC and a recent
follow–up technical assistance mission. In light of the significant financial sector reforms
that have been implemented in recent years and rapid growth in the insurance sector, an
FSAP update would also be welcome. The authorities indicated that for now, they were
focused on their self-assessment, on which they welcomed staff comments.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
41.
The Indian economy is reaping the rewards of the structural reforms introduced
since the early 1990s. The economy showed remarkable resilience in 2004/05, with growth
nearing 7 percent and becoming increasingly broad–based. Thus far in 2005/06, these trends
have continued and, with a near normal monsoon, growth should exceed 7½ percent.

30

See Chapter VI in the Selected Issues.

– 28 –

42.
Favorable conditions provide an opportunity to fast-forward the government’s
structural agenda, allowing it to achieve its own ambitious growth and
poverty-reduction targets. The government is rightly placing emphasis on addressing
infrastructure bottlenecks, deepening global integration, and accelerating annual growth to 8–
10 percent to create jobs and improve the living standards of the rural poor. Steps to improve
the business climate and regulatory environment, and reform of restrictive labor laws would
potentially have large pay-offs by encouraging needed domestic and foreign private
participation and fostering job creation, allowing India to fully benefit from demographic
advantages.
43.
Macroeconomic policies should remain vigilant in 2005/06, in view of the
evolving macroeconomic and financial situation. Strong domestic demand and high world
oil prices are contributing to rising inflation and a widening current account deficit.
44.
In this context, fiscal policy should counter demand pressures. The authorities
should strive to meet the minimum adjustment required under the FRBMA, which would not
only be an appropriate macroeconomic policy response, but would also help maintain the
credibility of the FRBMA and allow the center to lead by example in efforts to encourage
adjustment by the states. In this light, the authorities should direct any revenue
overperformance to deficit reduction and work to identify potential expenditure savings.
45.
The authorities have understandably sought to share the burden of higher world
oil prices, but the Indian economy must now adapt to a higher oil price environment.
Together with a move to full pass–through, the government could replace special price
subsidies by a system of targeted support for the poor. It would also be desirable to reinstate
an APM and shift petroleum taxation further toward a specific basis, in a revenue–neutral
manner and with automatic inflation adjustments to protect the real value of collections. The
government should consider full liberalization of oil prices in the medium run.
46.
Monetary policy needs to remain focused on keeping inflation expectations in
check. The recent increase in the reverse repo rate was appropriate, signaling the RBI’s
commitment to price stability and helping India adjust to an environment of rising global
rates. With indicators suggesting tightening supply–side constraints, and upside risks to
domestic demand growth, further interest rate increases may be needed.
47.
The RBI should continue its two–way flexibility in exchange rate management.
Despite a recent real effective appreciation, competitiveness appears adequate and staff
analysis finds that the exchange rate is close to fair value. In this context, two-way exchange
rate flexibility will help facilitate economic adjustment and encourage hedging of foreign
exchange risk.
48.
Despite fiscal adjustment efforts since 2001/02, public debt remains high and the
medium–term fiscal environment has turned more challenging. The central government
fiscal deficit reached an eight–year low in 2004/05. Notwithstanding this progress, the debt
burden remains high. Moreover, the improvement in recent years reflects in part a cyclical

– 29 –

upturn and a low interest rate environment, while the impact of high oil prices has been
shifted off–budget, and neither tax nor expenditure reform has moved as fast as initially
envisaged. Large planned increases in infrastructure and social spending also complicate the
center’s efforts to meet its fiscal targets.
49.
Further tax base broadening is needed to generate the needed adjustment.
Important progress has been made, including the introduction of a VAT in most states and
the expansion of the services tax base. In addition, ongoing modernization of tax
administration will help bring more taxpayers into the tax net. The central government can
broaden further its tax base by trimming exemptions and continuing expansion of the service
tax base. The development of tax expenditure estimates would also provide a valuable tool
for resisting attempts to introduce inefficient exemptions. Regarding the VAT, initial gains
should be consolidated by bringing in remaining states, phasing–out the CST, and agreeing
with states on revenue–sharing to lay the ground for introduction of a GST.
50.
Sustainable fiscal adjustment will also require greater spending efficiency, in
particular improved targeting of support to the needy. Subsidy reform is needed to free
resources for infrastructure and social spending as well as deficit reduction. The rural
employment program also represents a potentially large expenditure commitment and the
government should proceed cautiously while providing appropriate incentives for self–
targeting. The center should also consider replacing, over time, the large number of welfare
programs and subsidies with a better–targeted social safety net.
51.
The pending passage of the Pension Bill would be a welcome step toward
broader pension reform. The introduction of fully–funded defined contribution pensions
will help provide a secure and sustainable source of retirement income and aid in the
development of capital markets. However, the unfunded pension liabilities of existing
defined benefit schemes for civil servants require parametric revisions to ease the fiscal
burden and make these liabilities manageable.
52.
The authorities should build on the important steps taken in recent years to
improve states’ fiscal health.
•

States have, in the aggregate, succeeded in reducing their overall and current
deficits. But deeper reforms—including tax base broadening and pension, subsidy
and power reforms—are needed to sustain and extend these gains. The introduction of
a VAT in most states is an important step in this regard.

•

Implementation of TFC recommendations will provide states with greater
resources as well as incentives to undertake fiscal reform. However, incentives
provided may be too small to ensure that some states with large deficits adjust, and in
other states, TFC targets are not sufficiently ambitious. Harder budget constraints—
via tight global borrowing ceilings, reform of small savings, and greater reliance on
market borrowing—will be key to enhance the effectiveness of the TFC.

– 30 –

53.
Ensuring that regulatory and other policies support private investment and
productivity growth remains a key challenge. The emphasis on PPPs to ensure greater
private participation in infrastructure is welcome, but an improved regulatory framework is
also needed. Moreover, the government should evaluate and account for all contingent
liabilities associated with infrastructure projects. The SPV for infrastructure should be
accompanied by financial reforms to broaden the long–term investor base. In the power
sector, the 2003 Electricity Act provides a solid framework for reform and implementation
should be accelerated.
54.
The Indian financial system has remained resilient. Both the underlying strength
of financial regulation and an effective response to recent fast credit growth have contributed
to this. However, with a large and growing share of credit directed to higher–risk “priority
sectors,” prudential standards may need to be strengthened further and reliance on priority
sector lending reduced by addressing impediments to lending. The RBI also needs to monitor
carefully credit card debt. While still in its infancy in India, the rapid rise in such debt, as
well as the already sizable share of nonperforming loans, point to the need for close
supervision and consumer education. The RBI should also continue its efforts to strengthen
the regulation of UCBs, which remain in poor health. Finally, the RBI should continue
efforts to ensure readiness for the planned move to Basel II, by enhancing relevant skills for
bank supervisors, monitoring improvements in commercial banks’ risk management systems,
and improving disclosure practices of banks.
55.
With financial soundness improving, the authorities should use this opportunity
to emphasize underlying financial sector development. In particular, the authorities should
consider encouraging more foreign participation in the banking system, which would provide
banks the tools and incentives to increase their efficiency. In this context, the RBI should
consider accelerating implementation of its banking reforms. Steps to develop the
government and corporate securities market are welcome, but certain aspects, such as the
introduction of short–selling, could be accelerated.
56.
India is already benefiting from its increased integration into the global economy
but further opening would allow the country to reach its full growth potential.
•

Given excellent progress already made in reducing tariffs, faster convergence to
ASEAN levels should be achievable. The authorities’ pursuit of preferential trade
agreements (PTAs) bolsters the case for MFN-based tariff reductions so as to reduce
the trade diversion potentially associated with PTAs.

•

Continued loosening of FDI limits, together with efforts to improve the business
climate and liberalize labor laws would have a major payoff. Increased FDI would
bring technological and managerial know–how to India, while reducing reliance on
shorter–term capital flows. Although liberalizing labor laws are a complex and
socially contentious issue, some key steps short of fully flexible hiring and firing
would seem feasible in the near term.

57.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place within the standard
12–month cycle.

6/ Authorities' definition treats divestment as a receipt item.
7/ Total revenue and grants less current expenditure.
8/ External debt measured at historical exchange rates.
9/ Prepayment by states of central loans under the DSS.

ANNEX I

India—Medium-Term Fiscal Outlook
The government is targeting substantial consolidation by 2009/10. The central and state
governments would balance their current deficits by 2008/09 and reduce their overall deficits
to 3 percent of GDP or below by 2009/10, meeting the FRBM and TFC targets. These targets
require a 3¾ percentage points reduction in the general government’s current deficit
by 2008/09.
The baseline scenario envisages that the
central government meets FRBM
targets but states’ adjustment falls short
of the TFC targets. Helped by rising
revenue, a continued real wage bill freeze,
reform of major subsidies, and the
consolidation of low-priority programs,
the central government achieves current
balance by 2008/09. States sharply reduce
their deficits in 2005/06 thanks to higher
transfers, but the adjustment stalls in
subsequent years as central government
transfers decrease. Growth stabilizes at
6½ percent as capital expenditure rises
(2½ percentage points cumulatively by
2009/10). While debt declines to 80
percent of GDP by 2009/10, it remains
vulnerable to shocks (Table I.1 and
Figure I.1).

In a best case (reform) scenario, both the
center and states meet their medium-term
targets. Given spending needs, an adjustment of this magnitude would require annual revenue
increases of about 0.9 percent of GDP and improvements in the efficiency of public
expenditure. As capital spending increases (3¼ percentage points of GDP cumulatively by
2009/10), growth would accelerate to 8 percent and debt would decline to under 77 percent
of GDP.
Without a change in policies debt would rise. General government revenue would rise only
moderately (less than ½ percentage point per annum). The primary deficit would remain
unchanged at around 2 percent of GDP. Current deficit targets would be missed. Growth
would slow to 6 percent and with rising interest rates, the growth-interest differential fades
by 2009/10.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

Since March 1, 1993, the Indian rupee has floated against other currencies, although the Reserve
Bank of India intervenes in the market periodically. As per the Annual Report on Exchange
Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER), the exchange rate in India is classified as
managed floating with no pre-announced path for the exchange rate. On August 20, 1994, India
accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the IMF Articles of Agreement.
India maintains some restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current account
transactions which are subject to approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a): restrictions related to
nontransferability of balances under the Indo-Russia mutual debt agreement of 1993; restrictions
arising from unsettled inoperative bilateral payments agreements with three Eastern European
countries; and a restriction on transfer of amortization payments on loans by nonresident relatives.
The Executive Board has not granted approval of these measures. A restriction on remittances for

India—Relations with the World Bank Group
The World Bank’s total support to India of $2.89 billion in FY05 was the largest amount received by
an individual country, and more than double the $1.4 billion recorded in FY04. As part of this total,
India was also the largest recipient of IDA assistance, with credits totaling $1.1 billion. IFC also
recorded a strong commitment in FY05 of $412.5 million. The World Bank Group’s program of
support combines policy dialogue with diversified IBRD/IDA lending, IFC investments and
analytical and advisory activities in the sectors that are important to reducing poverty and sustaining
growth.
The Bank Group’s Board of Directors discussed a new Country Strategy (CAS) for India on
August 26, 2004. The CAS jointly covers the programs of IBRD/IDA and IFC for the period of
FY05-08. With over one-quarter of the world’s poor in India, the overarching challenge is how to
scale up the impact of Bank Group assistance in order to help India move closer to achieving its
development goals—including the goal of halving poverty by 2015.
Scaling up assistance will entail a strengthened Bank Group program at the Center, as well as more
lending to the states compared to recent years. For state level lending, the strategy is to retain an
essentially reform and performance-based approach to the states, and to also seek new opportunities
for engagement with the largest and poorest states in India in order to help strengthen the
environment for reform. The expansion in lending will primarily be for investment in infrastructure
development, human development and rural livelihoods. Through adjustment lending, continued
emphasis is also being placed on support to fiscal and governance reforms at the state level.
Adjustment lending to finance state level reforms will be limited to 15 percent of total IBRD/IDA
lending for the CAS period. Overall lending levels will fall within an upper bound of $2.15 billion
per year for IBRD, on average for the four years of the CAS, and the IDA limits for India established
by the IDA Deputies. Financial operations since 1998/99 are summarized below.

AsDB’s core operational strategy in India remains poverty-reduction through
infrastructure-led growth. More than 75 percent of its ongoing and proposed assistance
focuses on transport (national highways, state roads, and rural roads), urban (water and
sanitation, waste management, urban transport, city planning, and municipal reforms), and
energy (power sector reforms, investments for upgrading transmission and distribution
systems, hydropower generation, and improvement in energy efficiency) sector operations.
AsDB’s assistance pipeline for the period 2006–2008 is provided in the Country Strategy and
Program Update 2005.

ANNEX V

India––Statistical Issues
1.
While India’s macroeconomic statistics are adequate for surveillance, weaknesses
remain in the timeliness and coverage of certain statistical series. India has an elaborate
system for compiling economic and financial statistics and produces a vast quantity of data
covering virtually all sectors of the economy. India subscribed to the SDDS on
December 27, 1996 and started posting its metadata on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin
Board on October 30, 1997. It is currently in observance of the SDDS, and it uses flexibility
options for timeliness of data on general government operations and on the periodicity and
timeliness of labor market data. The authorities are planning further improvements in the
timeliness, periodicity, and coverage of data in a number of statistical areas as detailed
below. Many key financial variables are available on a weekly or monthly basis, most of
which are published in official documents or disseminated through press releases.
2.
The data module of the Report on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC, IMF
Country Report No. 04/96) was published in April 2004. It assesses India’s data
dissemination practices against the SDDS requirements and assesses the quality of six
datasets based on the Data Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF) developed by STA. In
addition, it lists prioritized recommendations to improve national accounts, consumer and
wholesale price indices, fiscal, monetary, and balance of payments statistics. The data ROSC
identified issues related to the periodicity, coverage, and quality of statistical series.
•

National accounts: The CSO rebased the annual national accounts statistics and
began publishing quarterly data in 1999. The CSO has recently reduced the
dissemination lag for quarterly releases to two months from three months and is
planning to release a new series of national accounts, with base year 1999–2000 in
January 2006. However, quarterly data are only available from 1996Q2 and relate
only to production-based data. Information on major expenditure categories is only
available with considerable delay (at least ten months after the end of the fiscal year),
providing limited guidance for short-term policies. The CSO is planning to
disseminate quarterly expenditure-based aggregates starting in 2007 and is aiming to
reduce the dissemination lag for the annual expenditure-based estimates to three
months.

•

Industrial production index (IPI): In May 2000, the CSO took the welcomed step
of releasing a revised time series for IPI, using the new WPI (base
year 1993/94) series as a deflator. The government has also contracted a private
company, CMIE, to increase the number of respondents and products in the sample,
as recommended by the data ROSC.

•

Price statistics: The Consumer Price Indices (CPIs) are based on weights that are at
least twenty years old and do not fully capture price developments in the economy.
However, the CSO plans to publish shortly a revised CPI with a 2001 base year and a
new producer price index. Presently, there are four CPIs, each based on the
consumption basket of a narrow category of consumers (namely industrial workers,

- 56 -

ANNEX V

urban and nonmanual employees, agricultural laborers, and rural laborers). In
addition, the CSO is in the process of compiling an all-India CPI covering the general
population of urban and rural sectors separately. The CPIs are published with a lag of
about one month. The WPI is published weekly with a lag of two weeks and are
subject to large revisions, especially in periods of rising inflation. A new WPI series
was published in 2000 with updated weights, new categories, and a revised base year
(1993/94). However, the representativeness of the index may be undermined by the
collection of prices from a relatively small sample of products and the infrequent
updating of weights.
•

External sector statistics: While the concepts and definitions used to compile
balance of payments statistics are broadly in line with the fifth edition of the Balance
of Payments Manual (BPM5), the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) presentation does
not follow the BPM5. Furthermore, trade data have quality, valuation, timing, and
coverage problems, and data on trade prices, volumes, and composition are not
regularly available on a timely basis. Starting January 2001, external debt statistics
are available on a quarterly basis with a one quarter lag. Estimates of short-term
external debt are presented in the debt statistics on an original maturity basis. The
short-term maturity attribution on a residual maturity basis is only available annually
(and excludes residual maturity of medium- and long-term nonresident Indian
accounts). The international investment position (IIP) statistics cover the sectors
prescribed in the BPM5 and these data are disseminated within six months of the
reference period in respect of annual data. India began disseminating the Data
Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity as prescribed
under the SDDS in December 2001. The more up-to-date information on certain
variables, such as total foreign reserves, foreign currency assets, gold, and SDRs, are
available on a weekly basis and are disseminated as part of a weekly statistical
supplement on the RBI website.

•

Monetary and financial statistics: The RBI website and the RBI Bulletin publish a
wide array of monetary and financial statistics, including interest rates, exchange
rates, foreign reserves, the monetary survey, and results of government securities
auctions. The frequency and quality of data dissemination have improved
substantially in recent years. However, some crucial data, such as the RBI’s forward
liabilities and intervention data, are still published with lags of two to three months.

•

The ROSC data module mission of May 2002 found that the concepts and definitions
used by the RBI to compile monetary statistics were in broad conformity with the
guidelines provided in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM).
Nevertheless, the following concepts and principles deviate from the MFSM: (1) the
resident sector data do not provide sufficient information on the sectoral distribution
of domestic credit. Specifically, under their present sectorization scheme, the
authorities subdivide the resident nonbank sector data by (i) central government,
(ii) state government, and (iii) the commercial sector (including other financial
corporations, public and other nonfinancial corporations, and other resident sectors);

- 57 -

ANNEX V

and (2) commercial banks add accrued interest to credit and deposit positions on a
quarterly basis only. The mission has recommended that the authorities adopt the full
range of sectors prescribed in the MFSM and include accrued interest on a monthly
basis instead of reflecting it only on a quarterly basis.
•

Fiscal operations: The Ministry of Finance posts selected central government
monthly fiscal data and quarterly debt data on its website. However, no monthly data
on fiscal performance at the state level are available, and annual data are available
only with an eight to ten month lag. Consolidated information is unavailable on local
government operations. In addition, data on the functional and economic
classification of expenditures are available with considerable lag, and there is scope
to improve the analytical usefulness of the presentation of the fiscal accounts.
Reporting to the Fund for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook
(GFSY) is adequate, but only cash data is reported, and the coverage is limited to the
central government.

3.
In addition to the ROSC recommendations, the authorities are presently addressing a
number of data compilation issues which were identified in the August 2001 Report of the
National Statistical Commission, including:
•

The revision of statistical and data reporting methods in order to keep pace with the
shift to a more market-oriented economy following the elimination of industrial
licensing.

•

The need for the Central Statistical Organization (CSO) to initiate procedures through
which its interaction with other agencies in the decentralized statistical system is
made more proactive as well as effective. The planned establishment of the National
Statistical Commission is a first step.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
February 6, 2006
1.
This statement contains information that has become available since the staff report
was circulated to the Executive Board on December 23, 2005. This information does not alter
the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Recent economic developments are broadly consistent with staff’s growth and
balance of payments forecasts for 2005/06. Industrial production appears to have softened,
with 8 percent growth in October-November, slightly below levels of the first half of the
year. This suggests that GDP growth may be moderating somewhat from the 8 percent
growth of the first half of the year, consistent with staff projections. However, domestic
demand remains robust, and staff continues to see upside risks to its GDP forecast for the
year. Recent data indicate that in the first half of the fiscal year (April-September) the
external current account deficit reached 1¾ percent of projected annual GDP, in line with
staff projections. Despite healthy export growth of more than 20 percent (y/y), import growth
of almost 50 percent—more than 40 percent excluding oil—pushed the trade deficit above
4 percent of projected annual GDP. Strong capital inflows, led by portfolio investment,
contributed to a small balance of payments surplus. Recent customs data indicate that the
growth of exports and imports slowed significantly during October-December, which may
also point to some moderation in GDP growth.
3.
Foreign inflows remain strong and equity prices have continued to climb. Since
mid-December, net inflows from foreign institutional investors have totaled close to
US$2 billion, contributing to a 3 percent appreciation of the rupee against the dollar. After
rising by more than 42 percent in 2005, the SENSEX is up about 5 percent this year.
International reserves fell by $7 billion in late December, as expected, as India Millennium
Deposits were redeemed on maturity, but have since recovered by more than US$2 billion to
reach $139 billion on January 20.
4.
Inflation is likely to remain lower than projected in the staff report. In contrast to
expectations, the WPI has not risen appreciably since September and stood at 4.4 percent in
mid-January. The moderation is broad based, and suggests that efficiency improvements and
competition from imports may be helping to contain inflation. Staff has revised downward its
projection for average WPI inflation to 4¾ percent this fiscal year and 5.5 percent next year.
5.
Despite the modest rate of inflation, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised its
key policy interest rate by 25 bps on January 24. Citing concerns about rapid growth in
domestic demand and monetary aggregates as well as potential pressures from future passthrough of oil prices, the RBI increased the reverse repo rate to 5½ percent. Market rates had
begun to harden ahead of the announcement amid tightening liquidity in the face of rapid
credit growth. However, the rate increase surprised markets and interest rates for government
securities continued to increase subsequently, with rates on government securities rising
50 bps at the short end and 20 bps at the longer-end.

-2-

6.
Budgetary developments remain broadly in line with those described in the staff
report. Through December the overall central government deficit stood at 3.1 percent of
projected annual GDP (72 percent of the annual budget target) and the current deficit at
2¼ percent of GDP (84 percent of budget). The government expects revenue
overperformance of 0.2 percent of GDP, largely in the form of special dividends from stateowned companies. Expenditures have also been revised up by 0.2 percent of GDP, mainly
due to compensation, in the form of bonds, for oil company losses arising from less than full
pass-through of global oil price hikes. However, the government expects this will be more
than offset by savings in other spending categories, including defense, resulting in a small
fiscal overperformance.
7.

Several structural measures have been implemented. Most notably:

•

The government has announced that it will allow FDI in the retail sector for singlebrand stores, up to a maximum of 51 percent.

•

The government has awarded concessions for modernization of Delhi and Mumbai
airports. The two winning consortiums, joint-ventures of domestic construction and
foreign airport companies, will be offered a 74 percent stake in the airports.

•

As a means for enhancing banking penetration in rural areas, the RBI has allowed
banks to appoint business correspondents to take deposits and offer loans without
opening branches.

8.
National accounts data for 2004/05 along with new historical series with base
year 1999/2000 were released on January 31. For 2004/05, real GDP growth at constant
factor prices is estimated to have reached 7.5 percent, compared to earlier estimates of
6.9 percent. Both services and industry growth were revised upward by 0.4 percentage point
to 9.9 percent and 8.6 percent respectively. Growth was fueled by investment which, for the
third year in a row, grew by around 16 percent. Revisions to historical nominal GDP figures
and the sectoral composition of GDP have been minimal.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with India
On February 6, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with India.1
Background
India’s growth has remained robust in 2005/06 following a strong performance last year. With
rapid growth in services broadening to encompass industry, GDP growth in 2004/05, at
7½ percent (recently revised upward from 6.9 percent) was above the historical trend. Strong
momentum in manufacturing and services has continued, resulting in rising capacity utilization
and soaring business confidence. Staff projects growth of over 7½ percent this year, led by
strong domestic demand, and broadly in line with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and
consensus forecasts. In 2006/07, growth is expected to decline slightly as the economy further
adjusts to higher oil prices and domestic and world interest rates rise.
While inflation remains low, underlying pressures from buoyant domestic demand and higher
international energy prices remain strong. Steps taken by the RBI to tighten liquidity in 2004/05,
including raising reserve requirements and policy interest rates, and incomplete pass-through of
higher oil prices helped keep WPI inflation low. With headline inflation hovering around
4½ percent year on year, the RBI raised overnight repo rates again in October 2005 and
January of 2006, by a cumulative 50 basis points, citing concerns about the rapid pace of
aggregate demand and monetary growth and high oil prices. Staff projects inflation to rise from
an average of about 4¾ percent in 2005/06 to 5½ percent in 2006/07, in part reflecting the
adjustment of administered fuel prices.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2–
After several years of current account surpluses and growing reserves, the investment recovery
and consumption boom have pushed the external current account into deficit. In 2004/05, the
trade deficit widened to over 5½ percent of GDP and the current account reverted into deficit for
the first time in three years, notwithstanding high growth in services income. While export
growth continues to be strong, a large increase in both oil and non-oil imports caused the trade
deficit to widen further this year, and contribute to a sharp deterioration in the current account
deficit. Staff projects it to reach 3 percent of GDP in 2005/06.
The balance of payments position remains comfortable with strong capital inflows helping
finance the growing current account deficit. In 2004/05, close to half of all capital inflows were
debt creating, as Indian corporates took advantage of favorable global interest rates, an
appreciating rupee, and the liberalization of restrictions on external commercial borrowings to
borrow abroad. While portfolio flows have continued to gain importance, FDI inflows remained
weak. So far this fiscal year, capital inflows have remained strong and reserves have only fallen
modestly as a result of the redemption of the India Millennium Deposits. While more reliance on
debt and portfolio inflows has increased India’s susceptibility to changes in investor sentiment,
ample reserves and remaining capital controls limit risks of potential reversals.
Asset markets have strengthened. Net foreign investor inflows have accelerated since
mid-2005, as equity prices soared. Equity prices are up around 50 percent from end-April.
Ample liquidity and historically low interest rates also helped fuel property prices, which have
risen in major cities by over 20 percent annually over the past two years. Concerned with
speculative pressures, the RBI has raised risk-weights on housing and real estate loans and
imposed controls on real estate investments aimed at curbing speculative FDI inflows.
The exchange rate has exhibited increased two-way flexibility. In the eight months to June
2005, the RBI scaled back intervention in foreign exchange markets and the rupee appreciated
by 4 percent against the dollar (6½ percent in real effective terms). In the second half of 2005,—
with the exception of a six-week period following China’s July 21 revaluation, when the RBI
intervened to stem appreciation pressures—the rupee depreciated, reflecting pressures from
the growing current account deficit and renewed U.S. dollar strength.
Following three years of declining fiscal deficits, a “pause” in deficit reduction was announced
for 2005/06. The central government deficit came in below target in 2004/05 for the second
consecutive year at 4.1 percent of GDP (authorities’ definition, including privatization receipts as
revenue), helped by a cyclical rebound in revenue and expenditure compression, but also
reflecting greater recourse to off-budget petroleum subsidies. This, together with a
0.8 percentage points reduction in subnational deficits, contributed to a fall in the general
government deficit to under 7½ percent of GDP, enough to stabilize public debt at about
86 percent of GDP. The 2005/06 Budget deficit target of 4.3 percent of GDP falls short of the
minimum reduction required by the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act.
This reflected significant spending increases for key social and infrastructure needs and higher
transfers to the states. The general government deficit is projected by staff to rise, for the first
time in four years, to 7¾ percent of GDP.
The banking sector has continued to strengthen but some risks remain. Commercial banks have
continued to reduce nonperforming assets, and aggregate capital adequacy remains high.
Banks have reduced their exposure to interest rate risks, decreasing their holdings of
government paper and shortening maturity. Declining profitability due to rising interest rates has
been in part offset by higher credit growth. However, interest rate risk remains a concern with
bank holdings of government paper (at 38 percent of assets) still high and in excess of statutory

-3–
requirements. At the same time, rapid credit growth raises concerns about credit quality and
cooperative banks, accounting for about 6 percent of banking system assets, remain in poor
health.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that the Indian economy is continuing to reap the rewards of more
than 15 years of reforms. Notwithstanding high world oil prices and a weak monsoon, the
economy showed remarkable resilience in 2004/05, with growth remaining robust and becoming
broader-based. These trends have continued in 2005/06, and growth of more than 7½ percent
for the full year is expected.
Directors supported the broad objectives of the government’s economic program, in particular
addressing infrastructure bottlenecks, alleviating rural poverty, and deepening global
integration. They noted that current favorable economic conditions provide a good opportunity
to speed structural reforms. In particular, measures to improve the business climate and reform
labor laws would have a large pay-off by fostering private and foreign investment and job
creation. With an acceleration of the reform process, India would be able to achieve sustained
economic growth of 8–10 percent, in line with the objectives of the authorities.
Directors emphasized that macroeconomic policies should remain vigilant, in view of the
evolving macroeconomic situation. Although inflation has remained contained, underlying
pressures point to upside risks. In particular, domestic demand remains strong, as evidenced by
a widening current account deficit and rapid credit growth. In this context, Directors
recommended that fiscal policy should counter demand pressures, and they underlined the
importance of overperforming on the budget and meeting the minimum adjustment required
under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act. This would not only be an
appropriate macroeconomic policy response, but would also bolster the credibility of the Act and
allow the central government to lead by example in efforts to encourage adjustment at the state
level. In this regard, some Directors cautioned that markets might interpret the pause in deficit
reduction in the current fiscal year as a weakening of the commitment to reform.
Directors underscored the need for the Indian economy to adapt to permanently higher
international oil prices. They recommended moving gradually to the full pass-through of oil
prices—with targeted support for the poor—which would help limit fiscal and quasi-fiscal losses
and provide incentives for more efficient energy use, thus aiding competitiveness in the medium
term.
Directors considered that monetary policy should remain focused on keeping inflation
expectations in check. The increases in the reverse repo rate by the Reserve Bank of India in
October 2005 and January 2006 were seen as appropriate, signaling the RBI’s commitment to
price stability and helping the adjustment to higher global interest rates. Directors welcomed the
RBI’s continued two-way flexibility in exchange rate management.
Directors noted that, notwithstanding the deficit reduction achieved since 2001/02, India’s large
public debt remains a key constraint on growth. Without further enhancing tax revenues and
reducing lower-priority spending, it will be difficult to create fiscal space for the planned large
and crucial increases in infrastructure and social spending. In addition, with credit to the private

-4–
sector rising fast, the risk that government borrowing needs will crowd-out the private sector has
increased. Directors observed that fiscal consolidation is a prerequisite for more complete
financial sector development and further opening up of the capital account.
Directors viewed an acceleration of tax reform as critical to achieve the government’s deficit
reduction targets. They welcomed the introduction of the value-added tax in most states and
steps to widen the services tax base and modernize tax administration. Directors underscored
the need to further broaden the tax base by trimming existing exemptions and eventually
introducing a goods and services tax with few exemptions. Directors looked forward to the
planned development of tax expenditure estimates, which would provide a valuable tool for
resisting attempts to introduce new inefficient tax incentives.
Directors observed that greater spending efficiency, in particular improved targeting of
subsidies, would be required to generate the needed fiscal adjustment. They viewed the
government’s 2004 subsidy reform blueprint as appropriate, and urged its rapid implementation.
Directors underlined that the new rural employment program represents a potentially large
expenditure commitment, and advised the government to proceed cautiously with it.
Directors welcomed the initiation of pension reform. The passage of the Pension Bill would
allow the introduction of fully funded, defined contribution pensions, which in turn would help
ensure a secure source of retirement income and aid in the development of capital markets.
However, Directors pointed out that revisions to the existing defined benefit schemes for civil
servants are also required to reduce large unfunded pension liabilities.
Directors noted that states have succeeded, in the aggregate, in reducing their deficits in recent
years, and they welcomed recent reforms undertaken in the context of the Twelfth Finance
Commission to further strengthen state finances. These reforms provide states with greater
resources and incentives to undertake fiscal reform. However, Directors emphasized that state
finances could be further strengthened by increasing conditionality and hardening budget
constraints, including via tighter global borrowing ceilings. They called for consolidating the
recent gains through tax base broadening and further reforms in the pension, subsidy, and state
electric utility areas. Directors were encouraged that a number of states have already shifted to
defined contribution pension systems and enacted fiscal responsibility laws.
Directors supported the government’s emphasis on public-private partnerships to ensure
greater private participation in investments in infrastructure. However, they cautioned that an
improved regulatory framework and financial reforms to broaden the investor base are also
needed. Directors viewed the 2003 Electricity Act as a solid framework for reform, and advised
that it be implemented quickly.
Directors commended the underlying strength of financial regulation and the effective response
to recent rapid credit growth. They advised close monitoring of fast-growing credit card debt.
A further strengthening of prudential standards could be considered, where appropriate.
Reliance on priority sector lending floors to deliver credit to agriculture and small and
medium-sized enterprises could be reduced by addressing needed structural reforms in lending.
Regulation should also be strengthened for cooperative banks. Directors urged the RBI to
ensure readiness for the planned move to Basel II by continuing to enhance monitoring of
banks’ risk management systems, upgrade supervisory skills, and strengthen disclosure
requirements. Directors considered that the current sound position of the financial system

-5–
provides a good basis for its further deepening, in particular through increasing private and
foreign participation in the banking sector, including by accelerating implementation of the RBI’s
banking reform roadmap.
Directors emphasized that further opening of the economy would allow it to reach its full growth
potential. While they commended the progress already made in bringing down tariff levels, they
noted that faster convergence to ASEAN levels would be desirable. Broad-based tariff
reductions would also help minimize the trade diversion potentially associated with preferential
trade arrangements. Also, continued loosening of sectoral limits on foreign direct investment,
together with efforts to improve the business climate and liberalize labor laws, could foster
growth and job creation, while reducing India’s reliance on shorter-term capital flows.
Some Directors noted that further privatization could spur efficiency gains and provide
resources to reduce the public debt. Directors urged the authorities to consider labor market
reforms, including expanded contract employment and streamlined labor regulations and
reporting requirements. Such flexibility would be key to ensuring that India can generate jobs for
its rapidly expanding labor force.
