SPILLOVER REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION AND SELECTED ISSUES

July 2011
The Spillover Report and Selected Issues on China were prepared by a staff team of the
International Monetary Fund as background documentation for the periodic consultation with
the member country. They are based on the information available at the time they were
completed on June 27, 2011 and June 28, 2011, respectively. The views expressed in these
documents are those of the staff team and do not necessarily reflect the views of the
government of China or the Executive Board of the IMF.
The document listed below will be separately released.

PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
SPILLOVER REPORT—2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 27, 2011

KEY POINTS
Issues. Spillover reports explore the external effects of policies in systemic economies,
focusing on issues raised by key partners. In the case of China, these partners saw benefits
from its growth, especially during the crisis, but were also concerned to varying degrees
about spillovers from (1) a potential disruption to China’s so far steady growth; (2) the
slow pace of currency adjustment; and (3) a further build up in foreign exchange reserves,
already the largest in the world, and the closed capital account.
Findings. The main messages flowing from the analysis are as follows:


China’s capacity to both transmit and originate real shocks is rising, implying an
important stake for the world in its stability. Insofar as its export-oriented growth
model is a source of stresses, economic rebalancing is crucial.



Currency appreciation is important to that process but alone yields only limited
spillovers. Significant positive effects on others’ output and trade require a
comprehensive transformation that reduces China’s household and corporate savings
rates and raises depressed factor prices. The latter could also alleviate concerns that
China’s competitiveness is built on a distorted cost structure, thus easing trade
tensions—itself a risk to the world economy.



Conversely, failure to rebalance the growth model would imply unprecedented
increases in export market share, potential overhang in capacity, and adverse
spillovers from resulting stresses on corporate and bank balance sheets.



China’s policies can affect global capital flows, although that role is secondary to
fundamentals such as emerging market country growth and advanced country
liquidity conditions. While China’s large purchases of reserve currency assets reduce
their yields and push capital to emerging markets, it is unclear what the net effect of
its closed capital account is, and what opening it up would do.

2011 SPILLOVER REPORT

The report was prepared by a staff team comprising Ranjit Teja
(Head), Lorenzo Giorgianni, Rishi Goyal, Roberto Benelli, Nathan
Porter, Kai Guo, Jarkko Turunen (all SPR); Papa N’Diaye (APD); and
Shaun Roach (RES).
SPILLOVER REPORTS

Spillover reports examine the external effects of domestic policies in five systemic economies,
i.e., the S5, comprising China, Euro Area, Japan, United Kingdom, and the United States. The
mere existence of external effects does not imply that policy modifications or collective action is
needed—that depends on many considerations, including the presence of economic
externalities. The aim rather is to stimulate discussion, providing a global perspective for policy
advice in Article IV discussions and input for the Fund’s broader multilateral surveillance.
In each case, key partners are asked about outward spillovers from the economy in question, on
the basis of which staff choose issues for analysis. To facilitate candor, spillover reports do not
cite who raises a specific issue. For this report, the consulted were officials and analysts from the
other S5 and from selected emerging markets (EMs)—Brazil, Hong Kong SAR, India, Indonesia,
Korea, Mexico, Poland, Russia, Singapore, and Thailand.
This report does not try to capture the full extent and historical significance of China’s new
influence on the world economy. Rather, it focuses on a few forward-looking issues raised by
partners, brings to bear relevant analysis, and describes the reactions of the Chinese authorities.
Technical papers underlying the analysis can be found in China Spillovers: Selected Issues. A
separate forthcoming report will summarize the themes emerging from discussions with the S5.

The main result, however, is that

the

positive spillover from currency adjustment. If
private consumption in China also were to rise
with currency appreciation, the growth and
trade balance effects more than double. China
contracts before production structures adjust
but the ultimate impact is mildly positive
(which is fine, since the point of rebalancing is
not to raise growth in China but to render it
sustainable). It bears reiterating that the above
is a partial treatment of global imbalances,
which requires action by many sides.

15.

The estimated impacts on advanced

countries do seem small. However, the results
in Tables 2–3 need to be seen in perspective.
For one, the effects on advanced countries are
many times larger measured against their
manufacturing sectors, which are the ones
most affected by Chinese competition. More
importantly, the effects would be much larger
measured against an arguably unsustainable
trajectory—an inherently difficult baseline to
model; the attenuation of risk, as rebalancing
moves the economy to a sustainable path,
would also lower risk premiums and magnify
the benefits of China’s adjustment. Finally, the

have faced a surge in capital inflows since the

as easy monetary conditions in advanced

Their performance, either in terms of gross

going forward, the China growth story

been to quantify the spillovers from various
policies to rebalance demand in China and
durably reduce the current account surplus.
The payoff to the rest of the world, as it is for
China, could be important. However, any
disruption in growth arising from a failure to
address the tensions implicit in China’s exportoriented growth model would yield major
negative spillovers. The stakes for the world in
a smooth transition to a more domestically led
growth model are thus significant.

Overall development financing is small relative to

China’s infrastructure spending in Sub-Saharan Africa
(SSA) is, on average, double the IDA/IBRD sectoral
allocation for infrastructure.



Concessional financing commitments from China
amounted to about $3 billion in 2007 (compared to
$90 billion from traditional donors). This is expected
to be scaled up—there are plans for a further
$10 billion to SSA over the 2010–12 period.

Although Chinese FDI to LICs is still a small fraction of

ten-fold between 2003 and 2009. Large state-owned

infrastructure dominate Chinese FDI.

China’s commodity demand has materially boosted low
income country (LIC) trade performance and a jump in
outward FDI and development financing from China would
help LICs tap natural resources and develop infrastructure
and manufacturing capacity.

Chinese demand has boosted LIC trade. A 3 percent
increase in China’s industrial output (or 1 percent of
GDP) raises the terms of trade and the trade balance
of several LICs by amounts noted in the figure below
[see background paper, China Spillovers: Global

Some have called for greater disclosure on the destination

take into account LIC debt sustainability, including
cooperative approaches to debt resolution. Closer
involvement with other donors and international lenders
would also help ensure a coordinated approach.

2011 SPILLOVER REPORT—SELECTED ISSUES

I. CHINA’S EVOLVING ROLE IN GLOBAL TRADE

1

China’s export-oriented growth model has resulted in a large expansion of China’s trade and a
rapid move up the value-added chain. This has had significant implications for the global supply
chain: China’s reliance on processing trade, while large, is on a declining trend. From a network
perspective, China is now the world’s most “central” trader, with the largest and most important
connections to other major trading nations; it has become a dominant importer of commodities
and exporter of capital goods and intermediate products. While China remains a key conduit for
the transmission of real shocks, but three factors—its size, trade centrality, and shares of domestic
demand and value added—mean that the impact of shocks originating in China is increasing.
1.
Export-oriented growth. The export-oriented growth model—comprising in the main an
exchange rate policy and supportive investment, financial, and trade policies—has resulted in a
large expansion of exports. China’s share of exports has nearly quadrupled over the past
15 years, rising from around 3 percent in 1995 to about 12 percent in 2009; its share has doubled
since WTO accession in 2002. The structure of exports has changed, with a rapid increase in the
proportion of capital goods exported. At the same time, processing still accounts for nearly one
half of China’s trade, which means that the standard trade figures overstate the economic impact
of China trade, but its share is declining.
2.
Increasing value added. China has been moving rapidly up the value-added chain
(Figures 1 and 2). Its comparative advantage, as measured by its export share of a product group
relative to the world, is increasingly in capital goods, alongside consumer goods. As a result, the
share of intermediate inputs has declined.
3.
Global supply chain. The growth and transformation of China’s trade has had important
implications for the global and, in particular, the regional supply chain.


Commodities. China has moved from being a material supplier to a very large importer,
with new links emerging (e.g., with Australia, Brazil, and Saudi Arabia).



Intermediate goods. The rise up the value chain is reflected in new and expanded markets
for its intermediate good exports (e.g., in the region, U.S., and Euro Area).



Capital goods. China has expanded its market share for exports of capital goods. Its
demand for capital goods is increasingly met within the region.



Consumption goods. As domestic consumption strengthens, important supply links are
developing—from the Euro Area, Korea, Japan, and the U.S.

4.
Central role. Applying metrics of centrality from network theory, China is found to be
most central to the global trading system, surpassing even the U.S. and the Euro Area. This is a
significant change from a decade ago. On final consumption and capital goods, China has
become the most central, and also very central to intermediate goods trade.

5.
Spillovers. China’s central role in global trade makes it an important conduit for the
transmission—and increasingly a source—of shocks. Domestic demand is contributing a growing
part of the value added of its trading partners (see Appendix I for a technical discussion). This
contribution was small about a decade ago, reflecting the low import content of consumption,
but it is currently estimated to be larger than

Rebalancing policies. Looking ahead, rebalancing growth in China toward domestic
private consumption can have significant spillovers on the supply chain (see, for instance,
Chapters II and VI). This increased demand would need to be measured against the impact of
potentially reduced demand from the U.S. (owing to increased saving) and given the different
sets of consumption goods imported by the Chinese and the Americans (Figure 3). Moreover,
since China and the Asian region export a different set of consumption goods, changes in
product mixes and/or consumer preferences would need to accompany such demand changes, if
the impact of the changes is to extend beyond the Asian supply chain.

Appendix I. The Decomposition of Value Added
1.
Input-output analysis. This appendix presents the details of the input-output analysis
needed to calculate the contribution of China’s (and others’) domestic demand to the value
added of partner countries. The analysis builds on Asian regional Input-Output tables for 2000
and 2008 from Mohommad and others (2010). These I-O tables show the detailed production
structure for 10 economies—Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, China, Taiwan
Province of China, Korea, Japan, and the U.S.—with 7 sectors in each economy.1
2.
Production structure. Figure 1 summarizes the production structure of each economy,
which comprises an intermediate demand block (the “A” matrix) and a final demand block (the
“F” matrix). The A and F matrices show (reading down the column) the number of units of
intermediate (in the A matrix) and final (F matrix) inputs required to produce one unit of output.
The inputs include domestic and imported intermediate goods from upstream supplier, as well as
final goods. The diagonal shaded blocks show the domestic goods for intermediate and final use.

Country coverage. To broaden country coverage, the following key economies were
added to the selected ones above: Australia, Brazil, the Euro Area, Russia, India, Saudi Arabia, and
the U.K. The I-O tables for these economies for 2008 were constructed using I-O tables for year
2000 published by the OECD and information on trade and output growth. This involved mainly
the following 3 steps:


For each new country (and each in the Euro Area), a domestic input-output matrix is
identified from the OECD input-output database. Typically, these were for the year 2000.
For 2008, the value added inputs were updated using GDP data from the WEO database,

and domestic intermediate input requirements were updated assuming a constant
relation to value added.


Imports of intermediate and final goods were calculated using COMTRADE data based
on the BEC classification. Raw materials and intermediate goods trade were assumed to
feed into the production process at the intermediate level (matrix A), while trade in
capital and consumption goods were taken to be for final use in each country (F matrix).
Trade data were then used to complete the “off diagonal” blocks of the A and F matrices.



The domestic final demand was calculated as the residual from output net of
intermediate use and exports in each economy to ensure consistency with the I-O
framework presented in Figure 1.

Calculating spillovers. In the I-O framework, gross output ( ) solves the following
equation:

units of production in country i (supply country) to produce one unit of gross output in j, the
demand country. The impact of final demand in economy j on other economies is determined
through the following equation:

where v is a diagonal matrix of the vector of value added.

II. CHINA SPILLOVERS: IMPACT OF REBALANCING
ON THE SUPPLY CHAIN
1

This chapter assesses quantitatively the short-run effect of rebalancing growth in China on its
trading partners. Using an input-output framework and detailed trade information, and holding
short-term production patterns unchanged, it finds that rebalancing—with higher private
consumption and a real appreciation of the RMB—would substantially raise GDP in the regional
supply chain. The impact on advanced partners would be small initially, but should become larger
as production patterns change.
1.
Rebalancing policies. As discussed in Chapter I, China’s export-oriented growth strategy
has had important effects on trading partners and competitors. Going forward, its policies to
rebalance the economy—such as in the 12th Five Year Plan—are expected to have significant
effects on the global supply chain as China’s imports rise and its production becomes more
domestically oriented. These policies include re-aligning relative prices (e.g., cost of capital, land,
and pollution), gradually adjusting the exchange rate, and changing the savings behavior of
households and corporations (e.g., through reforms to social safety nets).
2.
The exercise. This note uses an input-output framework—which takes as given the
production structure of inputs and output in an economy and relates changes in final demand
across countries to changes in output and value added (see Regional Economic Outlook: Asia and
Pacific, IMF, April 2010)—to assess quantitatively the instantaneous or short-run effect on partner
countries of a fall in savings that raises private consumption (by 5 percent of GDP) and lowers the
share of investment in GDP, and a real effective exchange rate (REER) appreciation (of
10 percent). The calibration of the increase in private consumption by 5 percent follows the study
of Guo and N’Diaye (2010). The REER appreciation of 10 percent is ad hoc and illustrative, and
not based on any assessment of RMB undervaluation. In the near term, it is taken as part of an
overall rebalancing package, which includes measures to promote private consumption.
3.
Rising private consumption. Rebalancing that raises Chinese consumption would raise
growth universally and reduce China’s trade surplus significantly (Figure 1):


Growth. Chinese GDP would increase by around 2 percent. Regional trading partners
would be the significant beneficiaries. For instance, GDP in Malaysia and in Taiwan
Province of China would rise by around ½ percent. However, advanced economies would
benefit substantially less. Japan’s GDP would rise by 0.1 percent, while the U.S. and the
Euro Area would see even smaller rises. (By comparison, a 5 percent increase in U.S.
consumption has larger effects outside Asia than it does in Asia.)



Trade balance. China’s trade surplus would be reduced by about ½ percent of GDP. The
trade balance in all trading partners would improve, contributing to raising GDP.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

2011 SPILLOVER REPORT—SELECTED ISSUES

4.
REER appreciation. An appreciation of the REER would lower China’s trade balance and
also its GDP, but most trading partners would benefit (Figure 2).


China. A 10 percent REER appreciation could reduce China’s GDP by around 1 percent.
The initial direct impact could be larger, close to 1¾ percent; however, the appreciation
would also raise private consumption that offsets this direct impact. China’s trade surplus
would narrow by more than ⅓ percent of baseline GDP.



Regional supply chain. Most trading partners would benefit from a real appreciation of
the renminbi, especially regional partners. This changes if other countries in the regional
supply chain also appreciate.



Commodities’ producers. Some raw material suppliers, however, could have slightly lower
GDP, reflecting a decline in the demand for inputs. Nonetheless, the rise in Chinese
consumption (due to the appreciation) boosts GDP in all partners.



Advanced partners. Advanced trading partners benefit only marginally from the
appreciation. The largest beneficiary is the Euro Area, probably reflecting Germany’s role
as a significant supplier to China.

5.
Best of both worlds. Combining the 10 percent REER appreciation with rebalancing
toward private consumption (rising 5 percent of GDP in total) leaves China’s GDP relatively
unchanged, while China’s trade surplus narrows (Figure 3). Trading partners benefit from both
the appreciation and stronger demand. The impact of the stronger consumption also tends to
ameliorate the impact of trading partner appreciation.
6.
Caveats. The strength of input-output analysis is that it is built on detailed trade and
production patterns. However, the economic structure is relatively static, with limited substitution
possibilities. The simulation results should, therefore, be interpreted as short-term impacts. The
scenarios may understate the impact of an appreciating renminbi, with only trade in final goods
directly affected by the appreciation. Trade in intermediate goods is affected only through
second round effects.

III. ESTIMATING CHINA’S SPILLOVERS: A SECTORAL
TRADE ELASTICITIES APPROACH
1

This chapter assesses the potential impact of an exchange rate appreciation on sectoral trade at a
high level of disaggregation. Given the significant information requirements for highly
disaggregated data, a partial equilibrium exercise is conducted and the long-run effects examined.
The results suggest that a change in relative prices consistent with an appreciation of the RMB
would, over time, facilitate a rebalancing of the economy and re-orient exports more toward
regional partners and high-technology products.
1.
Sectoral-level analysis. The impact of currency appreciation is often examined at the
level of the overall economy or for highly aggregated sectors. This note analyzes the response of
trade flows at the product level (HS2002, 6-digit) to changes in relative prices. Differences in
import demand and substitution elasticities, and differences in the amount of imported
intermediate goods in production, result in changes to the structure of trade.
2.
Approach taken. The information requirements for a high level of disaggregation
necessitate taking a simple approach. Complex interactions across products, sectors, and other
variables (such as income) would compound the number of variables (e.g., elasticities) to be
estimated, raising the data requirements even more. So instead, a partial equilibrium set up is
used, with information from input-output tables (for a detailed description of the methodology
and additional results, see Changing Patterns of Global Trade, IMF). A two-step approach is taken.
The first step focuses on the import market of each economy. Changes in relative prices result in
demand responses and shifts in the structure of trade at the product level that reflect differences
in import demand and substitution elasticities as well as in the amount of imported intermediate
inputs used in producing exports. An analysis of input-output tables shows in particular that the
foreign content of Chinese exports has increased and is large for high and medium-high
technology exports (Figure 1).2 The second step uses the input-output tables to determine the
composition of import demand as a result of the shift in the structure of exports (as determined
in the first step).
3.
Simulation. The simulation reflects an increase (decrease) in the relative price of Chinese
exports (imports) that could stem from a 10 percent appreciation in the currency. For simplicity,
full pass-through of nominal exchange rate changes to import prices in partner countries is

STAN/OECD, available for 36 emerging and advanced countries.

assumed, although in practice exporting firms are likely to adjust profit margins, mitigating the
impact on trade.


Sectoral effects. The simulation points to significant changes in the structure of sectoral
trade. High technology exports decline less than low technology exports, owing to the
significant contribution of imported intermediate inputs (Figure 2). Among the largest
export sectors, the share of machinery and electrical equipment (a high technology sector)
increases, whereas the share of textiles (a low technology sector) declines marginally. Thus,
an appreciation would support a continued upgrading of Chinese exports in terms of
technological content. Reflecting China’s relative downstream position in the supply chain,
imports of intermediate goods fall (while other imports increase) as overall exports decline
in response to the appreciation (Figure 3).



Supply chain effects. Trade with Asian trade partners is less sensitive to changes in relative
prices, consistent with significant regional integration (Figure 4). Exports to the main Asian
export destinations (Hong Kong SAR, Korea, and Taiwan Province of China) decline less,
while exports to European countries (mainly to Italy, U.K., France, and Germany) decline
more. This is consistent with both significant high technology exports to Asian countries
and China’s integration within the Asian production chain.



Aggregate effects. The effects on each sector can be aggregated and the effect on
rebalancing computed. In total, Chinese exports would fall by about 11 percent and
imports increase by 2 percent. Overall, the simulations suggest that the trade surplus could
fall by more than 3 percentage points. However, these results need to be interpreted with
caution owing to the partial equilibrium nature of the exercise.

IV. FACTOR PRICING, OVERCAPACITY, AND
SUSTAINABILITY RISKS
1

This chapter examines the argument that distortions in factor markets effectively subsidize China’s
tradables investment. It finds that distortions in capital costs are substantial and have increased
over time. Moreover, the export-oriented growth model looks increasingly unsustainable. Delays in
reform pose the risk of significant spillovers in the interim.

A. Factor Pricing
1.
Factor costs. In addition to an undervalued exchange rate, China’s export-oriented
growth model has relied on a combination of distorted factor prices. Distortions to capital, labor,
land, energy, and environmental prices have been suggested in the literature (e.g. Huang, 2010).
Huang and Kunyu (2010) suggest the estimated extent of aggregate distortions have declined
from a peak of around 12 percent of GDP in 2006 to around 9½ percent in 2009. More directly,
the extent of the potential distortion can be seen from the gap between Chinese interest rates
and growth, and the relatively low price of gasoline.

Aggregate estimate. A measure of the aggregate factor cost distortions can be
constructed from aggregate production and income data.2 Applying the methodology of Aziz
(2006) to China, the implied tax on capital is significantly negative over much of the period since
1990 and has become more negative over the past decade, suggesting distortions amounting to
substantial subsidies to capital over this period. Many other countries effectively tax capital or
have smaller implicit subsidies, particularly since 2000. Given the undervalued exchange rate and

Aziz (2006) uses growth accounting to calculate the implicit tax (or subsidy, if negative) on investment such that
aggregate productivity, factor use, and consumption are consistent with a model-based benchmark. Since this
essentially measures the distortion in the cost of capital required to account for the difference between economic
behavior described in the aggregate data and a distortion-free benchmark, it provides a single measure of all
distortions. In particular, it can be used to track changes in aggregate distortions over time.

scenario in Guo and N’Diaye (2010)
Year since growth take-off
suggests that key industries could see
their profit margins evaporate in a few years in order to gain the required market shares,
particularly those with thin profit margins and large capacities (e.g., steel). The mismatch
between the buildup of tradable manufacturing capacity in China and the lack of strong external
demand could have significant implications for the balance sheets of the corporate and banking
sectors.

5.
Spillovers. Based on the estimates from a global vector autoregression (GVAR, see
Chapter VI), a deterioration in the quality of non-financial corporate and financial balance sheets
in China would have substantial negative effects on the rest of the world, particularly on the
regional supply chain and commodity exporters.


18

Corporates. An increase in Chinese corporate default probabilities (a measure of balance
sheet deterioration) by 10 percentage points could lower industrial output in other
economies by as much as 3⅓ percent among emerging Asian economies and 2 percent
of GDP in commodity exporters.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA 2011 SPILLOVER REPORT—SELECTED ISSUES



Banks. A similar deterioration in bank balance sheets would have somewhat larger
impacts. An increase in Chinese banks’ default probability by 10 percentage points could
lower industrial output in Japan and emerging Asia by about 3⅓ percent. U.K. industrial
output would also be lower by about 5 percent. Many other economies, such as in the
Euro Area, could also experience some decline in industrial production.



Caveat: The measure of financial stress is indicative of problems in balance sheets that
would affect real activity, at least until policies are implemented to either resolve the
problems directly or to transfer them out of the banks’ balance sheets and, as some
expect, onto the balance sheet of the public sector.

6.
Historical default rates. Historical evidence from China and the U.S. suggest that a
significant hike in the default probability could occur following the booms, particularly
investment driven ones. The default probability of the Chinese banking sector increased by more
than 200 bps following the credit boom in the early 2000’s. In the U.S., corporate default rates
also increased by a similar 30

V. IMPACT OF CHINA’S COMPETITION:
BRAZIL AND MEXICO
1

This chapter assesses the impact of China’s competition on the main export market shares of Brazil
and Mexico. It finds some evidence that these countries lost competitiveness vis-à-vis China, but the
impact is moderate. A portion of the loss can be attributed to exchange rate valuations, particularly
for Mexico, whose export structure is more similar to China’s.
1.
Context. There has been concern that China’s competitiveness in export markets, while
built on structural advantages such as the low cost of labor, has been boosted by a distorted
exchange rate and other factor costs, such as the cost of capital. The claim is that this
competitiveness has adversely impacted the ability of other developing and emerging market
countries to compete in third markets. This paper assesses the claim by looking at the impact of
China’s competition on two Latin American emerging markets, Brazil and Mexico. In particular, it
looks at how these countries have been affected in their largest markets, the U.S. and European
Union for Brazil and the U.S. for Mexico.
2.
Exports in third markets. Brazil and Mexico gained market shares in their respective
main markets, but this process stopped in the 2000s, with somewhat different timings for each.
For Brazil, it stopped in the mid-2000s, but for Mexico, it was 2001, around the time China
entered the WTO. Excluding China’s exports reveals higher market shares in remaining exports,
suggesting competition with China may have led to losses in market share.

Competitiveness gain index. To measure more precisely the impact of China’s
competition on Brazil’s and Mexico’s competitiveness, the first step was to construct a
“competitiveness gain” index using constant market share analysis (CMS) at a 4-digit SITC
product level (see Appendix I). The index was constructed with and without China for both the
U.S. and the European Union markets in the case of Brazil and for the U.S. market in the case of
Mexico. The index shows that, in both the U.S. and European Union markets, Brazil experienced
competitiveness gains in the first part of the 2000s, but suffered losses in competitiveness in the
last part of the decade (see charts below); these losses were especially strong in the U.S. market.
For Mexico, the loss of competitiveness started in 2001 after gaining for 15 years. Repeating the
exercise for China shows it continuously gaining competitiveness since the mid-1980s, with a
boost taking place after its entry into the WTO.

China effect. These competitiveness gain indices can in turn form the basis for
constructing a counterfactual: what would have happened to Brazil’s and Mexico’s
competitiveness in third markets had China not been active in these markets? This was done by
first calculating competitiveness gains of Brazil and Mexico with and without China in a third
market (solid line and dash line, respectively, in the charts on competitiveness gain shown
above), and then by taking the difference between these two indices. The difference can be
thought of as a measure of a pure “China effect” on Brazil or Mexico. The same exercise was
repeated for China by including and excluding Brazil’s or Mexico’s exports to construct a Brazil or
Mexico effect (for China). Finally, a China effect was constructed for a few other countries. The
following facts emerge (see charts below):

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA 2011 SPILLOVER REPORT—SELECTED ISSUES



The China effect on Brazil and Mexico has almost always been negative in the third
market. On the other hand, the Brazil or Mexico effects have been fairly small.



The China effect was small before 2001 but widened afterwards. The large negative
impact appears to be diminishing after 2005, following the appreciation of the RMB.



The overall magnitude of the China effect does not appear to be very large. The peak
impacts on Brazil and Mexico, both of which occurred in 2005, are about 2 percent and
3 percent of their exports to the U.S. (slightly less in the E.U. market for Brazil).

This analysis thus suggests a role for a China effect on Brazil’s and Mexico’s manufacturing
market share in third markets, but this effect appears to be moderate. Other factors, such as
potentially internal competitiveness factors and the shift of the supply chain, could play a key
role in driving the dynamism of the manufacturing tradable sector in Brazil or Mexico.

5.
Exchange rates. The flexibility of exchange rates in Brazil and Mexico and the relatively
rapid appreciation of the renminbi against the U.S. dollar during 2005–2008 generated significant
variations in both the bilateral nominal and real exchange rates between China and Brazil or
Mexico. These variations can be used to estimate the impact of China’s exchange rate on Brazil’s
or Mexico’s competitiveness.
6.
Results. Regression analysis shows that exchange rates played a role in determining
Brazil’s or Mexico’s competitiveness. In these regressions, the China effect (whose increase
indicates that Brazil’s competitiveness improves) was regressed on the annual change in the
bilateral nominal and real exchange rates (subject to the usual caveat that these regressions
capture correlations and not causality). The main results are as follows:


The regression was first estimated by pooling together all the products (first table below,
first column for Mexico; second table below for Brazil). As expected, an appreciation of
the real or the peso is estimated to push the China effect more into negative territory—
that is, it reduces Brazil’s or Mexico’s competitiveness. Every 10 p.p. depreciation of the
renminbi against the real or the peso would reduce Mexico’s exports by around 0.5 p.p.
The effect on Brazil’s exports is smaller (about one-quarter of the effect on Mexico).



Results for sub-groups of products reveal that the effect of the exchange rate has been
stronger and statistically significant on products where Brazil and Mexico have
traditionally enjoyed a comparative advantage over China, medium-low and mediumhigh technology goods, while the effect on resource-based, low-technology and hightechnology good is either weak or statistically less significant (first table below, second
through fifth column, for Mexico; third table below for Brazil). This finding thus lends
support to the view that undervaluation in China’s currency may be contributing to
eroding competitiveness in those goods where Brazil or Mexico and China are
increasingly competing, medium-tech goods.

Appendix I. The Competitiveness Gains Index
1.
Calculation. For a given product, the index denotes whether competitiveness is
increasing or decreasing: it is computed as the difference between a country’s export of this
product to a particular market in a given year relative to what would have been expected if this
country had maintained the same market share for the product in this market as in the previous
year and given its total imports of this product. A positive value indicates that the country’s
competitiveness is increasing in this product. The sum across all products (normalized by the
country’s total exports in the previous year) gives a summary index of the overall competitiveness
gains. The methodology controls for two effects that change a country’s export share in global
markets without underlying changes in competitiveness. The first is the terms of trade effect: if
the prices of the products exported change, it is likely that the exporter’s market share may also
change regardless of its “competitiveness”. The second is the composition effect: if a country
specializes in goods that are in strong demand, its export market share may rise even without
any gains in productivity.

complex interactions among a large number of economies. The impact of cyclical factors, such as
worsening credit quality, is assessed, along with exchange rate appreciation and structural reforms
for rebalancing demand. Deteriorating credit portfolios would adversely impact trading partners,
particularly those in the Asian supply chain. On the other hand, the benefit to trading partners of
Chinese structural reforms and real appreciation depends on their location in the supply chain.
1.
Global VAR. A global vector autoregression (GVAR) provides a dynamic multi-country
framework suitable for the analysis of interdependence and international transmission of shocks.
In this note, a GVAR model comprising 30 countries—21 advanced and 9 emerging—is used,
based on Chen et al. (2010, IMF Working Paper WP/10/124; see Appendix I). The model has real
and financial variables: industrial production (a proxy for GDP), real effective exchange rate, real
money market rate, real share prices, and a measure of potential financial stress (the assetweighted average expected default frequency of banks and nonfinancial corporates). The latter
captures the role of credit in the transmission of financial and real sector shocks. Monthly data
are used (Jan 1996–Dec 2008).
2.
Spillovers. The model is used to analyze the spillover effects of policies or shocks from
China. Given China’s rapidly changing economic structure, an estimated model like the one used
here cannot speak to the long-term impact of changing policies or shocks. Conjunctural concerns
regarding the pace and quality of credit growth are assessed by examining the effects of
deteriorating balance sheets. Balance sheet quality is captured through estimated default
probabilities (EDFs); these have predictive power on the strength of credit growth one year ahead
(the unconditional correlation between credit growth and one-year lagged EDF is around -0.5),
even though credit is highly influenced by official actions in China. Structural reforms in support
of rebalancing the economy, such as financial sector reforms that help to level the playing field in
production, would be expected to increase Chinese productivity. Only the aggregate impacts of
such reforms and of exchange rate appreciation are assessed (it is not feasible to report standard
errors, given that weighted maximum impulse responses are reported).
3.
Financial shocks. A deterioration in the quality of non-financial corporate as well as
financial balance sheets in China would have substantial negative effects on the rest of the world,
highlighting China’s increasingly important role, including in the global supply chain.

Corporates. An increase in Chinese corporate default probabilities by 1 pp could lower
industrial output in other economies by as much as 1/3 percent among emerging Asian
economies and 1/5 percent of GDP in commodity exporting economies. Declining equity
prices would have a qualitatively similar impact (see figure below).



Banks. A similar deterioration in bank balance sheets would have a somewhat larger impact.
An increase in Chinese banks’ default probability by 1 pp could lower industrial output in
Japan and emerging Asia by about 1/3 percent. U.K. industrial output would also be lower
by about ½ percent. Many other economies, such as in the Euro Area, could also experience
some decline in their industrial production (see figure below).



Robustness. Note that the measure of financial stress is indicative of problems in balance
sheets that would affect real activity, at least until policies are implemented to resolve the
problems directly or to transfer them out of the banks’ balance sheets and, as some expect,
onto the balance sheet of the public sector. A financial stress scenario performed in the
context of a structural macroeconometric model of the G20 (Vitek, 2010, IMF Working Paper
WP/10/152) yields broadly similar results.

4.
Rebalancing. Structural reforms would be expected to boost productivity in
manufacturing, which accompanied by greater import substitution would generally have an
important impact on the supply chain. Economies upstream would benefit from higher output in
China at lower cost, while the demand for inputs from suppliers would decline. A rise in industrial
output by 1 pp would raise output by about 0.05 percent in economies at the end of the supply
chain, such as advanced economies (see figure below). The impact downstream (mainly,
emerging Asia) is estimated to be negative, albeit small, owing to increased capacity in China.
5.
Appreciation. RMB real effective appreciation would lower output in China but have
positive spillovers for most economies, especially commodity (e.g., Latin America) and producers
of intermediate goods (e.g., emerging Asia). A 10 percent real effective appreciation could raise
output by close to 1 percent in many advanced economies (e.g., Japan, U.K.) but less so in the
U.S. (see figure below). Such an appreciation would also lower output in China. Symmetrically, a
real effective depreciation boosts growth in China, at the expense of many partners.

Appendix I. The GVAR Model
Structure of the GVAR Model
The structure of the GVAR model can be summarized as the follows. Consider N+1 economies,
indexed by i = 0, 1, 2, ..., N, and a vector xit of ki domestic variables for each economy. Stacking
the vectors of country-specific variables,




xt   x 0t , x1t , ..., x Nt  ,



(1)

a VAR in xt would contain too many parameters to be estimated if the time dimension T of the
data is not much larger than the number of economy N. Instead of regressing x i, t on

without any restriction, GVAR links x i, t to a k i*  1 vector x i,t , where
N

x *it

    ij x  jt ,
j0

  1, 2,..., k i* .

(3)

The weight  lij captures the spillover effect of variable l of foreign economy j on variable l of
domestic economy i. Since  lij measures the relative importance of economy j to economy i, the
spillover effect of variable l is in proportion to the weight chosen to measure the relative
importance. Therefore, each economy’s component of GVAR is given as a VARX*  pi , qi  :

unobserved common effects across economies. The country-specific foreign variables and
common factors are treated as weakly exogenous (if confirmed by statistical tests), i.e., they are
“long-run forcing” country-specific domestic variables. The term “long-run forcing” means that in
the equations for foreign variables, the coefficients on the error-correction terms are set to zero.
The dynamics of foreign variables are not influenced by deviations from the long-run equilibrium
path, in contrast to the dynamics of domestic variables.
The VARX* can be estimated economy by economy using the ordinary least squares (OLS)
method or rank-reduced approach if the cross-dependence of the idiosyncratic shock is
sufficiently small, that is:

From equation (3), it can be seen that

x*it and Wi is an appropriately defined weighting scheme. Thus, stacking (4)

Equation (8) is a VAR for the complete set of domestic variables for all economies.
The advantage of the GVAR model is that it makes the estimation of (8) feasible by accounting
for interdependence among economies and then estimating the partial system on a economyby-economy basis, which implies allowing for modeling a large number of economies. The
impulse response is computed based on (8).
The vector for domestic variables is given by:



xit  edfbit

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

edfnit

rit

qit



'

(10)

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA 2011 SPILLOVER REPORT—SELECTED ISSUES

where edfbit denotes the logarithm of asset-weighted average expected default frequency (EDF)
of banks and edfnit for (nonfinancial) corporates, rit is the real money market rate, yit is the
s
logarithm of industrial production, pit the logarithm of real share price index, and qit is the

logarithm of the real effective exchange rate.
The vector for foreign variables for each economy except the United States is given by:



x*it  edfbit* edfnit* rit* yit*

pits*



'

(11)

We do not construct foreign effective exchange rates to minimize the number of parameters to
be estimated, since information about foreign economies’ currency is captured in the (tradeweighted) real effective exchange rate qit .
The foreign variable for the United States is constructed as:

x*us ,t  y *us ,t

(12)

Given the large influence of the U.S. financial variables on global markets, the U.S. foreign
financial variables are less likely to be weakly exogenous for the U.S. domestic variables. That is
the main reason we do not include the U.S. foreign financial variables in the equations for the
United States.
The spot oil price is included as a common factor dt  s to remove the common component in the
reduced form residuals. Another candidate for inclusion as a common factor could be the index
of global stock price volatility VIX, to ensure that the EDF shocks are purely idiosyncratic.
However, because the VIX is driven by volatility in U.S. share prices, it is not weakly exogenous to
the U.S. variables. Adding it separately will not augment the information content of the model.
Equations (3) and (4) show that the spillover effect of a foreign variable on a domestic variable is
proportional to the weight  lij , which measures the relative importance of economy i to
economy j in the transmission. Since the transmission channels for financial variables are likely to
be different from the transmission channels for the variables measuring real activity, we use
financial weights to construct foreign financial variables―EDFs, real money market rate, share
price index and real effective exchange rate―and trade weights for industrial production.

Impulse Responses
Given the short sample period, the study focuses on short-run dynamics. The model is estimated
in first differences as the macroeconomic and financial data are found to be integrated of order
1. Identifying the complete set of shocks in equation (8) and computing the impulse response
functions in a GVAR model is not straightforward. It requires imposing an enormous amount of
identification restrictions due to the large number of economies covered in the study. Therefore,
we identify shocks following the approach in Dees, Di Mauro, Pesaran and Smith (2007) and
Binder, Chen and Zhang (2009).

After identifying the EDF shocks, we compute impulse responses of the other variables in the
global solution in equation (8) based on correlations between the reduced form shock of each
variable and the identified structural shock of the EDF. Such an identification scheme means that
zero correlation between the structural EDF shocks and other domestic variables in each
economy need not be imposed and the transmission of the shock is determined without any
additional restrictions.

VII. CHINA SPILLOVERS: GIMF SIMULATIONS OF
REBALANCING AND APPRECIATION
1

This chapter applies the Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal (GIMF) model to study the spillovers
from China rebalancing. The GIMF model permits an assessment of changes to fiscal, exchange
rate, and structural policies in both the near and longer terms. The model’s simulations point to
significant spillovers from rebalancing. Benefits are larger if rebalancing comes through a
comprehensive package of structural, fiscal, and exchange rate reforms rather than exchange rate
appreciation alone.
1.
Policies. The set of policies considered for rebalancing demand and reallocating
resources across sectors include a real appreciation of the exchange rate by about 20 percent
over five years, financial sector reform comprising among others interest rate liberalization and
increased access to financial services by households and SMEs, higher public social spending,
and a stronger social safety net. All these policies support rebalancing demand toward private
consumption. They are broadly consistent with the medium-term reform plans already being
implemented or envisaged by the Chinese authorities. The real effective exchange rate
appreciation of 20 percent over 5 years serves purely as an illustration so as to model a
“substantial” change in the exchange rate over the medium term.
2.
Model. To analyze the spillover effects of these policies, the multi-country dynamic
general equilibrium GIMF model is used. The model allows for dynamic interaction across a
broad range of countries and sectors, and permits an analysis of fiscal as well as exchange rate
and structural policies (see Kumhof and Laxton, 2010). The GIMF model used for this chapter
comprises 8 regions: 5 Asian blocks, namely, China (CN), Emerging Asia (AS—which includes
Hong Kong SAR, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand), Japan (JA), South
Korea (KO), and Australia and New Zealand (AZ); the U.S. (US), Euro Area (EU), and the rest of the
world. Financial sector variables operate mainly through a financial accelerator mechanism. There
are several layers of production, with distinctions between manufacturing of intermediate goods,
distribution of intermediate goods to domestic and foreign assemblers, and final production of
consumption and investment goods. The model thus captures the direct and indirect
transmission channels of shocks as well as spillover effects from rebalancing.
3.
Scenarios. Two scenarios are considered: (i) a comprehensive rebalancing scenario that
assumes (a) structural reforms to raise productivity in the services sector, which would be
accompanied by a shift in households’ preferences toward non-tradable goods; (b) fiscal reforms
aimed at reducing individual uncertainties and precautionary savings; (c) financial sector reforms
to liberalize interest rates and develop further the domestic capital market; and (d) a gradual
appreciation of the RMB––20 percent over 5 years; and (ii) a real effective exchange rate (REER)
appreciation scenario only—20 percent over 5 years.

4.
Comprehensive rebalancing. A successful rebalancing of China’s growth toward private
consumption would have a significant impact on China’s trading partners (see Figures 13).


Output rises in all regions, including China, with the largest gains among partners being
in the Asian economies.



Investment rises throughout Asia (ex Japan), but falls in U.S. and Euro Area.



34



In China, investment rises primarily in the non tradable sector because structural
reforms raise productivity and profits. This increase is offset in the short term by
lower investment in tradables, given the rising cost of capital and appreciating
exchange rate. The overall impact on total investment depends on how quickly
capacity rises in the non tradable sector and on the payoffs from reforms.



In Korea, emerging Asia, and to a lesser extent Australia and New Zealand,
investment rises in relation to GDP in the short run as these economies benefit
from stronger demand from China. But as China’s demand for imported goods
moves away from intermediate inputs and toward final goods and as production
shifts toward catering to the domestic market, the benefits for intermediate
goods exporters is reduced.



In the U.S. and the Euro Area, total investment falls in relation to GDP as the nontradable sector shrinks with the real depreciation of the dollar and the euro.
However, the depreciation supports the manufacturing sector.

Private consumption rises in relation to GDP in China and Korea, but falls in the other
partner economies.


In China, the higher share reflects the impact of fiscal and financial sector reforms
that provide better access to finance for households and small private firms,
reduce the need for precautionary savings, and raise labor income.



In Korea, the rise in consumption stems from higher income as firms hire more
labor to satisfy the demand from China, as well as wealth effects from lower
payments (through both lower interest rates and an appreciating currency) on
foreign liabilities (the valuation effects from currency changes would be
somewhat overstated to the extent that most foreign liabilities are hedged, as
would be the case for Australia and New Zealand.).



Consumption falls in relation to GDP in Japan, emerging Asia, the United States,
Euro Area, and Australia and New Zealand, as the real depreciation of their
currencies limits spending and results in a rise in saving. This increase in saving
mirrors the decline in China’s saving rate.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA 2011 SPILLOVER REPORT—SELECTED ISSUES

Current account balances are lower in China (reflecting stronger domestic demand and
an appreciating currency) and in emerging Asia. Balances are higher in the U.S., Euro
Area, and Australia and New Zealand owing to stronger import demand from China.



5.
REER appreciation. A 20 percent appreciation of China’s REER would lower output in
China and shift its composition toward domestic demand (Figures 46). Such a shift would be
accompanied by a rise in import demand from the rest of the world, which would generate
positive spillovers. At the same time, the appreciation reduces China’s exports, lowering the
current account surplus. Current account balances rise modestly in most regions because of
stronger exports to China, but fall in emerging Asia owing to a reduction in China’s demand for
intermediate goods.
6.
Conclusion. Rebalancing through the exchange rate alone would be less beneficial to
other countries and more costly to China compared to the case where rebalancing is brought
about by a comprehensive package of polices. A lack of rebalancing owing to a nonappreciation, or a real effective depreciation, benefits China at the expense of the world. But a
comprehensive rebalancing would bring mutually beneficial outcomes.

VIII. CHINA SPILLOVERS: GLOBAL COMMODITY
MARKETS
1

China’s role in global commodity markets is increasing rapidly. Potentially the most important
spillover over the medium term could come from a rebalancing of economic growth toward private
consumption. This could reduce China’s demand growth for some raw materials used in processing
and investment (e.g., base metals), although historical experience suggests that total energy
consumption will still rise by similar rates to GDP growth. Short-run shocks to real activity in China
have an increasingly large commodity price effect; for example, a 3 percent shock to industrial
production growth (1 standard deviation, or nearly 1 percent of GDP) causes crude oil and copper
prices to rise by 6 percent. This would have widespread global terms of trade effects.
1.
Role. China is a large consumer of a broad range of primary commodities. Its market
shares have increased sharply since 2000, reflecting rapid economic growth but also the
economic structure, notably rapid growth of exports and large-scale fixed asset investment.
China has come to play a dominant role in base metals markets and, to a somewhat lesser extent,
agricultural raw material markets. In contrast, China has not yet assumed a large role in global
food and energy markets, although its share of world imports is rising.
Figure 1. China’s Share of Global Commodity Trade
(net imports as a percent of world imports)

2.
Rebalancing. Realignments in the structure
of China’s economy over the medium term (e.g., a
lower contribution to growth from fixed asset
investment and exports of tradables) may change
the nature of China’s participation in world
commodity markets. In particular, while relatively
high economic growth rates should lead to
ongoing increases in commodity consumption,
China may experience a decline in “commodity

Quantitative effect. How big is China’s effect in global commodity markets? The main
near-term policy spillover from China to global commodity markets is from measures that affect
the level of real activity or the accumulation of physical inventory. To analyze the effects of
shocks to the growth rate of real activity on some important global commodities—namely, crude
oil, copper, and other base metals such as aluminum—global supply-demand models are
estimated:
Specification. A vector autoregression (VAR) with 5 variables is estimated using monthly
data from January 2000 through October 2010: the primary production of the
commodity; advanced economy industrial production; Chinese industrial production; the
real renminbi-U.S. dollar exchange rate; and the real commodity price. A recursive
identification scheme is used, based on Killian (2009) with the variables ordered as above.



Results. Real activity shocks have large and statistically significant effects on global
commodity prices. The attached figure shows the variation decomposition of commodity
prices arising from Chinese demand. In

Note: 4-quarter variance decomposition to 1 standard deviation shock in industrial output
has a persistent effect on the level
of oil prices, largely because of a weak supply response.



Copper. A rise in copper prices of about 6 percent after six months, with the effect
largely persisting due again to a weak supply response.



Other base metal prices rise by less and, in some cases (e.g., zinc), there is no
statistically significant effect of a price effect. There is no significant effect on
aluminum prices, reflecting a relatively large supply response. In contrast to other
base metals, China has significant bauxite deposits and aluminum refining
capacity that can respond quickly to increased demand.

Reserves. It is difficult to identify demand shocks caused by changes in state reserve
holdings, for lack of data. At a global level, precautionary demand shocks are modeled as
unexpected changes in prices and are shown to have large and persistent price effects.

4.
Global terms of trade effects. Material shocks to real activity growth in China have
significant global terms of trade effects. Using the global supply-demand model estimated
above, the first-round trade balance impacts are presented by country and region of higher
prices for crude oil and 5 base metals following a China demand shock (Table 1). Iron ore is also
included owing to its importance as a factor of production (limited data availability and the
prevalence of long-term contract pricing before 2010 preclude an empirical estimate of the 12month impact on prices; the change in prices is set to the average of the other 5 base metals,
which equates to 1 percentage point increase for a 1 percentage point demand growth shock).
The 12-month change in prices is applied to full year imports and exports.


Overall. Many commodity exporting emerging economies experience a positive terms of
trade effect as the value of exports increase. Their trade balances improve, while those of
advanced markets and other commodity importers deteriorate slightly.



Middle East. The largest effect is seen in the Middle East where oil exporters see a
3.3 percent improvement in trade balances as a percent of GDP.



Other commodity exporting regions. Africa, the Commonwealth of Independent States,
and Latin America also experience improved trade balances.



Commodity importers. This increase is offset globally by small deteriorations in the trade
balances of advanced economies, emerging Asia (including China), and emerging Europe.



Summary. China’s impact on commodity markets, while significant, remains smaller than
that of the U.S. This reflects a smaller share of world consumption for some commodities,
such as for crude oil. More broadly, this is the result of the dynamics of real activity
growth shocks in the U.S., which tend to be more persistent domestically and have larger
effects on the rest of the world than shocks that originate in China.

China’s increasing role. Recursive estimations show that, in general, the impact of China
on global commodity prices has been steadily increasing over the last 5 years and that estimates
based on historical samples may be underestimating China’s current impact (Figure 3). The spike
in the estimated impulse responses during the final quarter of 2008 is caused by the significant
declines in commodity prices during the post-Lehman Brothers bankruptcy period. Recursive
estimations that include separate dummy variables for October, November, and December 2008
smoothed out the evolution of the impulse responses, but the results were qualitatively and
quantitatively similar.

Commodity price decomposition. How important has Chinese demand been for
commodity price developments during the last 10 years? To some extent, this is shown by the
variance decompositions above. An alternative perspective is to assess the contribution of each
of the variables to commodity price changes for each quarter, based on the model estimates
(Figure 4).
One notable result is the

stockpiling commodities in advance of the fiscal stimulus that was implemented later that
year and into 2010. During the early stages of the price recovery, explicitly identified
China demand shocks provided a positive but small contribution to price changes.



A second notable result is the contribution of U.S. interest rates to price changes. Some
caution should be exercised with respect to the interest rate contributions as they are
based on changes in the real Federal Funds rate. During this period, U.S. inflation was
unusually volatile, in part reflecting the pass-through of international commodity prices
and, as interest rates approached their zero lower bound, much of the effect can be
ascribed to changing inflation.



Perhaps the most striking result is the relative size of the effect of changes in the value of
the U.S. dollar on commodity prices. Dollar appreciation exacerbated the demand-driven
price downturn in 2008 and contributed to the price rebound in 2009. The effects of
recent depreciation—occurring through the second half of 2010, during which the U.S.
Federal Reserve announced a second round of quantitative easing (QE2) of monetary
policy—have been significant. Although the lagged effects of a stronger dollar in the
midst of the Euro Area problems was still weighing on commodity prices during Q3, the
final three months of 2010 saw dollar depreciation contributing significantly to
commodity price changes. The extent to which QE2 contributed to the loss of value of
the dollar is still subject to debate and there remains insufficient evidence to claim that
QE2 affected commodity prices significantly.

IX. CHINA’S CLOSED CAPITAL ACCOUNT AND
CAPITAL FLOWS TO EMERGING MARKETS
1

There is a view that China’s closed capital account has exacerbated the recent surge of capital flows
to other emerging markets (EMs). It is hypothesized that the inability of investors to have direct
exposures to portfolio investment in China led them to look for substitutes in other EMs, which in
turn contributed to the inflows elsewhere. While this is plausible, the evidence below is ambiguous.
1.
Closed capital account. China’s capital account is tightly controlled and remains largely
closed to portfolio flows. The controls are comprehensive, effective, and binding in both
directions. Thus, portfolio flows account for a small fraction of capital flows. This is in contrast to
other EMs with open capital accounts, where portfolio flows are of greater importance, as
evidenced in various episodes of surging capital flows.

Capital inflows. China is the single
largest recipient of capital inflows among all
EMs. During the period 2009Q3–2010Q2,
29 percent of the inflows to EMs ended up in
China, while China’s GDP is about 31 percent
of the same group of countries. While the
aggregate inflows to China do not appear to
be distinctly small, it should be noted that in
other large countries their share of flows is
larger than their share of GDP.

Hong Kong SAR listed firms. Investors could gain direct exposures to Chinese portfolio
assets by buying Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong SAR. H-share (mainland companies listed in
Hong Kong SAR) and red-chip (companies with main business in the mainland) stocks account
for around 50 percent of market capitalization of HKSE (about US$2.7 trillion). If capital flows
were being diverted from China, Hong Kong SAR would be a natural place to receive such flows

and one would expect to see large inflows and a surge in equity prices in Hong Kong SAR under
its linked exchange rate regime. However, there has been no evidence of large inflows into the
Hong Kong SAR stock market (even some outflows in the most recent quarters). In addition, the
performance of the Hong Kong SAR stock market is decisively in the middle of the pack
compared to regional peers.

4.
Regression analysis. Empirical analysis of how overall flows and the composition of
flows would change as a result of an opening of China’s capital account is hindered by the lack of
variation in the data on the degree of openness over time of China’s capital account. Such
analyses would need to rely on differences in the openness across other EMs’ capital accounts to
make inferences, but given China’s size and importance it is difficult to draw firm conclusions for
China from such an exercise. In a regression that includes pull and push factors of capital flows as
well as a measure of capital account openness, a country’s own capital account openness is
found to have a significant impact on capital flows into itself (details about the regression are
provided in Recent Experiences in Managing Capital Inflows—Cross-Cutting Themes and Possible
Policy Framework). But there is no clear evidence that partner countries’ capital account
openness matters for its capital inflows, or alternatively stated that the closed capital account of
one country contributed to additional inflows to other countries (Table 1).
5.
Further results. The regressions also suggest that additional portfolio inflows into China
may not be large were China to open its capital account. A standard gravity equation using CPIS
data suggests that multiple pull and push factors could affect portfolio investments between any
pair of countries (Table 2). Financial openness, as measured by the Chinn-Ito index, is only
marginally significant after controlling for other factors. Quantitatively, portfolio investment in
Chinese equities, where capital account openness appears to matter most, would be about
30 percent higher than the current level if China’s capital account were as open as that of Brazil.
6.
Caveats. The above tests suffer from low power. Therefore, caution is needed in
interpreting the results (since, among other things, currency undervaluation and financial
repression would be expected to shift asset allocations). China is not an average EM, given its
robust growth and size. The regressions results reflect experiences from average EMs, and it is
unlikely that an opening of China’s capital account would be seen as an average EM opening its
capital account. General equilibrium effects of such an event are not captured by the analysis
above but may well exist in reality.

X. CHINA’S SAVING: THE IMPACT ON GLOBAL
FINANCIAL CONDITIONS
1

China’s annual saving is the largest in the world—even in dollars. During 2010–15, China is
projected to contribute more than 1/3rd of global net wealth accumulation, which will impact
domestic and external financial conditions. This chapter estimates the impact of this saving on
asset prices. China’s closed capital account implies that the saving will significantly raise domestic
valuations relative to the rest of the world. Should the authorities seek to alleviate mounting
inflationary pressure on domestic asset prices by selling Chinese bonds (and sterilizing with foreign
asset purchases), external valuations could also rise. An orderly opening of the capital account that
results in net flows into China could lead to declining asset valuations elsewhere, particularly in
non-S5 countries.
1.
Large saving. On account of its large
annual saving, China is projected to contribute
more than 1/3rd of global net wealth accumulation
between 2010 and 2015 (measured as net
investment plus increase in net foreign assets).
China’s allocation of this new wealth should have
increasingly important, if gradual, implications for
domestic and global financial markets.

2.
Analytical framework. To assess the implications of China’s growing influence on global
financial markets under current policies, a set of asset market clearing conditions is used (see
Appendix I). Relative valuations needed to clear asset markets are calculated for portfolio
allocations across regions. An increase in demand for a country’s asset results in an increase in its
valuation, under a given path for the exchange rate. (Consistent with the WEO, a constant REER
exchange rate path is assumed, which also determines the saving and investment balances.)
3.
Rising domestic asset prices. Given capital controls and an undervalued currency,
among other factors, China’s non-reserve asset holdings reveal a high degree of home-bias. If, as
is likely, capital controls remain in place for the coming years and the managed appreciation of
the currency is gradual, the current configuration of

4.
Changing portfolios. In the absence of rebalancing policies to slow savings, the
authorities may seek to control asset inflation by purchasing foreign assets and selling RMB
assets. Such operations reallocate saving toward net foreign assets. A further accumulation of
US$600 billion in reserves between 2011 and 2015 would be needed, on top of the baseline
increase in reserves (US$2 trillion), to keep real asset inflation at the same rate as in the U.S.
5.
Impact on foreign asset prices.
Purchases of foreign assets would result in
noticeable asset inflation elsewhere over
the 2011-15 period. The impact on non-S5
countries could be larger, should China
choose to incrementally hold more of their
assets. 2 This would be particularly true if
more outward direct investment is
encouraged as an alternative to reserve
accumulation, since 95 percent of China’s
FDI goes to non-S5 countries.

asset price increases, or there is a trade-off between exchange rate appreciation and asset price
inflation in the face of rising demand for a country’s asset. The above conditions can pin down a

capital stock is the relevant asset for the purpose of this exercise. Capital stock data for

the FDI data are from the official Chinese statistics, which break down the stock of FDI by
country. For portfolio investment, official data are used from the U.S. and Japan, along
with some CPIS data, and a few assumptions were made to back out the geographical
allocation. Then, the weighted average of portfolio investment and FDI and the net
holding of domestic asset were used to calculate . For countries other than China,

XI. POTENTIAL IMPACT ON GLOBAL BOND
MARKETS OF REALLOCATING RESERVES
1

This chapter derives the global bond market implications of shifts in China’s reserve allocation
using a simple static mean-variance framework. It provides an example where a reallocation of
China’s holdings of U.S. reserve assets to emerging market (EM) assets by, say, US$100 billion could
increase U.S. yields by 12 bps and reduce EM yields by about 48 bps. Yields on other advanced
market (AM) debt, which are close substitutes of U.S. debt, would also increase. In this framework,
the quantitative results are linear and can be scaled. Given the many uncertainties involved in this
estimation, the results need to be interpreted with caution. In practice, the effect of such a
reallocation would also depend on the speed of its reallocation, an effect that is not possible to
assess in the simple model employed here.
1.
China’s reserves. At over $3 trillion and rising, China’s international reserves are by far
the largest in the world. The portfolio composition of these reserves is not known, but is widely
believed to be mainly in U.S. dollar assets, given the size and depth of U.S. financial markets.
Senior Chinese policy makers have publicly ruled out a rapid change in the composition of
China’s reserves. However, concerns expressed by them on the value of the dollar and the
strength of U.S. policies, measures taken to promote the use of the renminbi in cross-border
trade settlements, and calls for a more diverse international reserve currency system have fueled
speculation that gradual diversification may occur.
2.
Methodology. This chapter analyzes the potential impact on global yields of a shift in
China’s reserve portfolio away from U.S. assets and into EM assets under a variety of scenarios
and assumptions. In a baseline experiment, it is assumed that China reduces its holdings of U.S.
reserves by $100 billon and increases its holdings of EM assets by the same amount. This
reshuffling increases the stock of U.S. debt available in the market while reducing the stock of
available EM debt. In equilibrium, these changes need to be absorbed by a representative global
bond investor through changes in bond yields. This investor requires to be compensated for the
required portfolio shift, as this affects the mean-variance characteristics of his portfolio (see
Appendix I).
3.
Results. Simulation results for a reallocation of China’s reserves from U.S. government
bonds to EM government bonds by $100 billion are as follows (Figure).
First, increasing the market supply of U.S. debt increases yields by about 12 basis points.
This effect is similar to the estimates of Warnock and Warnock (2009), who found that
foreign purchases of U.S. Treasuries of 1 percent of GDP were associated with a 19 bps
reduction in long rates. At 2009 GDP, this would correspond to an impact of 13 bps for a
purchase of US$100 billion. On the other hand, the effect is larger than available
estimates of the effect of U.S. quantitative easing. For instance, Gagnon, Raskin,

Remache, and Sack (2010) estimated that Federal Reserve purchases between December
2008 and March 2010 of US$1.7 trillion of longer-term agency debt and mortgagebacked securities lowered longer term yields by 30–100 bps.


It also increases the yields on U.K., Euro Area and Japan debt by between around 20 and
35 basis points, while it reduces EM yields significantly (by some 200 points).

Robustness. To check the robustness of the results, a number of sensitivity analyses are
undertaken, including: changes in risk aversion parameters; inclusion of U.S. agency debt in the
pool of debt affected by the reallocation; consideration of alternative re-allocation scenarios; and
estimation of yield means and variances over alternative sample periods.

Risk aversion. As would be expected, the magnitudes change slightly.



U.S. reserve assets. In the baseline, only U.S. government debt was considered as part of U.S.
reserve assets. U.S. agency debt has long been considered a close substitute for U.S.
government debt, given the implicit (and, more recently, explicit) government guarantee. If
agency debt (around US$8 trillion at end 2009) is included in the global pool of public debt,
then a US$100 billion shift by China out of U.S. debt represents a smaller portion of the
global debt market, and as such it generates a smaller impact on yields (the impact is some
20 percent smaller).



Broader re-allocation. If, instead of investing entirely in EM debt, China were to spread its
purchases equally across the U.K., Japan, the Euro Area, other AMs, and EMs (by
US$20 billion each), then the impact of shifting out of China is smaller on both the U.S.
and EM debt. (The impact on U.S. yields is lower because the market supply of debt that
is closely substitutable for U.S. debt is reduced, causing demand for the latter to increase
in the ensuing portfolio reallocation.) Yields on non-U.S., non-EM debt also fall in this
experiment, given their reduced supply.



Shorter sample period. If expected returns and covariances are calculated with a shorter
sample (post 2002 only), then the impact of the baseline portfolio shift is larger on U.S.
and Japan yields and smaller on EM yields (and basically unchanged for others). This is
because the 1990s were a turbulent period for many EMs, while the latter part of the
sample has been relatively more turbulent for AMs (in relation to the longer sample).
Thus, EM debt is perceived as less risky in a shorter sample, with the opposite being the
case for AM debt.



Market debt. As discussed above, one of the assumptions underlying this exercise is that
all the public debt that is not held as official reserves is considered as “being in the
market” and priced according to the mean-variance framework. This may not be the case
to the extent that a portion of the outstanding debt is held by financial institutions that
follow passive investment strategies and hold their debt to maturity. Moreover, a portion
of outstanding debt may not available to global investors (e.g., because of limited
liquidity or other constraints). In this framework, the share of the debt that is not truly
available in the market could be subtracted from the world stock of marketable
securities, implying that a given nominal shift in China’s holdings would require a bigger
re-shuffling in terms of portfolio shares (given the smaller base), and in turn
proportionally higher yield adjustments.

5.
Caveats. These results are subject to a number of caveats, including: the model’s focus,
which is limited to mean-variance trade-offs; the sensitivity of the results to the estimation
period; limited data availability; the model’s high-level approach, which abstracts from finer asset
differences; and the static nature of the exercise, which does not allow for assessing the effect of
more gradual shifts over time:


The mean-variance framework requires exogenous factors to account for the level of
current global bond holdings. Under the reasonable assumption that these factors are
stable, this framework can be used to assess the implications of changes in the stock of
different debt securities. The model is less able to account for the level of yields
themselves.



The results are sensitive to the estimation of expected value of returns and their
covariance matrix. The sample includes in particular the last global crisis, a period of large
and volatile changes in yields. Going forward, it is not clear in principle whether the
sample means and variances over this period will be a benchmark for pricing.

52

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND



Because of data constraints, EM bond market behavior is modeled on the EMBI segment.
By construction, this is the most liquid segment of EM external debt. This may lead to
underestimation of the impact of global shocks on EM bond markets, given the trend in
recent years of increased foreign participation in domestic local currency debt markets,
where liquidity may be lower and unevenly distributed across different segments.



There are also a number of issues involved in the calculation of the relevant stocks of
outstanding bonds, for instance, whether private securities (such as corporate bonds)
could be considered as close substitute of government securities.



In practice, the effect of such a reallocation of reserves would depend on more factors
than simply the outstanding stock of securities. These factors, which are not included in
the simple model considered here, include the speed of implementation, how this is
communicated (or not) to the market, and how other official holders of U.S. dollar
securities would react.

Appendix I. Methodology
1.
Mean-variance framework. In a mean-variance framework, portfolio shares are chosen
to maximize a quadratic utility function (see Neely, 2010):
,

where and are the vector of expected (excess) returns and covariance matrix of returns,
respectively; is a parameter of risk aversion; and is the vector of portfolio allocations (as a
share of total wealth). These shares are not constrained to sum to one because the portfolio
constraint is met by investment/disinvestment in a risk-free asset.
2.
Portfolio maximization yields the following relation between expected returns, their
covariance matrix, and the optimal portfolio weights:
(2)

.

In equilibrium, this solution links expected returns to risk preferences (as summarized by ), risk
(as captured by V), and the supply of the risky assets included in the market portfolio (summarize
by their shares, w). This relation is the basis for the simulations conducted this note in which the
relative supplies of different bonds are affected by China’s decisions to reshuffle its holdings of
reserve assets among different bonds.
3.
Risk aversion. It is useful to relate the parameter
of relative risk-aversion, R(W). Simple algebra yields

to the standard Arrow-Pratt measure

where W is the wealth level at which risk aversion is evaluated, normalized to one in what follows.
With this normalization, equation (3) determines a relationship between and R that allows for a
calibration of for a range of values of relative risk aversion R, for which there is available

empirical evidence. Results are presented for relative risk aversion ranging between 1 and 7, with
4 regarded as the “central” scenario.
4.
Application to bond yields. In the simulations considered in this note, it is assumed that
China reallocates its reserve assets by reducing its holdings of U.S. assets and purchasing EM
assets. For a given bond k , equation (1) then implies that the change in real monthly return can
be written as follows:
∆

(4)

where , denotes the covariance in monthly real returns between country j and k; ∆ is the
change in equilibrium return for bond k; and ∆ is the change in the supply of asset j available
in the market as a percentage of total wealth in the market.
For illustrative purposes, the term corresponding to U.S. bonds has been separated from the
other countries. For example, equation (4) implies that an increase in the supply of U.S. bonds
available in the market (∆
0) will raise (reduce) the returns on those bonds whose returns
are positively (negatively) correlated with U.S. returns, ,
0( ,
0 . The total impact is
proportional to the change in the supply of U.S. bonds, the strength of the comovement
between bond returns, and the parameter of risk aversion. Finally, changes in monthly real
returns are translated into changes in annual yields by assuming that these changes are
permanent.
5.
Data and estimation. and , the vector of expected (excess) returns and covariance
matrix of returns, are calculated from total bond return indices for the countries or regions
included in the exercise. For indices in U.S. dollars (the U.S. long-term bond and EM indices, for
which the JPMorgan EMBI indices are used), a monthly real return is calculated by subtracting the
U.S. monthly CPI inflation rate. For the indices in local currency (Germany for the Euro Area,
Japan, United Kingdom, and Canada for other AMs), monthly nominal returns are first converted
into U.S. returns using the monthly change in bilateral exchange rates. Finally, excess real returns
are calculated by subtracting the U.S. short term rate. For the baseline calculations, the sample
starts in 1991 for AM returns and 1995 for the EM index; the Middle East begins in 1998.
In principle, the equilibrium summarized in equation (2) applies to the stocks of financial assets
that are outstanding in the market at a given point in time, expressed as a percentage of the
world’s financial wealth that is allocated to different assets according to the mean-variance
framework. Two assumptions were made to operationalize this approach. First, there is a
representative world bond investor that decides global government bond allocations according
to mean variance preferences defined over bond returns only. Second, reserve assets held by
central banks are excluded from the pool of bonds whose returns are allocated according to the
mean variance framework. The rationale for the latter is that reserve accumulation decisions by
central banks are not made primarily according to the risk-return features of their reserve assets.
Data on outstanding stocks for public debt securities as of end 2009 were obtained from the
Global Financial Stability Report, October 2010, Statistical Appendix, Table 3. This was combined
with COFER data on the currency composition of world reserve assets, and with staff estimates of
