STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 9, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context. Economic performance has been solid since the 2008-09 global crisis. Output has
converged toward potential, inflation is under control, macroeconomic policy remains
prudent, and the financial system has strengthened. However, global and domestic risks to
the outlook are tilted downwards, while buffers are modest and space for counter-cyclical
policies is narrow. Long-term inclusive growth is constrained by low investment in physical
and human capital, institutional weaknesses, and lack of security.
Near-term policies are broadly on track, but the monetary stance may need
reassessment. With the output gap closed, the broadly neutral fiscal policy stance is
adequate, but further tightening of monetary policy may be required if inflationary pressures
persist. Sustaining an adequate fiscal stance will require protecting the 2012 tax reform
against calls for amendments.
It is desirable to enhance fiscal sustainability over the medium term. Though the debtto-GDP ratio remains moderate, the ability to implement counter-cyclical fiscal policies is
limited by Guatemala’s high government debt-to-revenue ratio. Full debt stabilization
requires moderate tightening of the budgetary stance over the medium term. The emphasis
should be on greater revenue mobilization, given the overall low level of spending.
Focus should continue on upgrading the monetary and exchange rate (XR) framework.
Anchoring low and stable inflation will require measures to bolster monetary policy
transmission, including by expanding XR flexibility which would establish the inflation target
as the undisputed primary objective of the central bank. It should provide an additional
shock absorber and reduce incentives for dollarization.
Further strengthening of the financial system is necessary. Guatemala is well prepared to
apply Basel III rules though important work remains, not least to implement fully risk-based
and consolidated supervision.
Structural reforms are vital to achieving long-term inclusive growth. Paving the way
towards high, inclusive growth will depend upon raising the low tax-to-GDP ratio to support
priority public spending, thereby addressing critical social and developmental needs.

OVERVIEW
1.
Guatemala’s economic performance has been solid since the 2008-09 global
financial crisis. In its aftermath, activity rebounded quickly, spurred by both net exports and
domestic demand—supported by rising world commodity prices and counter-cyclical policies—
and buttressed by an 18-month precautionary Stand-by Arrangement (SBA). Growth is now
nearing potential and macroeconomic policies stay a prudent course, not least with declining
fiscal deficits—helping to maintain relatively low inflation. XR flexibility remains limited, while the
financial system has strengthened. The macro outlook is broadly positive.
2.
The main challenge is to unleash higher and more inclusive long-term growth,
while enhancing resilience to shocks and preserving macroeconomic stability. Potential
growth is constrained by weak investment in physical and human capital, and by the elevated
crime and insecurity; poverty is widespread. Increasing high-quality public spending to support
equitable growth is critical, but it will need to go hand-in-hand with boosting public revenue and
strengthening expenditure management to safeguard macroeconomic stability. A nimbler
handling of shocks would be allowed by widening the scope for counter-cyclical budget and
monetary policies—fiscal space is currently limited by the very low tax burden, monetary space
by sticky inflation expectations and modest XR flexibility. The financial sector, while firming, is
mildly dollarized and under-developed. Addressing these structural weaknesses should help
enlarge the policy toolbox further.
3.
The government’s policy plans are aligned with these objectives, but advancing the
reform agenda has proven harder than expected at the start of the administration.
President Pérez-Molina, who took office in January 2012, pledged to mobilize revenue and step
up the efficiency and transparency of public spending (IMF, Country Report No. 12/146).
However, initial reform efforts have suffered setbacks or stalled. The ruling party may muster
sufficient political clout to press on with its program, but the window of opportunity could be
closing soon, as positioning for the next Presidential election begins during the second half of
the four-year administration.

Growth has been robust, while converging

and natural disasters in 2010, activity surged
by 4¼ percent in 2011, helping close the
output gap that opened during 2008-09
(AN 1). Economic expansion decelerated to
3 percent in 2012, underpinned by healthy
domestic demand (Figure 1 and Table 1).

Inflation declined in 2012 but has begun to pick up. In 2011, high world food and oil
prices pushed up headline inflation, which reached 6¼ by end-year. As commodity prices
stabilized and domestic demand pressures weakened, inflation fell sharply in 2012—
closing at 3.4 percent by December. However by May 2013, inflation rose to 4.3 percent
owing mainly to domestic prices, but it still remained within the central bank’s target
range (of 4.0±1 percent) (Figure 1 and Table 1).

The balance of payments has strengthened. The current account deficit declined to just
below 3 percent of GDP in 2012 (from almost 3½ percent in 2011)—as a softening in
traditional export prices was more than offset by a strong recovery in remittances from
the U.S. and more favorable net factor income, amid tepid growth in import values
(Figure 2). Rising FDI, as well as official and private capital inflows, more than financed
this deficit. Thus, net international reserves (NIR) reached US$6.2 billion at end-2012—in
line with reserve adequacy metrics. End-May 2013, NIR rose to US$7.3 billion following
the issuance of an international bond in February totaling US$700 million (1¼ percent of
GDP) with a 15-year maturity and a 5 percent yield (Figure 2 and Table 3).

Competitiveness is broadly adequate though with some signs of erosion. The Fund’s
multilaterally consistent estimates under the External Balance Assessment (EBA) methodology
imply that Guatemala’s REER is in line with current fundamentals, while the CGER methodology

points to moderate overvaluation vis-à-vis medium term fundamentals. At the same time, the
REER has appreciated substantially in recent years, accompanied by some trend widening of the
external current account deficit (Box 1).
6.
Monetary policy has been on hold until lately and foreign exchange intervention
has declined. After reducing the policy rate by 50 bps in June 2012 (to 5 percent), the central
bank kept it constant until late April 2013, when it was lifted by 25 bps. The modest hike aimed
to stem incipient signs of inflationary pressures without exacerbating the possible adverse impact
on domestic growth from prevailing downside global risks. The XR fluctuation margin used to
determine intervention was widened in late 2012 (from 0.60 to 0.65 percent of the five-day
moving average of the XR). Under this rules-based framework, the central bank’s cumulative FX
purchases declined notably. Yet, XR flexibility remains limited— quite low relative to the rest of
Latin America and somewhat below the regional average (Figure 4 and Table 5).

Box 1. Guatemala: External Stability Assessment
Guatemala’s share in global trade has fallen in the last decade, but its export markets have become
more diversified. Between 2000 and 2012, Guatemala’s share in global trade decreased by nearly 25
percent to 0.06 percent of world trade, as its participation in US and European markets shrank. However, its
position in Central America has been strengthened and export destinations have diversified as the top-five
markets1 account for 67 percent of total exports in 2012, down from 80 percent in 2002.

Survey-based competitiveness indicators highlight some challenges for Guatemala. The country’s
ranking in the 2012-2013 Global Competitiveness Index improved only slightly to the 83rd position (out of
144 countries), from 84th in the previous survey. Concerns about crime, corruption, excessive government
bureaucracy and inadequate infrastructure and human capital as cited as main drawbacks. The country has
a somewhat better position in the Doing Business Index, ranking 93rd out of 183 countries, above the Latin
America and Caribbean average of 97.
The CPI-based real effective exchange rate (REER) has appreciated by 40 percent since 2000, partially
driven by Guatemala’s inflation differential with its main trading partner (the US). Relative productivity
increases in Guatemala may have alleviated the impact of this appreciation on competitiveness, but ULCbased REER indicators are not available. Shifts in US GDP have also led to movements in the remittances
inflows and—in conjunction with the global demand for commodities—in the terms of trade (TOT).
Although the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) has depreciated somewhat since 2007, this change
has been modest, at less than 10 percent in cumulative terms.
The current account (CA) deficit has widened in recent years, despite significant remittance inflows.
Although Guatemala ran a small CA surplus in 2009, the deficit reached about 3 percent of GDP in 2012,
mainly driven by a widening of the trade deficit from about 9 to nearly 11½ percent of GDP—still lower
than the over 14 percent of GDP observed in 2004-2008. The services and income deficit has also widened
from below 3 percent of GDP in 2004 to nearly 4 percent of GDP in 2012. During this period, large U.S.
remittances (around 10 percent of GDP) have helped support an average current account deficit of about
3½ percent of GDP.

adequacy metric since 2005, considered fully

IMF’s multilaterally consistent estimates suggest that Guatemala’s REER is broadly in line with
fundamentals both in the short term and relative to medium term benchmarks:.

External Balance Assessment (EBA) estimates based on current fundamentals and desirable
policies point to a sustainable cyclically adjusted current account deficit of 4.1 percent of GDP, which is
1.3 percentage points above the current cyclically adjusted deficit of 2.8 percent.

CGER methodologies, which rely on medium term fundamentals, point to a moderate
overvaluation ranging between 8.8 and 13.9 percent for the benchmark external sustainability and
macrobalance approaches, respectively. However, in order to interpret appropriately these estimates the
significant proportion of FDI in Guatemala’s total external liabilities should be taken into account. Thus, if
an alternative estimate for the NFA position which excludes FDI is used, then the external sustainability
approach instead implies an undervaluation of 3.7 percent, broadly in line with the EBA estimates.

A simple average across the different methodologies implies a moderate overvaluation of 3.1
percent. Given a mean squared error of 0.7 percent, Guatemala’s REER is broadly in line with fundamentals.

Fiscal structural reform attempts have suffered setbacks and delays:



Revenue mobilization. Last year, a tax package was passed by parliament—yielding
1-1½ percent of GDP—to come into force in 2013.1 Claims against the reform have piled
up before the Constitutional Court.2 So far these challenges have been largely
unsuccessful, though associated uncertainties have weighed down on collections and
possible amendments to the reform may erode revenues. A draft Competitiveness Law
sent to Congress by the President grants fiscal incentives to firms incorporated outside
Guatemala City, with possible significant fiscal costs in the medium term.



Expenditure management. A comparatively low revenue-to-GDP ratio, budget rigidities,
and weak internal control systems keep Guatemala’s public social expenditure below the
regional average3 and hinder resource allocation to high-priority areas. Accumulated
domestic arrears, which spiked in 2010, remain unresolved. Some efforts to quantify their
stock were made,4 but a plan to clear them has yet to be put in place—not least because
the discussion is clouded by questions on the validity of the claims. Nor has there been
progress in adopting a comprehensive strategy to avoid their recurrence, since needed
amendments to the Organic Budget Law are stalled in Congress.

9.
Though credit to the private sector is growing fast, the financial system remains
solid and fundamental reforms have advanced. Bank deposits and credit to the private sector
continued to expand—at 12½ and 15½ percent (y/y), respectively, in April—though private

The Constitutional Court has received claims against 35 (out of the total 45) articles in the reform, but so far
suspended only two; one of them is relatively important, relating to more rigorous rules for transfer pricing,
though the authorities estimate that the impact on fiscal revenue will be minimal.
3

A recent Fund technical assistance mission found that these budget rigidities are important, limit the flexibility
to respond to shocks, and could interrupt payments for multi-year projects. An earlier study by the IADB reached
similar conclusions (Los Sistemas de Gasto Público en América Central y la República Dominicana: Disciplina Fiscal

connected lending, strengthening supervision and the enforcement powers of the
superintendence of banks, as well as enhancing the banks’ safety net and resolution
procedures—in line with staff recommendations. A law to regulate micro-finance institutions is in
Congress, and a law to supervise cooperatives is being drafted. In 2012, Guatemala was
reclassified into the OECD’s “white list” of countries that implement international standards for
tax information sharing in the fight against money laundering, terrorism, and tax evasion.
Measures to combat money laundering—which include repossession of illicit assets, reporting of
transactions higher than US$10,000, greater use of technology in financial intelligence, and
stricter monitoring of politicians’ finances—have led to an increase in prosecutions.

Guatemala has gained some ground toward achieving the MDGs, but poverty and
crime are widespread. Modest-to-strong progress has been recorded for 12 out of 16 MDG
targets: extreme poverty has declined somewhat, primary enrollment has risen (albeit from low
levels), and maternal mortality has fallen (Figure 5). However, a third of the population is below
the minimum dietary energy consumption, and chronic malnutrition of children younger than
5 years is pervasive at about 50 percent. At the same time, the level of informality is very high,
while security concerns are very serious—including those linked to drug trafficking (Box 2).

Guatemala’s overall HDI ranking remains stable. Guatemala’s ranking by the UNDP Human

low levels). Access to sanitary drinking water has improved and the enrollment rate in primary school
exceeds that of Latin America as a whole, although total schooling and the quality of education are below
those observed in the rest of the region. More worrisome, the incidence of hunger has almost doubled
since the early 1990s.
Public expenditure devoted to social needs has been trending up and spiked in the wake of the
natural disasters in 2010, though it remains low as a share of GDP. Due to the country’s historically low
tax revenues, the government faces difficulties to fund increased spending in education, health, and
infrastructure for excluded groups.
The authorities are implementing institutional reforms to better target social programs. The creation
of the Ministry of Social Development (MIDES) is expected to ensure greater coherence in public social
policy and coordination across agencies. MIDES directly implements a large number of social programs,
including the conditional cash transfer (CCT) program Mi Bono Seguro. Additionally, the new Zero Hunger
Plan is aimed at consolidating efforts against malnutrition. The Plan prioritizes interventions amongst the
most vulnerable, and will ultimately be in place in the 166 municipalities most affected by malnutrition.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS
11.
The authorities agreed that the economic outlook is generally benign. Under the
baseline scenario, growth is expected to edge up to 3½ percent in 2013 and 2014, reaching its
potential rate, supported by ongoing buoyant domestic demand and healthy private sector
credit. Inflation would remain within the upper half of the central bank’s target range in 2013-14
before stabilizing toward the center of the band. The external current account deficit would
decline to around 2½ percent of GDP in the medium term, more than fully financed by FDI and

other capital inflows. This scenario envisages some fiscal consolidation with the central
government balance stabilizing at 2¼ percent of GDP and public debt rising slowly to around
28 percent of GDP by 2018 (Table 2).
The Outlook for Guatemala is Generally Positive, but Structural Weaknesses Will Constrain Growth.

Near-term risks are prevalent on the downside, owing to global uncertainties and
domestic policy constraints ( as detailed also in the Risk Assessment Matrix):


External conditions. Weaker than expected growth in the U.S. (potentially also triggered
by larger-than-anticipated fiscal tightening) would have adverse spillovers through trade
and remittances on Guatemala’s economic activity and fiscal accounts, while shocks to
neighboring countries would have a greater impact. Faster US growth would have
opposite effects, most notably through stronger growth in remittances. In case global
growth slows, the impact on the external accounts could be lessened by a potential
downward effect on oil prices from reduced global demand. By the same token, a
geopolitical oil shock could worsen Guatemala’s terms-of-trade, harming external
stability and growth. Higher world interest rates would modestly raise the costs of public
external financing. More generally, a hike in global risk aversion could curtail access to
international capital markets, though, the estimated impact of a deleveraging episode by
systemic international financial institutions and large banks would be modest (Box 3 and
AN 2).



Domestic risks. These relate to policy implementation, including a reversal of crucial
elements of the 2012 tax reform, or negative consequences from ongoing initiatives that

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

GUATEMALA

introduce tax incentives. Weak public revenues could derail fiscal consolidation,
aggravate debt dynamics, and lower Guatemala’s resilience to shocks—potentially giving
rise to adverse feedback loops if external shocks were to materialize at the same time.
13.
Longer-term risks are also tilted downwards. On the domestic front, the key concern
is that insufficient revenue mobilization could persist and further entrench themselves, deterring
investment in physical and human capital. In turn, this could significantly weigh on the country’s
growth and social prospects in the long run. More generally, the currently envisaged
consolidation plan is not yet sufficient to stabilize public debt as a share of GDP. If adverse
government debt dynamics were not stemmed, macroeconomic and financial confidence could
ultimately be eroded. On the other hand, incipient upside risks are surfacing: abundant global
liquidity over a prolonged period could eventually find an attractive location in Guatemala given
the country’s improving standing in international global markets, thereby stimulating investment
and growth. In the same connection, however, the still maturing financial system and monetary
policy framework may not be able to handle effectively strong capital inflows—particularly
portfolio—nor guard against eventual bubbles and overheating.

Box 3. Guatemala: Cross-Border Spillovers1
Compared to other countries in the CAPDR region, Guatemala has a lower sensitivity to shocks
originating in the U.S., but a higher response to shocks from other countries within the region. This
contrasts with analyses of other CAPDR countries, which point to larger effects from U.S. shocks. These
differences might be associated with trade structures. According to the World Bank, Guatemala has a larger
share of basic commodity exports (sugar, coffee, nuts) than Costa Rica and El Salvador. This could explain
why Guatemala’s reaction during the 2009 crisis was milder than in the rest of the CAPDR countries, since a
rebound was supported by the pickup in global demand for commodities.
Results from a multi-country VAR analysis show that a CAPDR shock would have the largest shortterm impact on Guatemalan growth followed by a U.S. shock. A shock of ½ standard deviation
reduction in the dynamic domestic growth component of the CAPDR countries could lower GDP growth by
0.5 percentage points, while a shock in the U.S could reduce growth by 0.1 percentage points. The relatively
low near-term sensitivity of the Guatemalan economy to shocks in the U.S. contrasts with the high share of
trade between these two countries. While the U.S. is Guatemala’s main trading partner, the correlation
between the business cycles in both countries is very low. For the period 1976 - 2012, the correlation was
only 0.1, and this is unchanged 2008–12. At the same time, the correlation between Guatemala and CAPDR
countries is much higher. For the period 1976Guatemala: Growth Forecast and Simulation, 2005-2015

exposed to rollover risk through direct crossborder lending by international banks and lending of foreign affiliates operating in Guatemala that are
funded by their parent banking systems. The upper-bound of the rollover risks is captured by the upstream
exposure of Guatemala to all BIS reporting banks, which was about 7 percent of GDP or 21 percent of net
credit to the public and private sectors by the Guatemalan banking system, as of March 2013.2

The analysis of various stress scenarios based on the RES/MFU Bank Contagion Module suggests
that the impact of large haircuts in the sovereign debt of some European countries on international banks
lending to Guatemala would be close to zero. This is due to the limited sovereign exposure of these banks
to the euro area periphery countries.

The estimates also indicate that the direct impact on lending to Guatemala residents from large
declines in the value in European sovereign assets held by international banks lending to Guatemala is
minimal.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
14.
Discussions focused on the policies required to preserve macroeconomic stability
and enhance resilience while supporting higher long-term inclusive growth. In the nearterm, with the output gap closed and incipient inflation pressures, the recent increase in the
policy rate is appropriate and there may be a case for tightening monetary policy further, while
maintaining a neutral fiscal stance. Building room to deal more effectively with shocks will require
bolstering budgetary management including raising revenues, upgrading the monetary and XR
framework, and strengthening the financial system while setting the basis for its orderly
deepening. In order to reduce poverty and raise long-term growth, it is necessary to boost
investment in physical and human capital to raise productivity, as well as to implement structural
reforms to improve the institutional framework and foster greater security.

A. Near-term Policy Mix
15.
There was agreement that the modest reduction in the fiscal deficit expected for
2013 is adequate from a demand management perspective. The 2013 budget aimed at a
central government deficit of 2½ percent of GDP. However, disbursement of some multilateral
loans will likely be delayed until next year and a moderate revenue underperformance is
anticipated, arising from administrative problems in the implementation of new tax regulations
and personnel issues, especially with the customs office. Both shortfalls will be largely offset by
lower expenditure (¶16). Accordingly, a central government deficit of 2¼ percent of GDP in 2013
is now projected. This entails an approximately neutral fiscal stance which was considered
appropriate in light of a virtually closed output gap and growth projected at potential. Moreover,
the fiscal sustainability gap (¶s19, 20) is small and does not require immediate correction.5
16.
The authorities noted that the shortfalls in revenues and external disbursements
this year would be met primarily by spending cuts. In particular, expenditures on capital,
goods and services, and transfers, would be lower since collections are earmarked to a significant
extent. Staff counseled keeping consolidation efforts away from cutting already low public
expenditure and making only targeted spending cuts to safeguard priority social programs and
investment. The authorities were reluctant to undertake additional borrowing to counter the
revenue and financing shortfalls and are determined to protect the critical elements of the 2012
tax reform. Staff reiterated the need to improve public financial management to avoid spending
arrears, finalize a reliable estimate of their outstanding stock, and establish a strategy for their
clearance. The authorities stressed their commitment to these actions and added that they were
considering issuing a bond later in the year for the payment of domestic arrears, contingent on
their proper documentation.

The fiscal sustainability gap is the improvement or in the (structural) primary balance required to stabilize the
debt-to-GDP ratio.

Box 4. Guatemala: The Monetary Policy Stance
Monetary and financial conditions Index (FCI) was developed for Guatemala to reflect how financial variables influence
economic activity. A change in the value of the overall FCI reflects the total contribution of financial conditions to GDP growth.
The financial variables used are: a summary measure of interest rates (the real interest rate of bank loans), the real effective
exchange rate (REER), the real growth of deposits and credit to the private sector, and a housing price index.

The FCI suggests that overall financial conditions were broadly neutral by the end of 2012. They were
fairly loose or positive in the first quarter but turned more negative or tighter in the rest of the year.
Overall, the average contribution of the FCI for the whole of 2012 was positive. Nonetheless, relatively
underdeveloped financial markets in Guatemala may limit the interpretive value of the model.

Following Magud and Tsounta (2012)1, different methods were used to estimate the neutral
real interest rate (NRIR). The first one is

The authorities concurred to remain vigilant of lingering inflationary pressures. The
central bank lowered its end-year inflation target range by half a percentage point (to
4±1 percent) in January 2013. Headline and core inflation are at the mid range of the band, and
have started to edge up, while expected inflation is at the top of the range for end-2013 and
through 2014. After the entire borrowing needs of the government for 2013 were met with the
issuance of a Eurobond in February, and with no further domestic state bond issuance planned
for this year, banks remain very liquid. Moreover, the high growth rate of consumer credit is a
sign of demand pressures, underpinned also by buoyant remittances. Accordingly, the
authorities’ decision to raise the policy rate by 25 basis points in late April was fully endorsed by
staff. The central bank also considered that sterilization operations to mop up excess bank
liquidity had been adequate. Staff advised to raise further the policy rate and to step up liquidity
absorption promptly if inflationary pressures do not abate (Box 4 and AN 5). Officials agreed,
though they intend to assess the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations after the recent
hike in the policy rate before taking further action in the near term.

B. Increasing Resilience to Shocks
Rebuilding fiscal space and enhancing fiscal sustainability
18.
It was recognized that continuing increases in the burden of public debt are a
source of vulnerability. While the government debt-to-GDP ratio is comparatively low, it has
been rising steadily since the 2008 crisis. The authorities acknowledged that Guatemala cannot
rely comfortably on debt financing to support expansionary counter-cyclical policies (particularly
if prolonged)—funding risks are likely to escalate rapidly, especially in light of the high debt-torevenue ratio. The debt structure is solid on many fronts,6 but exposures to rollover and FX risks
are increasing, as the country gains access to international markets. The lack of depth in the
domestic financial market (with its highly concentrated investor base and virtually non-existing
secondary government debt market) 7 and rigidities that curtail access to official financing in FX
(IFI loans must be approved by Congress on a case-by-case basis, and are often made hostage to
political negotiations) provide thin coverage against spikes in global risk aversion.

6

Guatemala’s total gross financing needs are small (3½ percent of GDP in 2013), and a large share of debt is
contracted at long maturities (10 years), fixed rates and reduced spreads (nearing 200 bps for SCDS).
7

Most central government domestic debt is held by the three major banks and the social security institute.

19.
Hence, fiscal sustainability should be reinforced over the medium term. Stabilizing
the debt-to-GDP ratio at its current level—thereby unlocking the ability to implement
expansionary counter-cyclical policies without exacerbating budget funding risks) would require
a permanent improvement in the primary balance of about 3/4 -1 percent of GDP. If the actuarial
deficit of the social security system were taken into account (preliminary estimates are still being
refined), the sustainability gap would be correspondingly larger. With output not exceeding
potential, continuing global uncertainties exacerbating growth risks, and no pressing financing
constraints, the common view was that immediate adjustment is not needed. At the same time,
staff indicated that its recommended moderately paced adjustment, starting from 2014, with
modest frontloading and spaced over several years, would strike the right balance between
reducing the sustainability gap and limiting the negative impact on growth (AN 3), given an
estimated fiscal multiplier of 0.4 (multipliers tend to be smaller when activity is at about
potential).
20.
The authorities agreed and highlighted
that current policies are already on track
gradually to reduce the sustainability gap. They
noted that their medium term budget already
envisages a steady reduction of the deficit through
2015. Staff’s recommended adjustment path (¶19)
would be broadly similar to the authorities’ plan, if
the latter were extended beyond 2015. In this case,
the sustainability gap would be lowered to nearnegligible levels without pushing growth
significantly below potential. On the other hand,

staff’s baseline projection anticipated a somewhat smaller and less frontloaded budget
tightening than that planned by the authorities, owing to: (i) the expectation that some of the
spending delayed in 2013 will be executed in 2014-15; and (ii) a less sanguine view of the yield of
the tax reform, in light of the problems encountered in its early implementation. Nonetheless,
staff accepted that the macroeconomic implications of the differences between the baseline and
alternative scenarios were minor over the medium term, given the low fiscal multiplier. But some
residual budget adjustment will be required after 2018 to ensure sustainability.

21.
Staff urged additional efforts to mobilize revenue beyond budget consolidation
needs. Guatemala needs not only to achieve long-term fiscal sustainability, but also to maintain
macro stability while addressing pressing social needs—not least reduction of widespread
absolute and relative poverty—and paving the way toward high, inclusive long-term growth.
Meeting these objectives will depend upon raising the currently low level of government
revenues to support priority public spending (¶28).8 In particular, staff advocated reducing tax
expenditures (equivalent to 8 percent of GDP), and realigning VAT rates (from 12 to 14 percent)
with those prevailing in the region. Lowering the currently high degree of revenue earmarking
(about 50 percent) will also be important to widen the fiscal adjustment toolbox. Further work to
strengthen the tax and customs administration, and stepping up efforts to reduce informality,
should assist in enhancing collections. The authorities saw merit in these recommendations, but
emphasized that such an ambitious agenda will take time to implement.
22.
The authorities are committed to improve the efficiency of public expenditure and
reinforce budgetary management more generally. They noted that planned amendments to
the Organic Budget Law would ameliorate transparency and efficiency of public spending, and
help reallocate resources toward priority areas. Staff recommended that reforms should also
grant more flexibility to the approval of official financing, thus providing room for a greater
counter-cyclical cushion and preventing the under-execution of IFI-supported spending. Faster
progress would be desirable with the approval of the rest of the transparency package, in
Congress since last year, and with implementation of a results-based budget.

Upgrading monetary and exchange rate policy
23.
It was agreed that monetary policy transmission should be bolstered to anchor
further low and stable inflation. Guatemala’s annual inflation is below that of regional peers,
and within its target band. Nonetheless, the transmission channels of monetary policy remain
feeble, while pass-through effects from commodity prices continue to influence inflation heavily.9
The authorities concurred that there is scope for enhancing monetary policy transmission
through a four-pronged approach. First, it is desirable to raise gradually XR flexibility, credibly
conveying to the public that the inflation target is the monetary authorities’ primary objective. In
this regard, consolidating the operational independence of the central bank from government
and private sector interests would be important. Second, efforts ought to be stepped up to dedollarize credit, mainly by allowing the XR to fluctuate and thereby forcing agents to internalize
8

Guatemala’s tax “effort”—the ratio of actual revenues to potential—is the lowest among its peers, while the
“revenue gap”— the difference between the current level of tax collections and the level that would result from
achieving the tax effort prevailing in comparator countries—is estimated to be about 7 percent of GDP.
Guatemala’s level of public expenditure, 14 percent of GDP in 2012, lags both its CAPDR peers and other EM
countries (23 and 32 percent of GDP, respectively). As a broad goal for the long term, the authorities target an
increase in revenue to 18 percent of GDP. Consistent with a debt-stabilizing deficit, this would imply an increase
of around 5 percentage points of GDP in expenditures.

The pass-through rate for the policy rate has been estimated at 60 percent. See “Medina Cas, CarrionMenendez and Frantischek “Effectiveness of Monetary Policy, “ Piñon and other, eds., Central American, Panama
and the Dominican Republic, Challenges Following the 2008-09 Global Crisis, IMF, 2012.

FX risks and promote hedging. Third, public debt and private securities markets need to be
developed. To this end, it is also important to finalize the draft capital markets law in compliance
with IOSCO best practices and enact it. Finally, the framework for monetary operations—
including with technical assistance from the Fund—should be further refined.
24.
The central bank favors progress towards greater XR flexibility, but at a very
prudent and moderate pace. Increased flexibility would provide the economy with an extra
shock absorber, while preventing excessive FX risk taking. Staff recognized that the rule-based FX
intervention has allowed for some flexibility but also pointed out that intervention has been
relatively high—as it is apparent from the high sterilization costs, which have weakened the
central bank’s balance sheet (¶25). Indeed, a recent increase in net FX liabilities of the nonfinancial private sector (vis-à-vis 2007) may also be driven by a perceived implicit guarantee on a
stable exchange by the central bank (AN 4). In this respect, staff welcomed the slight widening at
the end of 2012 of the XR fluctuation margin used to determine intervention and the associated
recent decline in FX intervention. There was agreement on the need to continue broadening the
intervention rule. However, the authorities considered that the rule had served well to maintain
stability and anchor expectations and thus it could be widened only slowly.
25.
The government acknowledged the need to support the central bank’s balance
sheet. In 2011-12, the central bank had annual operational losses of ¼-½ percent of GDP. The
Ministry of Finance is obligated by law to compensate the central bank for part of the costs
incurred in its monetary operations with a two year lag. However, Congress decided to exclude
from the 2013 budget the refund corresponding to 2011, prompting a legal challenge by the
central bank. Staff argued that the latter should be compensated for its 2011 losses with a
modification to the 2013 budget, while provision should be made for the 2012 losses in the 2014
budget. The Ministry of Finance affirmed that the overdue refund to the central bank may be
approved by Congress later this year.

Strengthening the financial system and setting the basis for its orderly deepening
26.
The authorities are determined to strengthen the financial system. Guatemala is well
placed to apply key Basel III components and is in compliance with most of the Basel I
framework. The authorities are working to promote implementation of Basel III rules at the
regional level to prevent regulatory arbitrage. However, staff cautioned that important work
remains ahead, including full implementation of risk-based supervision, and consolidated
supervision. Moreover, further upgrade of financial sector regulations would be desirable,
including in preparation for the forthcoming FSAP scheduled for the spring of 2014. In this
regard, officials noted that there has been good progress with implementing the amendments to
the Banking Sector Law, as regulations have been issued to reduce risks from offshore banking,
require credit ratings for banks, and limit loans to shareholders to control credit concentration
and connected lending. Staff encouraged the authorities to spur congressional passage of the
draft banking secrecy law and supported other measures to combat money laundering to comply
with additional OECD and AML/CFT standards (AN 6).
27.
Officials concurred that recent strong credit growth calls for great vigilance. In
particular, fast expansion of consumer credit (including by micro-financial firms) and foreign
currency credit have raised concerns. While this issue will be examined in more detail by the
22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GUATEMALA

forthcoming FSAP update, staff cautioned that, although there are no immediate acute worries,
the continuation over a long period of high rates of credit expansion could eventually undermine
the stability of the financial system. The authorities agreed, while underlining that the ongoing
credit growth is needed to foster deeper financial markets. They noted that approval of the law
for micro-finance institutions, recently submitted to Congress, would also help assuage risks.

C. Poverty Reduction and Achieving Higher Long-Term Inclusive Growth
28.
There was consensus on the need to step up well-targeted social spending. Social
spending is too low in Guatemala—even relative to regional peers—leaving critical needs unmet.
Beyond the inherent benefit of reducing poverty and hunger, effective action by the public sector
has the potential to improve a broad range of social indicators and human capital, which
impinge directly on the country’s productivity. Staff argued that this is critical to foster
competitiveness and sustain growth, and to integrate fully vulnerable groups into Guatemala’s
social fabric, which would also alleviate the high security risks. The authorities agreed that higher
levels of social expenditure are required to build a skilled and productive labor force. Albeit
officials stressed that resources to fund greater outlays are limited, they underscored social
initiatives underway, such as the Zero Hunger Plan.
29.
The private investment gap must be urgently bridged. Much scope remains to foster
competitiveness through structural reforms to improve the business climate and reduce violence
and impunity. The authorities are currently addressing these issues through their competitiveness
agenda and several legislative initiatives, including one that aims to improve labor force flexibility
and diminish informality. It was agreed that the Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) framework
should be used to catalyze high-quality investment and infrastructure, though it first needs to be
strengthened to grant the Ministry of Finance more powers to monitor and control contingent
fiscal risks. Staff warned against plans, currently under consideration in Congress, to use tax
incentives to attract investment, arguing that they are of dubious efficacy and prone to abuse.
Indeed, the main determinants of investment by firms are the stability of the tax regime,
infrastructure availability, and adequate legal frameworks. Widespread tax incentives may
eventually endanger macroeconomic stability and thus hurt development.
30.
The authorities viewed regional integration as providing new impetus to support
faster growth. The region should complete the customs union, harmonize trade rules, and
further integrate services and factor markets. The authorities explained that they are urging
Congress to approve the Association Agreement with the EU which would boost regional
integration in those areas. They also noted that a Central American free trade agreement with
Mexico still needs to be ratified by Congress. Staff estimates Guatemala’s real GDP growth may
increase by up to 0.8-1.6 percentage points per year by improving logistics, increasing partner
diversification, deepening integration into global production chains, and increasing technological
sophistication of exports to the levels of the five largest Latin American countries and the EU.
Competitiveness could be augmented by market enlargement (from 14 to over 40 million

people) and pooling resources for infrastructure and trade. Economies of scale could boost
investment, and lowering intraregional trade costs would improve resource allocation.10

STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
Growth has been firm in the aftermath of the global crisis, fundamentals remain
stable, and the near-term outlook is broadly positive. Economic activity is projected to be
near potential, while inflation should remain contained and within the central bank’s target band.
Nonetheless, risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. External risks include weaker than
expected growth in the U.S. which would weigh on economic activity, and a geopolitical oil shock
that could impair Guatemala’s terms of trade and growth. Domestic risks pertain to policies,
including a setback on the main items of the 2012 tax reform, or enactment of legislation that
entails new fiscal incentives. Weak fiscal revenues could endanger fiscal consolidation and lower
Guatemala’s resilience to shocks.
32.
The anticipated broadly neutral fiscal stance for 2013 is appropriate while further
monetary tightening may be needed.


The deficit outturn this year is likely to be only marginally lower than in 2012 (and than
budgeted). Since capacity is nearly fully utilized, the resulting virtual absence of fiscal
impulses is deemed adequate. Shortfalls in multilateral loan disbursements and revenue
also mean that central government spending will be lower than planned. With
expenditure levels already low, efforts should be made to limit the reduction in outlays,
and at least to protect social programs and investment. Improvements in expenditure
controls are necessary to prevent further accumulation of arrears. Clearance of
outstanding payment arrears must be subject to rigorous audit of the claims.



Some evidence suggests that monetary policy stance may be, to a certain extent,
accommodating. Thus, if inflation continues to rise, amid robust domestic demand,
strong private credit growth, and abundant bank liquidity, the central bank should stand
ready further to raise the policy rate and absorb residual excess bank liquidity.

33.
Fiscal consolidation is necessary in the medium term to allow room for countercyclical policies and reduce vulnerability to shocks. Though public debt remains relatively low
as a share of GDP, it has been steadily increasing since 2008 and it is quite high in relation to
government revenue. Stabilizing the debt-to-GDP ratio will require a permanent improvement in
the primary balance of about ¾ -1 percent of GDP. A moderately paced adjustment beginning
in 2014-15, with limited frontloading, would balance the need to shrink the sustainability gap
against any negative consequences on growth.
34.
Additional revenue mobilization and improvements to public expenditure
management should underpin budgetary adjustment. Raising revenues is essential not only
10

for achieving long-term fiscal sustainability, thereby anchoring macro stability, but also for
boosting health, education, security, and infrastructure outlays, which are all critical to reduce
high levels of poverty and raise the potential for sustained inclusive growth. Specifically, reducing
tax expenditures, adjusting VAT rates, and further strengthening the tax and customs
administration would help lift collections. Enhancing the transparency and efficiency of spending
would permit directing limited resources to priority areas, a goal that could also be supported by
reforms to lower revenue earmarking and facilitate the approval of official external financing.
35.
The monetary policy framework should be upgraded, including by enhancing XR
flexibility. Strengthening monetary transmission would make it easier for the central bank to
reduce the volatility of inflation in response to external shocks and thus help maintain it at
moderate levels. To this end, it would be important to buttress further the central bank’s
operational independence and the soundness of its balance sheet. Efforts to de-dollarize by
allowing more XR fluctuation, developing domestic securities markets, and refining monetary
operations are all critical for augmenting the monetary transmission mechanism. Likewise, more
rapid progress in allowing greater XR flexibility would reinforce the role of inflation as the
primary objective of monetary policy.
36.
Further financial sector reforms are desirable while keeping careful watch over
recent strong credit growth. Though much progress has been made, financial regulations
should continue to be modernized, with special emphasis on full implementation of risk-based
and consolidated supervision, gradual introduction of the Basel III framework, passage of the law
for micro-finance institutions, and enactment of AML/CFT measures such as the banking secrecy
law. Though not an immediate danger, the authorities should remain vigilant over high rates of
growth of credit to the private sector—especially rapid expansion of consumer credit by microfinancial firms and foreign currency credit. Indeed, if sustained over a long period, a credit surge
could eventually undermine financial stability.
37.
High levels of poverty should be reduced by increasing social spending and by reforms
aimed at boosting growth and regional integration. Higher social spending is essential to lift
human capital, thus boosting competitiveness and growth, which would also be stimulated by
greater public infrastructure expenditure. Private investment should also be raised through
structural reforms to improve the business climate and reduce violence and impunity. The PublicPrivate Partnerships initiative should be strengthened to foster greater investment and improve
infrastructure while managing fiscal risks. The recent congressional approval of the EU
association agreement will help spur regional trade integration and the customs union.
38.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

Safeguards Assessment. Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Bank of Guatemala
was subject to an assessment with respect to the Stand-By Arrangement approved on April 22, 2009

When a member has overdue financial obligations outstanding for more than three months, the amount of such arrears will be
shown in this section.

(IMF Country Report No: 09/143). The assessment, which was completed in September 2009, found
that the Bank of Guatemala has strengthened safeguards in the areas of financial reporting
transparency and the management of foreign exchange reserves. Recommendations were made to
further strengthen the bank’s governance and independence.
Exchange Rate Arrangement. Since March 1994, Guatemala has had an arrangement based on an
interbank foreign exchange market in which authorized financial institutions buy and sell foreign
exchange at market-determined rates. Financial institutions authorized to operate in the foreign
exchange market include commercial banks, finance companies, and exchange houses. While
Guatemala has a de jure floating exchange rate arrangement, the de facto arrangement has
classified as “stabilized”. Guatemala has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4,

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK AND BANKFUND COLLABORATION UNDER THE JOINT
MANAGEMENT ACTION PLAN (JMAP)
1.

The IMF’s Guatemala team led by Mr. Lorenzo Figliuoli (Mission Chief) has met on
various occasions with the World Bank’s Guatemala team led by Mr. Oscar Calvo-Gonzalez
(Lead Economist and PREM Sector Leader) to discuss macroeconomic challenges, identify macrocritical structural reforms, and coordinate the two teams’ work for the period August 2013–July
2014.
2.
The teams agreed that Guatemala’s main macroeconomic challenges are to safeguard
fiscal sustainability, increase the effectiveness of monetary policy, and maintain financial
sector stability.
3.
The teams concurred that Guatemala’s near-term outlook is generally positive, though
there are risks stemming from global uncertainty and the limited scope to adopt
countercyclical policies in case downside risks materialize.
4.
Based on the shared assessment of macroeconomic challenges, the teams have
identified the following structural reform areas as macro-critical:


Fiscal consolidation and revenue strengthening. Guatemala’s fiscal position had deteriorated
in 2009-10 due to a decline in public revenues in the aftermath of the global crisis and an
increase in current expenditures. Significant fiscal adjustment occurred in 2011-12, though
still insufficient to stop the rise in the ratio of public debt to GDP. The 2012 tax reform has
yielded less additional revenue than anticipated due to implementation problems and legal
challenges. Stabilizing public sector debt at current levels will require a fiscal adjustment of
about ¾-1 percent of GDP over the medium term. However, beyond this goal, adopting
additional revenue-enhancing measures and improving the efficiency and composition of
public expenditure will be critical to achieving increases in spending in critical areas (e.g.
social programs, infrastructure, and security).



Monetary policy framework. Strengthening further the monetary framework, including by
allowing greater exchange rate flexibility, is key to improve the effectiveness of monetary
policy,



Financial sector stability. Guatemala is well placed to apply key Basel III components and is in
compliance with most of the Basel I framework. However, important work remains, including
the full implementation of risk-based supervision and consolidated supervision. Approval of
the law for micro-finance institution, currently under consideration by Congress, and the
securities market law would also add to the system’s resilience.

5.

The teams agreed the following division of labor:



Fiscal consolidation and revenue strengthening. The Fund will continue to provide policy
recommendations on macro-fiscal issues, including the overall strategy of fiscal
consolidation. The Fund will continue to provide technical assistance on budgetary
management, which is expected to help strengthen expenditure controls and prevent the
accumulation of new domestic payment arrears. The Bank has completed a Public
Expenditure Review which will be presented in 2013 along with a database on expenditures
at the municipal level. In 2012 the Bank’s Board approved a Development Policy Loan for
$200 million which aims at: (i) strengthening tax administration and tax policy; (ii) enhancing
the quality of public expenditure and; (iii) improving the coordination and management of
social policy. This Development Policy Loan is currently being reviewed by the Guatemalan
Congress and is expected to be approved in 2013.



Monetary policy framework. The Fund will continue to provide policy recommendations and
technical assistance to improve the monetary framework, including regarding exchange rate
flexibility.



Financial sector stability. The Bank and the Fund will cooperate as necessary in assisting
Guatemala to strengthen its financial system. A new FSAP is scheduled for the spring of 2014
and will be undertaken in collaboration by the Fund and the Bank.

6.

The teams have the following requests for information from their counterparts:



The Fund team requests to be kept informed of progress in the above macro-critical
structural reform areas. Timing: when milestones are reached (and at least semi-annually).



The Bank team requests to be kept informed of the Fund’s assessments of macroeconomic
policies and prospects, including updates of the Fund’s macroeconomic framework, and
progress in the above macro-critical structural reform areas.

RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of June, 2013)

A. Recent Projects and Objectives
1.
On December 2012, the IADB approved its country strategy for Guatemala for 2012–
2016. It focuses on improving living conditions for the Guatemalan population, particularly those
living in rural areas. The strategy’s priority target areas are structured along two axes, the first
institutional, covering the areas of (i) fiscal and municipal management, (ii) social protection, and
(ii) peaceful coexistence and citizen security; and the second addressing rural development,
including the areas of (iv) productive development, (v) health, and (vi) transportation. Work will also
be done in the crosscutting areas of climate change adaptation and mitigation, natural disaster
impact mitigation, indigenous peoples and gender; and regional integration will be promoted,
particularly in the transportation and energy sectors.
2.
As of June 2013, the IADB portfolio of approved sovereign-guaranteed investment
and policy-based loans under execution amounted to US$805.5 million, with an undisbursed
balance of US$636.9 million.
3.
The existing sovereign guaranteed portfolio focuses on: (i) reform and modernization of
the state; (ii) education, health, and social investment; (iii) environment and natural disasters;
(iv) improving productive infrastructure (especially, electrification, water, and sanitation in rural
areas); and private firms and SME development and trade. In the private sector, the IADB has an
active loan (US$ 33 million approved) to support MSMEs development, the housing sector and
trade.
4.
The pipeline for 2013 includes three projects in the private sector for US$41 million:
one in the financial sector for US$30 million; one operation focus on MSME sector for US$5 million;
and two credit line operations for trade financing for US$6 million. On the sovereign-guaranteed
side, 2013 work plan will focus on accelerating the implementation of the current portfolio rather
than in approving additional financing.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of April May 31, 2013)
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance.
National accounts: In 2010, the Bank of Guatemala began publishing quarterly national accounts
statistics consistent with the SNA 1993, with 2001 as the base year.
Consumer prices and unemployment: In 2011, the consumer price index was re-based to
December, 2010, and the index weights were updated to reflect changes in the consumption
basket since the base 2000 index. Unemployment is estimated only on an annual basis.
Government finance statistics: Revenue, expenditure, and financing statistics for social security
agencies, local governments, and nonfinancial public enterprises are not reported, hindering the
calculation of a consolidated operations statement and balance sheet for the nonfinancial public
sector. The coverage and periodicity of data on central government financing and debt is
adequate.
Monetary and financial statistics: The quality, coverage, and periodicity of data for the Bank of
Guatemala and commercial banks are sufficient. Data for the offshore sector and savings
cooperatives is only available quarterly, and with a lag of five weeks.
External sector statistics: The Bank of Guatemala publishes quarterly balance of payments data
according to the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. In 2012, the Bank of Guatemala
increased the periodicity of publication of international investment position data from annual to
quarterly. Detail on private sector external debt by creditor and by maturity structure is not
available.
Data Standards and Quality
Guatemala became a participant in the General
Data Dissemination System in 2004. Several
data categories are yet to meet the periodicity
or timeliness requirements necessary for
subscription to the Special Data Dissemination
Standard.

A data ROSC was completed on October 28,
2004.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August 2, 2013

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Guatemala
On July 25, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation 1 with Guatemala and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal
on a lapse of time basis 2.
Key developments since the 2012 Article IV Consultation have been positive. Growth has
been robust, while converging to trend and the output gap is virtually closed. As commodity
prices stabilized and domestic demand pressures weakened, inflation fell sharply in 2012—
closing at 3.4 percent by December (compared to 6¼ in 2011). While subsequently inflation
rose somewhat—to 4.3 percent by May 2013, owing mainly to domestic prices—it still
remained within the central bank’s target range of 4.0±1 percent. The current account deficit
declined to just below 3 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2012, from almost 3½
percent in 2011. Rising Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), as well as official and private
capital inflows, more than financed this deficit. Net international reserves are in line with
reserve adequacy metrics and the exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals, though
with some signs of erosion of external competitiveness.
Monetary policy has been on hold until lately and foreign exchange intervention has
declined. The central bank kept the policy rate constant at 5 percent until late April 2013,
when it was lifted by 25 bps, with the aim of stemming incipient signs of inflationary
pressures. The exchange rate fluctuation margin used to determine intervention was widened
in late 2012.
The central government’s deficit continued to narrow in 2012 to just below 2½ percent of
GDP, but not enough to prevent a further rise in the ratio of public debt to GDP to

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. The Executive Board takes decisions under
its lapse of time procedure when it is agreed by the Board that a proposal can be considered without convening
formal discussions.

24 percent, comparatively manageable but a significant burden for government finances,
given the low level of revenues. Net financing shifted from primarily domestic sources to
external flows, with the placement of an international bond of US$700 million at favorable
terms and long maturity. Last year, a tax package was passed by parliament—yielding
1-1½ percent of GDP—and came into force in 2013. Claims against the reform have piled up
before the Constitutional Court. So far these challenges have been largely unsuccessful,
though associated uncertainties have weighed down on collections and possible amendments
to the reform may erode revenues. A draft Competitiveness Law sent to Congress by the
President grants fiscal incentives to firms incorporated outside Guatemala City, with possible
significant fiscal costs in the medium term. Accumulated domestic arrears, which spiked in
2010, remain unresolved.
Though credit to the private sector is growing fast, the financial system remains solid.
Financial soundness indicators are strong and new legislation has been enacted to strengthen
the system further. In 2012, Guatemala was reclassified into the OECD’s “white list” of
countries that have implemented internationally agreed tax standards. New measures to
combat money laundering have led to an increase in prosecutions.
Guatemala has gained some ground toward achieving the Millenium Development Goals
(MDGs), but poverty and crime are widespread. Modest-to-strong progress has been
recorded for 12 out of 16 MDG targets. However, a third of the population is below the
minimum dietary energy consumption, and chronic malnutrition of children younger than
5 years is pervasive at about 50 percent. At the same time, the level of informality is very
high, while security concerns are very serious.
The economic outlook is generally benign. Growth is expected to edge up to 3½ percent in
2013 and 2014, reaching its potential rate, supported by ongoing buoyant domestic demand
and healthy private sector credit. Inflation is projected to remain within the upper half of the
central bank’s target range in 2013-14 before stabilizing toward the center of the band. The
external current account deficit would decline to around 2½ percent of GDP into the medium
term, more than fully financed by FDI and other capital inflows.
Risks are prevalent on the downside, owing to global uncertainties and domestic policy
constraints. Weaker-than-expected growth in the U.S, a hike in global oil prices or shocks to
neighboring countries could all depress output in Guatemala. The reversal of crucial elements
of the 2012 tax reform or negative consequences from ongoing initiatives that introduce tax
incentives could derail fiscal consolidation. Insufficient revenue mobilization could persist
into the long term, deterring investment in physical and human capital. More generally,
currently envisaged consolidation plans are not yet sufficient to stabilize public debt as a
share of GDP.

3

Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2013 Article IV consultation with Guatemala, the Executive Directors
endorsed the staff’s appraisal as follows:
Growth has been firm in the aftermath of the global crisis, fundamentals remain stable, and
the near-term outlook is broadly positive. Economic activity is projected to be near potential,
while inflation should remain contained and within the central bank’s target band.
Nonetheless, risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. External risks include weaker
than expected growth in the U.S. which would weigh on economic activity, and a
geopolitical oil shock that could impair Guatemala’s terms of trade and growth. Domestic
risks pertain to policies, including a setback on the main items of the 2012 tax reform, or
enactment of legislation that entails new fiscal incentives. Weak fiscal revenues could
endanger fiscal consolidation and lower Guatemala’s resilience to shocks.
The anticipated broadly neutral fiscal stance for 2013 is appropriate while further monetary
tightening may be needed. The deficit outturn this year is likely to be only marginally lower
than in 2012 (and than budgeted). Since capacity is nearly fully utilized, the resulting virtual
absence of fiscal impulses is deemed adequate. Shortfalls in multilateral loan disbursements
and revenue also mean that central government spending will be lower than planned. With
expenditure levels already low, efforts should be made to limit the reduction in outlays, and
at least to protect social programs and investment. Improvements in expenditure controls are
necessary to prevent further accumulation of arrears. Clearance of outstanding payment
arrears must be subject to rigorous audit of the claims. Some evidence suggests that monetary
policy stance may be, to a certain extent, accommodating. Thus, if inflation continues to rise,
amid robust domestic demand, strong private credit growth, and abundant bank liquidity, the
central bank should stand ready further to raise the policy rate and absorb residual excess
bank liquidity.
Fiscal consolidation is necessary in the medium term to allow room for counter-cyclical
policies and reduce vulnerability to shocks. Though public debt remains relatively low as a
share of GDP, it has been steadily increasing since 2008 and it is quite high in relation to
government revenue. Stabilizing the debt-to-GDP ratio will require a permanent
improvement in the primary balance of about ¾-1 percent of GDP. A moderately paced
adjustment beginning in 2014-15, with limited frontloading, would balance the need to shrink
the sustainability gap against any negative consequences on growth.
Additional revenue mobilization and improvements to public expenditure management
should underpin budgetary adjustment. Raising revenues is essential not only for achieving
long-term fiscal sustainability, thereby anchoring macro stability, but also for boosting
health, education, security, and infrastructure outlays, which are all critical to reduce high
levels of poverty and raise the potential for sustained inclusive growth. Specifically, reducing

4

tax expenditures, adjusting VAT rates, and further strengthening the tax and customs
administration would help lift collections. Enhancing the transparency and efficiency of
spending would permit directing limited resources to priority areas, a goal that could also be
supported by reforms to lower revenue earmarking and facilitate the approval of official
external financing.
The monetary policy framework should be upgraded, including by enhancing exchange rate
flexibility. Strengthening monetary transmission would make it easier for the central bank to
reduce the volatility of inflation in response to external shocks and thus help maintain it at
moderate levels. To this end, it would be important to buttress further the central bank’s
operational independence and the soundness of its balance sheet. Efforts to de-dollarize by
allowing more exchange rate fluctuation, developing domestic securities markets, and
refining monetary operations are all critical for augmenting the monetary transmission
mechanism. Likewise, more rapid progress in allowing greater exchange rate flexibility
would reinforce the role of inflation as the primary objective of monetary policy.
Further financial sector reforms are desirable while keeping careful watch over recent strong
credit growth. Though much progress has been made, financial regulations should continue
to be modernized, with special emphasis on full implementation of risk-based and
consolidated supervision, gradual introduction of the Basel III framework, passage of the law
for micro-finance institutions, and enactment of Anti Money Laundering/Combating of
Financing of Terrorism measures such as the banking secrecy law. Though not an immediate
danger, the authorities should remain vigilant over high rates of growth of credit to the
private sector—especially rapid expansion of consumer credit by micro-financial firms and
foreign currency credit. Indeed, if sustained over a long period, a credit surge could
eventually undermine financial stability.
High levels of poverty should be reduced by increasing social spending and by reforms
aimed at boosting growth and regional integration. Higher social spending is essential to lift
human capital, thus boosting competitiveness and growth, which would also be stimulated by
greater public infrastructure expenditure. Private investment should also be raised through
structural reforms to improve the business climate and reduce violence and impunity. The
Public-Private Partnerships initiative should be strengthened to foster greater investment and
improve infrastructure while managing fiscal risks. The recent congressional approval of the
EU association agreement will help spur regional trade integration and the customs union.
