STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 28, 2011

KEY ISSUES
Short-term prospects. With a supportive external environment, real GDP growth is
projected at 4.5 percent in 2011, and the external current account would remain in
surplus. A key policy priority is to secure a return to low inflation, after a sharp increase in
recent months. Monetary conditions would need to be tightened and interest rates
allowed to rise from currently negative levels in real terms. A faster appreciation of the
boliviano, which is estimated to be moderately undervalued, would contribute to offset
external inflation pressures.
Strengthening the macroeconomic policy framework. In 2011, the overall surplus of
the public sector is projected to narrow from 2 percent of GDP to about 0.7 percent of
GDP. The authorities are encouraged to put in place a medium-term fiscal framework to
manage hydrocarbon wealth and avoid pro-cyclical public spending. As the number and
activities

of

enterprises

has

expanded,

greater

transparency

and

accountability in their operations would help contain fiscal risks and improve their
effectiveness.
Maintaining financial sector soundness. Financial sector indicators are strong, banks
appear resilient to a range of shocks, and dollarization has declined. Regulations should
be geared toward preserving the solvency of banks and the resources assigned to
supervision should be increased. The crisis management framework needs strengthening.
Enhancing medium-term growth and social protection. Sustaining high and stable
medium-term growth will require improvements in the investment climate, including by
ensuring stability in the legal framework. While social policies have been effective and
Bolivia has made inroads towards achieving MDGs, enhancing the targeting of transfer
programs will help further improve the condition of the most vulnerable groups.

Bolivia: Recent Trends in Inflation and Inflation Expectations

Twelve-month inflation rose in recent months,
to 10 percent in February. Measures of core and
underlying inflation, at 9.8 percent and 8.4 percent
respectively, are above the official inflation
objective for 2011 (6 percent). To some extent, the
current inflationary trend reflects global factors—
the increase of food and commodity prices—and,
as in many other emerging markets, the relatively
large share of food products in the consumer
basket. There have also been some one-off effects
associated to supply shocks in agriculture, due to
adverse weather, and social unrest, which led to
temporary price hikes in certain regions.

The increase in inflation has been sharp and is
becoming generalized. Monthly inflation
averaged 1.4 percent during October-February, well
above the monthly average for the first half of
2010 (0.1 percent). Food prices, which account for
27 percent of the CPI basket rose 17 percent yearover-year in February, explaining 48 percent of total
inflation. While, historically, there has been a
relatively small pass through from world to
domestic food prices (20−25 percent), recent
developments point to a faster and stronger
impact, possibly explained by domestic demand
conditions and supply shocks. Measures of inflation
that exclude the impact of food, such as core
(which excludes some food items and
administratively set prices) and underlying inflation
(which excludes the ten most volatile items of the
CPI basket), also rose, indicating a somewhat
generalized trend. Some sub-indices of the CPI
(clothing, furniture and domestic articles, services,
and restaurants and hotels, representing altogether
31 percent of the basket) have all risen above 6
percent in the last twelve months.
Inflation expectations have increased in
tandem with actual inflation. While this is not a
new development, since survey-based expectations
have followed outturns for some time, it indicates
that there is a risk of inflation becoming more
entrenched in the coming months, requiring a more
aggressive policy response than what would be the
case otherwise.

Estimating fiscal impulses for Bolivia

The Cyclically Adjusted Balance (CAB) and the
Structural Balance (SB) are fiscal measures to
assess a country’s fiscal stance. By removing the
effects of the economic cycle (the impact of
automatic stabilizers), the CAB measures the
direction and size of discretionary fiscal policies. The
SB, which is an extension of the CAB, also seeks to
gauge whether or not fiscal policies are becoming
expansionary or contractionary. It is a more suitable
indicator for commodity exporting countries, as it
takes into account the impact of commodities on
public sector accounts and on the economy as a
whole. As Bolivia’s economy and its fiscal position
are greatly affected by the performance of
hydrocarbon activities, public sector revenues and
expenses have been adjusted by deducting
hydrocarbon-related items (tax collections on
hydrocarbon production and the operating surplus
of YPF, on the revenue side, and the investments
undertaken by YPFB on the expenditure side).

Potential output or the long run level of GDP
can be estimated applying different statistical and
economic methods. These include univariate filters
and multivariate methods. The output gap is the
difference between actual output and potential
GDP. In the case of Bolivia, the HP filter was used to
calculate potential output. Over the last 22 years,
potential growth has averaged around 4 percent.

Estimating the CAB and the SB requires
computing several key economic variables.
These include: potential output–or the long run level
of GDP, the output gap, and the elasticity of
revenues and expenditures to potential output. For
the SB, this means estimating non-hydrocarbon
potential output and the output gap in nonhydrocarbon activities. The first step, however, is to
adjust fiscal accounts by one-off items.
One-off items are non recurrent budgetary factors–
expenditures or tax forgiveness programs which
temporarily affect the fiscal position while at the
same time have some limited impact on the
domestic economy. For Bolivia, spending was
adjusted for the nationalization costs paid during
2007-2010.

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Elasticities on budget components are required to
estimate the level of structural revenues and
expenditures. In line with OECD guidelines (2001),
an aggregated revenue elasticity of 1 was applied;
this means that revenues respond one-to-one with
the business cycle. In addition, on the expenditure
side, it was assumed that all spending is structural
such that the elasticity of expenditure to output is
zero.
The results show that fiscal policy contributed
to sustain demand and GDP growth in 2008-09
even though non-hydrocarbon GDP was slightly
above potential. Results also indicate a strong
negative stimulus in 2010—mostly on account of
underexecution of public investment—while for
2011, the fiscal impulse is estimated at about 1½
percent of GDP.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Bolivia: Exchange Rate Assessment

Staff estimates, based on CGER
methodologies, suggest that the Boliviano is
moderately undervalued when compared with
fundamentals. There are however, uncertainties
associated with the application of these
methodologies to Bolivia, since: (a) they do not fully
incorporate the implications of the exhaustion of
natural resources within a predictable timeframe
and the associated intergenerational considerations
that may drive net assets accumulation in the near
term; (b) current account volatility is particularly
high because of commodity price fluctuations,
which makes it difficult to separate underlying
trends from temporary changes, complicating the
estimation of the underlying current account
balance; and (c) the Bolivian economy has
experienced large structural changes in recent years
and, hence, past values of fundamental variables
may be poor guides of their future levels.



The External Sustainability (ES)
approach suggests that the Boliviano is
undervalued by 12.3 percent. This assumes that
Bolivia’s net foreign assets would stabilize at their
end-2009 level (18 percent of GDP), which
would require a CAB of 0.9 percent of GDP.
The Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate (ERER)
approach points to undervaluation of 8.6 percent.
The model explains the REER on the basis of the
terms of trade, net foreign assets, public
expenditure, FDI, and relative productivity.

The Macroeconomic Balance (MB)
approach indicates that an appreciation of
Bolivia’s real effective exchange rate (REER) of
4.6 percent would be needed to close the
difference between the underlying current
account balance (CAB) and the estimated
equilibrium current account (current account
norm). This result hinges on an underlying CAB
of 4 percent of GDP and a current account norm
estimated at 2.8 percent of GDP. The level of the
current account norm reflects mainly relatively
high petroleum trade balances and low old-age
dependency ratios.

Bolivia: External Developments

Current account surplus reflected strong trade balance driven by higher exports. The capital account is driven by slightly
increasing FDI while the rest of private capital flows remain negative. Central Bank’s foreign reserves reached historic
highs of 50 percent of the GDP.
Current account remained in surplus on the backdrop of
improving terms of trade

Higher gas and mining exports were partially off-set by
lower remittances

Bolivia: Fiscal Developments

The fiscal position strengthened in 2010 on the back of lower current and capital expenditures. Public sector debt
resumed its downward trend and domestic debt vulnerabilities have been reduced.
The 2010 fiscal surplus increased to 2 percent of GDP ,
amid a lower non-hydrocarbon balance.

Tax revenues and hydrocarbon receipts remain strong.

September 27, 2004 in conjunction w ith an augmentation of the SBA. This assessment confirmed
that measures had been implemented to address all previously identified vulnerabilities, except for
those requiring a change in the central bank law. Currently, CBB is not subject to the policy.
IX. Exchange Arrangement: The Bolivian currency is the Boliviano and the exchange rate regime
is a stabilized arrangement against the U.S. dollar. 1 However, the authorities indicate that the de
jure regime is a crawling peg. Since November 2010, the authorities resumed the negative crawling
peg and the official selling rate has appreciated from Bs7.07 per U.S. dollar to Bs7.00.
X. Article IV Consultation. The last Article IV consultation was completed by the Executive
Board on January 15, 2 010 (Country Report No . 10/27). Bolivia is on a standard 1 2-month

A. Relations with the World Bank1
1.
The Interim Strategy Note (ISN) that
defines the World Bank Group’s support to
Bolivia for fiscal years 2010 and 2011 is
being implemented. The ISN, which will expire
in June 2011, has
a total envelope of
US$151 million of concessional resources from
the International Devel opment Association (IDA)
that have been allocated to two investment
operations: (i) the Strengthening of the Statistical
Capacity Project for US $50 million, approved by
the Board in January 2011, which will f inance
the population and agricultural censuses, and the
enhancement of the ho usehold survey; and
(ii) the National Roads and Airport Inf rastructure
Project for US$100 million, expected
to be
approved in May 2011, that will support the
development of the northern region of La Paz
through the improvement of the San

Buenaventura–Ixiamas national road and the
upgrading of the Rurrenabaque airport . The
strategy has implemented the principles of
selectivity—by supporting a smaller number of
projects for larger amounts—and flexibility—by
rapidly responding to gov ernment’s emerging
requirements.
The ISN has also supported the smooth
implementation of the existing portfolio.
The current portf olio comprises 12 investment
projects for US$353 milli on, of which US$206
million remain undisburse d (Table 1), and two
trust funds/global programs for US$6.7 million

3.
The Bank has started discussions
with the Government regarding the
development of a medium term strategy.
Over the last years the B ank has supported
Bolivia through two consecutive ISNs (FY07-0 8
and FY10-11) allowing the Bank to continue

supporting the development of the
country
during a period of political, economic and
institutional
transition. Considering the
development of the sociop olitical and economic
context, the government has requested Bank
support through a longer term engagement tool.
In this context, the Bank started the development
of a Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) f or the
following four ye ars. The indicative envelope is
still unknown, though it is expect ed that Bolivia
would receive an IDA allocation similar t o the
current one; IDA hardened terms will be applied
as Bolivia’s G NI per capi tal has remained above
the operational cut-off f or more than three
consecutive years. In addition, access to nonconditional lending fr om the International Bank
for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)
would be considered during the mid-point of the
CPS timeframe.
4.
The Bank and the Government are
already working on the design of new
investment projects that will be included
under the umbrella of the upcoming
strategy. The tentative lending program for the
next two years includes proj ects that had already
been identified in the ong oing ISN but were
slipped due t o the govern ment’s prioritization.
These include: the Agricu ltural Innovation and
Services, the Rural Investment in Rural Areas and
the Decentralized Infrastructure fo
r Rural
Transformation II.

B. IMF-Relations with the World Bank Under JMAP
5.
The World Bank and IMF t eams met in
September 2010 to coordinate the work-plan on
Bolivia for the next 12 months. The following
priorities were identified:


6

Strengthening
of
the
fiscal
framework, in particular the r eform of
intergovernmental relations, transparent
management of the hydrocarbon-related
revenue and reinforcement of the multiannual budget process. The public sector

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

has weak capacity also o n public sector
management and procurement.


Maintaining adequate financial sector
supervision. The financial sector is liqu id
and solvent. The current challenge is to
gradually increase its depth,
while
strengthening supervision to maintain the
health of the loan portfolios, and to fully
develop a financial sector safety net.

BOLIVIA



Improving the business climate to
bolster investment. Bolivia’s private
investment rate remains significantly
below the levels observed in the past
decade and well be low the regional
average. There is also th e challenge to
reconcile the need to maintain the role of
the private sector with t he government
intention to increase the role of the st ate
in the economy.



Reducing
poverty.
Significant
challenges remain in the area of hum an
development, including access to quality
basic education and h ealth, employability
of low in come youth and so
cial
protection network.

6.
It was agreed that the teams continue
with the following division of labor:




Tax policy and administration. The
Fund will continue to have the lead in
collaborating with the au thorities in this
area.
Fiscal federalism. The Fund has been
providing TA on the fiscal implications of
the draft law on Administrative
Autonomies
and De
centralization.
Further, the Bank is providing advice on
public investment management and
coordination among di fferent levels of
government in the provision of pub
lic
services.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX



Governance and budget framework.
The Bank, in collabo ration with the
Ministry of Finance, and the IADB, has
prepared an evaluation of Public Financial
Management,
following PEFA
methodology. The assessment provides
the basis for the government to prioritize
and measure progress, and identify
critical areas where refo rms might be
needed.



Social protection: The Bank will
continue assisting the gov ernment in the
area of soc ial protection, health a nd
education. The Bank is also
providing
technical assistance on poverty, to help
both diagnosis and targeting of
population that fails to reach minimum
standards of multidimensional welfare.



Private sector development: The Bank
will continue its anal ytical work and
financing in the area of agricultural
productivity, food security, support
to
small urban producers, rural development
and community driven development.



Financial sector surveillance. The Fund
will continue with the surveill ance of the
financial
sector
developments.
In
addition, the Bank will work with the
Supervision Authority co nduct analytical
work on financial sector issues. An FSAP
update took place in early 2011, covering
financial stability and development issues.

ANNEX 3. BOLIVIA: RELATIONS WIT THE INTERAMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
1.
As of December 31, 2010, the InterAmerican Development Bank (IDB) had
approved loans to Bolivia amounting to
US$4.41 billion, with disbursements totaling
US$3.45 billion. Bolivia’s outstanding debt to
the IDB was approximately US$629.4 millions
with undisbursed approved funds for US$668.5
millions. During the year net cash flows to the
country were positive for second year in a row, a
trend expected to con tinue in the base scenario
to 2015. At the end of 2007, the IDB unilaterally
joined the IMF-WB MDRI initiative, by writing

off a tot al of US$741.1 million in pr incipal
payments and US$307.3 millions of future

interest payments, ge nerating an estimated
annual fiscal space of
more than US$18.0
millions on average.
2.
After the last round of debt relief,
the IDB is implemented a new criteria of
allocation of concessional lending which is
consistent with the application of th e Debt
Sustainability Framework. The IDB lending to
Bolivia will follow the operational guidelines for
concessional funds under the Fund of Special
Operations performance-based allocation system.
Parallel lending operations, modality that blends
ordinary and concessiona l funding, will be the
preferred lending instrument up to 2015.
3.
The IDB and Bolivia are in the final
phase of drafting a new country strategy
covering the period from 2011-2015. Under
the new country strategy, the IDB has decided to
increase financial flows t o Bolivia. Beginning
2011, Bolivia will b e allocated 25 per cent of
concessional element under IDB’s blended
financial conditions, instead of the 30 p ercent
approved up to 2010. The new country strategy
included provisions and triggers for considering a
new increase in the financial envelope trough an
additional decrease in the concessional
component element up to 20 percent. During
2010 Bolivia enjoyed an annual allocation of
US$200.3 millions for 2010 , the base scenario

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

for the period 2011-2015 is the approval of new
loans US$252.0 millions per year.
4.
Under the draft of the 2011-2015
Bank’s country strategy with Bolivia, the
government and the IDB have agreed on
making sustainable growth and povertyinequality reduction as main objectives of
their strategic engagement. In pursuit of this
objective, the Bank will align its actions with
those on B olivia’s National Development Plan.
The country strategy will target its interventions
in the following sectors: (i) Transport; (ii) Water
and sanitation; (iii) Ener gy; (iv) Early Childhood
Development (ECD); (v) Health; (vi) Education;
and (vii) I nstitutional and Sustainability
Strengthening. As transversal sectors, the IDB will
focus on climate
change and indigenous
population/diversity issues.
5.
As of December 31, 2010 the
portfolio
of
executing
sovereign
guaranteed operations in Bolivia consists of
30 loans, totaling US$1.18 billion, o which
49 percent has already been disbursed. The
current executing port folio supports mostly
transport, water and sa nitation and energy
infrastructure interventions. The undisbursed
sovereign portfolio is c oncentrated (83 p ercent)
in the abovementioned sectors. The nonsovereign guaranteed executing portfolio consists
of 5 loans totaling US$128.0 million, o f which
91.8 percent has already been disbursed. The
Bank’s 2011 operative program contains a
portfolio of s overeign guaranteed operations of
7 loans for a total amount of US$252.0 millions
for the year, including US$62,0 million for
programmatic budget supp ort. The rest of the
approvals will be conc entrated in water and
sanitation, energy, health and ECD secto rs. Nine
additional loans for US$285.0 millions have been
identified and are already in the Bank ’s lending
pipeline for the 2011 cycle.

General:
Data provision has some
shortcomings, but is broadly ad
equate for
surveillance.

SNA 1993, as well as treatment of seasonal
products, missing items, quality changes, and
introduction of new products.

National Accounts: The National Institute of
Statistics (INE) is revising t he national accounts
statistics, including the updating of the base
year (currently dating f rom 1990) and an
intensified implementation of the
System of
National Accounts 1993 (SNA 1993).

Government finance statistics: Annual data
on the oper ations of th e consolidated central
government do not cover
all operations of
decentralized
agencies and operations
channeled through special funds. The ongoing
implementation of a co mprehensive financial
management system, with fundin g from the
IADB/WB, will help ensure proper moni toring of
public sector financia l operations including
subnational fiscal operati ons, debt and social
spending. It will also be i mportant to improve
on the repor ting of t he operations and debt o f
public enterprises.

Labor market: The quality of the household
and employment surveys ha s deteriorated in the
last few years, due
mainly to financial
constraints. The quarterly employment survey
was discontinued in 200 3, leading to a lack of
quarterly information on une mployment,
employment and wages. Yearly information on
wages is still compiled by INE.
Prices statistics: Industrial producer price
indices and external trade unit v alues are
compiled by INE, but are in need of revision as
regards concepts and definitions consistent with

Balance of payments: Despite recent
improvements in the coverage of private capital
flows and positions, as noted by th e January
2007 Data ROSC missio n, the coverage of
certain services and fina ncial transactions in the
balance of payments needs to be expanded.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—EXTERNAL AND PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

BOLIVIA

Bolivia’s public debt sustainability has continued to improve as a result of fiscal surpluses. Debt ratios
continue to display ample margins with respect to risk thresholds and are expected to decline further
under the baseline scenario. Debt service is projected to remain low, reflecting predominantly long
maturities of remaining stocks of both domestic and foreign debt. The path of debt ratios would
deteriorate somewhat under standard stress tests, but would remain within manageable bounds over
the medium- and long run. Therefore, the risk of debt distress is assessed to be low.

BACKGROUND
1.

Bolivia’s gross public debt (domestic

GDP at present—the solvency of the public sector

last years, benefiting from MDRI and fiscal

measured by the net public debt (i.e., gross debt

surpluses. Between 2003 and 2010, gross debt
has fallen from 96 to 40 percent of GDP, while
external public debt has declined from 66 to
15 percent of GDP, with MDRI accounting for
2.9 billion dollars in 2006 and 2007.
2.

Bolivia’s changing debt structure and

the accumulation of significant deposits have
further reduced debt vulnerabilities. Since
2005, average maturities have been successfully
extended and foreign currency exposure has been
reduced. Moreover, with the accumulation of net

minus those deposits) has improved even more
significantly as net debt has declined from
71 percent in 2005 to 18 percent of GDP in 2010.
On account of declining gross debt, debt ratios
would reach very low levels during the projection
period. The average maturity of the outstanding
external public debt remains longer than 20 years at
year-end 2010 (with 65 percent of the total debt
concentrated between 11 to 30 years and
32 percent beyond 31 years). Effective average
interest rate of the total public debt was about
3.6 percent at year end 2010.

Remittances constitute a significant inflow of foreign
exchange for Bolivia, representing about 5 percent of
GDP. Without taking remittances into account there are
no breaches of thresholds under the baseline or stress
tests in the DSA; the modified debt burden indicators
(including remittances) are still significantly lower than
the thresholds, and inclusion of remittances does not
cause a change in the risk rating, which remains low.

The World Bank’s three-year average IDA Resource
Allocation Index (IRAI) classifies Bolivia as a medium
performer with respect to the overall quality of its
macroeconomic policies.

The high levels of residuals in the external DSA are
explained by the accumulation of foreign exchange
reserves over the projection period, which is consistent
with the projected fiscal stance that would lead to
further accumulation of public sector deposits at the
central bank.

eventually returns to a downward trajectory. In all
cases, it would remain well below risky levels. Flow
indicators also remain manageable under all stress
tests. For public debt, the biggest risk stems from a
temporary or permanently lower GDP growth,
however, tests indicate that ratios remain within
manageable levels. Assuming an adverse scenario
where oil prices decline by 30 percent in 2012-16,
Bolivia’s non-interest current account would move
from a surplus of about 4 percent of GDP to a
nearly balanced position. This would mean that,

Bolivian authorities agree with the

assessment of low risk of debt distress. Staff
discussed the assumptions with the authorities, as
well as the strong dependence of the external and
fiscal positions on hydrocarbon revenues. The
authorities see upside risks to growth in the
medium-term and are confident that their policies
(i.e., industrialization of minerals and hydrocarbons)
will result in more stable external and fiscal
positions, making them less vulnerable to terms of
trade shocks.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Statement by the Staff Representative on Bolivia
May 23, 2011

1.
This statement provides additional information that has become available since the
issuance of the staff report. It does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Monthly inflation declined to 0.02 percent in April 2011, down from 0.8 percent
in March, bringing the 12-month inflation rate to 11 percent. This outcome is largely
explained by a large drop in food prices (0.9 percent). Monthly non-food inflation, albeit
positive, also declined, from 1 percent in March to 0.4 percent in April. Official GDP figures
were released, indicating growth of 4.1 percent for 2010, broadly in line with earlier
estimates (4.2 percent).
3.
Excess liquidity in the banking sector declined to 4 percent of deposits by endApril. The central bank stepped up open market operations at slightly higher rates. Net
international reserves have risen to US$10.6 billion, while the exchange rate
(B$6.89‒6.99 per dollar) has remained broadly unchanged.
4.
The authorities have reported that a draft law criminalizing the financing of
terrorism will be submitted to congress in the first half of 2011.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 27, 2011

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with Bolivia
On May 23, 2009 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Bolivia.1
Background
Bolivia has posted a solid macroeconomic performance in recent years, on the back of strong
terms of trade and prudent macroeconomic policies. Increased export volumes and prices led to
a doubling of export receipts between 2005 and 2010, while real GDP growth rose from
3.1 percent in the first half of the past decade to 4.6 percent in the second half. The strength of
the external and fiscal positions in recent years has allowed Bolivia to build a strong reserves
cushion which has reduced macroeconomic vulnerability. While poverty and income inequality
are still high, progress has been made on improving social inclusion and income distribution, as
cash transfer programs have been successful in reducing extreme poverty, from about
30 percent in 2008 to 26 percent in 2009.
In 2010, real GDP grew by 4.2 percent on account of higher hydrocarbons production, with high
terms of trade supporting domestic demand, and despite adverse weather shocks. The external
current account surplus rose to 4.8 percent of GDP, and net international reserves currently
stand at 50 percent of GDP and 80 percent of broad money. At the same time, inflation rose
sharply, to 7.2 percent in December and 11 percent in March 2011, on the back of higher food
commodity prices, some de-anchoring of expectations following an attempt at raising fuel prices

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares
a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this
summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

last December, and amid ample liquidity in the banking sector. The overall public sector surplus
rose to 2.0 percent of GDP in 2010, from 0.3 percent in 2009.
With the pickup in inflation, interest rates have become sharply negative in real terms. In the
context of higher credit growth, banks are profitable, well capitalized, and their nonperforming
loan ratios are low. Progress on the de-dollarization of balance sheets has continued, with
Boliviano-denominated credit and deposits standing at about 55 percent of the total.
Congress has approved a road map for fiscal decentralization and a reform of the pension
system. The decentralization law sets the stage for a discussion of revenue assignments and
spending responsibilities across different levels of government. The pension reform creates a
semi-contributory regime with stepped up benefits for low-income households, funded with
higher contributions from employers and employees. It also introduces a lower retirement age
and nationalizes the administration of the pension funds.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Bolivia’s strong economic performance, underpinned by prudent
macroeconomic policies. The external current account and overall public sector balances
remain in surplus, and record-high net international reserves provide strong protection against
external shocks. Directors noted that the economy is expected to gather further momentum on
the back of a continued recovery of hydrocarbon production, higher public investment, and
favorable export prices. They highlighted that a short-term priority is to contain inflation, and that
meeting development needs and making inroads into poverty reduction remain medium-term
objectives.
While recognizing that higher international food prices have been a key driver of inflation,
Directors saw a need for a faster exit from the monetary stimulus. They noted that a moderate
appreciation of the currency would also help reduce inflationary pressures. Over the medium
term, as de-dollarization and domestic financial market development continues, allowing greater
exchange rate flexibility would enhance the economy’s capacity to respond to external shocks.
Directors agreed that the available fiscal space allows for additional productive and social
investment to address development needs. In this regard, further efforts are needed to enhance
the effectiveness of public spending and implementation capacity across all levels of
government. Directors welcomed plans to introduce multi-year budgeting and a fiscal savings
fund to facilitate anti-cyclical fiscal policy. They encouraged the authorities to limit fiscal claims
on the central bank and enhance the transparency and accountability of state-owned
enterprises.
Directors welcomed improvements in the financial sector, as highlighted by the FSAP update. In
order to preserve macro-financial stability, it will be important to ensure appropriate levels of
banks’ liquidity and capital buffers, avoid using interest rate policy and prudential rules for
development purposes, and improve financial sector supervision more broadly. Directors

3
considered a deposit insurance scheme as a useful element of the crisis management
framework.
Directors stressed the need to improve the investment climate, particularly through further
reforms of the legal framework in a way that ensures clear and stable rules of the game for the
private sector. They commended the authorities for putting in place effective social policies and
enhancing the delivery of health and education services. Directors called for continued efforts to
improve the targeting of transfer programs, to facilitate the reduction of fuel subsidies and free
price setting in agriculture.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Alfredo Mac Laughlin, Executive Director for Bolivia
and Victor Hugo De la Barra, Advisor to the Executive Director
May 23, 2011
Background
Bolivia, in developing its domestic policies, considers transparency important. Even though
the authorities may not share the IMF’s recommendations and conclusions, they consent to
the publication of the surveillance reports. The authorities regret that the institution has not
given the necessary attention to the authorities’ claims regarding the effect that IMF
surveillance reports may have on the Bolivian economy, especially regarding inflation
projections. The Bolivian authorities have repeatedly expressed that expectations are very
sensitive in Bolivia, as economic agents do not internalize projections appropriately, because
they are very often manipulated and mishandled by the media and political opposition. The
authorities would like the staff to give this issue deeper consideration in the future.
Economic Overview
Bolivia’s economy showed a satisfactory performance in 2010. In fact, the GDP growth rate
was 4.2 percent, greater than envisaged (4 percent), notwithstanding the extensive drought,
subsequent wildfires and an unusually cold June and July which affected harvests and farm
output in eastern parts of the country. Notably, there was also an outstanding flow of foreign
investment. In addition, Bolivian balance of payments broadly reached positive results, with
increases in exports exceeding imports; the current account again showed a positive stance of
4.6 percent of GDP. International reserves are also at a very comfortable level, reaching
almost 50 percent of GDP. In the fiscal sector, Bolivia’s economy continued to manage a
positive result (2 GDP percentage points) mainly due to lower expenditure. The authorities
are considering a growth rate of 5 percent in 2011, which is supported by growth at that rate
in the first quarter of the year.
Fiscal Policy: Macroeconomic Equilibrium and Fostering Production Base
The fiscal surplus in 2010, as in the previous four years confirms a strong fiscal position,
even though social programs still continue as part of the main objective of economic policy:
income redistribution. Revenues grew faster than expenditure, coming from almost all
sectors but particularly from hydrocarbons and minerals. State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs)
are expanding operations leading to the implemention of important projects for enhancing the
production base. Investment in sub-national administration was not as good as in 2009, but
the authorities expect a strong recovery in 2011.
In 2011, the authorities will again apply a fiscal stimulus through an ample program of public
investment, since there is still fiscal space coming from public savings in previous years.

2
Therefore, this impulse should not affect inflation and, on the contrary, widening the
production base would help to anchor expectations. Fiscal impulse is still necessary since
large segments of population still live in poverty and extreme poverty, although important
progress has been made in recent years because of social programs and building social safety
nets. The authorities are keen to keep macroeconomic equilibrium but public investment has
to be done at this juncture, when the economy is gaining momentum as international markets
for Bolivian commodities are favorable. Incurring a small fiscal deficit because of public
investment would be worthwhile for the sake of building a stronger GDP base for future
generations.
In paragraph 4, the staff asserts that a low level of private investment would be a result of
uncertainties about the legal framework on strategic sectors. There are no actions that induce
uncertainties from the authorities’ side, since the main legal framework is already set up, and
adjustments are made in compliance of the Constitution. In strategic sectors, most operating
companies—whose main partner is the State—have signed contracts.
The government has plans for public investment to reach around US$ 2.4 billion in 2011
(around 10 .8 percent of GDP), with a significant part financed by fiscal savings. Public
investment will be allocated in infrastructure, as well as in public enterprises, following the
strategy of investing in partnerships with private entrepreneurs (50 percent respectively). As
part of the objective of increasing growth through public investment, the oil and electricity
state companies plan to engage in an ambitious investment program financed in part by loans
from the Central Bank of Bolivia (CBB). Among these projects are the exploration of
hydrocarbons, hydroelectric plants and major road constructions, as well as enhancing
infrastructure for education and health, which are part of central government responsibilities.
In paragraph 21, the staff notes that SOEs may pose fiscal risks if they do not show enough
transparency and accountability. SOEs are included in the budget and their governing laws
already require annual external audits and ex-post control from the subsequent control
agency.
The State Company to Support Food Production (EMAPA), which was originally founded to
assist with loans for medium- and small-sized farms in order to ensure domestic food
security, will be reformed to produce main food grains, such as soy, rice, wheat and corn,
which are essential to food security. Moreover, by doing so, the authorities believe that
EMAPA will contribute to tackling inflationary pressures coming from shortcomings in food
supply. The Production Law under preparation will set up provisions for enhancing
production across the board. The staff’s concerns about prolonged price controls on certain
goods and their effects on domestic supply are not technically supported, since market prices
are still well above production costs. Meeting domestic demand, particularly for poor people,
is a priority for the authorities. EMAPA may also export after covering domestic demand.

3
In paragraph 25, the staff talks again about fuel subsidies; this is an issue which is no longer
on the 2011 policy agenda. Fuel subsidies will remain in place until a consensus with social
movements is reached, as President Morales asserted immediately after the attempted
removal of such subsidies back in December 2010.
Expenses for health care and education will still be among the main components of public
expenditure in 2010. Social expenditure will be maintained, as well as the conditional cashtransfers to keep elementary school students on track and to entice pregnant women to attend
regular pre-natal and pediatric checkups. The non-conditional cash transfer for the elderly
will also continue as a universal retirement pension. These programs aim to enhance
domestic demand and create a market for new public and private enterprises expected to be
created as part of the development plan. This plan is also linked to the strategy to reduce
poverty, since the authorities are not comfortable with the prevalent level of poverty and
intend to reduce it further by expanding the social safety net and improving access to basic
infrastructure. To this end, the authorities will continue to implement the Extreme Poverty
Eradication Plan which started in 2009.
Reducing Inflation: Monetary, Exchange Rate and Complementary Policies
In paragraph 7, the staff comments on the important pick-up in inflation by the end of 2010
(7.2 percent) and it projects inflation for 2011 to be 7.9 percent. The 2010 inflation rate was
highly influenced by speculation in the domestic goods market after the authorities attempted
to correct fuel prices by cutting subsidies for gasoline and diesel in late December 2010.
Analysis on speculation as an explaining factor for inflation in 2010 is not adequately
covered in the staff report.
Speculation was spread by political opposition activists along with certain media sources
spreading false rumors about the exchange rate policy and goods availability, which
artificially raised prices and caused inflationary expectations. The authorities had projected
an inflation rate of 4 percent for 2010, supported by the accumulated inflation in June 2010.
In September, this level reached 2.9 percent. However, in the last week of December 2010,
prices went up, driving accumulated inflation up to 7.2 percent.
While the IMF staff projects an inflation rate of 7.9 percent by the end of 2011, the
authorities envisage an inflation rate of 6 percent because the upturn in inflation in 2010 is
not transmitting to 2011. Even though inflation expectations affected prices in January and
February, it is a not signal of overheating in the economy, since public expenditure is
completely under control and credit is expanding at reasonable rates.
Paragraph 8 of the staff report affirms that monetary policy remained accommodative in
2010. An accommodative monetary policy attempts to avoid growth falling at a price of
higher inflation. This is not the case for Bolivia. In fact, after reaching the highest GDP

4
growth rate in South America in 2009, the CBB decided to gradually remove the monetary
impulse applied in 2008-2009, by increasing open market operations (OMO). Starting in the
first quarter of 2010, the CBB sold larger amounts of securities in each auction. Additionally,
there were increases in reserve requirements and more dynamic OMO for individuals at
higher interest rates, meaning that banking institutions are not allowed access to these types
of transactions. While the CBB was in the middle of implementing such policies, the IMF
staff revised the 2010 inflation projection for Bolivia from 4 to 3.5 percent.
The recent upturn in inflation does not come from demand pressures but mainly from a
change in relative prices. The staff does not consider the statistical effect derived from a low
inflation in the first semester of 2010 (0.4 percent) compared to the second semester, which
implies a lower year-on-year inflation in the following months. The pace of OMO observed
in the first quarter of 2011 triples the liquidity withdrawn vís-a-vís what the Fund’s estimates
appropriate for the whole year. Moreover, this liquidity withdrawal was executed although
there was a fiscal surplus in the first quarter of 2011.
The staff recommends tightening monetary conditions through increasing the policy interest
rate as a means to combat inflation; however, it is important to take into account the way
monetary policy is instrumented in Bolivia. The CBB auctions a certain amount of securities
and participants bid interest rates, which reflect their expectations of the trend in commercial
rates and prices. Increasing the policy rate at this time would cause more harm than good to
the economy. The CBB, according to pre-established quantitative targets, has contracted
liquidity without substantially increasing the policy rate, but gradually.
There is no reason to believe that the credit growth is excessive, whether considering past
records or in comparison with neighboring countries. It cannot be said that Bolivia’s GDP
growth is above potential, so there is no overheating in the economy, as in economies with
demand-driven high inflation. M1 growth (around 20 percent) has been influenced by
changes in currency preference in favor of the domestic currency because of the dedollarization process that is taking place in Bolivia. In fact, M3 (which includes foreigndenominated operations) currently shows an increase of only 11 percent year-on-year.
Regarding the staff’s concern about high liquidity, the ratio of “excess liquidity/deposits” is
around 5 percent (April 2011), lower than the staff’s calculations (8 percent), which has
shown a systematic decreasing trend from 19 percent in early 2010, precisely due to the
monetary policy, as explained above.
Real interest rates in Bolivia are currently negative, but this is a temporary issue which is not
going to induce worries, since inflation is not demand-driven. Inflation is decreasing, as in
2008-2009, after a temporary pick up. As a matter of fact, monthly inflation for April was
0.02 percent (the lowest in 2011), while inflation for the same month year-on-year (11.04

5
percent) is lower than March’s year-on-year figure (11.1 percent) which signals a downward
trend.
In paragraph 21, the staff recommends that monetary policy should focus on price stability
while the exchange rate should move toward a more flexible regime. This in an orthodox
approach which was questioned even in advanced economies with flexible exchange rates,
which have heavily intervened in their exchange rate markets and introduced capital controls.
Bolivia’s monetary policy is not orthodox and has a counter-cyclical orientation. It uses
several instruments in addition to sterilization: limits on long positions for balance sheets in
foreign currency; regulation on liquidity avoiding significant increases in interest rates; and
credit policies for public entities. Furthermore, the CBB, in coordination with ASFI
(Authority for Financial Institution Supervision) and the Ministry of Economy and Finance,
implemented measures to limit excessive spreads between loan and deposit rates; regulated
commissions and fund transfers to other countries; and put limits on financial investments in
foreign markets carried out by commercial banks, pension administrators, and insurance
companies.
The exchange rate policy has kept its objective of controlling excessive volatility without
neglecting undervaluation or overvaluation over time. Following this objective, the CBB has
kept the widened spread between buying and selling exchange rate for the agents internalized
dollarization costs, while at the same time putting a limit on profit margins for exchange rate
operations. The authorities disagree on the level of misalignment of the exchange rate,
although they agree with the direction of the exchange rate policy in the following months,
which will contribute to anchoring expectation and mitigating inflationary pressures. The
exchange rate regime (crawling peg) has been reaffirmed with small nominal appreciations
since November 2010, which aimed to moderate external inflationary pressures at a gradual
pace, suitable for partially-dollarized economies such Bolivia’s. Sudden movements in the
exchange rate may affect balance sheets of households, as well as financial entities’, risking
the de-dollarization process also praised by the IMF staff.
In paragraph 21 of the report, the staff mentions that the use of international reserves for
financing SOEs may affect confidence in public policies and monetary policy independence,
while increasing external vulnerability. The staff does not relate its analysis to the high level
of international reserves (almost 50 percent of GDP), which ranks high in the world and are
above the optimum level according to research conducted both in Bolivia and by the IMF. It
is important to note that the Bolivian authorities are engaged in expanding the GDP base to
tackle key social concerns such as poverty, inequality and ultimately unemployment.
Therefore, they have decided to finance key SOEs investment projects in electricity and
hydrocarbons, which are pivotal for the Bolivian economy. External financing for such
projects is not available at this time and financially it is more convenient, given the current
low yields for international reserves investments. Regarding transparency for the use of these
resources, the CBB authorities have already laid down rules for handling credits to SOEs. In

6
addition, the fiscal authorities approved a procedure for credit to SOEs within the budget
framework; thus, this issue has been duly addressed considering necessary safeguards
(financial, legal, and economic). Besides, a law for public enterprises is being drafted for
strengthening these safeguards and establishing a more streamlined legal framework for their
operations. It will include a supervisory body for fiscal supervision and accountability.
The staff also recommends creating a fund with excess international reserves, which was
already included in the 2006 National Development Plan. In fact, this plan envisages the
creation of a Fund for Stabilization and Development for: i) preserving fiscal sustainability
and macroeconomic stability, ii) reducing volatility and uncertainty about international
reserves, iii) ensuring better income distribution, iv) taking care of intergenerational equity,
and v) promoting the development of production base and labor mobility.
In paragraph 23, the staff mentions that criminalizing the financing of terrorism is a pending
action. It is worth mentioning that the authorities have made important progress in drafting
and internally discussing this legal provision. Introducing new crimes implies a process that
involves the Executive, its agencies, the Judiciary and the National Assembly. An initial
provision for introducing this crime was included in the Anticorruption Law Draft, but the
National Assembly decided to put it in a separate law. The Minister of Finance attended the
2010 FAFT Plenary and has made a commitment to send a new draft in the first semester of
2011.
Development Policies and Social Issues
The staff considers that there are still disputes between sub-national and central governments,
as well as social tensions, but these tensions have actually calmed down substantially.
Normally, negotiations with unions, social movements and regions imply certain methods of
exercising pressure but they do not infer economic or politic risk.
In paragraph 3, the staff states that in Bolivia, poverty, infant mortality, and other social
indicators are above average in Latin America. This assessment is incomplete and out of
context, since Bolivia is a poor country with still poor infrastructure and thus progress on
social indicators is hard to achieve. Despite these difficulties, in the last five years the present
Administration has made more progress than ever before, thanks to an unprecedented level of
social expenditure and the development of social safety nets.
The Bolivian authorities highlight the need to attain greater equality, transparency, and
accountability underpinned by cautious macroeconomic policies. They are assigning an
important role in mining and hydrocarbons activities to finance the improvement of
education, health, and sanitation that will help reduce poverty and inequality and strengthen
infrastructure. The authorities are aware that private investment is also important for growth
and job creation, thus the legal framework is straightforward and imposes no restrictions for

7
investment. On the contrary, some regions are subject to special incentives for private
investment. In this vein, the Bolivian government attaches great importance to the
diversification of the economy to gradually reduce, in the future, the high dependence on the
hydrocarbon and mining sectors and, consequently, lessen the economy’s vulnerability to
external shocks.
Recently—and after many years of discussion with the unions—the new Pension Law was
passed in the National Assembly. This reform implies a step forward towards reaching more
equal income redistribution, since it creates a solidarity pension fund for those affiliates that
cannot retire due to the lack of sufficient funding in their individual accounts. This solidarity
pension—which is complementary to the regular pension—is financed by a small increase in
the basic workers’ contribution, the reinstatement of the employers’ contribution that was
unfairly cut off in 1997, and an additional progressive contribution from workers with high
income. The new pension law also sets up the minimum retirement age at 58, since life
expectancy is still low in Bolivia. The law also establishes a special retirement age for miners
and mothers. No fiscal impact is expected in the medium and long term, since MEFP’s
actuarial projections render financial sustainability for the following 30 years, although the
provisions of the law anticipate assessments every five years.
Agriculture output is likely to increase as the harvest should be good, given that there were
no severe weather conditions in the agricultural year. It is important to note that growth has
been driven by the impulse applied to domestic demand since 2006, through transfers to
municipalities (for financing small infrastructure projects that cannot be executed because of
a lack of financing in their budgets), and conditional and non-conditional transfers to
individuals. This policy boosted consumption, but not only for goods such as food, but also
for basic services like water and electricity, which also lead to positive spillover effects
across the economy.
The need to balance accumulation of financial savings for intergenerational equity and the
more urgent demands for economic and social infrastructure are also of concern for the
authorities. In this regard, the authorities are engaged in making operative the fund
established in the Autonomy Law, which would be used for stabilization—in case fiscal
revenue falls short of the amount budgeted—and development, for financing public
investment going forward. The authorities expect that this sovereign fund will be
expeditiously considered in 2011. In the meantime, the considerable amount of international
reserves accumulated since 2006 may be used as a financing cushion for public investment, a
key driver for growth and employment in Bolivia.
