This report is based on discussions held in Bern and Zurich during March 15–23. The team
comprised Ms. Waysand (head), Messrs. Mehrez and Ross (EUR) and Mr. Goswami
(MCM).

•

The mission met with Federal Councilor Merz (Head of Federal Department of Finance),
Swiss National Bank (SNB) Board Chairman Hildebrand, the Financial Market
Supervisory Authority (FINMA) CEO Raaflaub, and other senior officials, think tanks,
parliamentarians, and private sector representatives.

•

Context of past surveillance. In recent years, the Fund and the authorities agreed on the
main policy priorities—enhancing financial stability and cushioning the recession, without
threatening long term sustainability. Given the size of the financial sector, the Fund has
stressed the importance of strong and effective supervision and regulation. The authorities’
policy response to the crisis has incorporated key elements of Fund advice from the 2008–
09 Article IV consultations, notably the increase in capital and liquidity buffers,
strengthened supervisory arrangements, and fiscal stimuli in 2009 and 2010.

•

The Swiss franc exchange rate is market determined. The de facto exchange rate
arrangement under the AREAER system was reclassified from ‘free floating’ to
‘stabilized’ from March 2009 as a result of the SNB intervention in the foreign exchange
market to stabilize the Swiss franc against the euro. Starting December 18, 2009 Swiss
franc volatility vis-à-vis the euro increased while the SNB intervened occasionally. The
arrangement was thus reclassified to ‘floating’. Switzerland has accepted the obligations of
Article VIII. The exchange rate system is free of restrictions on current international
transactions, with the exceptions of those notified to the Fund in accordance with
Executive Board Decision 144 and UN-sanctioned restrictions on external payments for
security reasons.

•

It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND STAFF APPRAISAL
1.
A recovery is ongoing. While domestic demand helped cushion the effects of the
trade and financial shocks in the downturn, the economy is now benefitting from the pick-up
in world growth and stabilization in financial markets. Latest indicators point to a continuing
recovery and GDP is expected to grow by about 1½ percent in 2010 with a further
strengthening in 2011 (Figure 1). With substantial slack, and Swiss franc appreciation,
inflation should remain muted. However, uncertainties related to global developments are
large. Similarly, the medium term prospects of the economy are uncertain, as financial
activity and immigration flows—two key drivers of recent growth—may slow down going
forward. Given uncertainties and in the absence of near-term threats to price and public
finance stability, an exit from the current accommodative fiscal and monetary stance should
be cautious.
2.
The challenge for monetary policy is to normalize interest rates, while exiting
exchange rate interventions. The SNB has appropriately applied an expansionary monetary
stance with unconventional policies, given deflation risks and zero interest rates. With an
improving outlook and concerns over accelerating mortgage credit, the authorities have
signaled a desire to normalize interest rates over time. There is, however, considerable
uncertainty at this stage, and an inherent tension between appreciation pressures and the
desire to raise interest rates.


The real appreciation reflects continuing trade surpluses, improving growth prospects,
and safe haven effects, but model based assessments indicate that the Swiss franc is
broadly in line with fundamentals. In this context, the authorities’ intentions to return
over time to a free floating currency regime are welcome, and interventions, if any,
should be limited to resisting short-term disruptive pressures.



Interest rates should not be raised too early—or without regard to a fundamental
strengthening in the currency. Indeed, inflationary pressures are subdued and the long
established credibility of the SNB limits the possibility of de-anchoring of
expectations. Furthermore, while there is no indication so far that lending standards
have materially deteriorated, supervisory/prudential tools (e.g., loan to value
restrictions, added capital charges under Pillar II) may be best suited to address these
risks if they materialize.

3.
Fiscal consolidation should be limited to what is needed to respect the debt brake
rule, while giving more attention to longer term issues. In spite of the recession and of
stimulus measures of around ¾ percent of GDP in 2009 and 2010, the small surplus in 2009
is expected to only turn to a limited deficit in 2010. To comply with the debt brake rule, some
consolidation is being contemplated for 2011–13. Prudent fiscal policies resulting in low debt
levels have served the country well and are warranted, given large potential liabilities related
to the banking sector and ageing effects. Still, consistent underestimate of revenue suggests
an increase in potential revenues and points to a possible lesser need of fiscal retrenchment in
the short run. Reforms are needed, however, to address the medium term sustainability gap.

4
4.
The momentum to reinforce financial stability should not be lost. The authorities’
package of measures has helped to stabilize the financial system but also exposed the size of
contingent liabilities faced by public finances, and the moral hazard problem associated with
the presence of a limited number of systemic banks. It is therefore essential that the ongoing
strengthening of supervisory and regulatory frameworks continues.
5.
Risks remain and warrant close monitoring. Although the two largest banks have
strengthened funding and capital positions, their dependence on wholesale funding remains
elevated and further asset deterioration cannot be ruled out. Turbulences in the Euro area
would be a particular concern—through spillovers to the Swiss banks and economy.
Moreover, tax amnesties in third countries are putting some pressures on the wealth
management and private banking industry, as may the welcome full acceptance of article 26
of the OECD model tax convention by the authorities. In the insurance sector, some life
insurance companies and a re-insurer have been weakened by market developments. While
coverage ratios in the second pillar pension sector have picked up to some degree,
underfunding remains and may require adjustment.
6.
Although the authorities’ steps to strengthen supervision are welcome, more
needs to be done. The supervisory focus on major institutions, oversight of auditors,
attention to governance and risk management practices, and cross-border cooperation have
improved. The effectiveness of FINMA could be further enhanced. Its in-house supervisory
capability should be expanded, thus allowing it to engage more actively on-site with high
impact institutions. The independence of the external auditors carrying out on-site
supervision could be strengthened, inter alia by having payments to auditors come directly
from FINMA. This will clarify lines of control and reinforce the auditors’ public
responsibilities.
7.
Building on prior initiatives, the authorities should reinforce their regulatory
framework to address the “Too big to fail” (TBTF) problem. Early appropriate measures
taken by FINMA include imposing higher capital requirements effective in 2013, the recent
development of liquidity benchmarks for the two large banks, and issuance of remuneration
guidelines effective from 2010. The report issued by the advisory working group on the
TBTF problem identifies a series of possible measures. Once new Basel standards have been
issued, the authorities should implement them, and include sufficient add-ons for institutions
posing a systemic risk, in order to effectively address moral hazard and to discourage
excessive risk taking. Simplifications in the organization and the legal structure of large
banking institutions could also be considered to help improve crisis resolution. This may
require additional legislation. Progress in these areas will serve the economy well and help
foster the reputation of its financial center.
8.
Development of an effective macro-prudential framework will require clarity on
responsibilities, access to information, and enforcement power. According to their
mandates, the SNB contributes to the stability of the financial system while FINMA secures
the smooth functioning of the financial markets. While some overlap between micro and
macro supervision is an inherent feature of the system given the weight of the two large
banks, the delineation of responsibilities between the two institutions could be further
clarified. The new SNB/FINMA Memorandum of Understanding is a step in the right

5
direction. There is also a need to ensure that the legal framework is supportive of the
respective mandates, with the powers of each institution closely aligned with its mandate,
including as regards to information gathering, and enables the findings to be acted upon.

and had a strong impact on the current account.2 The 2008 current account surplus
was revised downward—from 10 to 2 percent of GDP—in August 2009, once the
extent of the financial losses became clear (Figure 3; Table 2). Direct investment
income fell from SFr 60 to 8 billion

The mid-1990s shock was due to a real estate bubble which spilled over into a domestic banking crisis. The
early-2000s shock was due to problems at one of the large Swiss banks as well as weakness in external markets.
In both cases financial sector value added fell by about 15 percent from their recent peaks.

A sizable portion of the expansion, and as a result of the crisis, contraction of investment bank balance sheets
reflects repo and proprietary trading book activity. Domestic interbank transactions, including repos, are netted
from FISIM calculations, while cross-border interbank transactions are explicitly excluded. Market making
margins within proprietary trading book activities are included in GDP but are small. Gains and losses on
proprietary trading only affect the factor income in the balance of payments.

causing the net investment income to move into deficit for the first time ever. The
trade balance, however, was in record surplus. With regard to 2009, the current
account surplus is projected to have increased to about 9 percent of GDP, as the trade
and service surplus continues to expand, and the net investment income moves back
to balance.

B. The Economy Entered the Recession in a Strong Position
14.
Households and corporations entered the recession with relatively strong
balance sheets. Swiss households’ gross debt-to-income ratios, traditionally high but more
than matched by their large financial and non financial wealth, have remained stable in recent
years. In contrast to most other European countries, non-financial corporate net debts to
income ratios declined prior to the crisis and have remained relatively low.

real estate prices to income ratios. Reflecting the
decline in industrial activity, however,
commercial property prices fell by 8.2 percent in 2009.
Box 1. Swiss Real Estate Cycles
Swiss real estate price inflation has recently been low by international standards, and has not been
extremely volatile.



Swiss real estate did experience a severe boom-bust cycle during 1987–91, which spilled
over to the broader economy. During this period, signs of overheating on the housing market
were pervasive – both on the sale and on the rental side. With households overextended, a sharp
rise in interest rates, escalating unemployment, and contracting credit brought real estate values
rapidly back to their late-1980 levels. The resulting fallout included numerous foreclosures,
consolidation in regional banking (some 200 banks were absorbed), and an unusually long
recession with protracted unemployment throughout most of the 1990s. General government
debt rose from 31 to 55 percent of GDP from 1990 to 1998—one of the key factors behind the
creation of the debt brake rule.



Basic misalignment indicators are inconclusive. Real estate prices have gradually increased
in a linear fashion since 2000. Real estate inflation rates during this period have averaged
between 4–5 percent per year, resulting in an increase in prices of single family homes and
owner occupied apartments over the last 5 years between 20–25 percent. Ascertaining
misalignment in Swiss real estate markets is problematic. There are a number of rules and
regulations—many implemented in response to the 1990s bust—which make it difficult to
determine if any asset class is out of equilibrium. However, a few simple comparisons are
possible. The ratio of real estate prices relative to rental prices reveals a strong upward trend
from the early 1990s to 2000, but a flattening since then. Also, while real estate price increases
have been somewhat more dynamic than nominal incomes in the recent years, affordability
measures have not deteriorated in the past 10 years. Still, market observers expect some
possible decline in 2010 due to a slowdown in immigration, hence demand, in a market where
supply remains dynamic.

Degen and Fischer (2009), find that an immigration inflow of 1 percent relative to local population, raises the price of
Swiss single family homes by 2.7 percent—explaining about two-thirds of the increase in 2001–06.

9
C. Supportive Policies also Played a Key Role
16.
A broad range of macroeconomic policy actions, and financial sector
stabilization measures, have been taken in response to the crisis. The authorities took a
series of measures aimed at stabilizing the financial sector, ensuring ample liquidity and
avoiding excessive tightening of the monetary and financial conditions, and supporting
demand and limiting labor market adjustment whose effects were reinforced by measures
undertaken in partner countries4 (Box 2).
17.
SNB measures contributed to limit the tightening of monetary and financial
conditions (Figure 5). Reductions in real interest rates, and the rebound in equity prices
from their early 2009 lows, partially offset the effective appreciation in the currency of about
4 percent in 2009, and 13 percent since the beginning of the crisis.

The re-pricing of risk of Swiss asset markets reflects the successful stabilization
package and improved global environment. Most measures of financial stress have eased
sharply from their early 2009 highs. Interbank liquidity has shown sustained improvements.
The CDS spreads on Swiss confederation bonds, which had swelled at the height of the crisis
in March 2009, and credit spreads of large banks and insurance companies, have declined
significantly.

In particular, Swiss banks also benefitted from a variety of actions taken by other authorities. US$ swap lines
created to alleviate liquidity shortages, were used to initially finance the SNB loan to the StabFund. The large
banks had access to US$ liquidity in the US, and both received funds related to completion of AIG CDS
contracts.

10
Box 2. Main 2009–10 Policy Initiatives
Over the last year the authorities took action in a broad range of policy areas.
Regarding monetary policy, the SNB lowered the target range to 0 to 0.75 percent in March 2009, and targeted
0.25 percent. It extended the maturity of its repo operations and range of eligible counterparties. It provided liquidity
through SFr/EUR swaps, jointly with the ECB, the National Bank of Poland and the National Bank of Hungary. The
last such operation was undertaken in January 2010. It engaged in SFr/USD swaps with the Federal reserve, which
expired on February, and provided USD liquidity. It also implemented unconventional policy measures—including
exchange rate intervention, and purchases of Swiss private bonds—in order to stabilize monetary and financial
conditions. The SNB has now shifted to exit mode and is scaling back liquidity since April 2009. Since mid-December,
bond purchases have ceased, and only excessive appreciation vis-à-vis the Euro has been prevented.
In the fiscal area, the authorities allowed automatic stabilizers full play and enacted the last of three stimulus
packages. These packages consisted in public investment in infrastructure and other areas (i.e. applied research,
alternative energy production), as well as targeted labor market measures (extension of the duration of short-time
work, incentives to hire young entrants on the labor market). These efforts were accompanied by further stimulus at the
cantons and municipalities level. Fiscal stimulus is estimated at around ¾ percent of GDP in 2009 and 2010. More
structurally, the debt brake rule was expanded to cover extraordinary expenditure effective as of 2010. A higher VAT
rate to finance disability insurance was approved.
In the labor market, the duration of short time work benefits was lengthened from 12 to 18 months in April 2009, and
to 24 months effective April 2010.
Building on measures in 2008, a series of financial sector actions were also taken.

In late 2008, FINMA had already announced new prudential rules for large banks to be effective by 2013:
cyclically adjusted capital rules (200% of Basel II norms in good times; 150% in bad times); a leverage ratio
cap (set at 5 in good times, 3 in bad times). In 2009, FINMA announced the progressive tightening of capital
requirements on Cantonal and Regional banks, from 1 January 2010 . In April 2010, FINMA and the SNB
announced a new liquidity regime for the big banks, effective on 30 June 2010, that requires banks to cover
the outflows estimated in a stress scenario over a period of at least 30 days.



In early 2009, the transfer of illiquid UBS assets into SNB stabilization fund (StabFund) was completed
($39 billion in total). By year end, the overall risk for the SNB was reduced by about one third. In August,
the government sold its 9 percent stake in UBS for a 33 percent profit.



Deposit insurance coverage was expanded from SFr 30,000 to 100,000 per depositor; the cap on the systemwide liabilities increased from SFr 4 billion to SFr 6 billion; banks were required to hold assets in
Switzerland equaling 125 percent of covered deposits; and a quicker payout mechanism implemented.



A “Too Big to Fail” (TBTF) working group, comprising both private and public sector representatives issued
an interim report on April 22, with a final report which could be issued during the summer. The report
defined TBTF institutions and described broad features of possible measures—notably added capital and
liquidity buffers, a tighter limit on risk concentration, and changes in organizational structure to contribute to
an orderly resolution in case of crisis. The calibration, however, still needs to be addressed.



New standards for remuneration schemes of financial institutions with at least SFr 2 billion in capital were
implemented. The guidelines stress transparency and risk incentives; greater responsibility for structuring
and monitoring the effect of remuneration is given to the firm’s boards of directors.



The FINMA-SNB memorandum of understanding (MoU) was revised. Guidelines and priorities for the
cooperation have been codified.

dynamic growth in the working population,
the unemployment rate has increased by about 2 pps, from 2.5 percent in mid-2008 to
4.5 percent in February. The authorities were concerned that depending on growth prospects,
workers in short time regimes could be pushed into unemployment. The resilience of
employment, together with strong wage growth had played a major role in cushioning
consumption during the recession.
D. Outlook
20.
Looking ahead, a moderate recovery is taking hold. The authorities noted that
despite the current strong growth, Switzerland had not decoupled from the rest of Europe.

supported by lagged effects from fiscal
stimulus. Real wage and income growth is expected to be sluggish, but some smoothing is
expected to continue and consumption is overall expected to grow in line with GDP.
21.
Uncertainty surrounding the baseline is mainly related to the global recovery
and developments on financial markets. The baseline scenario is a moderate recovery of
Switzerland’s main trading partners and financial markets stabilization. There are however
large uncertainties resulting notably from the impact of exits from accommodative policies,
which could affect growth prospects in the country’s partners, and the value of the Swiss
franc. Switzerland’s direct exposure to Greece is limited.

12
However, further market turmoil in the euro area could have significant repercussions, given
Switzerland’s financial and trade links with the euro area. The impact on the currency would
be uncertain, as safe haven effects may not be long lasting given spillovers to the Swiss
economy. If downside external risks were to materialize, this would lead to a further rise in
unemployment as firms would have less incentives to hoard labor. As monetary policy has
little margins of maneuver, this would need to be mainly accommodated through fiscal policy.
22.
Potential growth has declined in the short term and uncertainty on the medium
run estimates has increased. The uncertainty around any estimate of potential output during
a crisis is large. Overall, there was agreement that the global crisis would have less of an
impact on potential growth than the large domestically originated financial shock of the mid1990s. Many of the mitigating factors that cushioned this recession, including continuing
credit supply, are likely to limit the decline in potential growth. Still, there is considerable
uncertainty on the evolution of total factor productivity. From a policy point of view,
however, the key issue is whether immigration flows will continue, and at what pace. With
this in mind, staff’s preliminary estimates suggest potential growth has declined to around
1¼ percent in the short-run, mainly due to lower potential employment and capital
accumulation, and could return to a medium term growth of around 1 ¾ percent – somewhat
smaller than growth observed in the years preceding the crisis (Appendix I).
III. CHALLENGES REMAIN
23.
Exit from the current accomodative stance will have to be accompanied by
structural measures to strengthen financial stability. While little short term fiscal
consolidation is needed, exit from the current monetary stance is more challenging. Measures
to handle the financial crisis have been effective, but risks remain in the financial system and,
more broadly, the issues exposed by the crisis – the disproportionate size of contingent
liabilities and the moral hazard issue of too big to fail institutions – still have to be addressed.
A. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy Issues
24.
The SNB has signaled its intention to raise interest rates over time, and to exit
from the current exchange rate policy. The authorities noted that high levels of liquidity

13
SNB inflation projections—currently suggest an increase of about a ½ percent by-end 2010.
However, the authorities recognize that while their inflation projections signal that the
current monetary policy cannot be maintained in the long run without incurring inflation
risks, considerable uncertainty is attached to the inflation forecasts.
25.
Liquidity is being mopped up but the SNB’s balance sheet growth will not be
fully reversed. Repos and swap instruments have been allowed to expire, and short-term SFr
SNB bills are being used to further scale back liquidity. However, the SNB views the
increase in foreign exchange reserves and private sector bonds as a more permanent part of
its balance sheet, and acknowledges that it is therefore subjected to more currency and credit
risk (Box 3). The loan corresponding to the funding of the StabFund also remains on SNB’s
balance sheet. Looking ahead, while models suggest that even in a moderately pessimistic
scenario, the remaining assets would generate a significant amount of cash to pay down the
loan, the SNB could suffer losses–given that the first loss buffer of about $4 billion has been
exhausted. The authorities noted that this was one of the factors behind the SNB’s planned
increase in capital. Accordingly, the SNB plans to increase provisions drawn from annual
profits in 2009–13, and to reduce the amount distributed to the cantons in the form of
dividends.

26.
Since December, the authorities are only preventing excessive appreciation of the
Swiss Franc vis-à-vis the euro. During this period, the SFr/euro rate has appreciated by
4 percent—the effective appreciation of the SFr has, however, been more limited at 3 percent.
Latest data indicate that interventions have continued in the first quarter of 2010—leading to
a pick up in the size of the balance sheet. Pointing to strong fundamentals, and notably to a
projected return of current account surpluses as a share of GDP to double digit territory, staff
noted that the currency did not appear to be misaligned (Box 4)—a view shared by the
authorities. The authorities also indicated that the objective was, over time, to return to a free
floating currency regime. Staff endorsed this intention and noted that interventions, if any,
should be limited to resist disruptive short term movements in the effective exchange rate.

14
Box 3. Exchange Market Intervention and Foreign Currency Reserves
Given safe haven flows, periodically the SNB has been confronted with a choice of
accommodating the demand for Swiss francs or allowing the currency to appreciate.
The first option may not always be available in an environment of frequent low interest
rates and may endanger price stability, while the second reduces competitiveness of
Switzerland’s large export sector.
In this context, currency intervention by the SNB has been used from time to time to
smooth out disorderly fluctuations, resulting in large variations in the stock of foreign
currency reserves.1 In particular, since unconventional measures were introduced in
March, 2009 the SNB has more than doubled its stock of foreign currency reserves,
moving from about SFr 45 billion in 2007 to some SFr 95 billion by-end 2009, and to
SFr 125 billion by end-March 2010. While large in comparison to many other
industrial country central banks, a substantial amount of precautionary reserves can
make sense given the SNB’s LoLR responsibilities, and the relative size and exposure
of the banking system. At the end of 2009, the size and currency composition of
foreign currency reserves matched up well against the banking system’s net foreign
currency exposures. Also, while high, the stock of reserves did not appear out of line
with past trends in key metrics. However, it has since then risen, reflecting recent
interventions.

Some 69 episodes of currency intervention occurred between 1987 and 1995—with all but three interventions
undertaken jointly with the U.S. Federal Reserve and German Bundesbank. An explicit exchange rate target,
however, was implemented only once before 2009. In that episode (1978–79), a target of “well over 80 francs per
100 German marks” was set. Given the DM-Euro rate, this translates to an exchange rate of about SFr 1.57 per Euro
today or about 1.51 in real terms.

overstating competitiveness. The
Macrobalances approach reflects the difference between the actual current account and a
computed norm based upon structural factors and taking into account the fact that Switzerland
is a financial center. This method implies a small competitive advantage. The Equilibrium
Exchange Rate approach—which compares actual and estimated equilibrium real exchange
rates—indicates a minor competitive disadvantage. However, use of other real exchange rates
(e.g., ULC based) suggests that this may be overstated. On net, the average of the three
methodologies suggests that the currency could be slightly undervalued—consistent with the
authorities’ analysis. Thus, while uncertainty is high, the Swiss franc does not appear to be
misaligned. These results are broadly unchanged from a year ago. In particular, the possible
downside risks mentioned last year have not materialized—while current account surpluses
have been affected by the crisis, they have rebounded and are expected by staff, and the
authorities, to be back in double digit territory in the medium-run.

16
27.
There is agreement on the inherent tension between raising interest rates and the
appreciation pressures, and on subdued inflation prospects in the short-term (Figure 6).
While inflation and inflation expectations have picked up, staff and the authorities project
inflation in 2010–11 to remain under 1 percent given the sizable slack in the economy, muted
wage demands and pass-through from past currency appreciation.5 The authorities agreed that
while they saw current stance as incompatible with price stability in the medium-term,
uncertainty was high and it was too early to raise rates. Moreover, preliminary indications
suggested that lending standards have not materially deteriorated, and prudential tools were
seen as possibly useful if this risk materialized. The SNB is monitoring the situation and in
addition to its quarterly survey on credit standard, it is currently conducting a specific survey
on newly issued mortgages to households.
B. Fiscal Policies
28.
In spite of the recession and of the stimulus efforts, local authorities and the
federal government still registered surpluses in 2009. Since the start of the debt brake
in 2003–04, the general government balance had swung from a 2 percent of GDP deficit to a
surplus of about1 percent in 2008 (Tables 4 and 5). A surplus was still registered in 2009. At

economies soared during the recent
economic crisis, Swiss general government debt remained stable, and is about 30 percentage
points below the EU average. This solid fiscal position is reflected in a low risk premium,
similar to Germany.
29.
In 2010, general government balance is projected to swing into a small deficit.
While expected to respect the debt brake, federal government balance is estimated by the
government to swing into a small federal deficit—reflecting some lagged effects of the
recession on revenues, stimulus related measures, and a marginal impact of tax measures

(0.1 percent of GDP). Social security is expected to register a higher deficit (-0.6 percent of
GDP, after -0.2 percent in 2009), as a result of the labor market situation, and local
authorities to see their situation deteriorate.

Box 5: Switzerland’s Debt Brake Rule
The “debt brake” was introduced in 2003 after a series of large deficits in the 1990s. The
rule sets an annual upper limit on federal expenditure, based on projected cyclically-adjusted
federal revenues. This allows deficits when the economy is below potential and requires
surpluses in the opposite cases. The cyclical position of the economy is estimated using a
modified HP filter, with a lower smoothing parameter for the last two observations to correct
for the end-point bias problem.
Ex-post balances feed into a notional compensation account, used to ensure that
slippages do not accumulate and that nominal debt is contained. If a negative balance in
excess of 6 percent of expenditure builds up, it must be reduced below this threshold within
three years.
The debt brake rule was amended as of 2010 to include extraordinary one-off
expenditures. The balance between extraordinary expenditure and extraordinary revenue is
maintained in a separate notional account. Deficits in any given year have to be compensated
within six years. Application to lower levels of government is also being contemplated.

As it expects federal balance to turn into a small structural deficit in 2011, the
government expects some consolidation

31.
While respecting the debt brake rule is necessary, and given the fragile recovery
and expected tightening of monetary conditions, staff noted that consolidation should in
the short run be calibrated to what the rule requires. Less consolidation effort might be
needed in view of the consistent under-evaluation of some revenues in the recent years. In

particular, withholding tax revenues estimate—currently an average of the last 10 years
performance—could better reflect more recent outcomes. The authorities acknowledged this
possibility, but argued that withholding taxes were volatile and that they saw merits in
keeping an estimation method with a strong smoothing power.

A number of risks remain. The banks have largely written down their losses, shed
some SFr 1½ trillion in assets from mid-2007 to end-2009, de-risked their balance sheets,
and strengthened their funding and capital positions. At end-2009, Tier 1 capital ratios at
UBS and Credit Suisse stood at 15 and 16.3 percent respectively—an improvement of 4 and
3 pps over the year (Figure 8). Similarly,

requirements could increase funding costs.

Some weaknesses also linger in the insurance sector. Life insurance companies
have been affected by low interest rates and financial market developments, weakening the
financial health of some. The situation of non-life insurers has improved, reflecting better

20
investment outcomes and higher premiums. While the reinsurance sector has strengthened
through de-risking and capital increases, residual risks from securitized products remain.

D. Regulation and Supervision
38.
The authorities have undertaken a review of supervisory actions. FINMA, the
integrated supervisor, is drawing lessons from its underestimation of the systemic risks from
rapid on and off-balance sheet expansion that were building up within the Swiss financial
system before the crisis.7
39.
FINMA noted its progress in strengthening supervision. It has increased its focus
on major institutions, oversight of auditors, and governance and risk management practices.
It also has expanded cross border cooperation through supervisory colleges. Regarding
insurance supervision, FINMA has expanded application of the Swiss Solvency Test, and
will implement it fully in 2011.The authorities felt that resources were not a problem.
FINMA has increased its headcount to the projected 355 full-time equivalents, and was
creating a surplus that will be used to build a one year budgetary reserve fund.
There is broad agreement that the financial turmoil highlighted the risks posed by large
financial institutions—and the need to address the “too big to fail” problem. The
authorities acknowledged that support for UBS has exacerbated moral hazard and
undermined market discipline, and that the economy was exposed to disproportionate risks.
Against this background, a broad based advisory working group—made up of public and
private sector representatives—has issued on April 22nd an interim report outlining possible
measures to reduce the probability and the impact of failures.

See FINMA (2009), “Financial market crisis and financial market supervision”, and “FINMA Strategic
Objectives”.

21

While reiterating a broad support to retain the current universal bank model, the working
group identified as possible proposals imposing higher capital buffers, reinforcing liquidity
requirements, defining more stringent limit on single counterparty exposure, and requiring
organizational structures that would allow for orderly resolution. It also noted that contingent
capital instruments could play a useful role. These proposals were seen as more suitable than
new taxes. The working group will produce a final report in the summer of 2010.
40.

However modalities still have to be defined.


While the authorities are calling for meaningful progress on cross border resolution at
international level, the working group agreed that internal banking structures should
allow for a continuation of vital functions in case of a crisis, without necessitating a
rescue of the entire group.



With debates on risk weights, definitions of higher quality capital, and liquidity
requirements still unfinished at the international level, the authorities have indicated
they plan to re-examine all these issues depending on Basel outcomes and stressed
that they will maintain top-ups on forthcoming international standards. The working
group noted that capital add-ons should be adjusted to the degree of systemic
relevance, and signaled its intention to keep working on the progressiveness of such
add-ons. The mission felt that calibration of these requirements will determine their
capacity to effectively address moral hazard, and to discourage excessive risk-taking.



The working group stressed that while FINMA had a statutory basis for raising the
capital and liquidity requirements for banks of systemic relevance, a legislative
framework is needed for implementation. . The framework would define criteria for
systemic relevance, make additional requirements mandatory, and strengthen the
legal basis to address group structures. The mission noted that the framework should
ensure that regulators define requirements on economic grounds.

41.
Reforms of compensation frameworks at financial institutions have passed.
FINMA implemented minimum standards for remuneration schemes of financial institutions
with at least SFr 2 billion in capital. These guidelines—based on FSB principles—focus on
transparent remuneration schemes and aim at reducing the incentives to take inappropriate
risks that could threaten the stability of financial institutions. They give greater responsibility
for structuring and monitoring the effect of remuneration to the boards of directors of firms.
42.
As part of the construction of a macro-prudential framework, FINMA and the
SNB have deepened collaboration in order to address systemic risk. According to their
respective mandates, the SNB contributes to the stability of the financial system while
FINMA secures the smooth functioning of the financial markets. Both institutions saw an
overlap between micro (FINMA) and macro (SNB) supervision given the weight of the two

22
large banks, and recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding to reinforce their
collaboration on financial stability issues. This MoU provides for the creation of a high level
Steering Committee to set guidelines and priorities for this cooperation, sets out a mechanism
for SNB to request information from FINMA and to ask it to take measures within its area of
responsibilities, and foresees the possibility of joint, co-chaired, work. Beyond this improved
cooperation, however, the SNB considers it necessary to be able to independently examine
the two large banks and to implement prudential measures. Moreover, both institutions were
concerned that decisions to implement differential capital and liquidity requirements could be
legally challenged. In light of these concerns, which cannot be addressed by a MoU, further
consideration could be given to revising the legislative framework to design proper
allocation of responsibilities between SNB and FINMA, backed by respective powers that
are aligned with the mandates.
43.
As the proposal to overhaul the deposit insurance system has been rejected,
consideration is being given to make the 2008 deposit insurance reforms permanent.
With measures taken during the crisis set to expire by end-2010, the authorities proposed to
further strengthen the system by creating a partial ex-ante funding mechanism and by
shortening repayment periods. The authorities viewed this proposal as a good way to address
the current pro-cyclicality of the system. However, the proposal was rejected, given concerns
over costs from banks. Under these circumstances, consideration is now being given to
convert these temporary measures into law.

ANNEX I. POTENTIAL GROWTH IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE FINANCIAL CRISIS8
INTRODUCTION
Potential output is a key ingredient in the formulation of fiscal and monetary policies.
For example, Switzerland’s ‘debt brake rule’ requires an estimation of potential output9, as
expenditures are required to remain below a threshold determined by potential revenues.
Similarly, estimates of slack are crucial in determining SNB inflation projections.
The Swiss case is especially interesting given its large financial center and immigration
experience. Switzerland benefited from the expansion in global finance and lower risk
aversion, but has clearly suffered from the financial crisis. At the same time, it has tapped
into an expanded pool of labor in the run-up to the financial turbulence through large inflows
of highly skilled labor. This immigration has raised labor supply, and its quality, increasing
potential growth. The key question going forward is how the financial shock will impact
these two main growth drivers.
Research suggests extreme financial crises can permanently reduce potential output.10
Furceri and Mourougane (2009) find that financial crises in OECD countries permanently
reduce potential output by 1½ to 2½ percent on average, with the severity increasing with the
size of the crisis. Similarly, Koopman and Székely (2009) find that EU potential output
should fall by some 5 percent of GDP as a result of the financial crisis. The October 2009
WEO also concludes that based on past financial shocks, “real output in advanced economies
is unlikely to rebound to its pre-crisis trend”.
Potential growth may be affected through reductions in labor, capital and total factor
productivity (TFP) contributions. Potential labor supply may be hindered by a: (i) rise in
structural unemployment which increases the NAIRU; (ii) decrease in participation rates as
discouraged workers drop out of the labor force; (iii) loss of labor skills from prolonged
unemployment stays; and most importantly in the Swiss case (iv) reduction in net
immigration flows. Capital may contribute less to growth as scrapping rates may increase
because of reallocations and cost of capital increases renders some investment unprofitable.
Finally, the impact of the recession on productivity growth is in theory seen as ambiguous; in
particular, while some restructuration due to the crisis may enhance overall efficiency,
spending in innovation is pro-cyclical and likely to be affected by the rise in funding costs,
and as some areas of business have been changed or stopped.

See Furceri, D. and Mourougane A., (2009), “The Effect of Financial Crisis on Potential Output: New
Empirical Evidence from OECD Countries,” OECD Economics Department Working Papers No. 699;
Koopman G. and Székely I. (2009), “The Financial Crisis and Potential Growth: Policy Challenges for Europe,”
ECFIN Economic Brief Issue 3 June 2009.

40
With this in mind, we provide a preliminary estimate of Swiss potential output based on
a production function approach. Potential growth is estimated to have fallen to about
1¼ percent in 2009. Looking ahead, there is wide uncertainty. We estimate that potential
growth would slowly recover, mainly because of slower employment growth associated with
a decrease in immigration, before reaching its long term average of 1¾ percent.
PAST EXPERIENCE WITH FINANCIAL CRISIS
At first blush, the 1990s recession might appear to provide a good benchmark in
analyzing the possible impact on potential growth.

On average, real GDP grew at an annual rate of 1.7 percent between 1976 and 2008.
However, growth has been uneven, with recessions at the beginning of each decade followed
by recoveries of differing speeds. While most recessions were mild, the 1990s recession
associated with a real estate bust and ensuing banking crisis was longer and more severe
(Box 1 in staff report). As demonstrated by simple HP filtering methods, as well as by a PF
approach, this shock had a permanent impact on potential output.
The 1990s recession pushed RGDP off
its long-term trend...

41
Although the 1990’s Swiss recession provides insights and had been similar to what is
unfolding in many other industrial countries with concurrent credit and housing crises,
the current Swiss slowdown appears to be less severe. The crisis during the 90s that
originated in a real estate sector had weakened corporate balance sheets and households
wealth, and set off a crisis at the regional banks. In contrast, during the current recession, the
real estate sector has been stable, corporate and household balance sheet has been relatively
solid, and the domestic banking sector has been sound.
FINANCIAL SHOCKS AND POTENTIAL GROWTH
The financial sector has been a strong driver
of growth in recent years. Financial
intermediation accounted for 7.3 percent of total
value added (10.3 percent including insurance
and pensions) and 6 percent of employment. In
terms of growth rates, financial intermediation
directly contributed about 1 percentage point to
Swiss real GDP growth between 2004 and 2007.

Financial turbulence can impact potential growth through two channels.

The financial shock directly lowers intermediation value added through a reduction in
fees and commissions, and interest income. In this regard, financial sector value added, as
a percentage of total value added has declined by 2 percentage points since 2007.11 This is

With regard to the indirect impact, there
is evidence that fast growing sectors tend

During 2004–07, the financial sector grew by 4 percentage points per year faster than the rest of the economy.
A drop in financial sector growth rates to the economy-wide average would have implied a decline of about 0.4
of a percentage point in overall growth.

growth to the extent that overall credit availability declines. However, in contrast to many
other countries, the impact of the financial crisis on credit flow in Switzerland has been
limited so far and credit has continued to expand. This is because the financial crisis has
affected mainly the external operations of large Swiss banks, while banks with a domestic
focus (and the large banks’ domestic operations) have been left relatively unscathed.
PRODUCTION FUNCTION APPROACH
The production function approach maps input factors into a potential growth estimate.
Over the 2004–08, growth was about 2.8 percent, with labor, capital stock, and total factor
productivity (TFP) growth contributing approximately 0.4, 1.0, and 1.4 percentage points,
respectively. Given the absence of major imbalances and dissimilarities with the 1990s
recession (e.g., absence of credit and housing shocks), we estimate how the recession may
impact factor inputs—and thus potential growth.
A. Labor supply
Reflecting higher unemployment and hence a decline in foreign workers flows,
employment growth is projected to slow down in the short run. After growing rapidly
prior to the recession, employment stagnated since the second half of 2008 and
unemployment surged. Still, the growth of foreign workers decelerated somehow but
remained strong during 2009 – resulting in a still strong positive contribution of labor to
potential growth in 2009. Looking forward, with a large labor hoarding, the inflow of foreign
workers, and hence labor supply, should be curbed in the short run. In addition, we expect a
somehow smaller contribution of labor growth from residents – as higher unemployment may
weigh on labor force participation, while prolonged stays in unemployment increase skill
mismatch. In the medium run, we assume that the annual growth rate of migrant worker
inflows will decline –from 4 percent in the booming years to 2 percent. As a result, labor
growth is expected to decline to about 0.8 percent during 2010–11 – resulting in labor
contributions close to the ones estimated by the SNB (0.5 percent) - before gradually
increasing to its long run rate.
B. Capital stock
Investment is expected to remain muted in the short run. Lower employment growth (i.e.,
higher capital to labor ratio), and reduction in the availability and higher cost of credit
combined with increased risk aversion should reduce planned investment. Substantial slack
in capacity utilization would also tend to support this view.
C. Total Factor Productivity
Going forward, we forecast that overall TFP will decline moderately. The financial crisis
is likely to reduce the productivity growth in the financial sector and economy wide as the
financial sector alters its business models, some innovative activities decline, and positive
spillovers decline with the lower global growth. However, considering that the size of the
financial sector is only 10 percent of total output, and that the impact on domestic credit has
been small, we expect that the decline in TFP will be modest. We assume that TFP will grow

43
at about 0.5 percent and then steadily returns to its long-time trend of 0.8 percent, but
recognize the large uncertainty associated with projecting TFP following a financial crisis.13
D. Aggregated impacts on potential growth
Overall, the potential growth would appear to have declined to about 1 ¼ percent
in 2009–11. Combining the effect of employment, capital, and TFP, we estimate that
potential growth will be around 1 ¼ percent, followed by a gradual rebound to its long term
average growth of 1 ¾ percent.
Uncertainty around the estimates is
exceptionally high. In times of
significant regime change—as in the
current circumstances—there are
obvious risks that past observations can
no longer provide valid economic
inferences. Thus, while our analysis
based on past episodes and on an
evaluation of labor, capital and TFP
behavior, can shed some light on the
possible direction of structural changes,
there is a large degree of imprecision.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

The exchange rate of the Swiss franc is determined by supply and demand in the foreign
exchange market and is currently classified as a floating regime. The Swiss National Bank
reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market. All settlements are made at free
market rates. Switzerland maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions, except for restrictions in place for
security reasons notified to the Fund pursuant to Decision No. 144-(52/51).
On April 20, 2010, Switzerland notified the IMF of the exchange restrictions that have been
imposed against certain countries, individuals, and entities, in accordance with relevant UN
Security Council resolutions and EU regulations.

3

In accordance with UN Security Council resolutions, restrictions are currently in place with
respect to specific individuals and entities associated with the former government of Liberia,
Iraq, Osama bin Laden, the Taliban, and the Al-Qaïda network, specific individuals and
entities posing a threat to international peace and security in Côte d’Ivoire, in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC), impeding the peace process in Sudan, engaged in the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea's (DPRK) Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD)–
related programs, ban on financing and financial services related to the provision of arms and
related materiel to Lebanon, specific individuals and entities involved in the nuclear and/or
ballistic missile programs of the Islamic Republic of Iran, financing and financial services
related to the provision of arms and related materiel, and to military activities in Somalia, and
Eritrea. The lists of individuals and entities against which financial sanctions are in force are
based on the decisions by the competent UN Security Council sanctions committee and are
amended regularly.
In accordance with EU regulations, restrictions are currently in place with respect to specific
individuals associated with the previous government of the former Republic of Yugoslavia,
Zimbabwe, Myanmar, specific individuals and entities associated with the government of
Belarus, specific individuals associated with the military government of Guinea as well as
financial services and financing related to the provision of arms and related materiel to Guinea.
The lists of targeted individuals are identical to the list in the corresponding EU regulations.

II. Switzerland: Statistical Issues
Switzerland’s economic and financial statistics are adequate for surveillance purposes.
Switzerland generally publishes timely economic statistics and posts most of the data and the
underlying documentation on the internet. In June 1996, Switzerland subscribed to the Fund’s
Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), and its metadata are currently posted on the
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. Switzerland is in full observance of SDDS
requirements, and it is availing itself of the SDDS’s flexibility options on dissemination of
production index data (for periodicity and timeliness) and of wages and earnings data (for
periodicity).
However, a number of statistical gaps and deficiencies remain, mainly reflecting a lack of
resources and the limited authority of the Federal Statistical Office (BfS) to request
information:


reliable general government finance statistics appear with considerable lags, mainly due
to delays in compiling fiscal accounts at the level of cantons and communes;



pension statistics are published with a long lag;



GDP by industry appears with a considerable lag.

To address deficiencies, the authorities are taking or intend to take the following steps:
From July 2006, the SNB conducts the monthly survey on the cost of borrowing. In January
2010, it started to publish data from this survey. Data on household wealth—encompassing
both financial and real estate assets and not only, as was the case before, financial assets—was
published for the first time in 2009. In 2009, the SNB revised its credit survey, among other
things, to better reflect loans granted to the service sector. In conjunction with the SNB’s
centennial, long-run historical time series covering monetary aggregates, capital markets, the
SNB balance sheet, and the banking sector have been published. Under the agreement with
SFBC on reciprocal exchange of data, the SNB has since 2007, been collecting the new capital
adequacy statement information, in accordance with Basel II. Since 2007, the SNB has
conducted surveys of Liechtenstein-based companies when preparing its balance of payments
and international investment position. In order to gain information on the effects of the
financial crisis on domestic bank lending, the SNB has been collecting qualitative data on the
lending policies of about 20 banks since the first quarter of 2008. The results of the survey
complement the quantitative data obtained from existing statistics. This supplementary
quarterly survey is only temporary and not published.
Annual national accounts were upgraded in 2003 to the European System of Accounts 1995
(ESA95) and with the release of the Q4 2004 data, the Secretariat for Economics (SECO)
revised accordingly its quarterly national account estimates. SECO started publishing in
March 2006 a quarterly production account and since October 2008 the quarterly income

5
approach of GDP (at current prices). The main innovations in the new national accounts were
in investment (with detail on information and communications technology), private and public
consumption (hospitals were transferred to the private sector), and the use of chain price
indices (without adjustment for quality).
In 2004, a statistical cooperation agreement was concluded with the EU as part of Bilateral II
for the harmonization of several Swiss statistics with EU standards. In 2010 the agreement will
be updated.
The Federal Finance Administration has revamped fiscal statistics with the adoption of the
Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001, the reform of the accounting standards for
cantons and communes (Harmonisiertes Rechnungslegungsmodell der Kantone HRM2) and
the introduction of full accrual budgeting and accounting at the level of the federal government
(Neues Rechnungsmodell Bund NAM) along the lines of the International Public Sector
Accounting Standards (IPSAS). Figures according to the new accounting standards have been
produced for the federal government (NAM) for 2008 and for some cantons (HRM2) for 2009.
Figures according to GFSM2001 have been reported beginning in 2009. A ROSC mission on
fiscal transparency took place during January 16–29, 2009.
Quarterly balance of payments and international investment position data are compiled by
the SNB and meet international standards. However, monetary gold transactions relating to
sales of gold reserves not required for monetary policy purposes have not been correctly
reflected in the balance of payments. For legal reasons, and until the distribution of the
proceeds of gold sales between the SNB and the Federal Department of Finance was concluded
in February 2005, the proceeds of the gold sales not needed for monetary purposes were
considered as part of the official reserves in the balance of payments. After that date, they
appear in the position “other assets of the SNB” in the balance of payments.
Switzerland participates in the Coordinated Compilation Exercise for Financial Soundness
Indicators (FSIs). Data and metadata on a benchmark set of indicators of the soundness of the
financial system (for year-end 2008) has been posted on the IMF website.
The authorities have made progress in completing the implementation of the FATF
AML/CFT recommendations. The federal law implementing the revised FATF
Recommendations was adopted by the Swiss Parliament in October 2008 and entered into
force on February 1, 2009. Supervisory ordinances on the private insurances, gaming, banking
and non banking sectors have also been adopted, and a revised banking association due
diligence code has come into force in mid-2008. The Swiss authorities last reported on these
reforms to the FATF in October 2009.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Switzerland
On May, 14, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Switzerland.1
Background
Although Switzerland was hard hit by the global crisis, the 1.5 percent contraction in 2009
compares favorably with most industrial countries. After a year long decline in real GDP, the
economy exited the recession in mid-2009. While this resilience was unexpected given the
origins of the global recession and structure of the Swiss economy, it can be linked to strong
fundamentals and to supportive policies. In particular, households and firms were in a
comfortable financial condition before the crisis; Switzerland did not experience a boom-bust
credit and real estate cycle; and private consumption continued to be supported by immigration
flows and dynamic revenues, in a context of negative inflation and muted adjustment on the labor
market. Overall, export oriented and financial sectors were significantly impacted by the global
downturn but most domestic oriented activities held up relatively well.
In response to the crisis, the authorities took a series of actions in a broad range of policy areas.
The SNB continued to implement an expansionary monetary policy,

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with
officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
leaving the 3-month Libor target range at 0 to 0.75 percent since March 2009 and actively
pursuing quantitative easing measures, including foreign exchange intervention to limit upward
pressure on the Swiss franc. In the fiscal area, the authorities allowed automatic stabilizers to
fully play and enacted the last of three stimulus packages, focused on public infrastructure
investment as well as labor market measures that increased short time work benefits.
Financial sector measures also helped to stabilize financial markets and reduce systemic risk. In
2008, the authorities strengthened capital requirements for the two largest banks, transferred
illiquid assets of one large bank to a “bad bank”, and expanded deposit insurance coverage. In
2009, they tightened capital requirements for cantonal and regional banks, reduced by about one
third the risk of the StabFund, and set new remuneration guidelines for large financial
institutions. Moreover, authorities created a “Too big to Fail” working group that is examining
ways to address the moral hazard issue, and large contingent liabilities, associated with a
financial sector with large institutions. It will produce a final report in the summer of 2010.
Finally, guidelines for cooperation on financial stability issues between the SNB and the financial
supervisor (FINMA) have been clarified in a revised memorandum of understanding.
The authorities are now contemplating how to exit from current accommodative stance. Since
December the SNB has only prevented excessive appreciation in the Swiss franc against the
euro—and has signaled its intention to normalize rates over time. While the fiscal impulse should
be positive in 2010, the government expects some consolidation in 2011–13 in line with debt
brake fiscal rule.
While leading indicators suggest that the recovery is ongoing and becoming broader based,
uncertainty remains. Economic growth is expected to increase to 1.6 percent in 2010—and
strengthen further to 1.8 percent in 2011, as exports and financial sector activity improve.
Inflation has turned positive, but is expected to remain under 1 percent, given the effects of past
appreciation of the currency, and the remaining slack in the economy. However, there are large
uncertainties related to global developments.
Executive Board Assessment

Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They commended the authorities for
Switzerland’s strong macroeconomic fundamentals and pro-active policy response which
contributed to the resilience of the economy during the global crisis. Economic recovery is
ongoing although uncertainties relating to external developments persist. In the absence of
near-term threats to price and public finance stability, Directors supported a cautious exit
from the current accommodative fiscal and monetary stance.
Directors considered the current expansionary monetary policy to be appropriate. They
welcomed the liquidity support measures recently taken by the Swiss National Bank in
response to renewed stress. Directors agreed that the main monetary policy challenge will be
to normalize interest rates while exiting exchange rate interventions. Most Directors
supported the view that the Swiss franc is not misaligned and that the current real

3
appreciation pressure mostly reflects a strengthening of fundamentals. Directors endorsed the
authorities’ intention to return to a free floating currency regime and most Directors stressed
that any intervention should be limited to resisting disruptive pressures. Directors
recommended that interest rates should not be raised prematurely and that prudential tools
may be best suited to address any deterioration in lending standards.
Directors commended the authorities for their strong fiscal performance. They noted that
prudent fiscal policies, which also result in low debt, should be maintained given the
potential liabilities relating to the financial sector and the medium-term effects of population
ageing. In light of the risks to growth, a few Directors considered that the fiscal consolidation
envisaged by the authorities should be calibrated precisely to what is needed to respect the
debt brake rule.
Directors commended the authorities for their financial stabilization measures and
encouraged them to preserve the momentum to reinforce financial stability. Persistent sizable
contingent liabilities and remaining risks to the financial system require continued close
monitoring, and Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to strengthen supervision. Going
forward, the effectiveness of the Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) could be
further enhanced through an expansion of its in-house capabilities and measures to reinforce
the independence of its auditors. Directors welcomed steps taken by the authorities to prevent
the use of the financial system to avoid tax compliance and their commitment to implement
internationally agreed standards.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to address the “too big to fail” (TBTF) problem
as well as the preliminary report and recommendations of the TBTF working group. They
broadly supported the recommendations to impose higher capital buffers and reinforce
liquidity requirements for institutions posing a systemic risk. Directors encouraged the
authorities to contemplate measures, including simplifications in the organization and legal
structure of large banking institutions, to help improve crisis resolution.
Directors welcomed the new SNB/FINMA Memorandum of Understanding, which reinforces
collaboration on financial stability issues. They saw scope for further clarification of
responsibilities and stressed the need to align legal powers with respective mandates.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's views and
analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or countries) concerned, PINs
are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with member countries, of its surveillance
of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member
countries with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of
general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Rene Weber, Executive Director for Switzerland and
Marcel Peter, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
May 14, 2010
1.
On behalf of the Swiss authorities, we would like to thank staff for once again
presenting a well-researched staff report that provides a thorough, objective, and
insightful analysis of the macro-economic situation. The policy dialogue has been
excellent and we share staff’s opinion on the challenges going forward in most respects.
We also welcome the candid policy recommendations, which add considerable value to
our domestic policy discussions.
2.
We agree with staff that Switzerland will experience a gradual recovery after a
shallow recession. Domestic demand has held up especially well throughout the recent
crisis period, which could not be entirely expected from the outset. We are pleased to
note that, for the first three months of 2010, exports have picked up again, growing at 4.3
percent. Industry surveys point to further optimism for the coming months. In the labour
market, we observe an earlier than expected drop in the unemployment rate. While we
remain cautiously optimistic, our current GDP growth forecast is in line with staff’s.
Monetary Policy
3. Our authorities fully share the staff’s appraisal of the Swiss monetary policy stance.
The challenge of normalizing interest rates while exiting intervention has become even
greater following the recent pressure on the Swiss franc due to global financial market
uncertainty. The appreciation of the Swiss franc implies a tightening of monetary
conditions but has negative side effects to the extent that it reduces the room for
maneuver for normalizing interest rates. This situation is particularly unwelcome given
the acceleration in mortgage lending activity. There is thus a serious risk that appreciation
may become a source of disequilibrium between economic sectors.
4.
The current monetary stance is very loose, and there is a need to normalize interest
rates over time. The repo rate at 0.05 percent is close to zero, and the 3-month Libor, at
about 0.25 percent, is at its desired level within the target range (which is set at 0 percent
and 0.75 percent since March 2009). The latest inflation forecast published by the Swiss
National Bank (SNB) shows that price stability is not threatened in the short run.
Inflation should remain contained in 2010 and 2011. However, the current expansionary
monetary policy cannot be maintained without compromising medium to long-term price
stability. Assuming no policy change, inflation is forecast to exceed 2 percent by 2012.
Such a situation is not compatible with what the SNB considers as price stability.
5.
However, as inflation will not be tolerated, neither will be deflation. The global
economy is still fragile and large uncertainties remain. The recent events are a proof of it.
Should external shocks persist and appreciation pressures intensify, the danger of
deflation cannot entirely be ruled out. As a consequence, the SNB will continue to act
decisively to prevent an excessive appreciation of the Swiss franc.

Financial Stability
6.
Our authorities are well aware that the reform momentum for strengthening the
domestic framework underpinning financial stability needs to be maintained. In
particular, capital and liquidity standards will continue to include substantial add-ons to
internationally agreed requirements, reflecting the systemic importance of large and
complex financial institutions for the economy. In addition, the organization and the legal
structure of large banks should be modified in such a way that, in a crisis, the authorities
will be able to preserve those functions of a bank that are essential for the real economy
and are not forced to rescue the bank in its entirety.
7.
There is a clear agenda for further strengthening financial market regulation and
supervision. An expert committee commissioned by the government is currently
considering the challenges posed by ”too big to fail“ institutions for Switzerland in depth
and has already published an interim report. This report outlines the thrust of further
action on the regulatory side, which the government has endorsed. The core elements are
increases in the capital, liquidity, and risk diversification requirements that should reduce
the likelihood of insolvency of a systemically important bank. In its final report expected
for end-August 2010, the committee will put forward an overall package of measures,
including concrete proposals for changes to the Banking Law.
8.
Our Swiss authorities are fully supportive of a strong financial center that serves the
interests of the entire economy. Given the economic importance of the financial sector—
the financial sector generates about one tenth of Switzerland’s overall value added and
contributes nearly six percent to total employment—the government has reviewed the
strategic positioning of the financial centre and set the course for future financial market
policy. A report entitled “Strategic directions for Switzerland’s financial market policy”
has been published, proposing measures to enhance competitiveness and market access,
and mitigate risks. However, public policy is to be limited to assuring a conducive and
coherent regulatory and supervisory framework. To this end, Switzerland is committed to
implementing agreed international standards and it will conduct a peer review by the
Financial Stability Board in 2011.
Fiscal Policy
9.
Fiscal developments have been generally positive. The general government
accounts again registered a surplus in 2009 amounting to 0.7 percent of GDP, which is
remarkable under the circumstances and given expansionary fiscal policy. At the general
government level, discretionary measures and automatic stabilizers have provided and
will provide a combined fiscal stimulus of around 1.6 percent of GDP in 2009 and of 1.3
percent of GDP in 2010. These estimates are based on a survey carried out by the
authorities in 2009 and are higher than staff estimates. The debt-to-GDP ratio declined
further to below 40 percent.
10. The fiscal outlook for 2010 is somewhat worse, with all levels of government
turning into deficit. Our authorities currently project a general government deficit of 1.2

3
percent of GDP, slightly higher than the staff’s projections. Yet the cantons,
municipalities, and social security institutions are expected to narrow their deficits from
2011 onwards. Our authorities project a faster recovery in cantonal finances than staff,
mainly on account of lower projected growth in expenditure. Gross debt levels are
expected to decrease not only at the federal level but also at sub-national levels, where
more and more cantons are adopting fiscal rules similar to the debt-brake. From 2011
onwards, a consolidation effort of 0.3 percent of GDP is needed at the federal level to
meet the requirements of the debt brake.
11. As staff notes, the deterioration in the federal fiscal balance is mainly due to the
implementation of several tax reforms that will result in annual structural revenue losses
of roughly 1.6 billion Swiss francs according to the latest estimates. Staff argues that
revenues have been consistently underestimated in recent years, pointing to a lesser need
for fiscal consolidation in the short run. Our authorities conclude that potential revenues
have not increased significantly. They remain firmly committed not to compromise the
consolidation efforts of previous years and will implement the fiscal rule consistently,
thereby ensuring a balanced budget over the medium term.
