IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Malta

On January 6, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV Consultation1 with Malta and endorsed the staff appraisal on lapseof-time basis.2
Malta’s economy is growing strongly. Real GDP growth has been one of the highest in the
euro area since the beginning of the crisis, supported by vibrant domestic demand, large
infrastructure projects, and a stable banking sector. Unemployment is at historical lows and
labor participation is increasing. The current account remains in surplus and the external
position is broadly in line with fundamentals.
The outlook is strong. Growth is expected to remain solid in 2016–17, driven initially by
domestic demand and later by a gradual recovery of external demand. Inflation is projected
to pick up gradually due to the positive output gap and higher imported inflation on account
of the weaker the exchange rate. The current account surplus will likely persist.
The authorities have taken action on multiple fronts. Regarding fiscal policy, an independent
fiscal advisory council is now operational. The authorities have been reducing the fiscal
deficit and debt, and are making progress on the restructuring of state owned enterprises. As
regards the financial sector, regulatory and supervisory frameworks have been strengthened

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

in several areas. On structural policies, they took steps to increase labor participation,
improve the judicial system and reform the energy sector.
Executive Board Assessment
Malta has remained resilient in the face of global shocks and the economy is growing
strongly, helped by policy initiatives. The reliance on domestic funding and the relatively
well diversified economy have helped preserve stability. Growth accelerated to 5.1 percent in
the first half of 2015 and unemployment is at historic lows.
The outlook is strong and risks are balanced. Growth is expected to remain solid in 2016–17,
driven initially by domestic demand and later by a gradual recovery in external demand.
Inflation is projected to gradually pick up with the positive output gap and the exchange rate
pass-through. The external position remains broadly in line with fundamentals despite high
uncertainty driven by volatile components of the current account. While, downside risks
include slower global growth, delays in implementation of structural reforms, fiscal
slippages, and regulatory and tax changes elsewhere, upside risks stem from increased energy
efficiency and further increases in labor participation. The future of migration flows, the
majority of which coming from other EU countries, remains uncertain.
Strong migration inflows boost potential output. Large inflows since the early 2000, mostly
originating from other EU countries, have offset Malta’s declining working age population
and raised potential growth. Refugee inflows have also been significant, but have declined
since 2013. The planned agency for refugees should help enhance coordination between
institutions to ensure their smooth integration into the labor market and society.
The challenge is to preserve high and stable growth. Given uncertainty regarding the global
recovery, volatile migration flows, and ongoing efforts to enhance competitiveness by euro
area neighbors, raising potential output in a sustainable manner will depend on i) building
fiscal buffers to cope with adverse shocks; ii) maintaining financial sector stability and
providing financing for growth; and iii) sustaining structural reforms.
The authorities’ proposed pace of fiscal consolidation for 2016–18 is appropriate. The deficit
reduction is continuing, despite rapidly growing current expenditures, supported by revenue
measures and stronger-than-expected revenues. The authorities aim to reduce the overall
deficit to -0.2 percent of GDP in 2018, but measures beyond 2016 are not well specified at
this stage.
Fast growth in current expenditures makes targeted debt reduction challenging, particularly
beyond 2016. With the expected growth moderation towards its long-term trend, the fast
growth of sticky current expenditures makes the planned consolidation difficult. To ensure
meeting the fiscal targets, additional expenditure measures should be considered. In this

3
context, the authorities should ensure that public sector wage negotiations will not result in
increases higher than inflation and complete the ongoing and planned spending reviews.
With the output gap closed, revenues in excess of targets should primarily be used to build
fiscal buffers. Fiscal risks from SoEs should also be disclosed and managed in a consolidated
manner.
Pension measures introduced in the 2016 budget are steps in the right direction. These
measures aim to address both adequacy and sustainability of the pension system. Given that
Malta ranks second worst in the euro area in its age related spending increases, the authorities
should ensure that these measures lead to an increase in the effective retirement age and to
higher participation in the voluntary third pillar to support disposable income at old age.
Efforts to increase the efficiency of health care spending should help support pension
reforms.
Ongoing efforts to strengthen fiscal governance and institutions should continue. Continued
efforts to strengthen fiscal institutions and the budgetary framework are encouraged to
increase efficiency, transparency, and ultimately avoid fiscal slippages. Efforts to link
sectoral budget allocations and any new public spending to medium-term plans and outcomes
are welcome and will help track the impact of reforms and their medium-term fiscal
implications.
The banking system remains resilient. Banks are well capitalized, profitable, and liquid.
Solvency and liquidity of core domestic banks and other peer banks remain above the
minimum regulatory requirements, and their profitability is above the euro area average.
But nonperforming loans (NPLs) and the cost of credit remain high. The increase in the
coverage ratio and the national authorities’ consideration of using further Pillar II measures
to reduce NPLs are welcome, and further increases in coverage ratios as envisaged is
appropriate. The completion of the ongoing work on insolvency legislation, aiming to reduce
court proceedings time and enhance contract enforcement, should help improve NPL
resolution.
Given the large size of the financial sector and ongoing regulatory and supervisory changes,
continued policy actions are needed to boost resilience of the banks. Policies should focus
on: (i) a swift implementation of bank action plans to ensure a level playing field and sound
supervision; (ii) following the transposition of BRRD into national law and the establishment
of a separate resolution unit in the MFSA, developing bank recovery plans and collecting of
contributions for the resolution fund; (iii) strengthening the contingency framework,
including by reducing the share of special contributions to DCS fund, (iv) introducing
additional precautionary macroprudential measures, given the rapid increases in mortgages
and pick up in real estate prices, and (iv) continuing to coordinate closely and ensure robust
implementation of the AML/CFT framework in line with the 2012 FATF standard.
The authorities’ request for a Financial Sector Assessment Program Update is very timely, as

4
the last FSAP was conducted in 2003.
The structural reform priorities, as outlined in the national strategy program, are appropriate,
but momentum would need to continue. Raising potential growth requires that measures
translate into outcomes. In particular: (i) measures to enhance female participation have been
paying off and support the potential growth; (ii) linking measures to achieve the national
education strategy goals to budget allocations is welcome; (iii) judicial reforms, including the
focus on insolvency regime are welcome but need to be complemented by efforts to track and
demonstrate the results, such as conducting an impact assessment, and (iv) ongoing efforts to
improve access to credit, such as NPL resolution, judicial reforms, planned credit registry,
and multi trading facility by the stock exchange will improve growth financing. The planned
development bank (to facilitate SME and infrastructure financing) should be effectively
supervised and have strong governance.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
December 21, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Malta has remained resilient in the face of global shocks and the economy is
growing strongly. The reliance on domestic funding and the relatively well-diversified
economy have helped preserve stability. Boosted by large scale infrastructure
investments, low oil prices, a weaker euro, direct income tax cuts, and recent reform
efforts, growth accelerated to 5.1 percent in the first half of 2015 and unemployment is
at historic lows.
Policies should focus on sustaining high and stable growth in the medium term, which
will require pushing ahead with reforms on multiple fronts. Key priorities include:


Building fiscal buffers. The deficit reduction is continuing and the pace of fiscal
consolidation for 2016–18 is appropriate, but measures beyond 2016 are not well
specified at this stage. With the output gap closed, revenues in excess of targets
should be used primarily to build fiscal buffers. It is also important to disclose, and
manage risks to public finances from state owned enterprises (SOEs) in a
consolidated manner. Pension reform measures in the 2016 budget will make the
pension system more sustainable for now, but more measures will likely be
necessary to ensure long run sustainability.



Maintaining financial sector stability. Bank regulatory and supervisory frameworks
have recently been strengthened. Priorities to preserve financial stability include: i)
completing asset quality reviews and the associated action plans; ii) cleaning up bad
loans; iii) more progress on contingency planning; and iv) considering additional
macroprudential policies. All of this needs to be complemented by better access to
credit, especially for SMEs.



Raising potential growth. This requires sustaining structural reforms to increase
labor participation, upgrading skill levels and improving the business environment
by increasing the efficiency of the judicial system. And energy reforms should ensure
reducing energy costs.

CONTEXT AND OUTLOOK
1.
Malta has remained resilient in the face of global shocks. Despite its high degree of
openness to trade (about 300 percent of GDP) and presence of international banks (about
333 percent of GDP), Malta has been insulated from global financial market turmoil because of
its reliance on domestic funding and its relatively well diversified economy. The government has
used this opportunity to enact timely reforms— on energy, labor markets, the judicial system—
and fiscal consolidation. These efforts along with low oil prices and a weaker euro have
supported growth and employment.

Vibrant domestic demand supports the economy. Large scale infrastructure
investments, strong labor market conditions, as evidenced by low unemployment, low oil prices,
a weaker euro, direct income tax cuts, and recent reform efforts support investment and
consumption. As a result, growth accelerated to 5.1 percent during the first half of 2015, from
3.6 percent in 2014. A weaker euro has provided support for exchange rate sensitive sectors, but
the contribution of exports to growth remained weak, as large financial flows and special
purpose entities have been blurring the underlying export dynamics. The current account
remained positive at 3 ¼ percent in 2014. While the output gap has closed and is at a positive
territory, inflation remains moderate (1¼ percent), partly due to low oil prices and electricity tariff
cuts. The ECB’s QE has reduced term spreads, helping to support financial conditions.

The outlook is strong.


Growth, driven initially by domestic demand and later by a gradual recovery in external
demand, is projected to remain robust at 4¼ and 3½ percent in 2015 and 16,
respectively, thanks to energy related infrastructure projects, increasing female labor
force participation, low oil prices, and a reduction in income taxes.1 The ECB’s asset
purchase program has supported exports through a weaker euro, lowered borrowing
costs for the government, and likely contributed to the recent increase in real estate and
equity prices. With low yields, corporate bond financing has also picked up. Over the
medium-term potential output is estimated at about 3 percent, higher than the euro area
and Malta's historical average (Selected Issues (SIP), Chapter I), supported by higher
female labor participation, strong migration flows, mostly from the EU, and improved
energy efficiency. 2



Strong net migration inflows boost potential output (SIP, Chapter I). Malta has
experienced large inflows since the early 2000s. These inflows, the majority of which
originate from other EU countries, have offset Malta’s declining working age population
and raised potential growth, though their future remains uncertain (Box 1). Refugee
inflows have also been significant, but have declined since 2013. The planned agency for

1

Energy sector projects include construction of a regasification plant and conversion of the Delimara power plant
to natural gas. The interconnector to Sicily was completed and is currently in use. Personal income tax of
29 percent applicable to those who earn sixty thousand euro or less was reduced to 25 percent in 2015. The 2016
budget includes an additional measure, entailing raising tax-exemption thresholds for low income earners that
did not benefit from the 2015 reduction in the top income tax rate.
2

Projections for potential output assume an increase of labor force participation of about 6 percentage points by
2020, from its 2014 level and a population growth of 0.1 percent. Recent favorable trends in female participation
and migration flows are built in the baseline projections, with high net migration flows, in particular from EU,
offsetting the impact of aging population. Furthermore, estimates assume a slightly higher contribution of
capital, compared to post-crisis period, to account for the impact of energy projects on investment and slightly
higher productivity growth, resulting from improved energy efficiency.

refugees should help enhance coordination between institutions to ensure smooth
integration of refugees into the labor market and society.


Inflation is projected to gradually pick up, at a faster rate than the euro area. Upward
pressures, including from the positive output gap and strong labor market conditions,
and the exchange rate pass-through are expected to be dampened by the pass-through
of lower global oil prices and low euro area inflation (Table 1).



The current account is expected to remain in surplus, and the external position is
broadly in line with fundamentals. While large energy related projects should reduce the
current account surplus in the nearUnit Labor Costs
term, it should gradually improve on

account (Annex III).

Risks to the outlook are balanced (Risk Assessment Matrix). In the medium-term,
downside risks—of weaker global growth, a gradual loss of competitiveness due to continued
increase in unit labor costs, slow progress in structural and judicial reforms and regulatory and
tax changes elsewhere—are balanced with the upside risk of increased energy efficiency and
higher labor force participation. Fiscal slippages beyond 2016 and a rise in public debt could also
lead to higher financing costs, crowding out private investment. Risks from financial market
contagion in the euro area appear relatively limited, given that international banks do not have
direct linkages to the domestic economy and core domestic banks fund themselves domestically
(Box 3). There is also uncertainty around future net migration inflows, the majority of which
emanates from other EU countries.
5.
Contagion risks from adverse developments in Greece appear low, given limited
direct trade and financial links. Like all euro area members, Malta is exposed to Greece
through euro area institutions, such as the ECB, the European Financial Stability Facility, and the
European Investment Bank (about 2.2 percent of GDP). A Greek subsidiary reduced its balance
sheet rapidly in 2015Q1 (from 17 percent of GDP to 9 percent of GDP) with limited impact on the
rest of the financial sector—its claims on the deposit guarantee scheme are fully funded (about
0.9 percent of GDP).

Authorities’ views
The authorities broadly agreed with staff on the outlook and balance of risks. They noted
that upside risks stem from faster than expected acceleration in domestic demand (through
higher private consumption and inventories), while downside risks stem largely from weaker
global growth, given substantial trade and financial links. The authorities viewed the domesticdominated investor base as a mitigating factor in case of renewed turmoil in international
financial markets.

Malta has received large net migration inflows
in the last 15 years. Except for 2008 and 2011,
migration has had a larger contribution than
demographics to population change, explaining
more than 65 percent of population growth since
2000. Absent these inflows, the working age
population would have shrunk slightly, instead of
rising by 3 percent since 2004. 1 Migrant inflows
comprise two groups: skilled workers -mostly from
EU- and asylum seekers – mostly from Sub
Saharan Africa and the Middle East.

Sources: Eurostat
Skilled workers from the EU are the dominant
migrant group, employed mostly in service sectors. Since the EU accession in 2004, the share of EU
migrants increased from 1 to more than 6 percent of total employment. The main reasons for this increase
are high demand for skilled labor, a relatively flexible domestic labor market, and the use of English
language. Foreign workers –and EU nationals in particular- tend to concentrate in services, with most of
them working in administrative and professional activities, tourism and health sectors. During the last four
years, annual average migrant inflows (2800) have nearly doubled compared to the annual average over the
last 10 years (1600). The future of these inflows is uncertain, though in part, this surge is a result of structural
changes in the Maltese economy.

Malta has also been one of the EU’s largest
asylum seeker receivers in per capita terms,
but these have declined since 2013. Malta has
received thousands of asylum seekers in almost
every year since the early 2000s. At their height in
2008, Malta received 2,775 arrivals, mainly form
Sub-Saharan Africa. Since 2013, these inflows
declined as asylum seekers diverted to Eastern
routes due to the turmoil in Northern Africa and
as Italy became even more active in absorbing the

Refugees’ labor market integration is ensured de jure but not de facto. When granted refugee status,
they are entitled to fully access the labor market. However, they face many obstacles, including language
barriers and limited skills, and have seasonal employment opportunities. While a number of policy measures
aim to address these issues, enhancing coordination can help as well. The 2016 Budget included the creation
of an agency for refugees. This should help enhance coordination between institutions to ensure smooth
integration of refugees into the labor market and the society.
The fiscal impact of asylum seekers in Malta is small. Currently about 1000 refugees live in open centers
and the authorities estimate the associated costs per refugee of about €10000. 2 This represents a total fiscal
cost of less than 0.2 percent of GDP per year, well within the range of estimates provided in the literature
(+/-1 percent of GDP, see Hinte and Zimmermann, 2014). Moreover, the reduction in the stock of refugees
resulting from resettlement agreements with third countries and/or their migration to other EU countries,
took some pressure off the provision of public services.

The challenge for Malta is to preserve
high and stable growth and to close the
income gap with the rest of the euro area.
Given uncertainty regarding the global recovery,
volatile migration flows, and ongoing efforts to
enhance competitiveness by euro area neighbors,
raising potential output in a sustainable manner
will require building fiscal buffers to cope with
adverse shocks, maintaining financial sector
stability, and sustaining structural reforms.

Fast growth in current spending makes targeted debt reduction challenging,
particularly beyond 2016. Current expenditures rose from 38.3 percent of GDP in 2012 to
39.1 percent of GDP in 2014 (Table 2). With the expected moderation of growth towards its longterm trend, the fast growth of sticky current expenditures makes the planned consolidation
difficult. Rapidly increasing compensation of employees and additional unplanned subsidies to
various state-owned enterprises present key risks in the near-term. Given possible slippages in
the wage bill and lack of specific measures beyond 2016, staff project a slower pace of
consolidation than the authorities. In staff’s baseline scenario, debt is projected to decline to
around 62.1 percent of GDP by 2018, mainly driven by high nominal GDP growth (as opposed to
targeted 61 percent by 2018).3 Stress test scenarios indicate low growth, low inflation, and
contingent liabilities—stemming from state owned enterprises (SOEs) and the large banking
sector—are the key risks for debt sustainability (Annex II). Refinancing risks are mitigated by the
long average maturity of debt (8.6 years) and small share of non-resident holdings (around
8 percent).
10.
Additional expenditure measures should be considered to ensure that the proposed
fiscal targets are met. In this context, public sector negotiation of collective agreements should
be done within the framework of planned fiscal consolidation and should not result in increases
higher than inflation. With the output gap closed, revenues in excess of targets (because of either
higher than expected growth or windfalls from quantitative easing) should primarily be used to
build fiscal buffers. In line with the 2014 article IV recommendations, the spending review on
social security helped contain expenditure growth. Similarly, the ongoing spending review of
health care and planned spending review of education should help contain expenditures
(Annex I).
11.
Pension measures, included in the 2016 budget, are steps in the right direction.4
These include reforms to delay exits from the labor market, incentivize savings and increase the

Revenues and expenditures are expected to decline in percent of GDP in 2016, owing to lower EU structural
funds and associated capital spending related to the completion of the programming period, and the base effect
from the 2015 capital injection in AirMalta.

Earlier policy actions include increasing the retirement age gradually to 65 by 2027 and introducing voluntary

given to: i) ensuring that contributory years reflect life expectancy in the next assessment; ii)
linking pensionable income to life time incomes with a fair valorization to ensure equity across
groups; iii) ensuring that incentives lead indeed to an increase in the effective retirement age;
and iv) avoiding indexation to wages (Annex I). Ongoing efforts to increase the efficiency of
health care spending—such as increasing the administrative efficiency and strengthening the
primary care—should help contain age related spending growth and support pension reforms.
Box 2. Pension Reform Measures
The Pension Strategy Group (PSG) has recently proposed a set of recommendations to achieve
economic and social sustainability of the system (SIP, Chapter 2).
The authorities have included some key PSG proposals in the 2016 budget to address pension
adequacy and sustainability concerns.



Adequacy measures include the following: (i) An increase in the minimum pension to 140 euros per
week for persons with a full contributory period— while a pro rata will be given to persons who do
not meet the criteria; (ii) Credits to persons contributing towards the state pension for child bearing
and post-graduate studies; and (iii) A planned equity release program and incentives for
participation in the voluntary third pillar to support disposable income at old age.



Sustainability measures: (i) The increase in the contributory period from 40 to 41 years for persons
born after 1968; (ii) Incentives for private sector workers to continue working via the topping up of
their pension for every year of work post-retirement age. The 2016 budget also enables people who
opt to work longer past-retirement age, to do so in agreement with their employer.

12.
The authorities should continue to monitor the implementation of restructuring of
SOEs. While SOEs provide essential public services, their guaranteed debt amounts to about
14.4 percent of GDP. The partial privatization of Enemalta (the utility company) improved the
company’s financial position and reduced its arrears to the government. As part of the
restructuring of the company, interconnector to Italy has been completed, and two power plants
are expected to be operational by end-2016. Cost reductions from these investments should be
monitored carefully, as the electricity tariffs were already reduced in 2014 and 2015, before the
full efficiency gains could be realized. Airmalta is struggling with competitiveness issues despite
the ongoing restructuring plan, involving capacity reduction and selling non-core assets.5 The
public transport service was privatized in January 2015, following an earlier failed privatization,
with annual subsidy commitments of 1/3 of a percent of GDP for 2015 and 2016. It is important to
disclose, analyze, and manage fiscal risks from SoEs in a consolidated manner.
Authorities’ views
13.
The authorities acknowledged the risks to building fiscal buffers, but were
confident that deficit targets will be met. They stressed the improved fiscal framework and the
reliance on conservative macroeconomic assumptions which all together will reduce risks from

The restructuring plan started in March 2011 with the aim of breaking even by March 2014. The company still
makes losses, and is currently projecting to break even by March 2017. With their 2015 budget, a new 3-year plan
has been introduced. The government’s capital injections amount to 0.7 percent of GDP.

fiscal slippages. In this context, they highlighted the ongoing and planned spending reviews. On
pensions, the authorities agreed on the risks stemming from adverse demographic
developments and stressed that key recommendations of the PSG have been included in the
2016 budget, and they would wait to see the impact of these measures before taking additional
actions. The authorities recognized the risks from SOEs. In the case of Enemalta they agreed that
electricity tariff cuts should be matched by efficiency gains. In the case of Airmalta, they noted
that in line with the state aid rules, there are no planned subsidies.

B.

Financial Sector Stability

14.
The financial system (about 700 percent of GDP) remains resilient (Box 3). Banks are
well capitalized and liquid. Solvency and liquidity of core domestic banks and other peer bank
groups (non-core domestic banks and international banks) remain above the minimum
regulatory requirements. Their profitability, despite the decline in 2014, remains healthy (Table 4).
The non-bank financial institutions are relatively small, with the main risk to systemic stability
arising from their interconnectedness with the core domestic banks.

But nonperforming loans (NPLs) and the cost of credit remain high. High NPLs have
been contributing to high interest rates, particularly in certain sectors, as implied by the positive

stability, given the large size of covered deposits relative to GDP (€8.9 billion or about
112 percent of 2014 GDP).


High NPLs: The increase in the coverage ratio and the national authorities’ consideration
of using Pillar II measures to reduce NPLs are welcome and further increases in coverage
ratios, as envisaged, are appropriate. The completion of the ongoing work on insolvency
legislation— reducing court proceedings time and enhancing contract enforcement—
should substantially improve NPL resolution.



Macroprudential policies: Given below trend credit-to-GDP ratio, the central bank seems
minded to set counter cyclical buffers to zero. Despite the overall weak credit, mortgages
are increasing rapidly (10 percent y/y in July 2015). While the default rates on mortgages
and household indebtedness have been low, further consideration should be given to
precautionary measures, such as loan-to-value (currently at 74 percent for residential and
69 for commercial in 2014) and debt-to-income ratios, given the rapid increase in
mortgages, relatively high overall exposure to real estate, and pick up in real estate
prices—fueled by a combination of factors, such as tax incentives for first time buyers,
increase in rental demand stemming from the international investor program, increased
migration, and the ECB’s QE.



FSAP: The authorities’ request for a Financial Sector Assessment Program Update (FSAP)
is very timely, as the last FSAP was conducted in 2003.



AML/CFT Framework: The FIAU’s shift to risk based AML/CFT supervision is a positive step
and more frequent onsite inspections by the FIAU and the MFSA should contribute to
enhancing AML/CFT compliance in the financial sector. In light of the large financial
sector, the rapid growth in the online gaming industry, and high demand for the
international investor program, the MFSA, the FIAU, the Malta Gaming Authority (MGA),
and Identity Malta should continue to coordinate closely and ensure robust
9
implementation of the AML/CFT framework in line with the 2012 FATF standard. This
may also assist in ensuring that the level of suspicious transactions reports (STRs) is
appropriate.

Authorities’ views
18.
The authorities agreed with staff on possible sources of risks and noted that actions
are being taken. They agreed that the NPLs are high, but noted that they are mostly a legacy
issue, limited to some sectors such as construction, and are well collateralized—implying a
coverage of more than 100 percent together with provisions. The national authorities expect that
ongoing judicial reforms and the possible use of Pillar II measures, currently under consideration,
will help tackle NPLs. They also expect the planned credit registry and development bank will
improve access to credit. Regarding macroprudential policies, they highlighted that Joint
Financial Stability Board started discussions on further measures, given the rapid increase in

mortgages. The authorities are confident that the collection of contributions for the resolution
fund and the shift towards DCS ex-ante funds will go smoothly. On the AML/CFT framework, they
highlighted that they are at the final stages of the national risk assessment and efforts to
improve capacity and training are ongoing.
Box 3. Malta: Structure of the Financial Sector
Malta’ financial sector is large and highly segmented. As of end-2014, assets of banks were about 6 ¼
times GDP, while assets of non-bank financial institutions are around 2/3 of GDP. A big portion of these
banks have limited links to the real economy. The share of the financial sector in value added and
employment is about 7 and less than 5 percent, respectively. Banks and non-bank institutions can be divided
by domestic or international, depending on the scope of their involvement in activities with residents. For
banks, the Central Bank of Malta (CBM) breaks down domestic institutions into core domestic banks and
non-core domestic banks.



Core domestic banks, with assets of about
2½ times the GDP, provide around
97 percent of bank lending to residents in
Malta, and collect around 94 percent of
resident deposits. They have limited
external assets and liabilities. As of endJune 2015, their capital adequacy and
liquidity ratios stood at 13.9 and
52.1 percent, respectively, above the
required minimum of 8 and 30 percent. The
main vulnerability stems from relatively high
non-performing loans (8.6 percent as of
end-June 2015) and high exposure to the
property market and collateral in the form
of real estate.



Non-core domestic banks, with assets slightly more than ¼ of GDP, are funded primarily from
wholesale markets and non-resident deposits and have some (albeit still small) exposure to
residents, with resident assets and liabilities comprising 10.2 and 19.4 percent, respectively, of the
total balance sheet size as of end-2014. The main risks related to these banks stem from possible
cross-border deleveraging pressures and claims on the local deposit compensation scheme in the
event of bank failure.



International banks rely mostly on wholesale (including intra-group) funding and nonresident
deposits of relatively long maturities and focus on activities for the group (custodian services, trade
finance, investment banking). Their assets are about 3.3 times the GDP, with the bulk owned by two
branches of Turkish banks. The recent deleveraging in this group had limited impact on Malta.

The non-bank financial institutions are relatively small, and the main risk stems from their
interconnectedness with core domestic banks. Around a third of insurance companies and investment funds
are classified as domestic. The insurance sector is dominated by two companies, accounting for around
90 percent of total assets. Core domestic banks hold a significant shareholding in several domestic insurance
companies, while over 10 percent of insurers’ assets consist of deposits held with the Maltese banks. The
investment funds have significant investments in local bank equity.

increasing labor participation and upgrading skill levels; ii) reforming the energy sector; and iii)
improving the business environment, including through judicial reforms and increasing access to

Improving access to finance, in particularly for SMEs. While financial sector is large
and banks are liquid, credit to NFCs is weak, partly reflecting high interest rate margins.
High lending rates could reflect various factors, including higher funding cost of banks
(relative to the ECB policy rates), limited competition, high level of NPL ratios, and
relatively high corporate sector leverage, particularly for smaller firms and in certain
sectors (2014 Article IV Consultation, Staff Report). Ongoing judicial reforms and the
work on a credit registry will help improve access and cost of credit, by solving
informational asymmetry and reducing the risk premia charged by banks, given the
dominance of small and micro loans and time to recover collateral. Setting up a multi
trading facility by the stock exchange will help increase access to non-bank finance,
particularly for SMEs. The planned development bank (to facilitate SME and infrastructure
financing) should be effectively supervised and have strong governance.

Authorities’ views
21.
The authorities agreed with staff on the importance of structural reforms and
stressed that judicial reforms and upgrading the education system are key priorities. They
emphasized that reforms would take time given the required institutional and cultural changes.
They also acknowledged the importance of access to credit and stressed that ongoing efforts—
such as the credit registry, judicial reforms, incentivizing the NPL resolution, measures to
incentivize non-bank financing and the planned development bank— are expected to help
improve access to credit and lower the cost of credit.

STAFF APRAISAL
22.
Malta has remained resilient in the face of global shocks and the economy is
growing strongly, helped by policy initiatives. The reliance on domestic funding and the
relatively well diversified economy have helped preserve stability. Growth accelerated to
5.1 percent in the first half of 2015 and unemployment is at historic lows.
23.
The outlook is strong and risks are balanced. Growth is expected to remain solid in
2016–17, driven initially by domestic demand and later by a gradual recovery in external demand.
Inflation is projected to gradually pick up with the positive output gap and the exchange rate
pass-through. The external position remains broadly in line with fundamentals despite high
uncertainty driven by volatile components of the current account. While, downside risks include
slower global growth, delays in implementation of structural reforms, fiscal slippages, and
regulatory and tax changes elsewhere, upside risks stem from increased energy efficiency and
further increases in labor participation. The future of migration flows, the majority of which
coming from other EU countries, remains uncertain.
24.
Strong migration inflows boost potential output. Large inflows since the early 2000,
mostly originating from other EU countries, have offset Malta’s declining working age population
and raised potential growth. Refugee inflows have also been significant, but have declined
since 2013. The planned agency for refugees should help enhance coordination between
institutions to ensure their smooth integration into the labor market and society.
25.
The challenge is to preserve high and stable growth. Given uncertainty regarding the
global recovery, volatile migration flows, and ongoing efforts to enhance competitiveness by
euro area neighbors, raising potential output in a sustainable manner will depend on i) building
fiscal buffers to cope with adverse shocks; ii) maintaining financial sector stability and providing
financing for growth; and iii) sustaining structural reforms.
26.
The authorities’ proposed pace of fiscal consolidation for 2016–18 is appropriate.
The deficit reduction is continuing, despite rapidly growing current expenditures, supported by
revenue measures and stronger-than-expected revenues. The authorities aim to reduce the
overall deficit to -0.2 percent of GDP in 2018, but measures beyond 2016 are not well specified at
this stage.
27.
Fast growth in current expenditures makes targeted debt reduction challenging,
particularly beyond 2016. With the expected growth moderation towards its long-term trend,
the fast growth of sticky current expenditures makes the planned consolidation difficult. To
ensure meeting the fiscal targets, additional expenditure measures should be considered. In this
context, the authorities should ensure that public sector wage negotiations will not result in
increases higher than inflation and complete the ongoing and planned spending reviews. With
the output gap closed, revenues in excess of targets should primarily be used to build fiscal
buffers. Fiscal risks from SoEs should also be disclosed and managed in a consolidated manner.

28.
Pension measures introduced in the 2016 budget are steps in the right direction.
These measures aim to address both adequacy and sustainability of the pension system. Given
that Malta ranks second worst in the euro area in its age related spending increases, the
authorities should ensure that these measures lead to an increase in the effective retirement age
and to higher participation in the voluntary third pillar to support disposable income at old age.
Efforts to increase the efficiency of health care spending should help support pension reforms.
29.
Ongoing efforts to strengthen fiscal governance and institutions should continue.
Continued efforts to strengthen fiscal institutions and the budgetary framework are encouraged
to increase efficiency, transparency, and ultimately avoid fiscal slippages. Efforts to link sectoral
budget allocations and any new public spending to medium-term plans and outcomes are
welcome and will help track the impact of reforms and their medium-term fiscal implications.
30.
The banking system remains resilient. Banks are well capitalized, profitable, and liquid.
Solvency and liquidity of core domestic banks and other peer banks remain above the minimum
regulatory requirements, and their profitability is above the euro area average.
31.
But nonperforming loans (NPLs) and the cost of credit remain high. The increase in
the coverage ratio and the national authorities’ consideration of using further Pillar II measures
to reduce NPLs are welcome, and further increases in coverage ratios as envisaged is
appropriate. The completion of the ongoing work on insolvency legislation, aiming to reduce
court proceedings time and enhance contract enforcement, should help improve NPL resolution.
32.
Given the large size of the financial sector and ongoing regulatory and supervisory
changes, continued policy actions are needed to boost resilience of the banks. Policies
should focus on: (i) a swift implementation of bank action plans to ensure a level playing field
and sound supervision; (ii) following the transposition of BRRD into national law and the
establishment of a separate resolution unit in the MFSA, developing bank recovery plans and
collecting of contributions for the resolution fund; (iii) strengthening the contingency framework,
including by reducing the share of special contributions to DCS fund, (iv) introducing additional
precautionary macroprudential measures, given the rapid increases in mortgages and pick up in
real estate prices, and (iv) continuing to coordinate closely and ensure robust implementation of
the AML/CFT framework in line with the 2012 FATF standard.
33.
The authorities’ request for a Financial Sector Assessment Program Update is very
timely, as the last FSAP was conducted in 2003.
34.
The structural reform priorities, as outlined in the national strategy program, are
appropriate, but momentum would need to continue. Raising potential growth requires that
measures translate into outcomes. In particular: (i) measures to enhance female participation
have been paying off and support the potential growth; (ii) linking measures to achieve the
national education strategy goals to budget allocations is welcome; (iii) judicial reforms,
including the focus on insolvency regime are welcome but need to be complemented by efforts
to track and demonstrate the results, such as conducting an impact assessment, and (iv) ongoing
efforts to improve access to credit, such as NPL resolution, judicial reforms, planned credit

Malta: Risk Assessment Matrix1
Source of Risk

Relative Likelihood

Impact if Realized

1.
Euro area: weak
demand and persistently low
inflation from a failure to fully
address crisis legacies and
undertake structural reforms,
leading to low medium-term
growth and accumulation of
financial imbalances.

High
Highly open nature of
the Maltese economy
makes it particularly
vulnerable to
developments in the
euro area.

Medium
Adverse impact on growth and financial flows.

2.
Slowdown in emerging
markets and increased global
financial market volatility

Medium/High
A slowdown in
emerging markets may
stall global recovery
and a bumpy UMP exit
could lead to real and
financial spillovers to
Malta.
Medium
A Greece tail event
could lead to a reassessment of investor’s
risk appetite to euro
area exposures.

Medium/Low
Malta has been relatively insulated from financial market
contagion given public and private sectors’ reliance on domestic
financing, but is still vulnerable to low external demand.

3.
Euro area bond market
contagion. Sovereign and
financial sector stress
reemerges across the Euro
area due to protracted policy
uncertainty (for example in
Greece).

Policy Response
Reduce the pace of fiscal
consolidation, in line with
the flexibility under the
SGP.
Continue to diversify
trade and financial
activities with non-euro
area countries

Medium/Low
Malta has been relatively insulated from financial market
contagion given public and private sectors’ reliance on domestic
financing, but is still vulnerable to slow external demand.

Focus on eliminating
vulnerabilities (fiscal and
financial) to ensure
stability and continue to
diversify trade and
financial activities.
Focus on eliminating
vulnerabilities (fiscal and
financial) to ensure
stability.

Bank failures and the
bail-in of debt holders
could have spillovers
across European
banking system,
affecting Malta’s
international banks.
4.
Geopolitical
fragmentation: i)
Russia/Ukraine; ii)
fragmentation/state failure in
the Middle East

Medium
Direct links with Russia
and Ukraine are low

Medium/Low
Indirect effects through confidence and external demand might
be partially offset by additional tourists given Malta’s stability

5.
Broader than expected
changes in the EU regulatory
framework

Low
Malta’s attraction as a
financial center for
cross-border banking
activities may diminish

Medium
Deleveraging of the international banking and business sector
may adversely affect tax revenues and employment

6.
Delays in
implementation of energy
investment projects

Low
Delays in energy
investment plans can
reduce growth and
create budgetary
pressures.

Medium
Lower investment could be partly offset by lower imports.
Nevertheless with electricity tariffs already reduced this could
increase contingent liabilities.

7.
Delays in implementing
structural reforms, including
judicial and pension reforms.

Medium
Slow progress in
judicial reforms and no
behavioral changes in
response to pension
incentives

High
Delayed implementation of required structural reforms would
negatively affect long-term growth and fiscal sustainability

8.
A sharp correction in
housing prices

Low
After a period of
downward correction in
2008–09, Malta’s
housing market seems
to have stabilized

Medium/High
Core domestic banks are significantly exposed to the housing
market

Focus on eliminating
vulnerabilities (fiscal and
financial) to ensure
stability.
Diversify the economy
while scrutinizing
associated new risks

Rapid implementation of
the project plans and
monitor the efficiency
gains regularly

Sustain and monitor the
implementation of
structural reforms

Monitor risk and be
prepared to use macroprudential measures

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to
materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks
surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10
and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and
overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and
materialize jointly.

Annex I. Implementation of IMF Recommendations
The Maltese authorities have taken on board the majority of policy recommendations made by the
Fund in previous Article IV consultations (Annex Table 1).
Table 1. Implementation of IMF Recommendations
Fiscal issues

2014 Art. IV Advice

Actions since 2014 Art. IV

Adopt additional consolidation measures
to contain the fast growth in current
expenditures
and
use
unexpected
revenues primarily for building fiscal
buffers.
Pursue broad-based expenditure reforms
– on social security, healthcare and
education – to contain fiscal pressures
going forward.

Fiscal consolidation was pursued in 2014
and 2015, helped by the strong economic
growth. Current expenditures continue to
grow at a rapid rate.

Push forward with restructuring of state
owned corporations to restore the
profitability and viability of state-owned
enterprises to reduce fiscal risks.

Pension reforms: (i) accelerate planned
increase in retirement age; (ii) link
pension income to a longer period of
working years; and (iii) accelerate the
progress of the private third pillar
pension scheme.

Advance efforts

Spending review on social security was
completed and spending review on health
care is going on. A proposal for pension
reform has been prepared, and a part of
the proposed measures were adopted in
2016 draft budget.
The partial privatization of Enemalta has
been completed and infrastructure projects
are onoging. The implementation of
restructuring plan for Airmalta continues,
which includes disposal of non-core
businesses.
On (i), the 2016 budget raised the
contributory period from 40 to 41 years for
persons born after 1968 and introduced
topping up of pension benefit for every
year worked post retirement age. On (ii),
the PSG recommended linking pension
income to the last 15 years prior to
retirement - an improvement over the
previous regime, where only the best 3
years were used. On (iii), new financial
products to encourage individual to save
for their retirement in the voluntary private
third pillar were launched by two financial
institutions in November 2015.
The Fiscal Advisory Council continues to
build its capacity and has produced its first
set
of
reports,
increasing
fiscal
transparency.
Implementation of bank action plans
continues; AQR for Mediterranean Bank
completed.

Table 1. Implementation of IMF Recommendations (Concluded)
2014 Art. IV Advice
Strengthen the contingency framework in
line with reforms at the EU level, including
by boosting the resources of the deposit
compensation scheme and lowering the
share of banks’ special contribution.
Follow through legal amendments
needed to implement the EU Bank
Recovery and Resolution Directive
(BRRD), establish a resolution fund and
introduce a bail-in requirement.
Conduct an FSAP update.
Continue to aim for high standards in the
AML/CFT framework.

Structural
reforms

Strengthen female labor participation.

Enhance education attainment.
Improve the business climate through
judicial reforms.
Improve the business climate through
increasing access to credit.

Actions since 2014 Art. IV
The minimum for the DCS fund is set at
1.3 percent of covered deposits—above
the target level of ex-ante funds of
0.8 percent (EU directives). The share of
special contributions (i.e., not cash) will be
reduced in line with the EU directives.
The EU BRRD has been transposed into
national law and the MFSA established a
separate resolution unit. The focus is now
on bank recovery plans and the collection
of contributions for the resolution fund.
An FSAP update has been requested.
FIAU shifted to a risk based AML/CFT
supervision. Efforts to build capacity and
training are underway.

Incentives to work were improved, eg by
introducing free childcare for working
mothers.
Ongoing, within the framework of national
education strategy.
Judicial reforms are ongoing with a a focus
on the insolvency regime.
Ongoing on multiple fronts including
judicial reforms, planned credit registry,
efforts to incentivize banks to reduce NPLs,

Annex II. Debt Sustainability Analysis
1.
The public debt-to-GDP ratio fell to 68.3 percent in 2014 from 69.6 in 2013. The
primary balance turned positive in 2013 and is expected to rise above 1 percent of GDP in 2016.
This puts the debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward trajectory.
2.
The stock of contingent liabilities is expected to stabilize in 2015. Government
guaranteed debt increased from 7.5 percent of GDP in 2008 to about 16.8 percent of GDP
in 2014, mainly stemming from Enemalta (the national utility company). With the partial
privatization of Enemalta, guaranteed debt declined to 14.4 percent in 2015Q2.
3.
In order to assess the sustainability of government debt, a number of adverse
scenarios are considered. Although under the baseline scenario the debt-to-GDP ratio is
expected to remain on the downward trajectory, this is very sensitive to shocks.


Under a growth shock that lowers output by 2.7 percentage points (equivalent to 1
standard deviation of growth over the past 10 years) in 2015–2016 and inflation declining
by 0.3 percentage points in 2016, debt would peak at 69.8 percent of GDP in 2017,
6.0 percentage points higher than in the baseline.



A sustained interest rate shock of 200 bps would slow down the rate of debt decline such
that by 2019 the debt-to-GDP ratio is 0.7 percentage points higher with respect to the
baseline.



A primary fiscal balance shock of 0.3 percentage points over 2015–2016 yields a debt-toGDP ratio 0.7 percentage points higher in 2019 relative to the baseline.



A combined macro-fiscal shock including the three shocks above would lead to debt
peaking at 69.9 percent of GDP in 2017, 6.1 percentage points higher relative to the
baseline, and declining to about 66.8 percent of GDP in 2019.



Under a contingent liability shock there is a one-time increase in non-interest
expenditures equivalent to 10% of the banking sector credit (or about 2/3 of the current
guaranteed debt). This leads to a real GDP growth shock as the one above (with growth
declining for 1 standard deviation over 2015–2016)— revenue-to-GDP ratio remains the
same as in the baseline while the deterioration of the primary balance leads to higher
interest rates and the decline in growth lowers the inflation rate. This leads to debt
reaching 75.3 percent in2019.

4.
Overall, key risks to public debt are assessed to be originating from low growth and
inflation, and contingent liabilities.
5.
Risks stemming from Malta’s high external financing requirements are partly
mitigated by large holdings of foreign assets. While total net external debt as of at the end of
2014 is about negative (325 percent of GDP), the short term net debt is positive (264 percent of
GDP). Most of outstanding short term debt is dominated by financial institutions (79 percent of
net short term debt and 64.1 percent of gross short term debt). Excluding financial institutions
and the central bank, short term debt is about 157 percent of GDP.

1/ Public sector is defined as general government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over German bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate
of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate
depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth
contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection

Annex III. Malta: External Sector Assessment1

2.
The structure of Malta’s current
account is complex, with “nontraditional”
items accounting for a large fraction of the
surplus. Most of the gains recorded in the
current account come from the rapid acceleration
in service exports in recent years. The net balance
of trade of services moved from 9 percent of GDP
in early 2000s to more than 20 percent of GDP
recently, compared to about 1 percent of GDP for
the euro area as a whole. Rising service balance
mainly reflects increase in exports of remote
gaming companies, telecommunications,
insurance services, and travel.

3.
Malta’s current account exhibits large volatility that is largely unrelated to
movements in the real exchange rate and global demand. The standard deviation of the
Malta’s current account surplus, computed over the last decade, is 4.5 percentage points of GDP,
one of the highest among advanced economies. The bulk of this volatility comes from
fluctuations in net exports of services—such as financial services2 and online gaming3, and
primary account—which reflect international bank transfers.4 Goods account is also volatile,

These transactions are mostly driven by international banks that have little connection to the real domestic
economy.
3

Regulatory and fiscal changes in other EU countries (including in the U.K.) have led Malta to take advantage of
its competitive advantage in online gaming activities.
4

An example of the current account’s high volatility is the decline in its deficit from 5.9 percent of GDP in 2009 to
a surplus of 5 percent of GDP one year later without a sizeable change in the trade balance. Service exports rose
by almost 6 percentage points of GDP in a year.

Malta’s external balance has improved
rapidly over recent years. Malta recorded a
current account surplus of 3.3 percent of GDP in
2014 (an all-time high) from an average 4 percent
deficit over the period 1995 to 2014. On the
financial side, while the NIIP appears not
concerning, major vulnerabilities might still arise
given large gross stock positions. Staff calculations
indicate that valuation effects on the liabilities side
are substantial and mostly originate from foreign
direct investment. However, the large share of
intra-company lending stands as a mitigation
factor to possible risks.

partly reflecting oil re-exports.5 This implies that the Malta’s current account is affected by
sizeable non-traditional factors in addition to the standard fluctuations in REER or foreign
demand. There has been a rebalancing of Malta’s current account away from goods to services
exports, with the decline in market share of good exports being compensated by the gains in
exports of services.

Staff views Malta’s external position as having been broadly in line with
fundamentals in 2015, though this assessment is subject to high uncertainty. This judgment
reflects a balance of a number of factors, including the EBA–lite current account norm estimates,
misalignment estimates, and Malta-specific factors. Given the high uncertainty surrounding
estimates, staff has proceeded to a number of statistical adjustments using the EBA-lite
methodology. First, the cyclically-adjusted current account to GDP ratio in 2015 has been
adjusted downward (to -0.4 percent of GDP) by a one-off factor which is equivalent to aligning
the volatility of the overall current account with its trade or income balance counterparts (around
2 percentage points of GDP; see text-figure above). Second, the adjustment to the estimated
cyclically-adjusted current account norm has taken into account the fact that a large share
private sector credit finances non-tradable activities (such as mortgages and residential real
estates) and does not necessarily affect the trade balance. The adjustment to the norm has also
taken into account the slightly reduced energy dependency in line with ongoing large energy
investment projects. Taking into account these adjustments, the current account norm improves
from around -3 percent to -0.3 percent of GDP. The resulting current account gap (the difference
between the “revised” cyclically-adjusted current account and cyclically-adjusted norm) is 0.1 percentage point of GDP.6 This translates into a REER overvaluation of 0.1 percent.7
Contribution from policy gaps increases the current account surplus (mainly explained by Malta’s
recent fiscal consolidation efforts compared with trading partners and private credit in line with
fundamentals) but rather limited (0.3 percent). EBA REER estimates suggest an overvaluation of
the REER of 0.5 percent. In a nutshell, staff assesses the external position as broadly consistent
with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings.

6

A negative current account gap and/or a positive REER imply an overvaluation of the REER.

7

Without adjustment made, the current account gap amounts to 4.4 percentage points of GDP of which
4.1 percentage points are pure residuals. Taking into account current account elasticity with respect to REER, the
implied exchange rate misalignment without any adjustment stands at -4.8 percent.

STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
(As of November 11, 2015)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance purposes. Significant progress in improving
macroeconomic statistics has been made in close cooperation with the European Central Bank (ECB) and
Eurostat while upgrading statistical systems to meet the euro area standards. Most macroeconomic
statistics can now be accessed through Eurostat and Haver Analytics. The country has subscribed to the
SDDS since December 1, 2009, with the metadata posted on the IMF’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin
Board.
National Accounts: Malta compiles its national accounts in accordance with the guidelines of ESA

2010 since October 2014. The effect of the conceptual differences from ESA 1995 on the estimated
level of GDP in 2010 was a relative small upward revision of 0.5 percent. Data on retail and
consumer prices, labor market indicators, and tourism arrivals are released monthly, usually with a
short lag. A harmonized index of consumer prices has been published since May 2004. These data
are available through Eurostat and Haver Analytics as well as via the Internet at the Central Bank of
Malta (CBM) and the National Statistical Office (NSO) websites. The NSO releases quarterly national
accounts data in current and constant prices with a lag of about two months, annual nonfinancial
sectoral accounts in current prices with a lag of about 11 months, and a monthly index of industrial
production with a lag of just over a month. However, national accounts data have been subject to
substantial revisions, often affecting several years. The reasons for revisions include large statistical
discrepancies (captured under changes in inventory stocks), particularly on the first release
and revisions of deflators. Furthermore, supply-side GDP estimates by type of economic activity are
only available at current prices and compilation of volume measures is currently progressing.
Volume estimates of expenditure GDP are obtained using annual-chain linking with 2010 as the
reference year. The producer price index for total industry and agricultural products have been
published, but that for services sector is still under discussion. National accounts imports and
exports data are not disaggregated into goods and services. Annual Financial balance sheets and
transactions by sectors are published on the Eurostat website. However, data on household savings
are not available.
Price Statistics: Data on retail and consumer prices are released monthly, usually with a short lag. A
harmonized index of consumer prices has been published since May 2004. These data are available
through Eurostat and Haver Analytics and via the Internet at the Central Bank of Malta (CBM) and the
National Statistical Office (NSO) websites. The producer price index for total industry and the agricultural
price index have been published, but that for services sector is still under discussion.
Government finance statistics: Fiscal statistics meet requirements, with quarterly accrual-based data on
general government operations compiled in accordance with the ESA2010 methodology and

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALTA

disseminated with a one-quarter lag. The general government comprises data from the consolidated
fund of government adjusted to include other accounts of government, the accruals elements, and the
financial performance of the Extra Budgetary Units and of the Local Councils. The NSO also publishes
monthly statistics on the cash operations of the central government, for which the authorities plan to
utilize the targeted timeliness flexibility option in light of additional time required for the final month of
the fiscal year.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Monetary statistics are timely and of good quality. Since the entry
into the euro area in January 2008, monetary data for IMF statistical publications have been obtained
through a gateway arrangement with the ECB, thus reducing the reporting burden of the country.
Financial Sector Surveillance: Malta has reported Financial Soundness Indicators beginning from 2005
along with metadata, which are available on the IMF’s website (http://fsi.imf.org).
External sector statistics: Summary data (merchandise trade, current account balance, and selected
financial account data) are released by the NSO on a quarterly basis with a lag of about three months.
More detailed BOP and IIP data are released quarterly, the latter with a lag sometimes of about one year.
Summary trade statistics are released monthly with a lag of about 40 days. The CBM publishes the
external debt templates in line with requirements of the SDDS, including both gross and net external
debt. In line with the European regulation, Malta has transitioned to BPM6 and has revised the estimates
back to 2008. In line with the BPM6 requirements, the new data include estimates for the SPEs and other
coverage improvements, affecting in particular the primary incomes and the financial account (direct and
portfolio investments), as well as position data (IIP). The BPM6 implementation and data back casting
entailed a series of data revisions recently.
II. Data Standards and Quality
The country has subscribed to the SDDS since

A data ROSC was published in 2006.
