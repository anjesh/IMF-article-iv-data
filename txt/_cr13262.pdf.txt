STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. Slovakia recovered strongly following the global crisis, and remains among the
more robust European economies with positive growth, moderate public and private
debt, a dynamic export sector, external surpluses, and a sound financial system.
Weakness among trading partners and a further decline in already anemic domestic
demand are causing the economy to lose momentum, and a key challenge is to balance
the substantial further fiscal consolidation that is necessary with concerns about slowing
growth. Given very high unemployment, laying the foundations for stronger job-rich
growth is key for the medium term. External factors, particularly challenges in Europe,
are among the most important risks.
Strengthening growth and creating jobs. Slovakia’s integration into international
supply chains has yielded great benefits, but has not been enough to address high
unemployment and may also amplify risks from trade shocks. Boosting growth and
employment depends on further improvements to the business environment, effective
active labor market policies, better educational quality, and regional integration. Over
the medium term, promoting new sources of growth and export diversification would
help lessen external vulnerabilities.
Fiscal policy. Fiscal consolidation has continued, although some sources of revenue or
savings have been temporary. The 2013 fiscal deficit target is achievable, but automatic
stabilizers should be allowed to operate if risks to growth materialize. Going forward,
sizeable additional fiscal adjustment is needed to avoid economically harmful effects
from crossing key debt thresholds and to meet EU commitments. High-quality measures
will be important to ensure the durability of consolidation efforts and to improve the
structure of the budget.
Financial sector policies. Slovakia’s banking sector is sound, liquid, and well-capitalized,
but credit to the corporate sector has declined, reflecting weak demand. Banking
supervision has been prudent but it could usefully be enhanced with a more developed
framework for early intervention and more effective resolution mechanisms.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
Vibrant export growth powered a strong post-crisis recovery. Growth remains positive, but
the Slovak economy has gradually lost momentum with the external environment
faltering and domestic demand contracting. Slovakia has nonetheless stayed on track in
its fiscal consolidation efforts while enjoying moderate public and private debt levels. It
has seen decelerating inflation, registered record trade and current account surpluses,
and maintained a sound banking system, all in the context of a stable political landscape.
Reducing very high unemployment, however, is a key challenge while external weakness,
particularly stemming from Europe, remains a central risk.

A. Losing Momentum After Strong Post-Crisis Recovery
1.
While still one of the strongest performers in the euro area, the Slovak economy has
lost momentum (Figure 1 and Table 1). With average growth of 3.2 percent over the past three
years, the Slovak Republic outpaced most EU economies. However, Slovakia’s export-driven
economy has progressively lost steam with

and stagnant real wages. Gross investment
plunged by more than 10 percent, reflecting not only a strong base effect—due to the large projects
carried out in 2011—but also growing economic uncertainty and a sizeable decline in inventories.
2.
Inflation decelerated. During 2012, weak domestic demand and lower fuel prices prompted
a gradual deceleration of headline inflation to 3.4 percent from 4.1 percent in 2011. The decline
accelerated in the first months of 2013 with headline and core inflation down to 1.6 and 1.7 percent
as of June, narrowing the differential with average euro area inflation to around ½ percentage point
from almost 2 percentage points at end-2011.
3.
Troubling labor market conditions deteriorated further (Figure 2). Despite still positive
growth, unemployment continued rising, reaching 14.4 percent at end-2012. The trend edged up
towards the end the year with anecdotal reports of firms accelerating layoffs in anticipation of the
stricter provisions of the new Labor Code, which entered into force in January 2013. Labor market
conditions stabilized in the first months of 2013.

4.
The government outperformed the 2012 deficit target. The 2012 general government
deficit came in at 4.3 percent of GDP, below the 4.6 percent target under the Excessive Deficit
Procedure (EDP) (Figure 3 and Tables 2–3 ). Gross public debt reached 52 percent of GDP, due in
part to contributions of 2 percent of GDP to euro area firewalls (the European Financial Stability
Facility (EFSF) and the European Stability Mechanism (ESM)) and some pre-funding. While public
debt is manageable, scenario analysis suggests some vulnerability, especially to growth shocks
(Table A1 and Figure A1).
5.
Sovereign financing conditions improved substantially in early 2013 and have
remained largely stable despite broader market volatility beginning in May. With the new
government’s strong commitment to comply with EDP targets, the ECB’s statement on Outright
Monetary Transactions to safeguard the euro area, and broader improvements in market sentiment,
Slovakia’s CDS and bond spreads narrowed to historical lows and maturities have been extended.
The share of non-resident holdings of government bonds increased to 47 percent in 2012 as part of
efforts to diversify the investor base, including by tapping foreign-currency markets. While yields
rose slightly in May and June 2013 as market volatility increased, they remain low (about 2.6 percent
for Slovakia’s 10-year bond with spreads relative to Germany around 100 basis points).
6.
External competitiveness remained strong in export-oriented manufacturing.
Substantial foreign direct investment (FDI), particularly in the auto sector, contributed to 15 percent
annual average export growth over the past decade and rising market shares. Booming exports,
along with weak domestic demand, led to sizeable trade and current account surpluses (Figure 4
and Table 4). These developments as well as productivity and inflation outpacing manufacturing
wage increases point to competitiveness having been preserved, and the real effective exchange
rate (REER) based on unit labor costs in the manufacturing sector shows a substantial
competitiveness improvement (Figure 5). The CGER methodology provides a mixed picture of the
REER with the macroeconomic balance and the external sustainability approaches indicating
undervaluation while the equilibrium real exchange rate approach suggests some overvaluation,
perhaps capturing trend appreciation in the CPI-based REER as real convergence takes place.
Supplemental analysis supports staff’s view that the REER is somewhat undervalued, reflecting
restrained wage growth amidst productivity increases (Box 1).
7.
The external position remains stable. Slovakia’s net international investment position
(NIIP) has improved somewhat to negative 62 percent of GDP, a level similar to other countries in
the region. Slovakia’s external debt has edged down to about 74 percent of GDP and is projected to
fall even under stress scenarios (Table A2 and Figure A2). The improvement in the NIIP and external
debt indicators was mostly due to a reduction in liabilities of the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS)
and commercial banks. Large portfolio inflows in 2012 reflected an increase in foreigners’ holdings
of government debt and a decrease in foreign debt holdings by the NBS and other financial
institutions.

SLOVAK REPUBLIC

Box 1. Slovak Republic: Assessing Slovakia’s Real Effective Exchange Rate
The standard CGER methodology provides a mixed assessment of Slovakia’ real effective exchange
rate (REER). While the external sustainability (ES) and macroeconomic balance (MB) approaches point to an
undervaluation of Slovakia’s REER of about 9 and 16 percent in 2012, the equilibrium real exchange rate
(ERER) approach suggests an overvaluation of more than 40 percent. The ES and MB results indicate that
actual current account surpluses are larger than fundamental determinants of savings and investment would
suggest, and hence a REER appreciation would be needed to close that gap and stabilize Slovakia’s net
foreign asset position. On the other hand, Slovakia’s experience of having inflation above peers, reflecting
the convergence process, may explain the ERER result which is based on deviations from the long-run
equilibrium value. However, this wide range of the results may also reflect the fact that CGER estimates are
based on a large sample of countries and hence specific characteristics of individual economies may not be
fully factored in.
A more tailored analysis suggests that Slovakia’s REER is broadly in line with fundamentals, even
marginally undervalued. As an alternative, the MB

consistent with the analysis carried out by the NBS. A
closer look at CGER estimates show that the resulting

economies such as Slovakia.

8.
Bank lending slowed. Reflecting some tightening in credit standards, corporate lending
contracted while household borrowing, mainly housing loans, continued at a steady pace (Figure 6).
Nonperforming loans are low and well-provisioned. Reflecting the difficult operating environment
and increased taxation, bank profits declined. Banks continued to enjoy stable domestic deposit
funding and robust capitalization (Table 5).

B. Outlook and Risks
9.
The near-term outlook has become less favorable. Growth is projected to slow to
0.6 percent in 2013 due to a weakening external environment and large fiscal consolidation efforts
coupled with high unemployment and modest wage increases, which will be a drag on domestic
demand, and in turn will further dampen underlying inflation. Net exports are expected to continue
to contribute positively to growth, albeit to a lesser extent, with the current account remaining in
surplus. In an unchanged policies scenario, staff forecasts output to strengthen in 2014 to
2.3 percent, as the external environment gradually improves and domestic confidence recovers, with
positive effects on investment and employment, and hence on private consumption. Growth should

pick up to 3–3½ percent in the medium
term (potential growth is estimated at
3 percent), with unemployment falling to
around 11 percent by the end of the

Risks are primarily to the

would push debt ratios up, and hamper
fiscal consolidation. Over the longer term, there is a risk that a generation of workers is not wellintegrated into the labor force, potentially compounding future demographic challenges. The euro
area crisis and the potential for prolonged weakness in Europe could delay the expected pick-up in
Slovakia, particularly through the export channel (where the global outlook for the important
automobile sector is already uncertain), while risks from financial linkages appear limited.
Authorities’ views
11.
The authorities broadly shared staff views. The authorities’ latest forecasts are similar to
staff projections, and they concurred on the importance of risks emanating from the euro area,
including from inaction on reform priorities. On the domestic front, the authorities were slightly
more optimistic than staff regarding labor market prospects, which would provide modest support
to domestic demand and revenue.

REVIVING STRONG GROWTH
Export-led growth has served Slovakia well by fostering a rapid catching-up with
European income levels, but convergence progress has slowed, employment creation has
been limited, and regional disparities have widened. The weak domestic labor market has
also been a factor in holding back domestic demand, even while the high productivity
export sector generates current account surpluses. A range of structural reforms would
help maintain competitiveness and promote more enduring, inclusive, and job-rich
growth. This would help to strengthen domestic demand and preserve competitiveness,
consistent with maintaining external balance in the Slovak economy.
12.
Slovakia’s growth model has been based on dynamic export sectors. Growth has
depended heavily on FDI and foreign demand: exports of goods and services almost doubled from
roughly 55 percent to 95 percent of GDP between 1995 and 2012. Over time, Slovakia has improved
its comparative advantage in knowledge-intensive manufacturing as part of global supply chains.
But it remains specialized in more downstream stages of production in a few sectors (automobiles
and electronics, in particular), raising risks from external shocks (Box 2). Commercial and investment
links with Germany have been crucial—about 20 percent of Slovakia’s exports go to Germany

Box 2. Slovak Republic: Integration into Global Supply Chains 1/
In the last two decades, Slovakia has become extensively integrated into the global economy and
global supply chains (GSCs). The degree of openness of the economy, as measured by the sum of exports
and imports of goods as a percent of GDP, has grown steadily from around 100 percent at the end of
the 1990s to 170 percent in 2012. This expansion was supported by significant inflows of foreign direct
investment and went hand-in-hand with growing participation of the Slovak economy in GSCs. The share of
foreign inputs and domestically produced inputs used in other countries’ exports, which is a measure of a
country’s participation in GSCs, increased from 50 percent in 1995 to 63 percent before the large trade
collapse in 2008. Slovakia ranks second among OECD economies in terms of being most integrated into
GSCs and its foreign trade has become more concentrated in terms of products and trade partners.2/
Participation in GSCs has significantly changed Slovakia’s export structure. Empirical evidence shows
that changes in a country’s revealed comparative advantages (RCA)—measured in terms of domestic value
added (DVA)—in knowledge-intensive manufacturing sectors are positively correlated with changes in the
foreign value added (FVA) shares in GDP. In other words, with participation in GSCs, countries’ exports seem
to shift toward more knowledge-intensive sectors. For example, in the early 1990s, Slovakia showed no RCA
in the transportation and electronic sectors, which started emerging only in 2007. A similar pattern can be
detected for countries such as the Czech Republic and Hungary, which are also extensively involved in GSCs.
Currently, exports of vehicles and electronic products account for 38 percent of Slovakia’s total exports.
Slovakia’s business cycle has become much more synchronized with Germany’s. Germany is the largest
trade partner for Slovakia with the share of FVA from Germany in Slovakia’s exports having increased from
5 percent in 1995 to 9 percent in 2008. As a result, Slovakia’s exports and GDP developments have become

Germany could be passed on to Slovakia. Value-added figures show that Slovakia’s exports to countries
outside of Europe, including the U.S. and China, have grown from 18 to 27 percent of exports
between 1995 and 2009.

Participation in GSCs offers significant opportunities but poses risks as well. Research shows that the
vulnerability of individual countries to global shocks is heavily influenced by their participation and position
in GSCs (OECD, 2012). Specialization in more downstream stages of GSCs and in a few specific industries
makes Slovakia vulnerable to global market conditions. Although Germany will continue to play a crucial
role, going forward, with a view to mitigating those risks, Slovakia might seek to gradually diversify its
production and trade partners, including by encouraging FDI from other countries. To this end, improving
the business environment, including by seeking ways to increase public sector efficiency, is a key priority,
while improving labor market efficiency (both in terms of flexibility and mobility) would help the economy
adjust more rapidly to external shocks.

Unemployment has remained high since the global crisis (Box 3). After falling for a
number of years and reaching single digits in 2008, unemployment rose sharply after the crisis with
only a modest improvement in 2010–11 when growth averaged 3.8 percent. The dynamic export
industries are mainly capital intensive and firms’ investments have aimed at improving productivity
at the expense of employment. Long-term unemployment has been a feature of the Slovak
economy for some time and the recent crisis has exacerbated the problem. Also, between 2008
and 2012, youth unemployment nearly doubled. More than one-third of young people are
unemployed, risking a lost generation and heightened demographic challenges.

some uncertainty. Slovakia’s unemployment benefits
appear to be limited in terms of both net replacement
rates and duration, even when compared with other
countries in the region. In the current context of
insufficient labor demand, the greater risk might be
that restrictive unemployment benefits contribute to
increasing poverty without promoting job-searching.

In addition, the composition of ALMP spending
could be more effective. Start-up incentives and
temporary activation works account for about onethird of Slovakia’s ALMP spending. Start-up
incentives have wide eligibility criteria, are not
means-tested, and are not adequately monitored,
raising the risk of misuse of scarce resources.

The average tax wedge for a single person earning

Nonetheless, taxation might contribute to lower

guidance. In addition to the importance of strong

can improve labor market performance (Andersen and
others, 2011). The so-called “flexicurity” model combines flexible employment protection, mainly by easing
hiring and lay-off procedures and costs for employers, with a solid social safety net, which is backed by an
extensive and effective system of activation policies, ranging from short counseling and assessment
programs to job training and wage-subsidized jobs.

Policy issues
15.
Shortcomings in employment services, education and training; labor taxes; and
impediments to mobility stand out as possible factors contributing to high unemployment.
Employment protection legislation is not restrictive when compared with peers and unemployment
benefits are low, but frequent changes to the Labor Code could create uncertainty (e.g., reforms to
reduce restrictions in 2011 were partially reversed in 2012). An even more flexible labor market (e.g.,
lowering disincentives to bring on new employees) might be appropriate given youth and long-term
unemployment levels that are well above peers. Wages do not appear high and compare favorably
with productivity. On the other hand, labor taxation is relatively high for low-paid jobs, limiting
employment opportunities for less productive workers who represent the largest share of the
unemployed. Further, three key mechanisms seem not to work properly: (i) the transition from
unemployment back to employment; (ii) the transition from school to work; and (iii) mobility across
regions. These challenges are particularly acute for marginalized groups, whose labor potential is
largely unrealized.
16.
Actions to address unemployment and improve the business environment could lay
the foundation for stronger and more job-rich growth. Over the medium term, actions in these
areas could also have positive spillovers for moving up value chains and export diversification, which
along with fiscal buffers, would help improve resiliency to trade shocks. To this end, it is crucial to:


Lower labor taxes. When fiscal space allows, reducing the labor tax wedge could encourage
hiring, especially for low-productivity workers.



Strengthen active labor market policies (ALMPs). The issue is not only to bring overall ALMP
expenditure more in line with other European countries but to improve the composition and the
cost-efficiency of current spending. Priorities should include promoting employability through
tailored activation incentives and services, increasing the share of spending allocated to training,
and reforming and strengthening public employment services as part of a comprehensive
strategy to improve labor market institutions and policies.



Improve the quality of education and training. Employers cited the need to match educational
curriculums and vocational training more closely to job requirements, and to combine practical
experience with training. The demand for high-skilled labor is also likely to increase if Slovakia’s
production possibility frontier were to expand towards new and more sophisticated goods or if
there is progress in moving upstream in existing supply chains. The recently approved act on
vocational education and training is a step in the right direction.



Enhance mobility. Regional integration and labor mobility would benefit from infrastructure
improvements (e.g., highway links to the east) and easing of rental housing regulations, thereby
unlocking additional pools of labor and parts of the country for business opportunities.



Strengthen the business climate. Slovakia’s regulatory burden compares unfavorably with other
EU countries, and competitor countries which were lagging behind have been catching up. The

efficient provision of “backbone” services (e.g., starting a business, investor protection, and
infrastructure) could help safeguard competitiveness while also being a catalyst for growth and
export diversification. Improvements in public sector efficiency and the legal environment
should be a priority and could encourage entrepreneurship and innovation while limiting
opportunities for dishonest behaviors (Transparency International ranks Slovakia below the
majority of European countries surveyed in its Corruption Perceptions Index).

Authorities’ views
17.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to reduce unemployment, improve
education and training, and enhance the business environment. Steps have been taken to
reform ALMPs by eliminating less effective programs and focusing resources on better services for
disadvantaged job seekers. While fiscal adjustment needs limit the scope to reduce the tax burden
on low-income employees, a labor cost subsidy for newly created jobs for disadvantaged job
seekers (youth, long-term, and unemployed workers over 50) has been introduced. Vocational
education and training and education amendments are being implemented to link curriculums more
closely to employer needs, pilot a “dual-system” approach so that students gain practical experience
directly in firms, and improve education for marginalized groups. Although it is early to assess
recent changes to the Labor Code, the authorities did not consider them likely to have adversely
affected employment. The government has embarked on a major reform to streamline public
administration procedures and improve service efficiency for both citizens and businesses. Also, in
collaboration with the European Investment Fund, the government has set up a €100 million fund to
provide bank guarantees as well as venture capital to innovative small- and medium-sized
enterprises.

ENSURING HIGH-QUALITY FISCAL CONSOLIDATION
The government over-performed on its 2012 deficit target and, despite a weaker
economic environment, achievement of the 2013 target of 2.9 percent of GDP looks
within reach, which could allow exit from the EU’s EDP. Given some reliance on
temporary measures in the past, substantial additional adjustment is needed in 2014 and
subsequent years so that Slovakia can avoid hitting debt brakes under its fiscal
responsibility act (FRA) that would trigger overly abrupt fiscal adjustment, and to comply
with EU commitments. The emphasis should be on implementing high-quality permanent
measures.
Background
18.
The fiscal consolidation target was more than met in 2012 despite challenges from
weaker growth.2 The progressive slowing of the economy and falling domestic demand affected
revenue, especially VAT and corporate income tax receipts, compounding persistent inefficiencies in
VAT collection. Wage bill overruns and higher-than-budgeted assumption of past hospital debts put
additional pressure on the budget. These adverse developments were offset by a combination of
revenue measures adopted during the year—e.g., a broadening of the base for the bank levy, a
special levy on regulated enterprises, a shift in pension contributions from the second to the first
pillar, and allowing people to move out of the second pillar—as well as lower-than-budgeted use of
EU Funds, lower investment, and some savings on social insurance outlays. A positive contribution
also came from local governments, which for the first time in five years recorded a small surplus,
reflecting a significant curtailment in capital expenditure.
19.
The authorities are determined to meet their 2013 deficit target of 2.9 percent of GDP
to allow for EDP exit on schedule. To this end, the 2013 budget implemented numerous revenue
measures, including an increase in the corporate income tax rate from 19 to 23 percent, the
introduction of a new 25 percent bracket for personal income above €3,246, an adjustment in the
tax regime for self-employed and short-term work agreements, and changes to the assessment base
for social contributions. Expenditure savings are mainly concentrated on the wage bill, which is
planned to be reduced by 6 percent compared to the 2012 outturn, as well as on public investment
and other spending, including by local governments. Owing to weaker-than-expected revenue
developments in the first months of the year, the government took steps including use of budget
reserves and cuts to health care, capital, and ministry budgets. It also expects to realize higher
dividend income.
20.
Public debt is approaching more restrictive debt brake thresholds under the FRA.
General government gross debt reached 52 percent of GDP at end-2012. However, debt
developments reflected not only Slovakia’s borrowing due to its deficit, but also its EFSF and ESM

contributions to support other euro area members totaling about 2 percent of GDP, and the
decision to take advantage of favorable market conditions to pre-finance a significant portion
of 2013 borrowing needs. General government cash balances currently amount to about 5 percent
of GDP or roughly half of 2013 gross funding needs. If gross debt (the indicator used in the FRA)
reaches 55 percent of GDP, which could happen as early as this year, 3 percent cuts in many
spending lines would be required in the following year. Crossing the 57 percent threshold would
force the government to submit a balanced budget, which would imply sharp adjustment with
significant growth impact when output is still below potential.

The government submits to the Parliament a proposal of measures for debt reduction and the wages of
government members are frozen to the previous fiscal year level.
The Ministry of Finance reduces current year state budget expenditure by 3 percent (with specified
exemptions such as interest payments, EU funds, co-financing and EU budget contributions) while restrictions
apply to the release of funds from the reserves of the government and the Prime Minister. If the debt level
exceeds this threshold for consecutive years, the reduction happens only in the first year. In addition, the
government should submit to the parliament a general government budget for the subsequent year that
does not increase the nominal expenditure level (with previously mentioned specified exemptions); it applies
to local governments as well.
The government should submit to the Parliament a balanced (or in surplus) general government budget; it
applies also to local governments.
The government asks the parliament for a vote of confidence.

1/ Starting in 2018, the debt ceiling will be gradually reduced by one percentage point of GDP each year to reach 50 percent of GDP by 2027.

Policy issues
21.

Staff forecast that the 2013 target is within reach, but automatic stabilizers should

be allowed to operate if risks to growth materialize. Assuming growth of 0.6 percent and

based on existing policies and policy intentions (including, if needed, readiness to accelerate 2014
measures that would have little macroeconomic impact such as the sale of strategic oil reserves),
staff estimate that the budget deficit target of 2.9 percent of GDP can be met. There are risks to this
scenario, including the possibility of still weaker growth or difficulties in achieving public sector
wage reductions or savings from local governments, on which the state’s influence is limited, and no
buffers remain in the 2013 budget. If growth disappoints further or interest costs rise due to market
volatility, automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate to avoid extra drag on output when
growth is weakest. In a scenario where the headline deficit exceeded 2.9 percent of GDP due to
weaker growth, the structural adjustment would still be significant at just over 1 percent of GDP.
22.
Sizeable consolidation efforts in 2014 and beyond are needed to avoid debt rising
above a domestic debt threshold and to comply with EU commitments. Under an unchangedpolicies scenario, the general government deficit is projected to widen to 3.8 percent of GDP

16

SLOVAK REPUBLIC

in 2014, mainly reflecting the unwinding of temporary measures. This scenario factors in a return of
the VAT rate to 19 percent as envisaged by law once the deficit falls below 3 percent of GDP and
assumes significant expenditure containment in line with the government’s plans (e.g., a sustained
public wage bill freeze). The deficit will then stabilize around 3½ percent of GDP in the outer years.

3/ In percent of potential output.
4/ Consistent with estimates of the authorities in their latest Stability Program, the effect on growth from fiscal measures assumes a multiplier of about
0.3 in the year they are enacted and about half that effect in the subsequent year. This reflects the high degree of openness, lack of binding financing
constraints, and relatively greater reliance on revenue measures which are estimated to have a smaller impact on growth.

As a result, gross government debt would climb over the 57 percent of GDP debt brake that would
mandate a sharp move to balance the budget. To avoid this risk and comply with EU rules, which
require Slovakia to implement an annual structural adjustment of at least 0.5 percent of GDP until
the medium-term objective (MTO) of a structural deficit of 0.5 percent of GDP is achieved, staff
estimate that a little over 2 percent of GDP in additional permanent fiscal adjustment measures will
be required over 2014–16 with about 1 percent thereafter. This would imply more moderate growth
over the forecast period (the text table provides an illustrative scenario), but would keep debt below

efficiency and savings. More broadly, evidence suggests that Slovakia has significant scope to
improve public administration efficiency, which would support more effective use of EU funds,

Box 4. Slovak Republic: Improving Tax Collection
Improving VAT efficiency, which is low and worsening, stands out as a key priority. C-efficiency—the
ratio between actual VAT revenue and the proceeds that would be obtained by applying the standard VAT
rate to final consumption—is below 0.5 and compares

country’s VAT system departs from the application of
a uniform VAT to all transactions under the assumption of full compliance. To understand precisely where
improvements in the VAT might be expected, C-efficiency can be decomposed into a “policy gap,” which
captures the impact of rate differentiations and exemptions, and a “compliance gap,” which measures the
degree of non-conformity (ranging from minor errors to tax evasion). Preliminary analysis of a granular
dataset on VAT tax returns and payments (see Annex III for details) suggests that the policy gap in Slovakia
is relatively small and unlikely to provide much scope to generate additional revenue. On the other hand,
over-claiming of VAT input credits rather than under-reporting of tax due seems the most important factor
to explain the low VAT efficiency. Moreover, compliance risks appear concentrated in a few sectors. Staff will
refine its VAT gap analysis and once completed, it should provide a clearer picture of VAT compliance
conditions and help develop an effective compliance management strategy.
The government has also embarked on a comprehensive action plan to fight tax fraud. The action plan
sets out 50 precise measures and a timeline for implementation. Acknowledging that to improve VAT
compliance broader administrative and legal powers are needed, the government’s strategy comprises not
only tax measures but also amendments to business, criminal, and financial laws. The plan also envisages
strengthening information gathering capabilities, which is crucial. However, full implementation of the plan
will inevitably take time, not least because some measures are medium-term in nature and others require
negotiation with other countries. The action plan would therefore benefit from a more risk-based
prioritization of the envisaged measures through identification of businesses and activities with the highest
compliance risk.

Box 4. Slovak Republic: Improving Tax Collection (concluded)
The action plan could address international aspects of VAT non-compliance more forcefully. The
openness and deep integration of the Slovak economy into the world economy may have a bearing on VAT
non-compliance. Pure fraud through fictitious import-export transactions aside, artificial reduction of the
VAT base could be achieved through abusive intra-group transactions that shift companies’ profits out of
the Slovak jurisdiction. Therefore, the revenue authorities should be equipped with countermeasures not
only against specific VAT non-compliance but also against undue profit shifting. For example, a controlled
foreign corporation regime to tax artificially shifted profit could be introduced and transfer pricing rules to
counter abusive intra-group transactions could be applied more widely, assisted by active use of advance
pricing agreements. In addition, although there is little link with VAT issues, the corporate capitalization rule
could be strengthened, for instance through limiting abusive deductions of interest payments to foreign
parents since cross-border intra-group interest payments typically pose the highest risks.

24.
Effective fiscal institutions can help underpin sound fiscal policies. Establishment of the
Council for Budget Responsibility and adoption of the FRA (at the level of the constitution) signal
the authorities’ strong commitment to fiscal discipline. This is appropriate for a country in a
monetary union and increasingly exposed to global trade shocks as integration into global supply
chains deepens. The FRA’s reliance on gross debt figures published independently by Eurostat helps
reinforces the credibility of the FRA. On the other hand, gross debt does not adjust for factors such
as recent intergovernmental lending in the context of the crisis in Europe and the accumulation of
precautionary cash balances (pre-funding). As experience under the FRA is gained over time and
expenditure ceilings are elaborated, a proper balance should be sought between upholding strong
credibility and ensuring sufficient flexibility. This means maintaining the firm commitment to fiscal
discipline and perhaps enhancing it by covering public entities, and potentially considering a net
debt target if published by Eurostat and a smoother multi-year adjustment path toward a balanced
budget to avoid excessive impact on growth.
Authorities’ views
25.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff analysis, reiterated their strong commitment
to the 2013 deficit target, and stressed the importance of improving tax collections. They
reiterated their determination to meet the 2013 fiscal deficit target to allow for EDP exit, and to
achieve the MTO. A memorandum of understanding signed with local governments should help
control spending, and public wage bill savings were considered achievable. The authorities shared
staff’s concern that the sharp adjustment required by a balanced budget if debt crosses the
57 percent of GDP threshold could harm the economy, and stressed that debt would be expected to
remain safely below the threshold if support to other euro area members and the cash balance were
netted out. They concurred on the importance of enhancing VAT collection efficiency and reducing
tax evasion, which are top priorities for the Finance Ministry. The government recently adopted a
comprehensive action plan to combat tax fraud and welcomed IMF analysis to support
improvements in VAT efficiency. The authorities argued that linking real estate taxation to the
market value of property will require substantial preparation, but work is underway and scope for
collecting additional revenue under the current real estate tax could be considered. The authorities

20

did not see raising the retirement age more rapidly than stipulated by the recent pension reform as
desirable due to relatively low life expectancy and considered that a more accelerated transition
would produce only small savings.

PRESERVING FINANCIAL STABILITY
The banking system remains sound, reflecting a traditional business model and prudent
oversight. Bank profitability is under pressure due to a weak operating environment and
a special levy on bank liabilities. With the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), a
significant portion of the Slovak banking sector will come under ECB direct supervision,
underscoring the importance of close collaboration between the ECB and the NBS to
maintain effective supervision.
Background
26.
Slovak banks’ soundness reflects a traditional retail-oriented business model with
healthy capital and liquidity buffers. Foreign bank subsidiaries are key players in Slovakia, but the
banking system’s reliance on external funding is limited with lending mostly financed through
domestic retail deposits. Ample liquidity allowed banks to repay about two-thirds of ECB LTROs in
the first quarter of 2013. Bank capitalization is solid with a core Tier I capital ratio of 14.7 percent
in 2012, up more than 2 percentage points from 2011, reflecting in part the NBS’s strict rules on
profit distribution. Non-performing loans (NPLs) are relatively low (5.2 percent of total loans in 2012)
and well-provisioned (loan loss allowances amount to about three-quarters of NPLs).

Household lending continued to expand at a relatively rapid pace, while corporate
credit declined. Although lending rates have broadly tracked easing in the ECB’s monetary stance,
lending to the corporate sector progressively slowed since 2011 before contracting in 2012, mainly
reflecting weakening credit demand due the uncertain economic outlook. Competition for retail
mortgages has intensified and while mortgage loans remained broadly flat, less stringentlyregulated “other housing loans” have continued to grow. Nonetheless, risks related to household

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

lending seem low. Loan-to-value (LTV) ratios returned to more customary levels (around 70 percent)
in the second half of 2012 after an increase earlier in the year, and the housing market remains
depressed, with prices essentially flat for some time and about 20 percent below the 2008 peak.
28.
The weak domestic economy and temporary levy dented banks’ profits. Lower lending
volumes together with pressure on interest margins, driven by increased competition for deposits,
curtailed gross income. Despite some improvements in cost efficiency and cost of risk, as measured
by the share of gross income absorbed by administrative expenses and loan-loss provisioning
respectively, banks’ aggregate net profits declined by almost 30 percent. The current levy on bank
liabilities (0.4 percent) to fund potential future resolution costs is relatively high in comparison to
other jurisdictions, but will fall based on accumulated payments and asset coverage. In the first half
of 2012, levy payments amounted to about 12 percent of the sector’s pre-tax profits, but its impact
varied across banks.

Going forward, there is a risk that credit quality could deteriorate given economic

growth is likely to slow owing to high unemployment. Banks’ NPLs may increase and the high
borrower concentrations in the banks’ corporate portfolios reinforce concerns, though limited
private sector debt and low interest rates may be mitigating factors. As a result, banks’ already
falling profitability is likely to remain under pressure, though capital buffers are robust.
30.
The effects of bank levies on lending and costs should be kept in mind, and proceeds
might be more clearly allocated. There is a risk that additional burdens on banks may hamper the
transmission of supportive monetary conditions to the real economy. The proceeds of the bank levy
might finance a more well-defined fund dedicated to absorbing potential bank restructuring costs,
and, to avoid creating a new institution, it could be managed by the NBS, or by the Deposit
Protection Fund (DPF) under a modified mandate. A flexible approach could help accommodate
potential changes in EU banking rules.

Establishment of the SSM and an effective banking union would strengthen the
environment for banks in Slovakia. Although Slovak banks do not rely on parent funding, creation
of the SSM is a key step in preserving financial stability and market integration in the euro area.

administrators could be strengthened and the
resolution toolkit broadened, for example by allowing purchase and assumption operations and the
establishment of bridge banks. Consideration could also be given to gradually increasing the
resources of the DPF. Any changes should take into account expected European directives and
banking union developments.
Authorities’ views
32.
The authorities saw little effect on lending from policy actions and emphasized their
commitment to a prudent financial sector approach. The authorities considered credit
developments primarily demand-driven, with little or no effect on lending from taxation and
prudential regulation. On the bank levy, the authorities argued that the proceeds held as part of the
government’s cash balances are available if needed for resolution and that the levy rate will
gradually decline with the accumulation of resources. They also observed that the small size of the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

SLOVAK REPUBLIC

banking system has facilitated close supervision, but stand ready to implement amendments
required by forthcoming EU directives. While supportive of the SSM, NBS officials stressed the
importance of good cooperation and expressed concern if SSM encouraged the conversion of
subsidiaries into branches, potentially lessening their scope for prudent supervision (a subsidiary of
a large European bank converted to a branch last year).

STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
After a strong recovery in the wake of the global crisis, the Slovak economy is
expected to continue growing, but at a significantly slower pace in 2013. The Slovak Republic
has been among Europe's most dynamic economies in recent years, largely due to sizeable foreign
investment in the auto sector that led to rapidly rising exports, much faster growth than most others
in the region, and limited vulnerabilities. Spillover risks are materializing, however, with weaker
demand expected from trading partners, especially in Europe. This, coupled with still anemic
domestic demand, has worsened the near-term outlook.
34.
Risks are tilted to the downside. Domestic demand is expected to slowly recover but will
remain restrained for some time due to ongoing fiscal adjustment as well as high unemployment. If
prolonged, high unemployment risks negatively affecting growth, fiscal consolidation, and debt
ratios, as well as long-term labor participation and productivity. If weakness in Europe is deeper or
more drawn out than expected, this could reduce export demand and contribute to uncertainty
holding back investment. Integration into international supply chains has brought great
opportunities, but can also amplify risks from trade shocks, underscoring the importance over the
medium term of new sources of growth and export diversification.
35.
Addressing very high unemployment—particularly youth and long-term
unemployment—should be a top priority. Efforts underway to strengthen education, training, and
ALMPs including targeting to disadvantaged groups are welcome, but are still at an early stage.
Public employment services should be strengthened and funding for ALMPs—which was increased
in the 2013 budget—should be a priority even amidst budget consolidation. Effective use of EU
Funds will be especially important in these areas. Steps to streamline administrative burdens for
businesses are also welcome, and should be complemented by action to achieve a more stable,
open, and predictable business climate with respect to labor regulations, the legal environment,
procurement practices, and corruption.
36.
Slovakia has demonstrated its strong commitment to sustainable public finances but
further progress is needed. The fiscal deficit has come down substantially since 2009 and
important structural reforms have been implemented, such as those that strengthen the pension
fund’s finances, but other sources of revenue or savings have been temporary or have affected
valuable projects such as those financed by EU Funds. Slovakia’s gross public debt, which includes
contributions to support other euro area members and a healthy level of cash balances, remains
manageable. However, to avoid economically harmful effects from debt rising above thresholds

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SLOVAK REPUBLIC

under the FRA as well as to comply with EU targets, substantial additional adjustment measures will
be needed for a number of years.
37.
The 2013 fiscal deficit target is achievable, but automatic stabilizers should be allowed
to operate if risks to growth materialize. Provisions in the 2013 budget, additional steps taken so
far, and the government’s readiness to take further measures that would have little macroeconomic
impact suggest the 2013 target can be met. There are risks to this scenario, including the possibility
of still weaker growth or difficulties controlling public wages and local government budgets. And
should growth further disappoint, automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate to avoid a
further drag on output when growth is weakest.
38.
Efforts should focus on identifying high quality fiscal measures for 2014 and over the
medium term. Further fiscal consolidation is needed to ensure medium-term debt sustainability,
and in light of EU rules and a domestic debt brake that would mandate an overly sharp move to
balance the budget. In addition to maintaining the current VAT rate, adjustment efforts should focus
on improving VAT collection efficiency and reducing tax evasion, introducing a property value-based
real estate tax, and improving spending efficiency. Moving more quickly to a higher retirement age
and potentially raising the overall age target would improve the long-term sustainability of the
pension system.
39.
A traditional banking model and prudent supervisory approach have contributed to a
sound banking system. Slovakia’s banking sector is liquid and well capitalized, with low and wellprovisioned NPLs, although a weaker economic outlook could have effects on credit quality. Bank
taxes have risen at a time when the operating environment is weak and credit to firms is declining,
hitting profits. The levy should be lowered to be more in line with other countries in Europe and the
proceeds allocated to a more well-defined special resolution fund. The size of the banking system
has facilitated close supervision (and risks are low), but the current supervisory framework could be
enhanced through a more well-specified intervention and resolution framework, in line with
expected European directives and banking union developments.
40.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with the Slovak Republic take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to
materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks
surrounding the baseline. The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of
discussions with authorities.

Annex III. Slovak Republic: Measuring the VAT Gap
Given low and declining VAT efficiency in Slovakia, improving VAT collection is one of the
government’s top priorities. To help raise VAT efficiency to the level of EU peers, an in-depth VAT
gap analysis has been started with a view to measuring the compliance gap and better
understanding the determinants of the poor VAT performance (through sectoral and other detailed
revenue studies). This appendix summarizes the analytical framework (Section A) and preliminary
findings (Section B).

A. Analytical Framework
Measuring the tax gap for better compliance management
1.
A good understanding of the sources of tax non-compliance is crucial to strengthen
compliance management. There are different forms of non-compliance (fraud, non-filing, incorrect
reporting, non-payment, etc.), the relevance of which may vary by economic sector. It is therefore
critical to have an in-depth understanding of the sources of non-compliance so as to better tailor
remedial actions.
2.
A detailed analysis of the tax gap provides useful information in this respect, although
it is not a panacea. As all non-compliance behaviors would eventually lead to a loss of revenue, the
amount of lost revenue, or “tax gap,” is a good indicator of non-compliance. A detailed study of the
sources of tax gaps could help understand, albeit indirectly, non-compliance behaviors. That would
in turn help tax authorities develop an effective compliance management strategy. However,
measuring tax gaps, together with complementary revenue analyses, would not always reveal how
those gaps arise. This would require more in-depth scrutiny of taxpayer behaviors, for example
through targeted tax audits.
3.
For compliance management purposes, the portion of the overall tax gap that is
primarily due to non-compliance needs to be isolated. The so-called “compliance gap” is defined
as the difference between actual tax revenues and the theoretical amount that would be collected if
all potential taxpayers fully complied with the applicable law. In this way, those revenues that the tax
system does not collect by design (e.g., reduced rates and exemptions)—the “policy gap”—are
excluded. This distinction between compliance and policy gaps is important, as the nature of the
issues related to the policy gap is quite different from those related to the compliance gap; for
example, while tax administration should aim at closing the compliance gap, reductions of the policy
gap may not always be a sound policy objective. Even when curbing the policy gap is appropriate
(e.g., overly wide exemptions), it would be a policy decision requiring the legislative changes.1
1

Tax avoidance—taxpayer behavior which is technically legal but whose sole purpose is to enjoy tax benefits against
the ‘spirit’ of the law—is also excluded from the definition, as it is beyond compliance management and would
require policy action (i.e., legislative changes). However, measuring the revenue impact of tax avoidance behavior
could be very difficult, not least because the tax regime is not expecting such behavior.

4.
Nevertheless, a broader perspective encompassing all components of the tax gap
should be maintained. It is indeed crucial to assess to what extent the overall gap is being
influenced by either compliance issues or policy choices.2 The relationship between the compliance
gap, the policy gap and the overall tax gap is illustrated in Figure 1.

In more analytical terms, a commonly used measure for revenue productivity is “C-efficiency”, which
is an indicator of the departure of the VAT from a perfectly enforced tax levied at a uniform rate on
all consumption:3
C-efficiency =
As discussed above, the C-efficiency can be decomposed into a policy gap and a compliance gap:
C-efficiency = (1 – policy gap)(1 – compliance gap)
In a nutshell, the design features of the VAT are essentially two: the exemptions (i.e., the extent of
final consumption not subject to VAT) and the rate structure. Therefore, the policy gap can in turn
2

In order to identify the size of the “policy gap” the current policy structure must be measured against some
normative policy structure, similar to the process needed to estimate the value of tax expenditures. As the primary
purpose here is to address non-compliance issues, we could simply assume that the normative policy structure is the
current standard rate being applicable to all potential taxpayers and activities without any exemption (or
alternatively, in the case of Slovakia, with only those exemptions specified in EU directives). In a different context, a
broader definition of the policy gap might be useful; for example, to discuss policy options, the impact of a rate
reduction from 20 percent to 19 percent could be considered as a policy gap.
3

For further details on C-efficiency, see Michael Keen, 2013, “The Anatomy of VAT,” IMF Working Paper WP/13/111.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

45

SLOVAK REPUBLIC

be decomposed into an exemption gap and a rate gap, which captures the impact of differentiation
in statutory rates across goods:
C-efficiency = (1 – exemption gap)(1 – rate gap)(1 – compliance gap)
This clearly shows that a good deal of caution should be used in interpreting the C-efficiency for
compliance management purposes. Low C-efficiency does not necessarily imply that the compliance
gap is large. For example, as the provision of pure public goods is not taxable under any VAT design,
a low C-efficiency may be the result of a high share of those goods in final consumption.
Expenditure and production approach for VAT gap analysis
5.
The VAT gap can be measured in two ways: the expenditure approach and the
production approach. The former looks at the VAT as a tax on (final) consumption, whereas the
latter as a tax on the value added in the production process. Accordingly, they are also referred to as
the consumption approach and the value added approach, respectively.
Expenditure (consumption) approach
6.
The expenditure approach estimates the gap from the ultimate VAT tax base, that is,
final consumption. If there is no reduced rate or exemption, final consumption multiplied by the
standard rate would be equal to the potential VAT yield. If there are reduced rates, the potential
amount of VAT proceeds would be equal to the sum of final consumption of each commodity
multiplied by the respective applicable VAT rate. The various rates that are applied to intermediate
consumption can be ignored since the VAT is specifically designed to remove all tax burdens on
intermediate inputs (including investment).
7.
The application of exemptions makes the VAT system more complex, as it puts certain
supplies outside the VAT system, severing the VAT chain.4 While the mechanism of exemption is
rather simple—the VAT is not levied on certain output categories and the VAT on their inputs is not
creditable—the way it affects VAT revenue may not be straightforward, especially when it occurs in
the middle of the production chain. There are broadly three cases to consider: (1) when final
consumption supply is exempted, only the value added by the person making the supply escapes
VAT (VAT already paid earlier in the production chain is not recoverable);5 (2) when an exempt
supply is made to a person making taxable supply, there is no revenue impact, as the complete VAT
base will be restored (i.e., the value added that escaped VAT due to the exemption will be
recouped); but (3) VAT inclusive supply used to make an exempt supply to a person making taxable

4

The VAT threshold can be considered as a special case of exemption. So is public final consumption—e.g., provision
of public goods.

5

If there is a series of consecutive and uninterrupted exemptions leading to final consumption, those exemptions can
be treated as a single exemption—with all of the value added by those making such exemptions escaping VAT.

46

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SLOVAK REPUBLIC

supply will be subject to tax: such supply will be taxed twice and VAT itself is taxed.6 Since the last
case can be reasonably assumed to be small, the potential VAT revenue is determined as follows:
1

1

where,
= the potential net VAT,
= final consumption of commodity c (of M commodities, Eth through Mth commodities
are exempt)
= intermediate consumption to supply commodity c,
= investment made to supply commodity c,
= the weighted average VAT rate applicable to input to supply commodity c, and
= the VAT rate that applies to commodity c (zero if zero-rated)
Although the expenditure approach starts from final consumption, for which reliable data should be
relatively easy to obtain, the second term on exempt supplies (including provision of pure public
goods) requires further estimation on intermediate consumption and investment patterns by
exempt suppliers.
Production (value added) approach
8.

The value added approach follows the process of VAT collection along the production

chain—taxing output with input credited. Any registered VAT taxpayer would (i) collect VAT on
imports, (ii) collect VAT on domestic supply, (iii) receive credit on VAT paid on input (including
investment), and (iv) receive credit on VAT paid on input for export (zero-rated).7 Assuming a single
representative taxpayer per sector (i.e., ignoring taxpayer specific treatments, if any):
1

where,
= the potential net VAT for a sector,
= imports by sector s of commodity c,
= output by sector s of commodity c,
6

This additional tax on VAT inclusive input is one-off and will not cascade down the chain, as VAT would relieve any
tax paid on input as long as taxable supply continues.
7

To “collect” here means to collect and submit the VAT to the tax authorities. For example, VAT on input will be
“collected” by the supplier, although the purchaser pays a VAT-inclusive price.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

47

SLOVAK REPUBLIC

= exports by sector s of commodity c,
= intermediate demand (consumption) by sector s of commodity c,
= investment by sector s of commodity c,
= the VAT rate that applies to commodity c (zero if zero-rated or exempt),
= the proportion of output for a sector which is exempt output, and
= the proportion of output for a sector produced by registered businesses.
9.
The value added approach, while requiring detailed supply-use tables, enables sectoral
gap analyses. As discussed above, the value added approach requires matrices of domestic output
(Y), imports (M), intermediate consumption (N), investment (I) and exports (X) by individual sectors
and products. Supply tables provide total supply comprising Y and M, while use tables provide total
use comprising N, final consumption (FC), I and X.8 From the supply-use identity, it can be shown
that the above calculation (Y + M - (N + I + X)) is a decomposition of final consumption (FC). The
value added approach, when matrices can be reasonably estimated, enables gap analyses by sectors,
which would be instrumental in developing an effective compliance management strategy.

B. Preliminary Findings

9

10.
In Slovakia, a VAT gap model based on the value added approach is being developed
with assistance from IMF staff. The model, which combines detailed tax returns and payments
data, national accounts and other statistical data, is expected to complement and expand the earlier
analyses by the Slovak authorities based on the expenditure approach.10 The preliminary findings
from the new value added model are summarized below.
11.
The preliminary results indicate that the compliance gap is the main driver of
Slovakia’s VAT inefficiency. The policy gap is indeed relatively small. As discussed above, the
policy gap is a function of the rate gap and the exemption gap. The relative sizes of those two
metrics depend upon the system of rates and exemptions currently in force in Slovakia and the
structure of the economy. In Slovakia, compared with other countries, relatively few categories of
suppliers are taxed at reduced rate or exempted, and their share in the overall economy is relatively
small. Figure 2 shows the hypothetical policy gaps that selected EU countries would experience if the
Slovak structure of VAT rates and exemptions were applied. The low ranking of Slovakia confirms
that the Slovak economy has more room to tax than peers. Since the policy gap proves to be small,
Slovakia’ low C-efficiency denotes very serious problems of tax compliance.

8

Supply-use tables should provide sector-by-product matrices for Y and N, but only product vectors for M, I and X.
Where a matrix is not available, it needs to be estimated from product vector and other information.
9

The modeling for the VAT gap estimate and related revenue analyses (initially for 2008-2012) are still at preliminary
stages. All the analyses in this appendix are subject to revisions and therefore should be understood and treated as
illustrations.

Over-crediting might be contributing
more to the VAT gap than under-reporting.
Reported gross VAT (VAT collected on output)
seems broadly consistent with the model
estimates. However, reported net VAT (VAT
payable after deducting applicable input credit) is
much smaller than the model results. This implies
that those who are filing VAT returns are overclaiming input VAT credit.

14.
The legitimacy of input credit should
be checked systematically, without hampering economic transactions. In Slovakia, claimed
credits are cleared without delay (being either offset against gross VAT or refunded). This is a very
good practice that should continue. However, such a good system, if misused, could pose serious
risks for revenue. To strike a good balance between effective screening of fraudulent claims and
smooth clearance of claimed credit, a risk-based approach should be considered. However, some
forms of fraud, most notably “carousel” or missing trader intra-community (MTIC) fraud, do not
directly appear in the model as fraudulent claims (MTIC fraud would replace intra-community
imports with domestic supply, producing valid input credit but without collecting VAT on such
domestic supply). Certain inferences would then be necessary to supplement the model outcomes.
Sectoral analysis
15.
Compliance risk appears to be concentrated in a few sectors. The discrepancies between
sectoral net VAT (VAT due on supply less VAT on input for the sector) and theoretical VAT revenue
of the sector (derived through the value added model)—or sectoral VAT gaps—are concentrated in
a few sectors. While there may well be legitimate causes behind some of the discrepancies (which
would need to be reflected in the model through future refinement), all major discrepancies should

49

SLOVAK REPUBLIC

be clearly recognized and explained. If gaps are being generated by preferential treatments, policy
makers should be aware of the costs of maintaining such regimes. Otherwise, these discrepancies
signal a compliance gap, and thus targeted analyses should be conducted to determine the
appropriate remedial actions to address the specific non-compliance issues in those sectors.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of data provided to the Fund are adequate for
surveillance purposes. From the point of view of macroeconomic analysis and policy making,
significant data improvements have been made, particularly in the national accounts. A data ROSC
mission during February–March 2004 found that the integrity, methodological soundness, and
reliability of the data were satisfactory, despite some shortcomings in the data revision policy. The
main issues remaining are: (i) a significant statistical discrepancy between the supply and demand
sides for GDP; and (ii) weaknesses in the data on prices and volumes of imports and exports. The
Slovak Republic has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since 1996 and
observes or exceeds all related standards.
2.
With regard to timeliness and public access, the authorities in general follow a free
and open data publication policy. Data are promptly released to news services, and are also
published regularly in various monthly and quarterly statistical publications, and on the Internet
according to a pre-announced schedule. Data on core surveillance variables are provided regularly
to the Fund, and with minimal lags: a week or less for foreign exchange reserves; a day for monthly
state budget implementation data; 10 days to a month for consumer prices, reserve money, broad
money, and interest rates; two months for foreign trade data; and about three months for other
fiscal, balance of payments, and national accounts data.

Real Sector and Prices
3.
Despite significant progress made so far, the compilation of the national accounts
statistics still suffers some weaknesses. The quarterly and annual national accounts data exhibit
significant statistical discrepancies between the supply side and the demand side. An important
outstanding issue is the compilation of reliable price deflators for imports and exports that would
enable better decomposition into volume and price changes. The statistical authorities are aware of
these issues and improvements are pending.

Fiscal Sector
4.
General government statistics are compiled in accordance with the methodology of
the ESA95. The Ministry of Finance compiles its fiscal accounts according to ESA95 standards and
reports general government net lending/borrowing and gross debt on a quarterly basis. Monthly
reconciliation of government operations above and below-the-line is restricted to state budget
transactions on a cash basis. A modern treasury system has been operating since January 2004. The
new system has improved fiscal control and public debt management by allowing the recording of
expenditures at the planning and commitment stages.

these issue and are working to address them.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with the
Slovak Republic
On August 2, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Slovak Republic1 and considered and endorsed the staff
appraisal without a meeting on a lapse-of-time basis.2
Following a sharp downturn in 2009 in the context of the global economic and financial crisis,
Slovakia emerged as one of the fastest growing economies in the EU, supported in particular by
substantial foreign investment in the auto sector and subsequent exports. Growth slowed to
2 percent in 2012 as the impact of exceptionally large investments in 2011 faded. For 2013, the
growth forecast is 0.6 percent, reflecting especially the weakening external environment.
Domestic demand has been held back by persistently high unemployment—around 14 percent,
with about two-thirds of this long-term, and an especially high rate among Slovakia’s youth
(around 35 percent).
Slovakia has reduced its fiscal deficit substantially since 2009, reaching a deficit of 4.3 percent
of GDP in 2012, and enjoys moderate public and private debt levels. Inflation fell to 1.6 percent
in June 2013, record trade and current account surpluses were recorded in 2012, and the banking
system remains sound with healthy levels of capital and liquidity.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2013 Article IV consultation with the Slovak Republic, Executive Directors
endorsed the staff’s appraisal, as follows:
After a strong recovery in the wake of the global crisis, the Slovak economy is expected to
continue growing, but at a significantly slower pace in 2013. The Slovak Republic has been
among Europe's most dynamic economies in recent years, largely due to sizeable foreign
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

investment in the auto sector that led to rapidly rising exports, much faster growth than most
others in the region, and limited vulnerabilities. Spillover risks are materializing, however, with
weaker demand expected from trading partners, especially in Europe. This, coupled with still
anemic domestic demand, has worsened the near-term outlook.
Risks are tilted to the downside. Domestic demand is expected to slowly recover but will remain
restrained for some time due to ongoing fiscal adjustment as well as high unemployment. If
prolonged, high unemployment risks negatively affecting growth, fiscal consolidation, and debt
ratios, as well as long-term labor participation and productivity. If weakness in Europe is deeper
or more drawn out than expected, this could reduce export demand and contribute to uncertainty
holding back investment. Integration into international supply chains has brought great
opportunities, but can also amplify risks from trade shocks, underscoring the importance over the
medium term of new sources of growth and export diversification.
Addressing very high unemployment—particularly youth and long-term unemployment—should
be a top priority. Efforts underway to strengthen education, training, and active labor market
policies (ALMPs) including targeting to disadvantaged groups are welcome, but are still at an
early stage. Public employment services should be strengthened and funding for ALMPs—which
was increased in the 2013 budget—should be a priority even amidst budget consolidation.
Effective use of EU Funds will be especially important in these areas. Steps to streamline
administrative burdens for businesses are also welcome, and should be complemented by action
to achieve a more stable, open, and predictable business climate with respect to labor regulations,
the legal environment, procurement practices, and corruption.
Slovakia has demonstrated its strong commitment to sustainable public finances but further
progress is needed. The fiscal deficit has come down substantially since 2009 and important
structural reforms have been implemented, such as those that strengthen the pension fund’s
finances, but other sources of revenue or savings have been temporary or have affected valuable
projects such as those financed by EU Funds. Slovakia’s gross public debt, which includes
contributions to support other euro area members and a healthy level of cash balances, remains
manageable. However, to avoid economically harmful effects from debt rising above thresholds
under the FRA (Forward Rate Agreement) as well as to comply with EU targets, substantial
additional adjustment measures will be needed for a number of years.
The 2013 fiscal deficit target is achievable, but automatic stabilizers should be allowed to
operate if risks to growth materialize. Provisions in the 2013 budget, additional steps taken so
far, and the government’s readiness to take further measures that would have little
macroeconomic impact suggest the 2013 target can be met. There are risks to this scenario,
including the possibility of still weaker growth or difficulties controlling public wages and local
government budgets. And should growth further disappoint, automatic stabilizers should be
allowed to operate to avoid a further drag on output when growth is weakest.

3

Efforts should focus on identifying high quality fiscal measures for 2014 and over the medium
term. Further fiscal consolidation is needed to ensure medium-term debt sustainability, and in
light of EU rules and a domestic debt brake that would mandate an overly sharp move to balance
the budget. In addition to maintaining the current VAT rate, adjustment efforts should focus on
improving VAT collection efficiency and reducing tax evasion, introducing a property valuebased real estate tax, and improving spending efficiency. Moving more quickly to a higher
retirement age and potentially raising the overall age target would improve the long-term
sustainability of the pension system.
A traditional banking model and prudent supervisory approach have contributed to a sound
banking system. Slovakia’s banking sector is liquid and well capitalized, with low and wellprovisioned nonperforming loans (NPLs), although a weaker economic outlook could have
effects on credit quality. Bank taxes have risen at a time when the operating environment is weak
and credit to firms is declining, hitting profits. The levy should be lowered to be more in line
with other countries in Europe and the proceeds allocated to a more well-defined special
resolution fund. The size of the banking system has facilitated close supervision (and risks are
low), but the current supervisory framework could be enhanced through a more well-specified
intervention and resolution framework, in line with expected European directives and banking
union developments.
