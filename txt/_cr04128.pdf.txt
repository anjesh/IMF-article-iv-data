EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Economic Background
•

The New Zealand economy has continued to perform strongly. Real GDP growth
moderated to 3½ percent in 2003. Domestic demand remained buoyant owing to the
strength in net immigration, solid employment growth, the wealth effects from rising
house prices, and real income gains from the New Zealand dollar’s substantial
appreciation since end-2001. Net exports, however, acted as a drag on the economy.
The unemployment rate declined below 5 percent to a 16-year low, while inflation fell
to the lower half of the official 1–3 percent target range.

•

Growth is projected to ease further to 3 percent in 2004. However, the outlook is
subject to considerable uncertainty with the economy operating at a high level of
resource utilization, slowing net immigration, continued strength in domestic demand,
an improving world economy, and the specter of further currency appreciation.

Policy Discussions
•

The authorities and the Fund staff broadly agree on the settings for
macroeconomic policies. In the near term, the challenge for monetary policy will be
to assess the countervailing pressures on inflation. The staff supports the Reserve
Bank of New Zealand’s decision to cautiously wait and watch the data to see whether
further monetary policy changes are needed.

•

The fiscal position remains strong and the stance of fiscal policy is fundamentally
sound. The recent improvement in fiscal prospects provides room to introduce some
new fiscal initiatives. However, as the government recognizes, the scope for additional
spending is limited, and continued prudence and discipline in making expenditure
decisions need to be maintained. The government has begun to take actions to address
the fiscal implications of population aging, including partial pre-funding of future
pension liabilities. Consideration should also be given to possible parametric reforms in
the pension and health care systems.

•

Further strengthening the growth performance remains a key goal. Government
efforts in welfare and education reforms and expanding New Zealand’s linkages with
the rest of the world should contribute to enhancing growth.

•

New Zealand’s financial sector has a high degree of short-term stability and an
overall sound outlook. The main recommendations of the Financial Sector
Assessment Program aim at preserving stability in the medium and longer term in the
context of the country’s disclosure-based regulatory regime and the high share of
foreign ownership of the banking system.

I. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. Introduction
1.
The New Zealand economy has performed strongly in recent years. Despite the
global slowdown and periods of drought at home, real GDP growth averaged about
3¾ percent during 1999–2003. The unemployment rate has been brought down, inflation has
generally remained within the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s (RBNZ’s) target range at
(currently 1-3 percent average over the medium term), and the budget has recorded sizeable
and growing current surpluses, resulting in a significant reduction in public sector debt. The
strong economic performance reflects the ongoing benefits from the extensive structural
reforms that have been implemented since the early 1980s and the continued confidence in the
macroeconomic environment fostered by transparent monetary and fiscal policy frameworks.
Strong net immigration flows have also buttressed the economy in recent years by increasing
labor supply and spurring domestic demand—notably residential investment.
2.
At the conclusion of the 2003 Article IV consultation on April 30, 2003 (IMF
Country Report No. 03/121, 5/2/03), Directors agreed with the short-term stance of
macroeconomic policies and noted the significant long-term challenges posed, in part,
by population aging. They concurred with the authorities’ approach to try to adopt suitable
measures early on. Directors pointed to the labor market as a key area where policy changes
could raise potential growth, and they encouraged the authorities to consider measures to
foster greater labor force participation. Directors also saw merit in simplifying the income
support system and making complementary changes in the income tax system to encourage
individuals to take up employment. They considered that New Zealand continues to be well
placed to manage adverse economic shocks. For their part, the authorities have taken some
actions to address the fiscal implications of population aging, including a partial pre-funding of
future pension liabilities. They are also looking at other policy measures to enhance the
economy’s growth potential, including welfare reform, improving education, and expanding
New Zealand’s linkages with the rest of the world.
B. Economic Developments
3.
Growth slowed in early 2003
but rebounded in the latter part of the
year (Figure 1 and Table 1). Real GDP
growth declined from 4¼ percent in 2002
to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate
(SAAR) of 2¾ percent in the first half
of 2003, amid heightened international
geopolitical tensions, concerns about
SARS, and declines in farm output and
hydroelectric generation

Although the current account deficit has widened, external liabilities have
declined relative to GDP (Figure 2 and

widened from about 2½ percent of GDP

Deteriorations in the merchandise trade
and services balances were partly offset
by an improvement in net income and

the recent appreciation of the New Zealand dollar.

Strong demand conditions have led to increasing resource constraints. With
employment growth averaging over 2½ percent during 2002 and 2003, the unemployment rate
declined to a 16-year low of 4.4 percent in September before rising slightly to 4.6 percent in
December (Figure 3). Although businesses are reporting increased labor shortages,
particularly of higher-skilled workers, measures of private sector wage growth have so far
picked up only moderately. Thus, the Labor Cost Index (LCI), rose by 2.4 percent in the year
to December 2003, compared to an

7.
Inflation has remained within
the official 1–3 percent target range.
CPI inflation declined to 1½ percent in
the December quarter of 2003 from
2¾ percent in 2002, and measures of
core inflation have also fallen sharply
(see Figure 3). Underlying the decrease
in inflation, however, there were sharply
divergent trends in the major
components of the CPI. In particular,
tradables inflation is now negative,
owing to the impact of the sizable
appreciation of the New Zealand dollar.
In contrast, nontradables inflation has
increased substantially, led by a
22 percent jump in housing prices
in 2003—the highest rate in 13 years.
Even excluding the housing
component, nontradables price
inflation is running at a 3½ percent
rate.

The New Zealand dollar
appreciated substantially
during 2002 and 2003. Since
end-2001, the New Zealand dollar has
risen by 58 percent vis-à-vis the
U.S. dollar through end-March 2004,

Box 1. New Zealand: The Exchange Rate and Commodity Prices
The New Zealand dollar has historically been regarded as a “commodity currency.”1 The tradeweighted index (TWI) of New Zealand dollar and the New Zealand Commodity Price Index (NZCP)2
shared roughly a common trend during the late 1980s and early 1990s. However, the close
correlation between the two indexes
broke down in mid-1990s. The
breakdown in the relationship is a
TWI (right scale)
puzzle and raises the possibility that
NZCP
New Zealand’s flexible exchange
(left scale)
rate might not be working as well as
previously, as a shock absorber to
offset movements in commodity
prices.

Unlike the NZCP, the correlation
CRB (left scale)
of the New Zealand dollar
exchange rate with the
Commodity Research Bureau
Index (CRB), a widely used index
of global commodity prices, has remained consistently strong.3 The tighter relationship between
the exchange rate and the global commodity index, rather than the index based on New Zealand’s
own commodity bundle, is somewhat surprising. One possible explanation is that the global index is
available in real time for currency traders and has been widely accepted and used in financial centers
all over the world, while the NZCP index is much less well known in off-shore financial centers and
is only published on a monthly basis with a lag of a couple of weeks.

Both the New Zealand commodity prices and the global commodity prices have been rising since
the end of 2002. Two issues remain unclear. First, why has the correlation between the NZCP and the
CRB indexes varied over time? Second, how important is the role of commodity prices versus other
fundamentals such as interest rate differentials, and weakness of the U.S. dollar? Further research on
these issues is warranted.

(OBERAC) nearly doubled to 4¼ percent of GDP in 2002/03 (fiscal year starting July 1), and
the overall cash surplus widened to almost 2 percent of GDP (Table 3). Factors contributing
to the improvement include significantly better-than-expected tax revenues, lower spending,
and higher Crown entity (public enterprise) surpluses. According to staff estimates, there was
a modest tightening in the fiscal stance. Gross government debt declined to 28 percent of
GDP with net debt, excluding the assets held by the New Zealand Superannuation Fund
(NZSF), falling to 13½ percent. 2
C. Outlook
11.
Economic activity is expected to moderate in the near term. Growth is projected
to ease from 3½ percent in 2003 to 3 percent in 2004 and 2½ percent in 2005 (Table 4).
Personal consumption is expected to slow somewhat, reflecting lower net immigration and the
lagged effects of currency appreciation on exporters’ incomes. Building permits and other
forward indicators suggest that residential investment will remain strong in the coming
months, although the pace of growth is unlikely to be as rapid as in 2003. Business investment
is expected to continue to post strong growth based on the need to build additional capacity
and the decline that has taken place in domestic prices for capital goods imports. Export
volumes are projected to pick up on recovering international demand, although gains will be
partly offset by the lagged impact of the currency’s appreciation. Import volume growth is
expected to slow from its very rapid pace as domestic demand growth eases. Nevertheless, the
external current account deficit is forecast to increase modestly to 5 percent of GDP in 2004.
Headline inflation is projected to move toward the upper end of the target range during the
course of the year, reflecting some continued pressure on capacity utilization in nontradable
sectors and the tight labor market.
12.
There are significant uncertainties in the near-term outlook. At this juncture, it is
unclear whether the economy will begin to execute the anticipated “soft landing” that has been
expected for some time, or whether domestic demand will maintain its robust pace for a while
longer before economic activity drops off more rapidly. Some signs that the economy may
slow as expected have begun to emerge, with net immigration flows easing in recent months.
However, there also are indicators pointing to continued short-term demand strength, and it is
difficult to predict how quickly or smoothly the housing market might cool down. In addition,
the prospect of further appreciation of the currency adds substantially to the uncertainties and
increases the risk of a sharper slowdown in growth.
13.
Medium-term prospects remain favorable. Beyond 2005, real GDP growth is
projected to increase to an average of around 3¼ percent during 2007–09, owing mainly to a

public pension system. The NZSF—like public pensions—is entirely funded by the
government.

further, gradual improvement in net exports. The external current account deficit is forecast to
decline modestly back to roughly its historical average, reflecting an unwinding of
New Zealand’s relative cyclical strength.3 This would imply that the net external liability
position relative to GDP increases modestly. The inflation rate is expected to be around
2 percent over the medium term.
II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
14.
The authorities and the Fund staff broadly agree on the settings for
macroeconomic policies in the period immediately ahead and over the medium term.
The discussions focused principally on: (i) the challenges for macroeconomic policy
management in the short term; (ii) how economic policies might further enhance
New Zealand’s medium-term growth prospects; and (iii) financial sector policy issues in the
context of the ongoing FSAP.
A. Monetary Policy and the Exchange Rate
15.
The challenge for monetary policy has been to assess the countervailing
pressures on inflation. As noted earlier, the current benign headline inflation picture reflects
the offsetting influences of relatively strong domestic inflationary pressures arising from the
strength of domestic demand, and weak tradable goods prices due to the sharp New Zealand
dollar appreciation. While tradables prices could decline further in the short term, this might
not be sufficient to keep inflationary pressures in check if domestic demand does not slow and
help to ease pressure on nontradables prices.
16.
The authorities and the staff agreed that uncertainties in near-term prospects
have substantially increased the difficulty in determining how to set monetary policy in
the period immediately ahead. The authorities’ expectation at the time of the discussions
was that some small additional tightening of monetary conditions might be needed to contain
inflationary pressures. However, there was a risk that a subsequent slowdown in economic
growth could be sharper than currently expected, especially if a rise in interest rates would
contribute to a further appreciation of the New Zealand dollar. In general, uncertainty
regarding the future path of the exchange rate is a factor significantly complicating the task of
assessing the short-term outlook. In deciding in March 2004 to leave the OCR unchanged, the
Governor pointed to all of the uncertainties in the economic situation as making it appropriate
to wait and watch the data to see whether a further small increase in interest rates would be
required this year. The staff fully supports this view.
17.
The sharp pick-up in New Zealand housing prices has raised questions of
whether a housing price bubble is developing and how monetary policy should respond.
3

Consistent with the World Economic Outlook practice, the real exchange rate for projection
purposes is assumed to remain constant, which would be over its historical average.

- 11 -

The authorities’ assessment of the situation, with which the staff concurs, is that the
acceleration in housing prices has been driven largely by fundamental factors, such as low
mortgage interest rates relative to the recent past and high net immigration, combined with the
relatively long lags inherent in adjusting the housing supply to changes in demand. While some
element of speculation might also be present, this does not appear to be large enough to
generate a significant fallout for the general economy, particularly in view of the strong health
of the financial sector. Accordingly, the authorities and the staff agreed that conditions in the
housing market do not currently appear to warrant greater weight in determining monetary
policy settings.4

The rapid rise in the value of the New Zealand dollar since 2001 has been a
greater source of concern. With the nominal effective value of the currency above its longterm average and a significant appreciation of the bilateral rate with the Australian dollar,
there is a concern that the exchange rate is moving out of line with the fundamental
determinants of its value, although significant uncertainty remains about the level of the
equilibrium exchange rate.5 Current circumstances raised a question as to whether more
reliance might be placed on fiscal policy, rather than monetary policy, in managing short-term
demand pressures. There was general agreement between the authorities and the staff that the
existing medium-term orientation of fiscal policy brings an important degree of predictability
and transparency. The staff noted that short-term economic conditions always should be taken
into account in setting fiscal policy to avoid sharp conflicts with monetary policy. However, a
more active use of fiscal policy in short-term demand management did not appear feasible or
desirable, owing to difficulties in carefully targeting fiscal policy and relatively long lags in
implementing policy changes.
19.
New Zealand has been reviewing its policy toward foreign exchange market
intervention and the level of the country’s international reserves. The floating exchange
rate regime is seen as continuing to serve New Zealand well. In March 2004, the RBNZ
Governor made a statement reiterating the RBNZ’s longstanding policy option to intervene in
the foreign exchange market if disorderly conditions were ever to occur as a result of an
exceptional adverse shock. New Zealand has not significantly increased the level of its official
international reserves since the mid-1980s. Given the changes that have taken place in the
international economy since that time, the authorities have decided that some increase

Employers’ Chamber of Commerce in Christchurch entitled “Asset Prices and Monetary
Policy,” delivered on January 30, 2004.

In the March 2004 CGER assessment of the real effective exchange rate, the overvaluation
of the New Zealand dollar was estimated to be in the range of 5 percent to 20 percent.

would be appropriate to ensure that they have adequate capacity to implement this policy.6
The RBNZ has also stated that it would contemplate exchange market intervention if the
exchange rate was viewed as being “exceptionally and unjustifiably” high or low.7 It
emphasized that interventions will in all cases be consistent with the inflation targeting
framework, that the RBNZ would not defend a particular exchange rate level, and that it
would not attempt to stand in the way of market trends. While modalities are still being
worked out, the RBNZ Governor has stressed that he would expect that conditions calling for
such intervention would be infrequent. The staff agreed that intervention could influence the
exchange rate if used in such exceptional and extraordinary circumstances by potentially
altering perceptions and expectations of market participants. The staff noted that this
approach to intervention is in line with common practice in other industrial countries,
including Australia and Canada.
B. Fiscal Policy
20.
Fiscal policy is formulated in a transparent and predictable medium-term
framework, and the fiscal position is strong. The fiscal objectives of the government call
for it to run operating surpluses on average over the economic cycle sufficient to cover
contributions to the New Zealand Superannuation Fund (NZSF), while meeting capital
spending requirements and maintaining government debt at prudent levels. Projections in the
December Economic and Fiscal Update 2003 (DEFU) call for the OBERAC surplus to
increase from 3.8 percent of GDP in 2003/04 to 4.4 percent of GDP in 2004/05 before
narrowing to 3.7 percent of GDP in 2007/08.8 Gross government debt is expected to decline
to 20½ percent of GDP by 2007/08. These projections include new spending from 2004/05,
which the government recently confirmed it would be in a position to accommodate within its
medium-term framework in light of sustained improvements in revenue. The 2004 Budget
Policy Statement announced that the government would proceed with plans foreshadowed in
the 2003 Budget to deliver a social dividend to low- and middle-income families. This Future
Directions package will include some increase in direct support to these households and

6

This is consistent with a study in the context of the ongoing FSAP which suggests that the
level of reserves necessary to restore liquidity in the exchange market in the event of a severe
disruption in the foreign exchange market and avoid possible systemic risks for the New
Zealand economy could be significantly higher than actual reserves.
7

“Exceptionally and unjustifiably” high or low refers to situations where the exchange rate has
moved well in excess of any relevant economic fundamentals, such as relative productivity,
commodity prices, growth, or inflation. In remarks announcing the RBNZ’s review, the
Governor noted that this approach to intervention policy is similar to that used in Australia.
8

The fiscal impulse for 2004/05 is -0.5 percent of GDP.

- 13 -

measures to facilitate the transition from unemployment to work at an expected cost of about
$NZ 1 billion a year, when fully implemented after three years.
21.
In the discussions, the authorities indicated that, if necessary, the timing of new
spending and/or tax measures would be kept under close review and adjusted, if
necessary to avoid placing undue pressure on monetary policy. Indeed, a withdrawal of
fiscal stimulus in 2004/05 is projected as the OBERAC surplus is expected to increase. The
authorities also discussed the potential impact of the significant uncertainties regarding the
economic outlook and buoyancy of tax revenues on the medium-term fiscal outlook. To
safeguard the fiscal position, they noted that the new fiscal initiatives would be implemented
when there were reasonably strong assurances that sufficient fiscal resources would be
available to pay for the package’s costs. The staff supported this cautious fiscal strategy and
suggested that prospective fiscal resources provided the authorities with a good opportunity
to enact reforms that could have a lasting effect in lifting output growth.
22.
New Zealand faces significant long-term spending pressures owing to population
aging and rising healthcare costs. Estimates by the New Zealand Treasury suggest that
demographic changes alone could push government spending on pensions and healthcare from
the current level of around 11 percent of GDP to some 19 percent of GDP by 2051; under
alternative cost assumptions, this could rise as high as 34 percent of GDP. To help meet
anticipated pension-related pressures, the government created the NZSF to pre-fund part of
the future pension liabilities. While this is recognized as an important step, the staff suggested
that consideration would also need to be given at some point to possible parametric reforms in
the pension and health care systems to help ensure that public spending is kept on a
sustainable path over the longer term. This might include measures to lower pension costs
(such as further raising the retirement age and lowering or means-testing pension benefits) and
to increase private contributions to healthcare (such as imposing user fees for higher-income
earners). However, the authorities also noted that the long-term cost projections were still
highly uncertain and that building political consensus for additional reforms remains an
important challenge. Some steps were likely to be needed and they should be adopted
sufficiently early to smooth fiscal costs over time, allowing individuals time to adapt their
saving behavior appropriately.
23.
The NZSF, while currently small, is expected to accumulate and invest
substantial assets over the next 20 years. The government contribution is expected to rise
from $NZ 1¾ billion in 2004 to around $NZ 2½ billion per year in 2010–13. With no
withdrawals from the fund before 2020, the balance is expected to reach 40 percent of GDP
by the mid-2030s. Management of these assets is governed by an independent Board of
Guardians, which is obligated to report regularly and publicly on the performance and the
asset holdings of the NZSF (governance arrangements for the NZSF are described in Box 2).
The Board’s basic objective is to achieve average annual long-term returns of 2½ percent
above the risk free rate of return (defined as the rolling average of returns on Treasury bills),
while avoiding undue portfolio risks. The current plan is for the NZSF to invest 22 percent of
its assets domestically (including in listed shares, fixed interest securities, and other

- 14 -

Box 2. New Zealand: Governance of the New Zealand Superannuation Fund
The NZSF is governed by a Board of Guardians. The Board was created as a separate Crown
entity to act at arm’s length from the government and make its own operating and investment
decisions. The Board must comprise at least five, but no more than seven, members who are
appointed for terms of five years (eligible for reappointment). The founding six Board members
were appointed in August 2002.
Board members are appointed by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the
Minister of Finance, following nominations from an independent nominating committee. In
making the recommendations, the Minister must consult with representatives of other political
parties in Parliament. Board members are chosen mainly for their experience, training, and
expertise in the management of financial investments.
The Guardians are charged with managing and administering the NZSF in a prudent and
cautious manner. They are given the objective of maximizing the value of the fund’s assets
without subjecting it to a high degree of risk. The Guardians are responsible for establishing
investment policies and standards and procedures for the Fund, including the portfolio allocation.
The Guardians appoint investment managers to manage different parts of the Fund, but are not
involved in allocating funds to specific securities or other assets. The Minister may give
directions, which are tabled in Parliament, to the Guardians regarding the government’s
expectations as to the Fund’s performance, but must not give any direction which is inconsistent
with the duty to invest the Fund on a prudent commercial basis. The Guardians must consider
these directions from the Minister. In general, governance arrangements for the NZSF are similar
to best practices in governing private pension funds. In addition, provision is made for an
independent assessment of the NZSF and the Guardians’ performance at least every five years by
a person appointed by the Minister of Finance, and this report is provided to Parliament and
made publicly available.

- 15 -

investments such as property and private equity), with the remaining 78 percent invested
abroad (60 percent in international shares). The authorities noted that a close watch would
need to be kept over the fund’s asset allocation and its investment strategy to ensure that the
NZSF does not become too large a player in the domestic market or exert an excessive
influence on macroeconomic conditions.
C. Growth and Structural Policy Issues
24.
The government’s goal is to further strengthen New Zealand’s growth
performance so as to restore the country’s per capita income ranking to the upper half
of OECD countries. The strategy to achieve this goal is outlined in the Growth and
Innovation Framework (GIF), which focuses on the need to develop a more skilled labor
force, improve New Zealand’s links to the global economy, and strengthen innovation in order
to help overcome disadvantages stemming from the country’s small size and long distance
from global economic centers.
25.
Promoting movement from welfare to work is one of the pillars of the
government’s strategy.9 The centerpiece of the 2004 Budget, the new Future Directions
package, is expected to include measures to simplify the income support system, streamline
income assistance to families, improve the targeting of disability benefits and the hardship
allowance, make housing more affordable for those in hardship, and improve the provision of
childcare.10 The staff supports the basic thrust of this initiative, especially those elements of
the package designed to lower high effective marginal tax rates when income support
recipients make the transition to work. Steps to tighten up and strictly enforce eligibility
requirements for benefits would be useful. In addition, limitations on the duration of
unemployment benefits would also provide additional encouragement for people to move into
employment.
26.
The government over the past year has passed or proposed a few pieces of labor
legislation. The Holiday Bill, passed in December 2003, increased annual leave from three to
four weeks starting in 2007. Following a review of the Employment Relations Act (ERA), the
government introduced the Employment Relations Law Reform Bill (ERLRB) in
December 2003. Key objectives of the Bill are to clarify the requirement to bargain in good
faith; protect low-paid service sector employees when there is a sale of a business, a transfer
9

New Zealand has some 400,000 working age people receiving some form of income support,
about 22 percent of whom receive disability benefits.
10

Budget 2003 introduced some modest measures, amounting to some $59 million over four
years, including increases in the maximum number of subsidized childcare hours for parents
entering full-time work and raising income thresholds for the Family Support, Child Tax
credit, and Parental Tax credits.

- 16 -

of undertakings, or contracting out; and update the Equal Pay legislation and require
employers to respond in good faith to equal pay queries. The staff stressed that care has to be
taken to ensure that new initiatives and the ways in which they are implemented do not
introduce significant labor market rigidities that might hamper employment and growth
prospects. The authorities said that enacted and proposed labor legislation should not have
these effects. They noted that the ERLRB was intended to be the government’s last major
piece of labor legislation. The bill addressed those areas where the ERA could be strengthened
to better achieve its key objectives of promoting collective bargaining and effective disputes
resolution.
27.
Transport and electricity infrastructure are two areas where significant
bottlenecks have emerged. To address the former, the government recently increased the
petrol levy starting in 2005 and established an integrated regional agency to develop a plan for
Auckland-area transportation. As regards electricity, the government announced the
establishment of an Electricity Commission to regulate the electricity industry. In addition,
provisions will be made to provide for sufficient electricity generating capacity to be held in
reserve to meet New Zealand’s needs in the event of a severe drought.
28.
Given the small size of its domestic market, New Zealand has long recognized the
crucial importance of an open international trade regime in promoting competition,
innovation, and growth. Tariffs on most products are low or zero, and in the few sectors
that continue to receive significant import protection (such as textiles, clothing, footwear, and
carpets), the government has announced a further gradual reduction of tariff rates starting in
July 2006.11 In contrast, New Zealand continues to face substantial foreign trade barriers in
key areas where it could be expected to have a significant comparative advantage, like dairy
products and meat. While continuing to explore bilateral and regional avenues to promote
trade liberalization, the authorities stressed that the government remains deeply committed to
the multilateral system as the foundation of its trade relations, and it has participated actively
in all major areas of the Doha Round.
D. Economic Vulnerability and the Soundness of the Financial System
29.
The authorities and the staff agreed that New Zealand remains generally well
placed to absorb adverse economic shocks. The external current account deficit has
widened recently but remained slightly below its average of the past decade, and the
deterioration mainly reflects the sharp appreciation of the New Zealand dollar and the

11

New Zealand’s tariff and nontariff barriers ratings are 1 and 2, respectively, on the IMF’s
trade restrictiveness index (on a scale ranging from 1 to 5 for tariffs and 1 to 3 for nontariff
barriers, 1 being the least restrictive).

- 17 -

relatively strong cyclical position of the economy.12 The low and declining level of public debt,
the relatively stable source of external financing, and the strong risk management culture in
New Zealand’s financial institutions should significantly limit New Zealand’s external
vulnerability (Annex I). Nevertheless, the size of the external debt position could leave New
Zealand potentially vulnerable to shifts in market sentiment, and the situation should be
carefully monitored. Corporate and banking sector balance sheets are generally sound and
have proven to be resilient to large swings in exchange and interest rates. While debt servicing
remains manageable, households could be subject to somewhat more stress than in the past in
the event of a substantial increase in both interest rates and unemployment. The authorities
emphasized that they would maintain their close, ongoing surveillance of these sectoral
balance sheets.
30.
The Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) staff team found that
New Zealand’s financial sector is generally sound. In conducting the FSAP discussions, the
staff was mindful of two rather unique characteristics of New Zealand’s financial system: the
country’s disclosure-based regulatory regime and the high share of Australian ownership of
New Zealand’s banking system. The banking sector is well capitalized, highly profitable, and
adequately provisioned. The discipline of New Zealand’s market-based disclosure regime is
supplemented by active home country supervision of the major banks. Stress tests measuring
the quantitative effects of large exchange rate swings, house price declines, and negative
supply shocks show that the banks would face reduced profitability, but none of these shocks
would pose a systemic risk. Nonbank financial institutions, while not systemically important,
are allowed to compete with banks in all areas of business. Their regulation and supervision
are covered under the Securities Act and are not subject to the same stringent disclosure
requirements as banks. The foreign exchange market is sufficiently deep and functions well,
hedging is widespread, and banks are readily able to provide adequate cover.
31.
The FSAP mission’s main recommendations aim at preserving the financial
system’s stability in the medium and longer term. In particular, the FSAP recommends:
(i) maintaining the disclosure-based supervisory regime, but reinvigorating it by strengthening
the RBNZ’s ability to do timely and subject-specific monitoring of the banks; (ii) further
developing the RBNZ’s ability to handle financial stresses by reviewing

12

Stress tests using the external sustainability framework template do not suggest major
concerns (Table 5). A large exchange rate depreciation produces (in a relatively static and
mechanical fashion) a sizable jump in the external debt to GDP ratio. However, the experience
in the late 1990s underscores the flexibility of the New Zealand economy in handling such
shocks without significant dislocation. Moreover, the mitigating influence in the event of a
substantial depreciation of having foreign currency debt positions that are predominantly
hedged (either by natural hedges or by financial derivatives) is not captured in the framework.

- 18 -

alternative approaches to manage a situation in which the solvency of a systemically important
bank comes into question; and (iii) enhancing cooperation and coordination between the New
Zealand and Australian regulators. The authorities have already initiated a process for closer
collaboration with Australia, which was recently agreed between the finance ministers of both
countries. In addition, the staff welcomed New Zealand’s invitation to the Financial Action
Taskforce to send a mission team to examine Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the
Financing of Terrorism issues.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
New Zealand continues to experience solid economic growth with low inflation.
This strong performance reflects ongoing benefits from the extensive structural reforms that
have been implemented since the 1980s and continued confidence in the transparent monetary
and fiscal policy frameworks. The foundations for sustained growth remain firmly in place.
However, with the economy operating at a high level of resource utilization, continued
strength in domestic demand, an improving world economy, and the specter of further
appreciation of the New Zealand dollar, there are considerable uncertainties regarding the
short-term economic outlook and distinct challenges for macroeconomic policies.
33.
The monetary authorities face a particularly difficult task in sorting through
current and incoming information on economic conditions and prospects to determine
the appropriate path for policy in the period immediately ahead. Given the potentially
conflicting economic forces at play presently, the staff supports the RBNZ’s decision to leave
interest rates unchanged in March 2004 and to cautiously wait and watch the data to see
whether further monetary policy changes are needed.
34.
The floating exchange rate regime has served New Zealand well. The authorities’
recent decisions to raise the level of international reserves and possibly to intervene in the
exchange market if the exchange rate was viewed as being “exceptionally and unjustifiably”
high or low do not represent significant changes in the regime. Raising New Zealand’s level of
reserves would provide insurance against disorderly markets in the event of an exceptional
adverse shock, and this action is consistent with a staff assessment of the country’s reserve
position in the context of the FSAP. The staff also agrees with the authorities’ decision to
adopt an approach to exchange market intervention, which is in line with that used in other
industrial countries. Exceptional and extraordinary circumstances—which are difficult to
define a priori—may occur where market participants have pushed the value of the exchange
rate significantly out of line with its fundamental determinants, and well-timed intervention
could influence the exchange rate by altering market perceptions and expectations.
35.
Fiscal policy continues to be soundly anchored. The government has set itself the
fiscal objectives of achieving budget operating surpluses over the economic cycle sufficient to
meet contributions to the NZSF, while keeping gross government debt below 30 percent of
GDP and trending down over the longer term and meeting capital spending requirements. An
improvement in fiscal prospects relative to Budget 2003 provides the authorities with an

- 19 -

opportunity to introduce some new fiscal initiatives, including the Future Directions package,
beginning in Budget 2004. The staff supports the basic thrust of this initiative, but notes, as
the government recognizes, that the scope for additional spending is very limited. Moreover,
to support monetary policy in the near-term, fiscal policy should hold the line on operating
and capital spending to what is proposed in the DEFU, with any unanticipated gains in
revenue saved in the short-term. In this connection, it should be recognized that unanticipated
developments in tax revenue generally have been favorable, and this may not continue.
Therefore, the prudence and discipline that the government has shown up to now in making its
expenditure decisions should be maintained.
36.
Over the longer term, New Zealand will face significant spending pressures
owing to population aging and rising healthcare costs. With the establishment of a partial
pre-funding of future pension liabilities through the NZSF, the government has taken an
important step to address some of these pressures, confirming New Zealand’s reputation for
innovative and far-sighted policymaking. However, other measures are likely to be needed to
contend fully with the long-term fiscal challenges. Among measures that may need to be
considered are further parametric changes in the pension and healthcare systems. Such
measures should be adopted sufficiently early to help smooth fiscal costs over time and allow
individuals time to adapt their savings behavior.
37.
The labor market remains one of the most important areas where policy changes
could help raise potential growth. The staff strongly supports the government efforts to
raise the participation rate and build a more skilled workforce, including providing the right
incentives to move people from welfare to work; improving education, training, and access to
childcare; and maintaining labor market flexibility. In this context, the Future Directions
package can play a significant role by providing in-work benefits that can lower the high
effective marginal tax rates currently faced by welfare recipients when they take up
employment. Labor force participation could also be enhanced by tightening up and strictly
enforcing eligibility requirements for receiving benefits. In addition, care needs be taken to
ensure that recent and proposed changes in labor legislation, and the ways they are
implemented, do not impair the flexibility of New Zealand’s labor market.
38.
The government recognizes that an open international trade regime is crucial for
promoting domestic competition, innovation, and growth. Tariffs on most products are
low or zero, and tariffs in the few remaining heavily-protected sectors are slated for further
reduction starting in 2006. In contrast, New Zealand continues to face substantial foreign
trade barriers in key areas where it could be expected to have significant comparative
advantages. While improved market access and decreased subsidization of agricultural
production by other countries are, understandably, New Zealand’s highest trade policy
priorities, the government remains deeply committed to all aspects of the multilateral trading
system, and it has participated actively in all major areas of the Doha Round. New Zealand
continues to pursue bilateral and regional trade liberalization initiatives to the extent that these
remain supportive of multilateral trade liberalization.

- 20 -

39.
New Zealand remains generally well placed to absorb adverse shocks without
undue economic distress. Although the external current account deficit has widened, the
deterioration has mainly reflected the sharp appreciation of the New Zealand dollar and the
relatively strong cyclical position of the economy. The low and declining level of public debt,
the relatively stable source of external financing, and the strong risk management culture in
New Zealand’s financial institutions should limit significantly New Zealand’s external
vulnerability. Nevertheless, the size of the external debt position could leave New Zealand
potentially vulnerable to shifts in market sentiment and should be closely monitored.
Corporate and banking sector balance sheets are generally sound and have proven to be
resilient to large swings in exchange and interest rates in the past. While debt servicing
remains manageable, households could be subject to somewhat more stress than in the past in
the event of a substantial increase in both interest rates and unemployment.
40.
As part of the 2004 Article IV consultation, New Zealand has participated in the
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP). The general finding of the FSAP is that
New Zealand’s financial sector has a high degree of short-term stability and an overall sound
outlook. The banking sector, which dominates the financial system, is financially sound, highly
profitable, and adequately provisioned. The discipline of New Zealand’s market-based
disclosure regime is supplemented by home country supervision of the major banks. In
addition to comfortable capital levels, high profitability rates, and sophisticated risk
management systems, short-term financial stability is also supported by a well-functioning
market environment and sound economic policies. Stress tests measuring the effects of large
exchange rate swings, house price declines, and negative supply shocks show that the banks
would face reduced profitability, but none of these shocks would pose a systemic risk.
41.
The FSSA’s main recommendations aim at preserving stability in the medium
and longer term. In particular, the FSSA recommends: strengthening the RBNZ’s ability to
undertake timely, focused monitoring of bank risks; further developing the RBNZ’s ability to
manage a situation in which the solvency of a systemically important bank comes into question
and to handle associated stresses on the financial system; and, given the unique role of
Australian-owned banks in New Zealand, enhancing cooperation and coordination between
supervisors in the two countries. In this connection, the staff welcomes the recent
announcement by the New Zealand Finance Minister and the Australian Treasurer of their
intention to strengthen collaboration in these areas.
42.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with New Zealand take place
on the standard 12-month consultation cycle.

ANNEX I

NEW ZEALAND—ECONOMIC VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT
1.
The basic assessment of New Zealand’s economic vulnerability remains broadly
unchanged.13 The country does not appear to face major economic vulnerabilities, and the
economy remains well placed to manage adverse economic shocks. While net foreign liabilities
remain high, they have declined from their peak. Foreign debt has become more concentrated
in the banking sector and its maturity has shortened, reflecting increased intermediation of
flows by banks. The foreign currency composition of the debt remains a large, but declining,
share of the total, with currency risk mitigated through substantial hedging. Corporate and
banking sector balance sheets continue to look strong, and they have proven in the past to be
resilient to large swings in exchange rates and interest rates. Household balance sheets and
finances also look to be reasonably sound, and they too have been resilient to past interest
swings. Housing remains the main household asset, and mortgage debt is the major household
liability and a major asset of the banking system. With higher indebtedness, households might
be subject to somewhat more stress now in the event of a substantial increase in interest rates
and unemployment.
A. External Position
2.
Net external liabilities have remained broadly unchanged over the last four
years, as assets have kept pace with the rise in debt. Gross external debt increased from

total gross external debt. At the same time, foreigners’ holdings of New Zealand government
debt have declined and represented only some 13 percent of total debt at end-March 2003.
3.
The maturity profile of the external debt has been shortening, while there has
recently been a decline in the foreign currency component. As the financial sector raises
most of its funds at shorter maturities than the government and corporate sectors, the rise in
the share of banks’ external debt has caused a shortening of the maturity. The foreign
currency component of the external debt has declined to 52 percent of total debt at endMarch 2003, after rising to 63 percent at end-March 2001. The risks from foreign currency
exposure are greatly mitigated by a substantial degree of hedging. Recent survey data indicate
that exchange rate risk for most of the foreign currency debt is hedged (Table 2).15 For the
debt covered by the survey, some 90 percent has been hedged either through natural hedges
or using financial derivatives. Dependence on financial derivatives for hedging has increased
sharply since end-March 1998. The market for these instruments appears to be reasonably
deep and has proven to be rather resilient, given the large swings in the value of the New
Zealand dollar in recent years.
B. Sectoral Balance Sheets
Banks
4.
New Zealand’s banking
sector performance remains
very strong. With a robust
domestic economy, New Zealand
banks remained solidly profitable
in 2002; return on assets for the
banks was some 1¼ percent and
return on equity was over
25 percent.16 The banks are well
capitalized, maintaining total
capital of more than 11 percent
and tier-one capital of

very high, with the ratio of impaired assets to total assets at about ¼ percent, a historic low
and well below levels in other developed countries. The overall strength of the banks in New

Registered banks in New Zealand are required to maintain a minimum tier-one capital ratio
of 4 percent and a total capital ratio of 8 percent of risk-weighted assets. While capital
requirements for branches of overseas banks operating in New Zealand are not mandatory, the
RBNZ has requested that branches, which are deemed as systemically important and with
retail deposits exceeding $NZ 200 million, incorporate domestically.

substantially faster than disposable
income. Meanwhile, mortgage debt
has gradually risen from 92 percent of
disposable income in 1998 to
106 percent in 2002, supported by
lower interest rates, lower inflation,
and financial deregulation. At the same
time, debt servicing costs have
declined from 9 percent of disposable
income in 1998 to just under 8 percent
in 2002; however, servicing costs have
risen in the last two years. Net financial
wealth continued to decline in 2002
relative to disposable income, primarily
reflecting weaknesses in the equity
markets. Households are likely to be
resilient to a major rise in interest
rates, as they have been in the past,
provided that there is no major
correction in employment.

Housing prices have recently
risen sharply. Since end-2001, house
prices have increased at an average annual rate of 11 percent, with a 12½ percent annual rate
increase in the first three quarters of 2003, following a period of relative stability over the
preceding five years. Lower interest rates and easier access to credit have enhanced housing
affordability, which combined with the recent increase in net immigration have contributed to
the price increase.

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with New Zealand
On April 30, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with New Zealand.1
Background
The New Zealand economy has performed strongly in recent years. Despite the global
slowdown and periods of drought at home, real GDP growth averaged about 3¾ percent
during 1999–2003. The strong economic performance reflects the ongoing benefits from the
extensive structural reforms that have been implemented since the early 1980s and the
continued confidence in the macroeconomic environment fostered by transparent monetary and
fiscal policy frameworks.
Growth slowed in early 2003 but rebounded in the latter part of the year. Real GDP growth
declined from 4¼ percent in 2002 to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 2¾ percent in the
first half of 2003, amid heightened international geopolitical tensions, concerns about SARS,
and declines in farm output and hydroelectric generation related to a drought. However, with an
improved international environment and better weather conditions, output growth rebounded to
over 4 percent seasonally adjusted annualized rate in the second half of the year. Residential
investment and household spending have been robust, reflecting strong income growth, real
income gains from the New Zealand dollar’s appreciation, the strength in net immigration, solid
employment growth, wealth effects from rising house prices, lower interest rates, and financial
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2innovation. Business investment growth has also strengthened, in response to emerging
capacity constraints, lower interest rates, and declining prices (in New Zealand dollars) for
capital goods imports. However, net exports deteriorated reflecting the relative cyclical position
and the continued appreciation of the New Zealand dollar.
Although the external current account deficit has widened, external liabilities have declined as a
share of GDP. The current account deficit widened from about 2½ percent of GDP in 2001 to
4½ percent of GDP in 2003. Net external liabilities declined from their peak of 87 percent of
GDP at end-1998 to 76 percent of GDP at end-2003, reflecting both the strong GDP growth
over this period and valuation gains from the recent appreciation of the New Zealand dollar.
Inflation has remained within the official 1–3 percent target range, despite increasing resource
constraints. CPI inflation declined to 1½ percent in each of the four quarters through
March 2004 from 2¾ percent in 2002. There were, however, sharply divergent trends in the
major components of the CPI. In particular, tradables inflation is now negative owing to the
impact of the sizable currency appreciation, while nontradables inflation has increased sharply,
led by a jump in housing-related costs, most notably for the purchase and construction of new
dwellings. Even excluding the housing component, however, nontradables price inflation is
running at over 3 percent. Employment growth averaged over 2½ percent during 2002
and 2003, and the unemployment rate declined to a 16-year low of 4.4 percent in September
before rising slightly to 4.6 percent in December. Although businesses are reporting increased
labor shortages, particularly of higher-skilled workers, measures of private sector wage growth
have so far picked up only moderately. At the same time, the capacity utilization rate is at a
relatively high level.
The New Zealand dollar appreciated substantially during 2002 and 2003, but has depreciated
somewhat since reaching a seven-year high in mid-February 2004. Overall, since end-2001, the
New Zealand dollar has risen by nearly 50 percent vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar through
end-April 2004, by 7 percent relative to the Australian dollar, and by 27 percent on a
trade-weighted (TWI) basis. The TWI is now 8 percent above its ten-year average.
The medium-term appreciation reflects a combination of comparatively high interest rates in
New Zealand, the country’s strong recent growth performance relative to most other developed
countries, and strengthening commodity prices in U.S. dollar terms, along with weakness in the
U.S. dollar.
Monetary policy has successfully kept inflation in the target range. Between April and July 2003,
the Reserve Bank of New Zealand cut the official cash rate (OCR) by a total of 75 basis points
in three moves—bringing the rate to 5 percent—based on its assessment that economic activity
was likely to cool in response to weak external conditions, an appreciating currency, and
slowing net immigration. However, the RBNZ increased the OCR by 25 basis points each in
January and April 2004, when indicators of economic activity suggested that domestic demand
going forward could be more robust than expected. The RBNZ also noted in April that it would
continue to watch economic indicators closely to determine if further rate increases would be
required later in 2004.

-3The fiscal position has continued to strengthen during the past year. The operating surplus
nearly doubled to 4¼ percent of GDP in 2002/03 (fiscal year starting July 1), and the overall
cash surplus widened to almost 2 percent of GDP. Factors contributing to the improvement
include significantly better-than-expected tax revenues, lower spending, and higher Crown
entity surpluses. Gross government debt declined to 28 percent of GDP, with net debt
(excluding the assets of the New Zealand Superannuation Fund) falling to 13½ percent.
Real GDP growth is projected to ease to 3 percent in 2004 and 2½ percent in 2005.
However, the outlook is subject to considerable uncertainty with the economy operating at a
high level of resource utilization, slowing net immigration, continued strength in domestic
demand, an improving world economy, and the specter of further currency appreciation.
Medium-term prospects remain favorable. Beyond 2006, real GDP growth is projected to
increase to an average of around 3¼ percent, owing mainly to a gradual improvement in net
exports. The external current account deficit is forecast to remain broadly unchanged, with
improvements on the goods and services account offset by a widening investment income
deficit. The inflation rate is expected to be around 2 percent over the medium term.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the strong performance of New Zealand’s economy in recent
years, which reflects the authorities’ continued skillful management of macroeconomic policies
and the ongoing benefits from the extensive structural reforms that have been implemented
since the 1980s.
Directors considered that the foundations for sustained economic growth remain firmly in place.
Nevertheless, with the economy operating at a high level of resource utilization, continued
strength in domestic demand, volatility in the exchange rate, and slowing net immigration, they
urged the authorities to be ready to adapt policies as needed to ensure that the economy
remains on a sound growth path.
Directors noted that in the current environment, with resource pressures still tight and an
uncertain path for the exchange rate, determining the appropriate monetary policy setting is
particularly challenging. In this context, they considered that the Reserve Bank of New
Zealand’s (RBNZ) recent decision to raise the official cash rate was prudent and consistent with
the monetary policy framework.
Directors emphasized that the floating exchange rate regime has served New Zealand well.
Reflecting New Zealand’s strong relative cyclical performance and strengthening commodity
prices, they noted that the real effective exchange rate had appreciated significantly from its
cyclical trough in late 2000 to its peak in February 2004, when it was well above its 10-year
average. They concurred with the authorities’ decision to increase the level of international
reserves given the changes that have taken place in the international economy since the
mid 1980s when the RBNZ last significantly raised these reserves. In connection with the
indication that the RBNZ would contemplate exchange market intervention if the exchange rate
were viewed as being “exceptionally and unjustifiably” high or low, Directors were generally of

-4the view that this policy was consistent with the inflation targeting framework and would be in
line with that used in many other developed countries provided, as the central bank has
emphasized, it would not defend a particular exchange rate level. Some Directors, however,
noted that the efficacy of such intervention to moderate exchange rate cycles is unproven.
Directors continued to support the sound medium-term orientation of fiscal policy. In this
connection, they endorsed the government’s objective of achieving budgetary operating
surpluses over the economic cycle sufficient to meet contributions to the New Zealand
Superannuation Fund (NZSF), while keeping gross debt trending down over the longer term and
meeting capital spending requirements. Directors agreed that the improvement in fiscal
prospects relative to the 2003 budget provides the authorities with an opportunity to introduce a
limited number of new fiscal initiatives, including the Future Directions package, beginning in
the 2004 budget. However, to support monetary policy in the near term, they stressed that the
authorities should hold the line on spending to what was proposed in the December Economic
and Fiscal Update, maintain prudence and discipline in making expenditure decisions, and save
any further unanticipated gains in revenue.
Over the longer term, New Zealand will face significant spending pressures owing to population
aging and rising healthcare costs. Directors considered that the establishment of a partial
pre-funding of future pension liabilities through the NZSF was an important step to address
some of these pressures. Nonetheless, they suggested that other measures are likely to be
needed to contend fully with the long-term fiscal challenges, including further changes in the
structural parameters of the pension and healthcare systems. They emphasized that such
measures should be adopted sufficiently early to help smooth fiscal costs over time and allow
individuals to adapt their savings behavior.
Directors emphasized the importance of the government’s efforts to raise the labor force
participation rate and build an even more skilled workforce, including by providing the right
incentives to move people from welfare to work; improving education, training, and access to
childcare; and maintaining labor market flexibility. In this context, they noted that the Future
Directions package could play a significant role by providing in-work benefits that lower the high
effective marginal tax rates currently faced by welfare recipients when they take up
employment. They also supported enhancing labor force participation by tightening up and
strictly enforcing eligibility requirements for receiving benefits. In addition, Directors stressed
that recent and proposed changes in labor legislation should be implemented in ways that do
not impair the flexibility of New Zealand’s labor market. To reduce infrastructural bottlenecks,
they advocated further investments in the electricity and transport sectors.
Directors strongly backed New Zealand’s ongoing commitment to the multilateral trading
system, and its active participation in the Doha Round. They noted that the tariffs imposed by
New Zealand on most imports are low or zero, and that tariffs in the few remaining
heavily-protected sectors are slated for further reduction starting in 2006. Directors observed
that New Zealand continues to face substantial trade barriers in key areas, including agricultural
products, and many Directors urged industrial countries to reduce these barriers.

-5Directors agreed that New Zealand remains generally well placed to absorb adverse shocks
without undue economic distress. They concurred that the recent substantial widening of the
external current account deficit mainly reflected the sharp appreciation of the New Zealand
dollar and the relatively strong cyclical position of the economy. Directors believed that the low
and declining level of public debt, the relatively stable source of external financing, the general
soundness of corporate and banking sector balance sheets, and the strong risk management
culture in New Zealand’s financial institutions should limit New Zealand’s vulnerability
significantly. Nevertheless, they cautioned that the size of the external debt position could leave
New Zealand potentially vulnerable to sharp shifts in market sentiment and recommended
strengthening national savings. Also, while debt servicing remains manageable, they observed
that households could be subject to somewhat more stress than in the past in the event of a
substantial increase in interest rates. Directors, therefore, endorsed continued close monitoring
of sectoral balance sheets.
In this context, Directors welcomed New Zealand’s participation in the Financial Sector
Assessment Program. They concurred with the general finding of the Financial System Stability
Assessment (FSSA) that New Zealand’s financial sector has a high degree of short-term
stability and an overall sound outlook. They noted that the discipline of New Zealand’s
market-based disclosure regime is supplemented by home country supervision of the major
foreign banks and supported by a well-functioning market environment and sound economic
policies. They observed that the banking system is well capitalized, highly profitable, and
employs sophisticated risk management systems. They also noted that the banking system is
highly resilient to shocks from large exchange rate swings, house price declines, and negative
supply shocks. Nevertheless, Directors recommended continued vigilance in regard to potential
shocks and the need to ensure prudent lending practices in the housing market.
Directors endorsed the FSSA’s main recommendations, which aim at preserving stability in the
medium and longer term. These recommendations included strengthening the RBNZ’s ability to
undertake timely, focused monitoring of bank risks; further developing its ability to manage a
situation in which the solvency of a systemically important bank comes into question and to
handle associated stresses on the financial system; and, given the unique role of
Australian-owned banks in New Zealand, enhancing cooperation and coordination between
supervisors in the two countries.
Directors welcomed New Zealand’s invitation to the Financial Action Taskforce to send a team
to examine Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism issues.

Public Information Notices (PINs) are issued, (i) at the request of a member country, following the
conclusion of the Article IV consultation for countries seeking to make known the views of the IMF to the
public. This action is intended to strengthen IMF surveillance over the economic policies of member
countries by increasing the transparency of the IMF's assessment of these policies; and (ii) following
policy discussions in the Executive Board at the decision of the Board.
