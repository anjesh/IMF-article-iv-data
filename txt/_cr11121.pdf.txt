REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA
Staff Report for the 2011 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2011 Article IV Consultation with
the Republic of Slovenia
Approved by Juha Kähkönen and Jan Kees Martijn
May 4, 2011
Executive Summary
Background: After one of the largest GDP declines in the euro area, growth resumed only in Q2
2010 on the back of external demand. Lower potential output growth and weak domestic demand
due to deleveraging are dampening growth prospects. Fiscal policy is tightening after a
countercyclical stance, with the authorities committed to bringing fiscal deficit below 3 percent of
GDP by 2013 mostly by freezing public wages and cutting investment. Pension reform was
recently approved, but will be subjected to a referendum. Banks suffer from weak capitalization
and deteriorating asset quality. Political support for reforms is weakening.
Challenges: (i) putting growth and public finances on a sustainable path; (ii) ensuring financial
stability; and (iii) maintaining competitiveness.
Staff views: The broad fiscal targets are appropriate but 0.3 percent of GDP in additional fiscal
measures per year in 2011–2013 will be needed to achieve them. Consolidation should rely more
on durable measures. Pension reform is a critical step in the right direction but it is not enough to
ensure fiscal sustainability. Banks should be further recapitalized and corporate governance
strengthened, including through a larger role for the private sector. An exit strategy for the
government’s role as an investor in banks should be laid out. Wage growth should be restrained,
labor markets should become more flexible, and products market reform is needed to attract FDI.
Authorities’ views: The authorities agree with staff that fiscal consolidation including pension
reform is key to ensure a sustainable recovery. The government considers that the recovery could
be revived by stimulating credit expansion. The Bank of Slovenia emphasizes that banks’
governance and capitalization should be enhanced, regardless of ownership. The authorities
stressed also the importance of social consensus to implement reforms.
Mission team: Mr. Spilimbergo (Head), Ms. Mahieu, Mr. Simone (all EUR), and Mr. Blotevogel
(MCD) visited Ljubljana March 9–21, 2011 and held discussions with the Mr. Križanič (Minister
of Finance), Mr. Krajnec (Governor of the Bank of Slovenia) and other ministers, government
officials and representatives of parliament, financial sector, labor, business, and media. Mr. Kavčič
(Advisor to the Executive Director) attended also the meetings. Mr. Prader (Alternate Executive
Director) attended the concluding meeting.

I. CONTEXT: FROM SUDDEN STOP TO DIFFICULT DELEVERAGING
1.
Slovenia experienced one of the
sharpest GDP declines in the euro area during
the crisis. Real GDP declined over 10 percent
from peak in Q3 2008 to trough in Q1 2010
owing to: a sharp decline in external demand
affecting especially the manufacturing sector; a
significant tightening in external credit
conditions forcing banks to curtail domestic
credit supply; and an abrupt end of a construction
and housing price boom.

Economic growth has been slowly recovering on the back of external demand.
Real GDP growth reached 1.2 percent in 2010. After declining in the first quarter of 2010,
real GDP grew in the remaining three quarters, mainly driven by exports. However, domestic
demand remains weak, with consumption only gaining 0.5 percent last year and investment

4
flat. The highly leveraged construction sector is contracting while manufacturing is
recovering. The average unemployment rate was 7.2 percent in 2010.

3.
Weak domestic demand led to negative core inflation and greatly reduced the
current account deficit. Average CPI inflation was 1.8 percent in 2010, mainly because of
rising fuel and energy prices. The current account deficit shrank from 6.7 percentage points
of GDP in 2008 to 1.2 in 2010, reflecting mainly the end of the construction boom.
4.
Fiscal policy turned countercyclical in
2009. Automatic stabilizers were allowed to work
and additional discretionary stimulus measures
amounting to 1.8 percent of GDP in 2009, 0.2 in
2010, and 0.1 in 2011 were taken. Discretionary
measures included subsidies to companies for
shorter labor hours and R&D, a corporate income
tax rate reduction, and the elimination of the payroll
tax. Most subsidies, except subsidies for temporarily
laid-off workers, were phased out by end-2010.

5.
The general government deficit narrowed in 2010. After widening considerably
during the crisis, the general government deficit declined to 5.2 percent in 2010. The main
factors were one-off revenue gains, cuts in capital transfers, and containment of the wage

5
bill. The structural balance also improved by 0.5 percent of GDP after reaching its lowest
point in 2009 (-4.5 percent of GDP).
6.
The crisis exposed vulnerabilities in the financial sector. The rapidly expanding
credit growth financed with short-term external bank borrowing came to a sudden stop in
2008. During the crisis, the authorities supported bank liquidity by enhancing the deposit
insurance scheme, placing government deposits with banks, and providing guarantees for
banks’ bond issuances. Banks also sought recourse to ECB funding. As a result, the funding
profile of banks changed significantly.

8.
The political context has not been favorable to the implementation of structural
reforms. The political support for labor market and pension reforms is weak. Trade unions
succeeded in holding a referendum on the recently approved revisions to pension and labor

6
market legislations in spring (Boxes 2 and 4). Upcoming elections in 2012 are also likely to
complicate reform implementation.
II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
9.
Policy discussions focused, for the short term, on the strength of the recovery in the
context of deleveraging, bank vulnerabilities, and the fiscal exit strategy. For the medium
term, the discussions were focused on pension reform and competitiveness.
A. Outlook: Deleveraging and Lower Potential Growth Are Constraining the
Recovery
10.
Pervasive deleveraging will limit
growth. Credit growth to the domestic private–
sector fell to below 4 percent in 2010 from 33
in 2007, as banks tried to protect their capital
positions and meet debt redemptions. The
highly leveraged corporate sector has stopped
borrowing, muting demand. Lending to
households was the exception to the downward
trend in 2010, mainly due to low initial debt
levels and attempts by banks to shift risk away
from construction companies.

Supply factors are also constraining the recovery. Slovenia’s GDP is already at
88 percent of the average euro area GDP, reducing the scope for further catching up.
Moreover, post-crisis potential output growth estimates by the OECD, the European
Commission, IMAD, and staff (see charts below) declined to a range of 1.3 to 2.5 percent
from a pre-crisis range of 3 to 3.4, primarily on account of the lower gross capital formation.
The output gap is projected to close gradually over the medium term.

GDP growth is projected at 2 percent in 2011 and 2.4 in 2012. The pick-up in
growth reflects mainly a recovery in the manufacturing sector and inventory rebuilding.
However, investment will likely be low due to deleveraging. High unemployment and fiscal
retrenchment will weigh on consumption growth. Average inflation is projected to gradually
pick up to 3.1 in 2012 on the back of high commodity prices. The current account deficit is
expected to widen again as the economy recovers, but not as much as in pre-crisis times. The
authorities broadly agreed with staff’s forecasts.

13.
Spillovers from the European
sovereign debt crisis have been contained so
far, but vulnerabilities remain. This resilience
reflects Slovenia’s moderate debt-to-GDP ratio,
limited refinancing risk of public debt, and solid
household balance sheets. However, the nearterm dependence of the recovery on external
demand and significant contingent public
liabilities from entitlement spending and banks

are ongoing risks. The postponement of pension and labor market reforms could also lead to
further deterioration in competitiveness and potential output growth.
B. Fiscal: The Challenges of Lasting Consolidation
14.
The authorities’ fiscal exit strategy envisions a gradual reduction of the general
government deficit to below 3 percent by 2013 in compliance with the EU’s Excessive
Deficit Procedure (EDP) (Box 1). Measures include freezes in basic wage, cuts in allowances,
and reduction in public employment. Non-pension entitlement growth is expected to be
contained by slowing down indexation. Structural fiscal reforms are also envisioned to support
the consolidation.
15.
Staff agreed with the contour of the authorities’ exit strategy but pointed out that
additional and durable measures are needed. While general government debt is likely to
remain sustainable, fiscal consolidation is necessary in light of the uncertainty in financial
markets and contingent liabilities.1 The government guaranteed €2.2 billion (6 percent of
GDP) of banks’ bonds during the crisis, which will mature next year, and may have to inject
more capital into state banks, depending on market interest. However, staff’s baseline scenario
illustrates that measures envisaged so far fall short by 0.9 percent of GDP (in ESA95 terms) to
reach the authorities’ targets. The shortfall results from less optimistic assumptions on
transfers and the wage bill.2 The authorities agreed with the need of a durable adjustment,
underlining the role of pension and health care reforms. The pension reform recently approved
by the parliament but subject to referendum is a step in the right direction but is insufficient in
the long run (Box 2).
16.
Staff and the authorities agreed on the composition and pace of adjustment.
Consolidation should take place on the expenditure rather than the revenue side given an
already high tax burden, especially on labor. To the extent that compliance with the EDP is
restored by 2013 and borrowing constraints permitting, the focus should be on the quality of
the adjustment measures.

1

Debt sustainability analysis suggests that debt would remain sustainable and at or below 60 percent of GDP
under a variety of scenarios with the exception of one with significantly lower growth. Standard & Poor’s put
Slovenia on negative outlook on account of its seemingly weakened commitment to fiscal consolidation.
2

The fiscal deficit could be higher by 0.7 percent of GDP in 2011 if Eurostat classifies the recently approved
recapitalization of state banks as state aid for EDP compliance purposes. Eurostat’s opinion would also
determine the impact on the fiscal deficit of any additional recapitalization.

Staff proposed durable
expenditure measures. Suggestions
included: preventing the policy adopted in
2008 to reduce wage disparities in the public
sector from increasing the wage bill;
rationalizing government employment; and
reforms to strengthen the targeting of
transfer programs and tighten eligibility.3
The authorities reiterated their commitment
to consolidation. They agreed that additional
measures over and above those announced
would likely be needed to bring the general
government deficit below 3 percent by 2013.

benefits. The authorities agreed with staff that additional measures beyond the current
pension reform will be needed to ensure long-term sustainability and noted that the defined
contribution private pension pillar is also being reformed (Box 2).
19.
Public debt management has been broadly adequate. Long-term syndicated loans
issued at fixed rates were used to pre-finance the deficit while limited quantities of short-term
treasury bills were issued to manage treasury liquidity. Staff recommended that the
authorities continue to pre-finance to hedge against refinancing risk.

Box 1. Slovenia’s Fiscal Exit Strategy
The authorities’ exit strategy seeks to achieve near-term fiscal consolidation and address sustainability
challenges arising from age-related spending. In addition to the withdrawal of the crisis-related
discretionary measures, the plan includes:


Expenditure-based fiscal consolidation. Key elements are rationalizing the wage bill, social benefits,
and goods and services. Wage bill growth would be contained by the abrogation of regular performance
bonuses until 2011, the postponement of the implementation of the wage disparity policy in the public
sector, the non-indexation of wages to inflation in 2011 and 2012, and the reduction of public
employment by 1 percent in 2011 and 2012. The growth of social benefits would be curtailed by using a
less generous indexation. Goods and services would be rationalized by introducing a unified system of
public procurement.



Fiscal structural reforms. These include pension, health care and financial management reforms. Health
care reform aims at increasing the use of generic drugs, tightening the eligibility for sick leave benefits,
changing the ratio of health services and medicine covered by mandatory and voluntary health insurance,
and widening the income base for the collection of health contributions. In the public financial
management area, reforms include performance budgeting and changes to the Public Finance Law. The
changes will introduce in the legislation a medium-term framework (MTF), institute a formula for
computing the expenditure ceilings based on MTF (“fiscal rule”), set a debt ceiling of 45 percent of GDP,
and 13 percent of GDP on government guarantees, and define the responsibilities and accountability
structure for the recently created fiscal council.
Box 2. Pension Reform

The government approved a pension reform in November 2010 which will be challenged in a referendum in
late spring. The main elements are the following:


An increase in the full and minimum retirement ages. The statutory retirement age will be lifted to
65 and the minimum retirement age will be 60. The gap between the retirement ages of men and women
progressively disappears. The retirement age for workers with longer careers also increases to 60 for
men and 58 for women.



A gradual extension of the period for calculating the pension base from the 18 best consecutive
years to 27 years. The extension will decrease the pension rating base by 12.1 percent for men and
10.5 percent for women. However, the replacement rate will be capped at 60 percent.



A change in the indexation of pension benefits. Instead of only indexing to nominal wage growth, the
new approach also links pension benefits to prices (40 percent weight until 2015; 30 percent thereafter).



Changes in the incentive system. Individuals who are eligible for a pension, but continue to work full
time, will be able to claim 20 percent of their pension entitlement. The permanent penalty for early
retirement will be increased to 0.3 percent per month before the age of 65.



Additional incentives to work past the pension eligibility age. Partial retirement will be extended,
allowing for greater flexibility in combining work and pension benefits.



Financial incentives for employers to employ older workers. Employers will pay 30 percent lower
social security contributions for workers above the age of 60. Hiring workers with long careers over the
transitional period until 2017 results in a 50 percent reduction in social security contributions for
employers.



Introduction of portfolio choices for workers opting to participate in the voluntary occupation
scheme and a revised minimum return guarantee.

C. The Financial Sector: State Involvement and Financial Stability
20.
Banks are coping with declining profitability. The deterioration in banks’ asset
quality, evidenced by rising arrears, provisions, and non-performing loans, will moderate
only slowly under staff’s baseline scenario. Provisions are expected to continue to act as a
drag on banks’ profits. This limits the scope for retained earnings to boost capital in the near
term.
21.
The highly indebted corporate sector is driving loan losses. The debt-to-equity
ratio in the non-financial corporate sector jumped to 140 percent in 2009, up from 90 percent
in 2000. Leverage is also high compared to other euro area members. Borrowing by
construction, real estate and leveraged holding companies grew particularly fast, with these
sectors accounting for a quarter of all corporate lending at the end of 2010. Given the
unfavorable environment for these sectors, banks are likely to realize further losses on the
associated exposures. The authorities are considering a tax on banks’ assets to incentivize
lending to the corporate sector. While appreciating the need to ensure adequate credit supply
for credit-worthy companies, staff noted that a tax penalizing banks for scaling back
exposures to risky borrowers would distort banks’ risk management. But staff saw some
merit in having a systemic approach to the management and selling of stakes in non-financial
companies that banks seized as collateral following bankruptcies. This solution should aim at
making banks’ portfolio more transparent and accelerating the restructuring of companies if
necessary. However, the approach chosen should have no fiscal implications.
22.
The recent pickup in mortgage lending warrants careful monitoring. While
households remain less indebted than in other EU countries, their debt-to-GDP and
debt-to-income ratios have deteriorated relatively quickly since the EU accession in 2004.
The near-term dangers of imbalances in the housing market are limited by relatively stringent
limits on loan-to-value and debt servicing-to-income ratios. But given the risks posed by
large stocks of unsold apartments and rising interest rates, with most loans contracted at
variable interest rates, the authorities agreed with staff that lending to households should be
monitored carefully. The Bank of Slovenia (BoS) indicated their willingness to tighten
prudential regulation further if necessary.
23.
Banks’ funding is set to become more expensive. Acute liquidity pressures are
absent, but at 146 percent, banks’ domestic loan-to-deposit ratio is high, indicating
significant refinancing needs of foreign liabilities. With borrowings from the ECB and the
government recently scaled back and foreign funding restricted, banks shrunk their total
assets in 2010. Given the limited scale of the local deposit market and continued strains in
international wholesale markets, funding costs are bound to increase when banks’ lending
activities will resume across the board, with negative effects for net interest margins.

effect immediately. Staff’s stress test also
indicates a need to raise additional capital, which would allow banks to maintain prudent
buffers even in a severe adverse scenario. The BoS broadly agreed with the results, but
emphasized that stress tests are sensitive to the severity of the assumptions used (Box 3).
25.
Strengthening capital buffers is key for financial stability. Even in the absence of
shocks, additional capital is desirable to bring capital adequacy to more prudent levels,
bolster confidence, and create new lending capacity. The two largest banks are currently
raising capital from the government and markets but the amounts are probably insufficient to
meet current market standards of capitalization. Staff encouraged the authorities to pave the
way for a greater role of private investors. This can be achieved by laying out an exit strategy
for the government as investor in banks, strengthening governance, disposing non-strategic
assets, and removing doubts about asset quality through strict capital and provisioning
requirements. Raising additional capital would ease the need to shrink domestic lending in a
difficult time, moderating the fallout from large-scale bankruptcies in the construction sector.
The authorities agreed with staff about the importance of adequate capitalization. They have
started to examine options for further recapitalization, including through partial divestment.

14
Box 3. Staff Stress Test
Staff conducted a stress test to assess the resilience of Slovenia’s two largest banks in an adverse
scenario. The methodology is based on the background analysis carried out for the April 2011 Global
Financial Stability Report, with some inputs taken from the EU stress tests organized by CEBS in July
2010. The adverse scenario covers the financial years 2011 and 2012 and features three shocks: (i) a
loan loss shock; (ii) a sovereign shock reducing the value of banks’ sovereign bond holdings; and (iii) a
Slovenia–specific funding shock squeezing net interest margins. Staff’s test is on balance more severe
than CEBS’ exercise. To illustrate, staff’s two standard deviation shock to loan loss rates gives annual
provisions of 2.9 percent of gross loans for NLB, compared to 2 percent in the CEBS test from last
year. The staff test’s main assumptions are that balance sheets remain constant and that net non–interest
income equals the average of 2008/09. The results reflect already announced recapitalizations at the end
of March and are summarized in the following table:

These results need to be interpreted with caution. The exercise is stylized, and does not take banks’
possible mitigation measures into account. The results are particularly sensitive to changes in the loan
loss shock. That said, the test shows that the banks could benefit from raising additional capital to
bolster confidence in their ability to withstand harsh, but low–probability, events.

D. Structural Issues: Overdue Reforms to Boost Potential Output
26.
While the real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals, the
authorities agreed that maintaining competitiveness will be crucial. The crisis induced a
sharp correction of current account imbalances, but indicators of price and cost
competitiveness further

27.
The crisis threatens to have a durable dampening impact on employment.
Subsidies for full-time working hours and temporary laid-off workers mitigated the increase
in unemployment, although the return of foreign workers to their home countries may also
have helped. Unemployment compares favorably to other euro area countries. However, the
many job losses in the construction sector are probably permanent.

Labor market flexibility should therefore be increased. The Mini-Jobs Act
regulating student work (Box 4) and the pension reform could contribute to increasing
employment. In addition, staff advocated reducing regular workers’ employment protection,
which remains among the highest in OECD countries. In particular, staff recommended rapid
enactment of the envisaged reduction in notice periods and severance payments as this would
help avoid increasing labor market dualism and foster FDI inflows. The authorities share
staff’s assessment but pointed to the need to reach a social consensus.

17
Box 4: New Labor Market Legislation
The Slovenian labor market suffers from low participation of older workers; low employment rate
of the young; and a dual labor market. Permanent contracts impose a high cost on firms due to the
obligation of paying high social security contributions, long notice periods for dismissal, high
severance payment, and restrictions on dismissals. The student job status did not carry many of
these restrictions, and was therefore misused as a substitute for standard employment.

The government has adopted two new legislative measures mainly aimed at reducing the
segmentation of the labor market, while increasing social protection of the young:
The Act on Mini Jobs improves the regulation of student work by restricting its possible use and
increasing social security and pension contributions. The Act also expands the pool of potential
users to pensioners and unemployed. The Act has been adopted in the Parliament but could be
repealed in a referendum.
The new draft Labor Market Regulation Act primarily aims at increasing young workers’ social
protection by extending unemployment benefits to workers employed for nine months during the
previous 24 months. The Act also increases unemployment benefits to an 80 percent replacement
rate during the first three months.
In order to increase labor market flexibility, changes to the Employment Act are envisaged to
shorten the notice periods for dismissals of workers and reduce the severance payments.

29.
Staff indicated that the increase in minimum wage implemented in 2010 will
have adverse effects on competitiveness and employment. At about 50 percent of the
average wage, the minimum wage was already higher than in most EU countries. The
23 percent increase prevented wages to fully respond to the downturn. It hurt employment in
labor intensive sectors and put upward pressure on the general wage level, exacerbating
already high unit labor cost compared to regional peers. The increase is also likely to reduce
incentives for workers to increase their human capital by compressing the wage differential
between unskilled and specialized low-skilled workers. The authorities stressed that the
increase responded to a request of social partners and has so far not had significant impact on
employment, although they recognized that it resulted in wage compression and could have
negative effects on competitiveness. Staff suggested that eliminating the mandatory wage

18
supplement for years of service could foster employment, particularly of older workers.
Consideration should be also given to avoid any further indexation of the minimum wage.

Improvement in the business environment would enhance FDI attractiveness
and boost productivity. Slovenia ranks relatively low in indices of competitiveness and ease
of doing business. FDI inflows have therefore been weak, notably in manufacturing and
network industries. In the last two years, the authorities have adopted several measures to
improve business environment, including the creation of one-stop shops for establishing new
companies. Further initiatives are currently contemplated to reduce administrative burden,
facilitate procedures to obtain construction permits, accelerate bankruptcy procedures, and
introduce a cap on social security contributions, compensating any potential revenue loss.
Staff supported these initiatives as they could help enhance Slovenia’s attractiveness as a
destination for FDI.

III. STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
The global crisis exacerbated the Slovenian economy’s previous imbalances in
the fiscal, financial, and real sectors. Easy external financing conditions and expansionary
fiscal policy before the crisis led to a credit boom, rising debt in the corporate sector, and
increasing wages. The global financial crisis and the sharp fall in external demand brought
the domestic boom to an abrupt end. The legacy of the boom-bust cycle is an over-indebted
corporate sector and weaker banks. This cycle also contributed to current large fiscal deficits,
higher unemployment, and deteriorated competitiveness. Also, high pre–crisis growth led to
unfounded expectations that Slovenia could grow out of its structural problems, leading to
postponement of long-overdue reforms. Policy makers and social partners should recognize
that structural reforms are needed for potential output growth to return to pre–crisis levels.
32.
Fiscal consolidation targets are appropriate but the measures announced so far
are insufficient to achieve these goals. In light of the uncertainty in financial markets and
contingent liabilities, the planned consolidation is necessary. The authorities are committed
to the consolidation path. However, additional measures over and above those announced so
far are needed to sustainably bring the general government deficit below 3 percent by 2013.
Measures are mostly temporary and largely rely on extending policies introduced in 2011.
33.
Durable consolidation measures should be specified and implemented. The policy
of removing disparities in public sector wages should not increase the general government
wage bill, and social programs should be better targeted and their eligibility criteria
tightened. The government should also reduce public sector employment by 1 percent per
year in 2011 and 2012 as planned in the stability program. The rise in the minimum wage
that was already implemented last year may put pressure on the public wage bill when the
temporary containment measures are lifted; lasting consolidation measures should be
introduced to offset this effect if it materializes.

20
34.
The pension reform approved by the parliament is a step in the right direction
but is insufficient in the long run. Slovenia is projected to have one of the largest pension
expenditures in the EU by 2050. By increasing retirement age and lowering the replacement
rate, the pension reform will improve fiscal sustainability. However, projections suggest that
transfers from the state budget to the pension fund would remain very large even after the
pension reform. Additional measures will need to be implemented going forward to ensure
sustainability, including: a more rapid increase in the effective retirement age to 65 years of
age for both men and women; moving indexation gradually towards full price indexation;
and automatically indexing the retirement age to life expectancy at retirement once an
effective retirement age of 65 has been attained. In case of rejection of the pension reform in
the referendum, temporary measures such as a freeze in pensions until a new pension reform
is approved, will be needed.
35.
Banks need to be further capitalized. Publicly announced recapitalizations for the
systemic banks are a good start, but probably insufficient. The authorities should further
tighten capital requirements and stand ready to inject public funds if private investors are not
forthcoming. Higher capitalization will keep the banks’ franchise value and contain the cost
of borrowing.
36.
Banks’ governance should be improved, including by broadening the investor
base. Expanding ownership to include private and foreign investors will help address
long-standing governance and risk management weaknesses by reducing possible state
interference in credit allocation. The authorities should set out clear divestment strategies and
commit to their implementation.
37.
Lending practices should not be distorted but monitored carefully. The proposal
to tax banks’ balance sheet to incentivize borrowing to the over-indebted corporate sector is
distortive, and should not be implemented. Given ongoing risks to house prices and the
prospect of rising interest rates, the authorities should take care to prevent recent surges in
mortgage lending from creating new imbalances. The authorities’ willingness to tighten
prudential regulations if necessary is welcome.
38.
Structural reforms in the labor and product markets are critical to boost
potential growth, which has been lagging after the crisis. Labor market restrictions—
especially for dismissals—should be loosened. This, together with accelerating privatization
and measures to enhance competition in product and financial markets, will help foster FDI
inflows. Cancelling any remaining indexation of the minimum wage and eliminating the
mandatory wage supplement for years of service would better align wage and productivity
growth, helping avoiding a further degradation in unit labor cost.
39.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the usual 24month cycle.

1/ Derived as [r - g -  (1+g) +  (1+r)]/(1+g+ +g ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
 = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and  = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [- (1+g (1+r1+g+ +g ) times previous period debt stock. increases with an appreciating domestic currency (> 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

APPENDIX II: REPUBLIC OF SLOVENIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.

Data provision is adequate for surveillance purposes.

2.
Special Data Dissemination Standard: Slovenia has subscribed to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS), meets SDDS specifications, and its metadata are posted on
the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board on the Internet.
http://dsbb.imf.org/Applications/web/sddscountrycategorylist/?strcode=SVN
3.
Real Sector Statistics: The Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia (SORS)
follows the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA95). Quarterly GDP estimates by
industry and expenditure categories are compiled in both current and constant prices, and are
published within 80 days after the reference quarter. In September 2005, the SORS changed
the base year for compiling constant prices GDP from 2000 to the previous year’s prices and
started using the chain–link index methodology.
4.
The SORS compiles the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for
monitoring compliance with the Maastricht inflation criterion. However, price collection is
restricted to four cities and their surrounding rural areas. The weights are based on the threeyear average of expenditure data for consumer goods from continuous Household Budget
Surveys for 2002, 2003, and 2004. It also compiles a retail price index (RPI), which differs
from the consumer price index in weights only.
5.
Government Finance Statistics: Slovenian fiscal statistics are timely and of a high
quality. The ministry of finance publishes a comprehensive monthly Bulletin of Government
Finance, which presents monthly data on the operations of the “state budget” (Budgetary
Central Government), local governments, social security (Pension and Health funds), and the
consolidated general government. The coverage of general government excludes the
operations of extra-budgetary funds and own revenues of general government agencies
(zavods). However, these operations are small in size. Monthly fiscal indicators are reported
for publication in IFS on a timely basis and annual statistics covering general government
operations, including the operations of the extra-budgetary funds are reported for publication
in the Government Finance Statistic Yearbook (GFS Yearbook).
6.
The data published in the Bulletin of Government Finance are on a cash basis and
broadly use the analytical framework and classification system of the IMF’s 1986
government finance statistics methodology. The data reported for publication in the GFS
Yearbook are also on a cash basis but are recast in the analytical framework and
classifications of the Manual on Government Finance Statistics 2001(GFSM 2001).
7.
The Slovenian authorities adopted the GFSM 2001 methodology, which is used as a
building block for the compilation of the ESA 95–based data jointly by the Ministry of
Finance and the SORS for reporting to the European Commission. To assist the Ministry of
Finance resolve several classification issues and develop a migration path, a STA technical
assistance mission visited Ljubljana in April 2006. The introduction in 2008 of a new chart of

5

accounts for all public entities based on accrual principles greatly facilitated the adoption of
the new methodology.
8.

Money and Banking Statistics: Monetary statistics are timely and of good quality.

9.
Balance of Payments Statistics: Balance of payments data are comprehensive and of
high quality. The data have been published in the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook
since 1993 (with estimates of the international investment position published since 1994). In
2002, the Bank of Slovenia revised the balance of payments statistics going back to 1994; the
most significant revisions were related to the income component of the current account and
to the other investment component of the financial account.
10.
External Debt Statistics: External debt statistics were revised and brought in line
with the SDDS in August 2003. The main change comprised the inclusion of trade credits in
the debt data.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Slovenia
On May 20, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Republic of Slovenia.1
Background
Slovenia’s economy is gradually recovering following one of the sharpest GDP declines in the
euro area during the crisis. Real GDP declined over 10 percent from peak to trough owing to: a
sharp decline in external demand; a significant tightening in external credit conditions forcing
banks to curtail domestic credit supply; and an abrupt end of a construction and housing price
boom. Real GDP growth reached 1.2 percent in 2010, led by rising exports. Weak domestic
demand led to negative core inflation and greatly reduced the current account deficit. The
current account deficit shrank from 6.7 percent of GDP in 2008 to 1.2 in 2010, reflecting mainly
the end of the construction boom. Average CPI inflation was 1.8 percent in 2010, mainly
because of rising fuel and energy prices. The average unemployment rate increased to
7.2 percent in 2010 up from 4.8 percent at end 2008.
GDP growth is projected at 2 percent in 2011. The pick–up in growth reflects mainly a recovery
in the manufacturing sector and inventory rebuilding. However, investment will likely be low due
to deleveraging in the highly indebted corporate sector. High unemployment and fiscal
retrenchment will weigh on consumption growth. Average inflation is projected to gradually pick
up on the back of high commodity prices. The current account deficit is expected to widen again
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

as the economy recovers, but not as much as in pre-crisis times. The main risks to the outlook
are the near–term dependence of the recovery on external demand and significant contingent
public liabilities from entitlement spending and banks. The postponement of pension and labor
market reforms could also lead to further deterioration in competitiveness and potential output
growth.
The general government fiscal deficit narrowed in 2010. After widening considerably during the
crisis, the general government deficit declined to 5.2 percent in 2010. The main factors were
one-off revenue gains, cuts in capital transfers, and containment of the wage bill. The deficit is
expected to continue narrowing in 2011 primarily through further wage bill rationalizations,
reduced indexation of pensions and other entitlements, and capital expenditure and capital
transfer cuts. The authorities aim to reduce the fiscal deficit to below 3 percent by 2013. In the
long term, pension expenditure poses a challenge to fiscal sustainability. Slovenia is projected
to have one of the largest pension expenditures in the EU by 2050 if no reform is implemented.
The authorities started addressing the challenge with the pension reform that will increase the
effective retirement age and lower the replacement rate. But additional reforms will be needed
to ensure sustainability of the system in the long run.
The crisis exposed vulnerabilities in the financial sector. The rapidly expanding credit growth
financed with short–term external bank borrowing came to a sudden stop in 2008. Banks’
profitability and asset quality deteriorated with aggregate profits turning negative in 2010 due to
high loan losses to the highly indebted corporate sector. Total assets declined and corporate
credit growth remained anemic. Slovenian banks are among the most thinly capitalized in the
EU, particularly the systemic domestic banks. Publicly announced recapitalizations are sufficient
to offset the accumulated losses of the last two years. But, given the thin capitalization at the
eve of the crisis, they will not be sufficient to create new lending capacity.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that, inspite of the authorities’ commendable policy response,
Slovenia experienced one of the largest drops in output in the euro area. The domestic boom,
fueled by easy external financing conditions and an expansionary fiscal policy, came abruptly to
an end with the global financial crisis. While a gradual recovery is underway, important
challenges remain. Directors emphasized the need to keep the recovery on track, safeguard the
sustainability of public finances, enhance financial sector resilience, and strengthen
competitiveness.
Directors supported the authorities’ fiscal consolidation targets, but stressed the importance of
specifying and implementing additional and durable consolidation measures. Social programs
should be better targeted, and the planned reduction in public sector employment should be
implemented.

3

Directors emphasized the crucial role of pension reform. While the current reform is a step in
the right direction, it will likely fall short in generating the needed savings in the long run.
Directors considered that additional measures should include a more rapid increase in the
effective retirement age and moving indexation gradually toward full-price indexation. Directors
stressed the importance of a strengthened communication strategy to help build social
consensus for reform. They also encouraged the authorities to prepare contingency measures
in case of rejection of the pension reform.
Directors highlighted the risks associated with the thinly capitalized banking sector. The nearterm priority should be on further increasing banks’ capital buffers, along with strengthened
supervision. The recently completed recapitalizations for the systemic banks are a good start,
but probably insufficient. Directors also encouraged further tightening of capital requirements to
reinforce the recapitalizations. They considered expanding ownership to include private and
foreign investors as a key measure to help address governance and risk management
weaknesses, as well as to acquire additional capital. Directors encouraged the authorities to set
out and implement clear divestment strategies for their ownership stakes in domestic banks.
Directors cautioned that lending activity should be monitored carefully, but not distorted with adhoc measures, such as the recently taken measure of taxing banks’ balance sheets to
incentivize borrowing by the over-indebted corporate sector. They encouraged the authorities to
monitor housing price developments closely to prevent recent surges in mortgage lending from
creating new imbalances. Directors welcomed the authorities’ willingness to tighten prudential
regulations if necessary.
To address the slowdown in the economy’s growth potential and to boost competitiveness,
Directors agreed that structural reforms in labor and product markets will play a crucial role.
They viewed the loosening of labor market restrictions, phasing-out of wage indexation
schemes, and eliminating of pay increases unrelated to productivity gains as key in helping
reduce unemployment. Directors also encouraged the authorities to enhance competition in
product and financial markets to foster foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Slovenia will be held on a 12-month cycle.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or countries)
concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with member
countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Slovenia
May 16, 2011
1.
This statement provides additional information on economic developments and policy
action in Slovenia since the Article IV mission complementing the staff report (SM/11/92).
The additional information does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
The announced state bank recapitalizations were completed. The government of
Slovenia bought most of the 250 million euros in newly issued shares of Nova Ljubljanska
Banka (NLB) at end March. The other large shareholder, KBC, bought less than 7 million
euros. Similarly, Nova Kreditna Banka Maribor (NKBM), the second largest Slovenian bank,
completed a capital increase of about 104 million euros at end April. The publicly owned
electricity and postal companies bought 51 percent of the newly issued shares while the
remainder was placed with private shareholders. After the recapitalizations, the overall
governments’ stake considering holdings by all publicly owned entities in NLB is estimated
to have increased to 59 percent while the stake in NKBM remained unchanged at 51 percent.
3.
The recapitalizations will have a one off fiscal impact of about 0.7 percent of
GDP on the 2011 general government deficit. This fiscal impact is generated by the
recapitalization of NLB. A decision from the European Commission adopted during April
indicated that the funds used for NLB’s recapitalization should be treated as state aid thus
increasing the general government fiscal deficit for 2011. The authorities have already
incorporated the 0.7 percent of GDP impact in their stability program, and given the one off
nature, will not require offsetting measures. Unlike NLB’s recapitalization, NKBM’s
recapitalization does not affect the general government deficit given that publicly owned
companies not belonging to the general government purchased the shares.
4.
The government approved a tax on bank assets. The government adopted in April
a bill introducing a tax on total assets of banks. The tax was announced as a temporary
measure. The need for the measure will be reassessed in 2013. Banks which are active in
giving out loans to businesses will get certain incentives and could be exempt from the new
tax. Those who are not exempt will have to pay tax in the amount of 0.1 percent of their total
assets for the year. Given that the large state banks which dominate the banking system are
likely going to benefit from the exemptions, the revenue yield from the tax is expected to be
negligible.
5.
The law on mini-jobs was overwhelmingly rejected in a referendum in early
April and the referendum on the pension reform is scheduled for early June. The
rejection by referendum will postpone the labor market reforms the mini jobs act was
supposed to implement by at least one year given legal constraints to legislate again on the
same topic before this time period. Current polls suggest that the pension reform is also likely
to be rejected.

Statement by Johann Prader, Alternate Executive Director for Slovenia, and Andrej
Kavcic, Advisor to the Executive Director for Slovenia
May 20, 2011
We would like to thank staff for the fruitful and constructive dialogue during the 2011
Article IV mission to Slovenia. The Slovenian authorities broadly agree with staff’s analysis
and recommendations.
Economic developments
Even though Slovenia largely avoided the first wave of the financial crisis, it was severely hit
when the crisis affected the real sector. As an export-dependent economy, Slovenia
experienced a sharp GDP decline in 2009 (- 8.1 percent), which was aggravated by the
concurrent phasing out of the national highway construction program. The sharp decline in
external demand and curtailed credit supply weighed heavily on the highly leveraged
corporate sector, particularly construction. Due to the relatively low debt-to-GDP ratio and
solid household balance sheets Slovenia managed to avoid spillovers from the European
sovereign debt crisis.
The crisis left a strong mark on the Slovenian economy. An export-led recovery is under
way, but remains gradual. Whereas the export-oriented manufacturing sector is rebounding
relatively fast, the recovery in other sectors is sluggish due to persistent high unemployment,
a very low level of investment and weak domestic demand. The unemployment rate, which
increased to 7.2 percent in 2010, is expected to peak this year at 7.5 percent but is likely to
start decreasing gradually in 2012 and thereafter. Against this background, GDP growth,
which turned to a positive 1.2 percent in 2010, is estimated at 2.0 percent this year, although
most international forecasters, including the OECD, the European Commission and staff tend
to be somewhat more optimistic than the authorities’ conservative approach. The relatively
gradual economic recovery is heavily influenced by the continuous deleveraging in the
construction sector, which was over-dimensioned before the crisis, and the relatively limited
activity in the financial sector.
Fiscal consolidation
During the crisis fiscal policy turned countercyclical, with automatic stabilizers working and
discretional stimulus measures amounting to 1.8 percent of GDP in 2009 and 0.2 percent in
2010, thereby increasing the deficit. After a moderate surplus in 2007 and a moderate deficit
in 2008, the deficit widened to 5.5 percent of GDP in 2009 and 5.2 percent in 2010. The
government has been continuing with the consolidation efforts in 2011 and targeted a
reduction to 4.8 percent. However, the government’s participation in the recapitalization of

the systemic bank Nova Ljubljanska Banka (NLB) in the amount of EUR 243 million is
increasing the deficit. The European Commission classified this participation as state aid
(Commission Decision of March 8, 2011), thereby increasing the nominal deficit in 2011 by
0.7 percentage points higher (totaling 5.5 percent) than originally scheduled. Given that the
measure is one-off, this move does not impact the underlying consolidation of the structural
deficit.
The authorities are committed to bringing the fiscal deficit to below 3 percent of GDP by
2013. They find the staff scenario overly pessimistic, especially in view of Slovenia’s proven
track-record of better-than-budgeted outcomes. Under the government’s exit strategy, all
stimulus measures except subsidies for temporarily laid-off workers were phased out by the
end of 2010. In line with the EU’s Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP), a program of
gradually reducing the general government deficit to below 3 percent by 2013 was prepared.
In light of the already relatively high tax burden, fiscal consolidation will be expenditurebased, primarily comprising measures in the area of wages, pensions and social benefits.
Among the short-term measures, wage bill growth will be contained by the reduction in
aggregate salary by 2.2 percent in nominal terms and non-indexation of wages to inflation in
2011 and 2012. The policy of reducing employment in the public sector by 1 percent
annually will continue. To underpin the necessary fiscal consolidation an intervention act
was passed for the 2011 budget implementation. The government is contemplating additional
measures by means of a new intervention act to safeguard the deficit–reduction process.
To ensure sustainability of public finances in the long run, the government has embarked on
fiscal structural reforms which include pension, health care and financial management
reforms. The pension reform, which is crucial, was adopted by the Parliament in December
2010, and includes an increase in the minimum and full retirement ages (to 60 and 65,
respectively), a gradual extension of the period for calculating the pension base from the 18
best consecutive years to 34 years, a change in the indexation of pension benefits and
changes in the system of incentives. Unfortunately, the reform will be challenged in a
referendum on June 5, 2011, and the outcome remains uncertain. Pending the outcome of the
referendum, the government is designing contingency measures. One of the alternative
measures is a temporary freeze of pensions and the immediate submission of a new proposal.
In the public financial management area, performance budgeting has been gradually
introduced across all ministries. In addition, changes to the Public Finance Law are under
way and are expected to be passed by the parliament not later than by the end of the year.
They will introduce a medium-term budgetary framework (MTF), expenditure ceilings
(“fiscal rule”), a debt ceiling of 45 percent of GDP, and a ceiling for all government
guarantees. The new act will also further strengthen the responsibilities and accountability
structure for the recently created fiscal council.

The financial system
The global crisis exacerbated the weaknesses of the financial system characterized mainly by
short-term external bank borrowing and over-indebted corporate sector. As a consequence,
weakened banks are coping with declining profitability incurred by loan losses of the highly
indebted non-financial corporate sector, especially construction and leveraged holding
companies. Despite aggregate loan losses in 2009 and 2010, which were mainly due to very
conservative provisioning, banks are expected to turn profitable (in aggregate) again in 2011.
The authorities are aware that Basel III will require higher capital ratios and concur with staff
that strengthening capital buffers is necessary. In this context, the central bank has
accelerated efforts to comply with Basel III. As the first step, the two largest banks, NLB and
Nova kreditna Banka Maribor (NKBM) were recapitalized. The latest recapitalization of the
systemically most important bank, NLB, will ensure a Tier 1 capital ratio of almost 8 percent,
while the raising of additional capital will be explored as needed. In line with OECD
recommendations and staff encouragement to ensure a greater role of private investors and to
strengthen governance of the financial sector, the government adopted the Strategy for the
Financial Sector Development in April 2011, as the first one in a series of sectoral strategies
under preparation. The strategy advocates the creation of 3 financial pillars centered round
the two largest banks (NLB and NKBM) and the largest insurance group, Triglav. While the
state maintains shareholdings in all three financial groups, the Strategy envisages
systematical divesting over time, whereby the state would limit its shareholding to 25 percent
at the most. Following the OECD recommendations to delink state ownership in the
companies from their management, an independent Capital Asset Management Agency was
established. Besides managing the state assets in such companies and restructuring them for
sale, the agency will prepare a recommendation on the disposal of non-strategic assets, based
on sectoral strategies. In order to stimulate the credit activity of banks to the non-financial
sector the government put forward a proposal for a tax on banks’ assets, aimed at taxing all
banks’ assets while a tax allowance is introduced for banks which are expanding their credit
activity. The draft legislation is currently discussed by the parliament with a view of
enforcement by July 1, 2011.
Structural issues
The authorities agree with staff that maintaining competitiveness is crucial for Slovenia as a
small and export dependent economy, especially due to the large share of labor-intensive
products. In dialogue with the social partners, the government has been trying to introduce a
greater level of flexible arrangements in the labor market and ensure prudent trends in the
growth of unit labor costs. While consensus on increasing security can be quickly reached,

increasing labor market flexibility has met with political resistance. As a consequence, the
Mini-Jobs Act, regulating student work and aiming to contribute to increasing employment,
was repealed in a referendum in April 2011. Reduction of regular workers’ employment
protection, in particular rapid reduction in notice periods and severance payments,
recommended by staff, is being considered by the government along with other measures in
the labor market. To enhance FDI attractiveness and boost productivity new initiatives are
currently being considered to reduce and facilitate administrative procedures in starting new
businesses, as well as to accelerate bankruptcy procedures, and potentially reduce social
security contributions.
