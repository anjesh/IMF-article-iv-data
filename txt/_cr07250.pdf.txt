HUNGARY
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2007 Consultation with Hungary
Approved by Susan Schadler and Adnan Mazarei

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Challenges. With fiscal consolidation on track for 2007 and 2008, short-term risks
have receded, especially due to the favorable international financial environment.
Nevertheless, vulnerabilities remain since, even with the ongoing efforts, the debt
levels will stay elevated. Ensuring that the current economic slowdown does not
translate into a prolonged period of low growth is important both for raising standards
of living and for containing vulnerabilities.
Staff views. The ongoing fiscal consolidation should be used to fundamentally reorient
fiscal affairs. Putting the debt on a sustainable downward trend will also require a
substantial decrease in the size of government expenditure in relation to GDP. As
structural reforms enter their more difficult phase, the momentum of change could slow
down. With inflation set to decline, an easing cycle could bring policy rates closer to
regional levels. Staff continues to recommend a shift from the current band to a
floating exchange rate regime. Despite new strains, the financial sector remains sound.
Measures to improve the regulatory environment and ensure productive use of EU
funds should help raise potential growth.
Authorities’ views. The authorities are less concerned than is staff about short-term
vulnerabilities but do share concerns about medium-term growth prospects. The
needed ambitious fiscal consolidation measures to continue the process beyond 2008
are under discussion. The short-term risks of currency appreciation, if the band were
removed, constrain their willingness to change to a floating regime. Views on interest
rate policy, the financial sector, and structural reforms largely coincide with those of
staff.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The resolute fiscal policy measures renew the prospects of stepped-up gains
from integration into Europe. Such integration has fostered enduring income growth
through trade, foreign direct investment, and access to financial markets. Also, financial
markets have forgiven policy errors and tolerated policy uncertainties. But, with elevated
debt levels, vulnerabilities remain and markets’ latitude carries risks if pressing policy
decisions are deferred. The cost is borne not as visible financial crises but in a more insidious
loss of international competitiveness. The erosion of Hungary’s growth potential coincides
with its fiscal deterioration—and recent European history cautions that low-growth traps are
a real possibility. To realize the continuing potential of integration, pushing ahead with
ongoing efforts to restore public finances and create a favorable business environment will
pay early dividends and allow competitive entry into the eurozone.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
2.
In mid-2006, the authorities put a brake on the runaway fiscal deficit. From
7.8 percent of GDP in 2005, the fiscal deficit rose to 9.1 percent of GDP in 2006, as against
the budget target of 6.4 percent of GDP (Tables 1 and 2). The end-year public debt rose by
nearly 4 percentage points to about 66 percent of GDP. In mid-year, the deficit threatened to
run away to 11 percent of GDP when a revised Convergence Programme (CP) announced
emergency measures (Box 1). Since then, the consolidation has proceeded faster than
promised. The “overperformance” has been due mainly to higher-than-expected revenues,
reflecting, in turn, improvements in the tax administration.1

1

Collections of social security contributions and income taxes have been particularly strong. Excises and VAT
have also performed better than expected.

4

Box 1. Surveillance and Policies
Fiscal Policy: The authorities’ fiscal consolidation plan in 2006 relied to a greater extent
on tax increases than advised by the Fund. However, expenditure measures with a
longer-term view have been undertaken and others are under discussion. Consistent with
the Fund’s recommendations, the authorities have advanced fiscal transparency and
accountability, including of public-private partnerships, and are exploring new fiscal rules
and further external scrutiny of fiscal policy by an independent council.
Monetary Policy: The increase in policy rates in the second half of 2006 was at the
higher end of the range recommended by the Fund. The authorities do not view the shift to
a floating exchange rate regime as necessary at present.
Financial Sector: In line with Fund’s advice, the authorities have made appreciable
progress in conducting stress tests and have undertaken more proactive banking
supervision.
Labor Market: The government is tightening the disability pension and the early
retirement program and is considering a gradual increase in the retirement age.

3.
The current account deficit has been falling, but external financing
requirements remain high. From 8.4 percent of GDP in 2004, the current account deficit
fell to 5.8 percent of GDP in 2006 (Table 3 and Figure 1). However, with net errors and
omissions widening to 3 percent of GDP, net financing needs remained at about 9 percent of

GDP (figure below). Of these, debt-creating flows were about 5½ percent of GDP in 2006,
raising the end-year external debt to 91 percent of GDP.
4.
Investor sentiment towards Hungary has improved. In mid-2006, fiscal
uncertainties placed Hungarian financial assets under intense pressure. The exchange rate fell
to a low of F285/euro (Figure 2). It has since appreciated and its volatility has come down
(figure below). About one-half of the appreciation reflects renewed bullishness for central
European economies (Box 2). The other half, attributable to a more benign view of Hungary,
has been helped by the fiscal policy efforts and, in part, by short-term weakness in domestic
demand. Domestic weakness has contained import growth, helping currency appreciation.

Box 2. Regional Influences on Asset Prices
Common regional factors have dominated asset price movements in Hungary, Poland,
Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, and Slovenia (the CE-4).1/ From its most depreciated
level in June 2006, about 55 percent of the forint’s 12 percent appreciation reflects the CE-4
common component (table and figure). The 24 percent increase in the stock price index over
the same period was overwhelmingly led by positive regional investor sentiment; the
Hungary-specific component actually fell after the start of the year (table and figure).

5.
With crisis risk alleviated, Hungary’s growth performance has moved into the
spotlight. GDP growth deteriorated relative to the rest of Europe starting early 2005 (figure
below). The divergence was accentuated in 2006, when GDP growth declined to 3.9 percent
just when much of Europe accelerated. Since the last quarter of 2006, GDP growth rate, at
around 3 percent, has been below that of the euro zone. Hungary risks falling further behind.

6.
Consumption growth and, especially, investment have weakened. Private
consumption had started to decelerate even before the announcement of the fiscal
consolidation package, with soft employment conditions and moderating net real wages in
early 2006 (figure below). Since then, the higher taxes and regulated prices have further
dampened consumption growth (figure below). The investment decline since the second
quarter of 2006 also predates the fiscal package. In the absence of direct profitability
estimates, proximate measures suggest a fall in Hungarian relative profitability (figure
below).2 The gross national investment fell to 23 percent of GDP in 2006, while outward FDI
increased to 2.7 percent of GDP (Figure 1 and Table 1).

7.
The continued success of exports remains crucial, but the signals on
competitiveness are mixed. Strong export growth in the past three years has been sustained
by a shift from European and U.S. markets to fast-growing emerging markets (Figure 3).
However, Hungary has underperformed relative to the other CE-4 over 2000-06, especially
in the value of exports (figure below). The technological upgrading of exports has slowed
(Figure 3), and Hungary’s share of world markets has stabilized (figure below). The unit
labor cost-based real exchange rate depreciated with the nominal exchange rate in mid-2006
(Figure 3), and has appreciated since then. As Box 3 explains, measures of the equilibrium
exchange rate are highly uncertain in short periods with significant structural changes. As of
end-2006, the trade-weighted exchange rate was possibly overvalued by 8-10 percent. This,
however, is not a serious concern, given the buoyant external environment.

The inflation surge in 2006 was primarily due to one-off factors. In 2006, average
headline and core inflation were 3.9 and 2.3 percent, respectively (figure below). Inflation
rates were headed down in early 2006, with year-on-year headline inflation reaching a low of
2.7 percent in the second quarter. However, the hikes in indirect tax rates and regulated
prices to support fiscal consolidation pushed the headline inflation rate up to 6.5 percent in
the last quarter. After reaching 9 percent in March 2007, inflation fell to 8.5 percent in May.

Bank lending—especially in foreign currencies—has decelerated with weakening
domestic demand. Corporate borrowing actually fell in the first quarter of 2007 with a sharp
decline in foreign currency-denominated borrowing (table and figure below). The heightened
exchange rate volatility in mid- and late-2006 may have helped reduce the demand for
foreign currency-denominated loans (figure below). Households, however, continued to
borrow in foreign currencies. The share of foreign currency loans stabilized in the second
half of 2006 at about 54 percent of all loans.

III. POLICY DISCUSSION

The authorities are focused on establishing a sustainable fiscal outlook, crucial
to maintaining stability and promoting growth. Dealing with the still formidable fiscal
challenges remains the central policy task.

A. Outlook and Risks
11.
The authorities were pleased that market pressures had subsided, but staff
cautioned that the risks remain significant. The fiscal deficit is on a downward trend but,
besides short-term uncertainties, measures for a further reduction of the deficit beyond 2008
have not yet been outlined. On current policies, staff projects the 2009 deficit to be
4 percentof GDP, while the authorities are expecting it to be 3¼ percent of GDP. The task
ahead remains formidable also because of the government’s contingent liabilities arising
from loss-making public enterprises (figure below) and increasing pressures from age-related
expenditures (table below).4 Public debt is expected to remain at about 66 percent of GDP for
the next few years (Table 5 and Figure 4).

External vulnerabilities also remain worrisome. The current account deficit is
expected to fall, with the staff and Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) projecting about 5 percent
of GDP in 2007 and the Ministry of Finance (MoF) projecting an even lower deficit.
However, the financing requirement remains uncertain on account of the unclear causes of
the net errors and omissions and could remain 2-3 percentage points higher than the current
account deficit. The external debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to decline in 2007 to about
79 percent because of the forint’s appreciation relative to 2006 (figure below, Figure 5, and
Table 6).5 However, policy slippages and deterioration in international market sentiment
could weaken the forint, raising the debt ratio.6 The ratio of reserves to external short-term
debt of about 100 percent provides a good short-term buffer.

5

A 3 percent appreciation of the forint is assumed in 2007.

6

A 10 percent nominal depreciation would raise the debt-to-GDP ratio by about 10 percentage points.

13.
A strong growth recovery after the ongoing fiscal adjustment is not assured.
GDP growth is projected to fall to 2.7 percent in 2007 (Table 4). The recent increase in
unemployment expectations is likely to keep consumption growth low (figure below). Recent
investment trends have not been favorable, and the virtual standstill in corporate borrowing
implies that investment is likely to remain weak. The weakness in investment could prove
self-reinforcing in the current policy context.7 The MoF takes the view that Hungary is in a
temporary adjustment phase, and growth, consistent with a potential rate of between 4 and
5 percent a year, will resume once this phase is over. However, the MNB’s view is closer to
that of staff. Together with the deceleration in GDP growth since early 2005, recent
developments suggest that growth may stay in a range of 3-3½ percent a year over the next
few years. Absent vigorous policy efforts, recovery to 4 percent growth may well occur only
gradually.
14.
The MNB projects inflation to decline to within the 3 ±1 percent target range in
the 18-month forecasting horizon. The MoF emphasized that recent wage increases partly
reflect advances in bonus payments and higher reported earnings because of stronger tax
compliance. The MNB, however, expressed concern that the currently high inflation could
persist in the short term if negotiated wages were to compensate for higher prices. Staff noted
that there is yet no clear evidence of labor market tightening. Given its flexibility, the labor
market is unlikely to create inflationary pressures. Also, as discussed below, following the
introduction of inflation targeting, inflation persistence has declined.
7

A selected issues paper suggests that negative economic shocks in Hungary cannot be presumed to self-correct
and will persist without policy initiatives to reverse them.

The 2007 and 2008 fiscal deficit targets are within reach, but risks need
attention. The government has lowered its 2007 fiscal deficit forecast from 6.8 to 6.6 percent
of GDP, while staff projects a deficit closer to 6¼ percent of GDP, given the faster than
promised consolidation in 2006 and continued strong revenues (table below and Table 2).
Staff emphasized that if revenues overperform, the authorities should aim at further lowering
the deficit. For 2008, the authorities’ deficit target of 4.3 percent of GDP appears within
reach with the expenditure measures in the pipeline and the expiration of certain one-off
obligations. Upside risks are related to the future of wage freezes and the unclear nature of
certain expenditure overruns in 2006 (worth about ¾ percent of GDP).

Staff congratulated the authorities on tangible expenditure measures, and the
discussions centered on consolidation needs beyond the CP targets. Important measures
have been taken including in reducing public employment, instituting co-payments by
patients, rationalizing hospital beds, and scaling back pharmaceutical subsidies (Table 7).8
However, the authorities recognize that continued consolidation beyond the targets set in the
CP is needed. Even if the CP is fully implemented, the sizable 2009 fiscal deficit, the high
public debt-to-GDP ratio, and a large government and tax wedge would continue to
undermine stability and growth. Staff pressed for further action now, since reforms would
bring savings only over time. Continued consolidation in 2009 and beyond—relying on
durable expenditure restraint and broadening of the tax base—would put the debt-to-GDP
ratio on a sustainable downward trend, raise potential growth, and help adopt the euro early
in the next decade.
17.
Implicit in the ongoing debate on fiscal reform is the future role of the state in
delivering public services and social security. The authorities and staff agreed that much
can be gained from greater efficiency and better targeting of expenditures (table below). The
more far-reaching measures being contemplated require that the goal of solidarity—or shared
commitment—be preserved in the context of greater private responsibility. Staff suggested
that a benchmark would be to achieve an expenditure-to-GDP ratio of between 40 and
45 percent from the current 53 percent (figure below). The authorities saw value in such a
benchmark but noted that it was not yet a focal point of the reform strategy.

The authorities described the scope for broader changes, but emphasized
political limitations. In health care, the policy debates have focused on competition in the

18

supply of health insurance. Staff argued for a broader discussion on competition in health
services’ provision. The restructuring and corporate governance of hospitals are, therefore,
crucial to further progress. The authorities noted that such reforms were politically difficult,
given needed parliamentary support for constitutional changes. Reforms of subsidies and of
disability and early retirement pensions, reductions in the replacement rate of pensions for
new retirees, and restructuring of central public administration are under way (Table 7).
Under discussion are the changes to indexation of pension benefits and a gradual increase in
the retirement age, which are crucial to improve the long-term sustainability of public
finances. Also under discussion are more far-reaching reforms of pensions and education
through the consensus-seeking “roundtables.” Staff welcomed these proposals and
encouraged their early implementation. Reforms of budget support to families, housing
subsidies, and, importantly, local governments are not in the authorities’ plans, but remain
key for efficiency and equity.
19.
The authorities are exploring the scope for improving the tax system while
maintaining revenue neutrality. They agreed with staff that tax reform should not endanger
the fiscal adjustment path and aim, for now, to increase efficiency, fairness, and stability.
Staff welcomed efforts to institute a property tax but noted the importance of early measures
to establish a property registry based on market valuation and simple rate structures. Based
on recent technical assistance by the Fund, staff highlighted other priorities, including
streamlining the personal income tax (while maintaining the principle of progressivity) and
broadening the base of the corporate income tax by phasing out exemptions and simplifying
deductions. Given the importance of raising employment rates (table below), and bearing
revenue objectives in mind, a measured reduction in high labor tax costs (figure below) could
be achieved in tandem with benefit consolidation. Also, consumption taxes may need to be
increased to reduce labor taxes. These efforts could be a prelude to reducing the tax wedge
once the fiscal space has been created through expenditure rationalization.

The authorities intend to institute stronger defenses against fiscal indiscipline.
They are considering implementing new fiscal rules, a medium-term expenditure targeting
framework, and stricter budget monitoring.9 Absent concerted leadership to establish selfdiscipline, Hungary could be stuck in a loop of high deficits and debt with weak and opaque
budgetary processes.10 Staff also emphasized that the new fiscal rules should be suitably
ambitious to place public debt on a sustainable downward path. Appropriately sequenced
complementary reforms in public financial management systems and budget processes (an
area on ongoing technical assistance by the Fund) are also needed to credibly deliver on
fiscal goals. Also, strengthening the external scrutiny of fiscal policy by an independent
council would promote transparency and accountability. Staff was encouraged by the
authorities’ consideration of such reform.
C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
21.
With inflation projected to decline, the authorities and staff agreed that an
easing interest rate cycle could commence once inflation has turned. Market participants
are beginning to anticipate policy rate reductions. Factors favoring a rate cut include tighter
monetary conditions (figure below), the economic slowdown, and no evident signs of
inflation being embedded in wage contracts. The inflation rate has fallen slowly but steadily
since March, indicating the possibility that inflation may have peaked. Short-term (monthon-month) inflation trends indicate that the effects of the fiscal measures have decayed
(figure below). These developments are consistent with the evidence that inflation
persistence to shocks has declined over time (Box 4). Nevertheless, MNB is not yet
persuaded that inflation persistence can be ruled out in the current circumstances. In
9

New regulations on public-private partnerships now allow the MoF to exercise veto power over projects that
are not fiscally affordable or do not deliver value for money.
10

A selected issues paper discusses the European evidence.

20

particular, they read the wage data as giving ambiguous signals. Staff is somewhat less
concerned about wage pressures than is the MNB, but agreed that caution is justified.

22.
Once an easing cycle commences, and if inflation expectations permit, there may
be room for sizeable interest rate reduction. In June 2006, the policy rate was 6 percent
with moderating inflation; the rate was then hiked to 8 percent in response to accelerating
inflation. Forward rates now suggest that markets expect Hungarian policy rates to decline,
as rates rise in the region (figure below). This convergence, in staff’s view, will encourage
borrowing in forints and, hence, render monetary policy more relevant and effective. The
authorities expect that greater reliance on statements of policy inclinations could partially
substitute for the sharp changes in policy rates; and the effectiveness of the inflation targeting
framework would be helped by endogenous interest rate forecasting—projecting an interest
rate path consistent with the desired changes in inflation.
23.
With euro adoption some years away, staff reiterated the recommendation of
moving to a floating rate regime. Even though the exchange rate band is wide
(±15 percent), it has occasionally constrained policymaking. Also, markets can have received
unclear signals about whether rate decisions are oriented toward inflation targets or exchange
rate bands. From a risk-management perspective, therefore, eliminating the band would be
desirable. Hungary possesses the necessary prerequisites—a well-functioning foreign
exchange interbank market and a credible monetary policy framework—for such a move.
The authorities, however, remain unpersuaded owing to fears of short-term appreciation of
the currency. While such a risk does exist, a more medium-term perspective should guide the
decision and its timing.

indicator of future monetary policy decisions.

D. Financial Sector
24.
The authorities and staff agreed that key trends in the banking sector need close
monitoring. First, with intense competition, banks are financing riskier activities (Figure 6).
Moreover, bankruptcies and liquidations are up, and the macroeconomic adjustment could
further strain parts of the banking system. Second, though the share of foreign currency loans
extended by banks stabilized in the second half of 2006, the unhedged exposure of
households to foreign currency loans has continued to rise, creating credit risks for banks.
Finally, to fund credit growth, banks are relying on foreign interbank deposits and debt
securities, some of which are subject to greater liquidity risks than traditional deposits.
25.
However, banks have significant financial buffers, and the supervisory authority
has responded appropriately to cautionary signals. The capital adequacy ratio remains at
a relatively healthy 11 percent (Table 8). Profitability is high, although it could come under
pressure with higher funding costs and decreasing interest margins. The MNB’s aggregate
stress tests indicate that the banking sector is resilient to GDP shocks (figure below). The
Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authority (HFSA) has started conducting bottom-up
market-risk stress tests, which have been used to induce higher capitalization and

23

strengthened risk management practices. The banks themselves are lengthening the maturity
of foreign funds and extending more variable-rate long-term loans, which mitigates interest
risk (though may raise credit risk). The HFSA and MNB are planning needed collaboration
on credit risk stress tests. The authorities expect that Basel II rules will be in place by
January 2008.

Among new challenges is the rapid growth of the non-bank financial sector.
“Non-bank” financial intermediaries, especially investment and pension funds, have grown
in importance (table). Their distressed loans have grown faster than those of banks (figure

E. Structural Reforms
27.
Hungary, the authorities recognize, may be falling behind regional peers in
maintaining its overall business climate. Within central and eastern Europe, Hungary has
been at the lower end of the competitiveness rankings (table below). While the labor market
is flexible, the administrative costs of setting up a business are relatively high (Figure 7).
Hungarian business indicators are not necessarily becoming worse; other countries have been
more proactive in improving business operating conditions. In this context, the government’s
recent initiative, “In tune with business,” takes the right steps, consistent with the OECD’s
recent Economic Survey. These steps include the simplification of regulatory requirements
and public procurement procedures.

raise productivity and growth. Expenditures financed from the EU budget are to reach
2.7 percent of GDP this year and almost 5 percent of GDP during 2011–13 (table below).

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
Fiscal credibility has been partially regained with the ongoing consolidation, but
vulnerabilities remain. Markets have responded favorably to the deficit reduction measures.
Also, the favorable international financial environment has eased the access to funds. But the
still high fiscal and external deficits are likely to keep public and external debt ratios at
elevated levels. And market sentiment could reverse, especially if accompanied by negative
surprises in fiscal and external accounts.
30.
The spotlight is now on the economic slowdown, which comes on top of earlier
signs of weakness, raising the concern of prolonged low growth. Hungary’s growth,
which stalled in early 2005, could remain in the 3–3½ percent range in the coming few years.
With fiscal consolidation, the decline in consumption growth was expected. Investment
weakness predates the fiscal consolidation and appears set to continue as corporate
borrowing has slowed sharply. Despite mixed signals on exchange rate valuation, staff does
not view the level of the exchange rate as a concern for competitiveness. Rather, competition
from economies with lower wage costs and improving business environments poses a threat
to foreign direct investment inflows and buoyancy of exports.
31.
Continued actions to retain the confidence of markets will also counteract a low
growth trap. Access to Europe’s product, financial, and labor markets has created the
foundation for rapid growth with stability, a process from which Hungary has already
achieved substantial gains. But realizing the full potential of this opportunity requires
continued pursuit of sound public finances and a business environment for firms to operate
competitively in the euro zone. It remains imperative to take advantage of the current
political window—and of the space provided by the markets’ goodwill—to fundamentally
reorient fiscal affairs and ensure continued competitiveness.
32.
Alongside ad hoc emergency measures in 2006, initiatives with a long-term view
are helping to lower the fiscal deficit. Contributing to the expected sizeable reduction in the
deficit is the strengthened tax administration, the sizing down of public employment, and
savings from measures in the health sector. Further measures in the pipeline, relating to
disability pensions and early retirement, move in the right direction and should help the
consolidation.
33.
However, challenges remain. Besides short-term risks to the budget, measures for a
further reduction of the deficit beyond 2009 have not yet been outlined. The task ahead
remains formidable also because of the government’s contingent liabilities arising from lossmaking public enterprises and pressures from age-related expenditures. Reforms of budget
support to families, housing subsidies, and, in particular, local governments have not
advanced but remain key for equity and efficiency. A revenue neutral tax reform that
simplifies and rebalances from labor and capital to consumption taxes, plus budget rules and
procedures that counteract fiscal indiscipline are other major items on the fiscal agenda.

27

34.
Inflation seems likely to return to the target range over the forecasting horizon,
and an easing interest rate cycle can commence once inflation is on a downward trend.
An initial policy rate cut could be followed by further easing if inflation expectations permit.
With this gradual approach, the cumulative reduction during the forthcoming easing cycle
could bring real short-term rates substantially lower. Greater fiscal policy credibility should
help dampen pronounced swings in the policy interest rate, as would increased reliance on
statements of monetary policy inclinations. Also, despite short-term concerns that speculative
pressure may cause an unwarranted appreciation of the Hungarian forint, a move to a floating
exchange rate regime remains desirable from a medium-term perspective.
35.
The financial sector, despite cautionary signals, appears generally sound. Both
long-term financial deepening and cyclical developments are creating new risks and stresses.
With increased competition, loan officers are lending to riskier clients and projects. The
ongoing downturn has raised the number of bankruptcies and liquidations. Banking sector
profitability remains strong, however. The supervisor has responded to recent risks, including
to those arising from foreign currency lending, by requiring some banks to strengthen their
risk-management procedures and capitalization. Ensuring that Basel II regulations are put in
place and strengthening consolidated regulation and supervision should be priorities.
36.
Accelerated improvements in the business climate and effective deployment of
EU funds would help raise productivity and growth. Recent steps including the
simplification of regulatory requirements and public procurement procedures will help
address the gap between Hungary and regional competitors in indicators of the business
climate. The increased EU funds should be dovetailed with ongoing structural reforms,
including strengthening infrastructure, human capital, and the innovation system, while
ensuring, especially for private sector development, transparency and competition in the
award of grants.
37.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

1/ General government gross debt.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.

6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels

5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.

4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.

3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.

2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).

ε = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and α = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.

ANNEX I. HUNGARY: FUND RELATIONS
(As of May 31, 2007)
Mission: April 25-May 7, 2007. The concluding statement of the mission is available at
http://www.imf.org/external/np/ms/2007/050707.htm.
Staff team: Mr. Mody (head), Ms. Fabrizio, Ms Mitra, and Ms. Stolz (all EUR), and
Mr. Corbacho (FAD). Mr. Sierhej, Regional Representative Office, Warsaw, joined the
mission during April 25-26. Mr. Abel from the Executive Director’s office also joined
the mission.
Country interlocutors: Minister of Finance, Governor of Magyar Nemzeti Bank, and
Minister of Health. Officials at the Ministry of Finance, the Magyar Nenzeti Bank, the
Ministry of Education, Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Labor, the State Reform
Committee, the Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authority, Representatives of
Parliament, commercial banks, the academy, investors, asset management companies,
private sector, the Central European Management Intelligence (CEMI), and the
diplomatic community.
Fund relations: The previous consultation took place in June, 2006. The associated
Executive Board assessment is available at
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pn/2006/pn06118.htm and the staff report and other
mission documents at http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.cfm?sk=20035.0 and
http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.cfm?sk=20019.0. Hungary has accepted
the obligations of Article VIII and maintains an exchange rate system free of restrictions
on the making of payments and transfers on current international transactions except for
those maintained solely for the preservation of national or international security and that
have been notified to the Fund pursuant to Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51).
Data: Hungary subscribes to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard. Data
provision is, in general, timely and facilitates effective surveillance (Appendix II).
Anti-money laundering and combating financing of terrorism: In 2005, a Fund
assessment was conducted of Hungary's anti-money laundering (AML) and combating
the financing of terrorism (CFT) 1/ system and concluded that the authorities had made
significant progress in strengthening their AML/CFT regime since the previous
assessment in 2001. The legislative framework for AML was in place and had been
extended to nonfinancial business and professions. Financial institutions’ compliance
with the AML requirements was well-supervised. However, the report indicated that
some gaps remained in the legislative framework for CFT and the implementation of
AML measures needed to be improved. Since 2005, further progress has been made, and
the authorities are currently working on the implementation of the Third EU AML/CFT
Directive.
1/ The result report was adopted at plenary by MONEYVAL, the FATF-style regional
body for Europe, to serve as tis third round evaluation of Hungary.

ANNEX II. HUNGARY—STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision is, in general, timely and facilitates effective surveillance. Significant
progress has been made in improving the coverage, periodicity, and other aspects of quality
of the economic and financial statistics. Most data quality issues noted in the data module of
the 2001 Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) have been satisfactorily
addressed, but some still remain.11
2.
Hungary subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), and its
metadata are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(http://dsbb.imf.org). Hungary meets the SDDS specifications for the coverage, periodicity,
and timeliness of the data, and for the dissemination of advance release calendars.
A. Real Sector Issues
3.
To incorporate EUROSTAT regulations, the Hungarian Central Statistical Office
(HCSO) started to use chain-linked indices in September 2006. Another important
methodological change concerns the GDP compilation by production approach. Until 2006,
the GDP estimation by production approach was based on volume indices for industries. To
measure changes in the sum of gross value added, the volume indices of production were
weighted on the 2000 proportions of GDP. Since the third quarter of 2006, the HCSO has
been using current price estimations. In addition, as of September 2006, the HCSO
introduced direct output volume measurement for some government services (education and
healthcare). Furthermore, the HCSO refined its method to indirectly measure financial
intermediation services by introducing two separate reference rates for transaction in local
and in foreign currencies. Also, the HCSO started to include illegal activities into the
national accounts.

The consumer price index (CPI) is compiled as an annual chained Laspeyres index
using expenditure patterns for weights two years prior to the current period. The computation
of imputed rent for owner-occupied housing is based on the average price changes of
different repair items and does not cover all elements of costs to the user.
B. Balance of Payments
5.
In 2005, the MNB launched a project to set up a new data collection system for
balance of payments and IIP statistics, with a view to replace the international transaction
reporting system with direct reporting of respondents by 2008. In addition, the MNB and the
11

The original 2001 ROSC Data Module and its annual updates are available on the IMF internet web site. The
latest update is Hungary: Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes—Data Module, 2004 Update (July
2004).

6

Hungarian Central Statistical Office (KSH) have established a new data collection system for
international trade in services. As a result, from 2005, data are compiled from KSH surveys
in the areas of travel and business services. For the remaining service items (i.e.,
transportation, insurance, financial and government services), the new data reporting system
is currently being developed. These new statistics on trade in services are to supplement the
statistics on trade in goods, which have used the KSH’s foreign trade data since 2003.
6.
Furthermore, the MNB changed the reporting of stock and flow data of specialpurpose entities (SPE) as of January 1, 2006. According to the international statistical
standards, an offshore firm is resident of the country in which it is registered. The off-shore
status of SPEs ceased to exist on December 31, 2005. From January 2006, the MNB has been
compiling the BOP including data on SPEs. The MNB continues to treat the statistics that
exclude the flow and stock data of SPEs, as readily interpretable in economic terms. In
defining the range of SPEs, the MNB cooperates with the CSO.
C. Monetary Sector
7.
Starting with the release of data for January 2003, the MNB has been compiling and
publishing data based on a new methodology consistent with the European Central Bank’s
framework for monetary statistics using the national residency approach. In addition to the
central bank and credit institutions, monetary statistics now also cover money market funds
(MMFs).
8.
Following Statistics Department (STA) recommendation that securities on the
balance sheets of depository corporations be valued at market prices; the authorities have
pursued improvement. From 2004, depository corporations were encouraged to use market
valuation for securities in their trading portfolio. From 2005, this requirement was made
compulsory for those depository corporations that are listed on the stock exchange.
D. Government Finance Statistics (GFS)
9.
In January 2004, STA conducted a substantive update of the GFS dataset using the
July 2003 Data Quality Assessment Framework. The mission reported that, overall,
significant progress has been made in addressing the shortcomings of budget execution data
and GFS identified in the 2001 ROSC Data Module. These improvements relate mainly to
institutional coverage of general government, consolidation of data and reconciliation of
deficit and financing. However, plans to report monthly expenditures classified on an
economic basis have yet to come to fruition.
10.
The latest data reported for publication in the 2006 GFS Yearbook are for 2005.
These data now cover the operations of the consolidated central government and
consolidated general government sectors, as well as their corresponding subsectors. The data
for 2000 onwards have been compiled on an accrual basis and reported in the Government
Finance Statistics Manual 2001 format.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with
Hungary
On July 18, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Hungary.1
Background
Investor sentiment towards Hungary improved after intense financial market pressure in mid2006. The improvement was helped by the government’s announcement of a fiscal
consolidation package to contain the runaway fiscal deficit. The measures helped contain the
2006 fiscal deficit, which rose to 9.1 percent of GDP. Since mid-2006, the exchange rate,
which had weakened to a low of F285 per euro in June, has appreciated and its volatility has
come down. About one-half of the appreciation reflected renewed bullishness for central
European economies, while the other half was attributable to a more benign view of Hungary.
However, vulnerabilities remain. The public debt is about 66 percent of GDP. Although the
current account deficit fell to 5.8 percent of GDP in 2006, net financing needs remained at
about 9 percent of GDP and the external debt reached 91 percent of GDP.
Growth deceleration from early 2005 brought GDP growth to 3.9 percent in 2006 and
2.7 percent in the first quarter of 2007. Consumption growth weakened further after the
announcement of the fiscal consolidation package in mid-2006; gross domestic capital

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

formation has fallen in the past year. Export growth, which has maintained its strength, was
sustained by a shift from European and U.S. markets to fast-growing emerging European
markets. Inflation surged to 6.5 percent year-on-year in the last quarter of 2006 primarily owing
to the one-off effects of the hikes in taxes and regulated prices to support fiscal consolidation.
After reaching 9 percent in March 2007, inflation fell to 8.5 percent in May, as the one-off
effects apparently peaked.
Bank borrowing, especially in foreign currencies, decelerated in 2006 with the weakening
domestic demand. Although the unhedged exposure of borrowers to foreign currency loans
generates credit risks for banks, the share of foreign currency loans in total loans stabilized in
the second half of 2006 at 54 percent of all loans. Banks appear capable of managing new
stresses and challenges with significant financial buffers, as capital adequacy ratio is at a
healthy level and profitability remains high. Furthermore, the Financial Supervisory Authority
has used its market-risk stress tests to require strengthened capitalization and risk
management practices in major banks.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors congratulated the Hungarian authorities for their resolute efforts to rein in
the budget deficit and rebuild fiscal credibility. Markets have responded favorably to the deficitreduction measures and access to funds has eased.
Directors stressed, however, that the task ahead is formidable and that vulnerabilities remain.
Fiscal and external deficits are still large, and public and external debt ratios are likely to
remain high. Favorable market sentiment could reverse, especially if fiscal and external
accounts deteriorate.
Directors noted that Hungary’s GDP growth performance has deteriorated relative to the rest
of Europe since early 2005, and more since the onset of the fiscal package in mid-2006.
Domestic consumption and investment are expected to recover only gradually. Directors
encouraged the authorities to continue to persevere with structural reforms to improve
competitiveness and spur growth.
Directors cautioned that prolonged low growth would set back income convergence and
aggravate vulnerabilities. While the easy access to Europe’s product, financial, and labor
markets provides the basis for a return to rapid growth with stability, realizing the full potential
of that opportunity will require continued pursuit of sound public finances and a competitive
business environment.
Directors welcomed the structural content of some of the fiscal consolidation measures, and
urged the authorities to outline further such measures so as to extend deficit reduction beyond
2009. They welcomed the measures to strengthen tax administration, to downsize public
employment, to increase efficiency in health and education, and to reform the disability and
early retirement schemes. However, much remains to be done, particularly in light of the

3

government’s contingent liabilities from loss-making public enterprises and pressures from
age-related expenditures. Directors recommended further rationalization of budget support to
families, housing subsidies, and local governments. A revenue-neutral tax reform that
simplifies and rebalances direct and indirect taxes, and budget rules and procedures that
promote fiscal discipline, should also be priorities.
Directors saw the recent easing of the policy interest rate as appropriate, with inflation having
apparently peaked and likely to return to the target range over the forecast horizon. They
encouraged the authorities to undertake further policy rate reductions gradually, mindful of
inflation expectations. Following such an approach, they envisaged a cumulative reduction of
the policy rate that could bring greater convergence with rates in the region. They highlighted
that enhanced fiscal policy credibility would help dampen pronounced swings in the policy
interest rate, as would increased reliance on statements of monetary policy inclinations.
In view of the wide exchange rate band for the forint, many Directors supported the current
exchange rate regime, which was working well and seemed not to constrain monetary policy.
Other Directors, however, considered that an eventual move to a more flexible system would
be desirable, as it would be more consistent with the inflation targeting framework. The
reconsideration of the exchange rate framework should take place in the context of the
medium-term strategy concerning fiscal policy and euro adoption. Directors viewed the
exchange rate as falling within a broadly acceptable range, but cautioned that competition from
economies with lower wages and better business environments poses a threat to foreign direct
investment inflows and export buoyancy, which are needed to support growth.
Directors stressed the need to improve the business climate and increase productivity to
enhance economic growth. They therefore welcomed the simplification of regulatory
requirements and public procurement procedures. Effective deployment of European Union
funds in infrastructure, human capital, and the innovation system would also help raise
productivity and growth.
Directors noted that the financial sector appears generally sound, with banks profitable and
well capitalized. At the same time, with financial deepening, banks are financing riskier
activities, the ongoing economic slowdown is creating more corporate distress, and foreign
currency borrowing (especially by households) remains a source of balance sheet risk.
Directors therefore welcomed the recent measures to contain risks by requiring some banks to
strengthen their risk management procedures and capitalization. In this context, Basel II
regulations should be put in place, and risk-based consolidated supervision across financial
institutions should keep pace with ongoing developments.
