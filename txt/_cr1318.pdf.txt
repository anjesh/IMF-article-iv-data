STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
December 26, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Causes: The roots of the current economic crisis in Portugal can be traced to the failure to
adapt to the rigors of monetary union. Instead of delivering on the promise of sustainable
catch-up growth to EU living standards, monetary union facilitated the accumulation of
economic and financial imbalances. The competitiveness of the tradable sector eroded. Policy
responses were, at best, muted. Banks lost access to the wholesale funding market from
mid-2010. And, in the first half of 2011, Portugal’s government got shut out from financial
markets.
Response: Portugal has mounted an impressive policy effort to gradually reverse the
accumulated imbalances and forestall future crisis. A front-loaded fiscal adjustment program
aims to restore credibility in government bond markets, while jump-starting external
adjustment. Financial sector measures seek to keep banks well capitalized and liquid, while
facilitating orderly deleveraging. A number of important structural reforms have also been
implemented. And, despite some setbacks, underlying fiscal adjustment has advanced
markedly; external account adjustment has also made significant strides.
Remaining challenges: There is broad agreement between staff and the authorities on the
difficult policy challenges that remain. First, the near-term outlook remains uncertain with the
economy likely to be in recession in 2013 and trading partner growth slowing. Second,
maintaining and anchoring fiscal discipline and deleveraging private sector balance sheets
still has some way to go and will be a source of headwinds for growth and employment.
Third, fostering a more competitive tradable sectors while reducing excessive mark-ups in
the non-tradable sectors requires politically difficult structural reforms. Overcoming these
challenges will continue to test Portugal’s so far remarkably sturdy social and political
consensus. The country’s success also hinges on continued strong European support.
Previous staff advice: The last Article IV report in December 2009 noted that Portugal
needed to start consolidating its public finances, focusing on reducing the public wage bill
and social transfers, while broadening tax bases; fiscal policy also needed to be anchored by
a stronger legal and procedural framework, including a medium-term expenditure rule. It was
also recommended that structural reforms focus on: (i) product market reforms to foster
competition and productivity; (ii) a review of unemployment benefits to boost labor supply;
and (iii) restraint on minimum wage increases to avoid pricing out low-skilled or young
workers. But corrective policy actions were delayed. By the time they started to be
implemented in mid-2010, tensions had already appeared in financial markets, which finally
gave rise to a full-blown financial crisis.

BACKGROUND
With a separate report covering developments under the program, this report on the Article IV
discussions steps back to consider the causes of the current economic crisis and overall progress in
addressing the long-standing economic challenges that Portugal faces. It starts with a discussion of
how the country failed to take advantage of the opportunities offered by euro adoption, which required
adapting to the new and demanding policy requirements of a monetary union. This background serves
as a foil for assessing Portugal’s present adjustment program and two broad economic policy
challenges: the need to reduce the large financial imbalances in public and private sectors; and, given
the limited policy tools, an exacting internal devaluation process to restore external competitiveness.

A. Build-Up to the Crisis
1.
In early-2011, mounting funding pressures tipped Portugal into an acute economic
crisis. While banks had already been shut-out from wholesale funding markets since mid-2010, as in
other euro area periphery countries sovereign yields rose sharply, quickly followed by the
Portuguese government losing access to the bond market. External financial assistance was needed
to avert a full-blown financial crisis. The on-going EU/IMF-supported program is designed to
provide Portugal with sufficient breathing space to implement the required adjustment and a wide
range of reforms to mend the economy before re-accessing financial markets.
2.
But in fact the roots of the crisis can be traced to Portugal’s failure to adapt to the
rigors of monetary union. By the early-1990s, Portugal’s economic institutions and policies had
been shaped by decades of monetary instability and financial repression. Against this backdrop,
Portugal’s rapid transition to economic and monetary union reduced sharply the real cost of credit,
relaxed financing constraints, and raised income expectations. Euro adoption seemed to offer a
launch pad for catch-up growth to EU living standards. But economic policies failed to adapt to the
new institutional constraints, a prerequisite in the face of a rapidly changing and more competitive
international environment. The competitiveness of the tradable sector eroded; public deficits and
debt could not be tamed; structural reforms failed to lower high economic transaction costs; and
private sector debt surged to exceptionally high levels. The economy found itself in a low growth
trap, while rising private and public debts created serious vulnerabilities to a sudden stop in capital
inflows—something that eventually happened fully in early 2011.

To be sure, Portugal was not alone in
struggling to achieve sustainable catch-up growth
within the new constraints of monetary union. The
pace of productivity growth over the last decade in
several euro area countries was too slow to achieve
meaningful convergence towards living standards in
the EU’s higher-income countries. But uniquely in
Portugal, surging levels of both private and public
sector borrowing were accompanied by very limited
output growth.

Excessive private-sector leverage was facilitated by indulgent international capital
markets and domestic banks. Local banks intermediated most of the capital inflows needed to
cover rising private financing gaps, largely borrowing on the interbank market to finance the
expansion in corporate loans and household mortgages. With banks willing to assume this risky
intermediation role, the non-financial corporate sector, and in particular the non-tradable sector,
raised leverage to excessive levels. Rising leverage was accompanied by negative gross savings,
mostly due to increasing labor and property costs as well as disproportionate investment in nontradable activities—including housing, energy, and highway infrastructure—misallocating real
capital. At the same time, excessive financial leverage may have impaired corporate incentives to
raise production efficiency.

Tradable sector competitiveness eroded. Staff
estimates suggest that profit mark-ups in the tradable
sector have been persistently lower than in the nontradable sector and that the gap in mark-ups in the nontradable sector widened further in the wake of euro
adoption (Box 1: Gauging Tradable Sector Competitiveness).
The high mark-ups in the non-tradable sector in part
reflected lack of effective competition and regulatory
policies, with entry barriers and informal networks

protecting a web of excessive rents. The situation was exacerbated by easy credit and rapid
domestic demand growth, and EU transfers mostly absorbed by the non-tradable sector, particularly
construction. The economy’s lopsided reward structure induced a relative shift of labor and capital
resources to the non-tradable sector, as also highlighted by the fact that virtually all net FDI inflows
since 1995 went to the non-tradable sector.
6.
Lack of fiscal discipline added further strains to an already unbalanced growth process.
Portugal’s budgetary institutions remained largely unreformed during the transition to the euro and
were unable to resist strong political economy biases toward increasing spending and debt in a
setting of low interest rates and indulgent capital markets. The results were consistently
overoptimistic budget revenue projections, unrealistic medium-term fiscal plans, and the shifting of
spending obligations outside the budget process. In particular, social protection spending has
surged since the mid-1990s, with little apparent pay-off in terms of improving income inequality. As
a result and notwithstanding the EU’s Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) rules, Portugal’s fiscal policy
after euro adoption remained unanchored, with headline fiscal deficits consistently exceeding the
Maastricht three-percent deficit limit. A massive fiscal expansion in response to the global financial
crisis added to the fragility of public finances.
7.
Growth was also constrained by other structural growth bottlenecks. An inefficient
public administration, particularly a slow-working court system, added to the economy’s transaction
costs. Moreover, a segmented labor market reduced the incentives for workers with temporary
contracts to acquire skills, while labor market insiders enjoyed overly strong protections. Interacting
with labor market segmentation, the social safety net created poverty traps for low-skilled
unemployed, while a wage setting process dominated by non-tradable sector conditions tilted the
playing field further against the tradable sector.
8.
With economic institutions, policies, and incentives ill-adapted to the opportunities
and constraints of monetary union, Portugal’s external stability risks rose gradually. Portugal’s
external current account balance has traditionally been in large deficit. Reflecting high nominal GDP
growth during the 1970s and 1980s, the international investment position remained close to nil until
the 1990s, but then deteriorated precipitously, while the real exchange rate appreciated.

B. Recent Economic Developments
9.
After a shallow recovery from the 2008–09 global financial crisis, activity reversed
again in mid-2010. Portugal responded to the global financial crisis with strong fiscal stimulus, but
the associated deterioration in public finances and rating downgrades forced an abrupt turnaround
in the policy stance by mid-2010. With fiscal tightening, credit spreads rising, and external demand
slowing, the economy slid back into recession. Unemployment continued to drift upward during the
recovery; however, the deterioration in labor market conditions accelerated once firms came to a
view that a permanent adjustment in their financial imbalances was unavoidable and started to
reduce investment and labor costs to repair their over-leveraged balance sheets.

10.
With financial imbalances being corrected
across private and public sectors, the current account
has improved substantially. Household and corporate
financial imbalances had already started narrowing
during 2009–10. Once the consolidation of public
finances started in earnest as well, the external current
account improved sharply. This reflected not just a
compression of imports in response to slumping
domestic demand, but also an expansion of exports,
particularly to non-EU trading partners.
11.
Financial market sentiment deteriorated
through early-2012, but sovereign spreads have
narrowed considerably since then. Spreads vis-à-vis
Germany began to drift upward in 2010, culminating in a
sudden stop in capital inflows and triggering the EU-IMF
supported program. After peaking at almost 1500 basis
points in January 2012, spreads reversed, reflecting both
improving views on Portuguese prospects and evolving
efforts to strengthen euro-wide crisis management.

The banking system has proven
resilient, but credit conditions of firms are
significantly tighter than those faced by most
other euro-area trading partners. Under the
program, the liquidity situation of the Portuguese
banks has remained adequate, supported by
stable deposits, and continued Eurosystem
liquidity support. However, while the necessary
deleveraging under the program remains orderly,
credit conditions, especially for small- and
medium-sized enterprises, remain tight, with
lending rates among the highest in the region.

13.
Fiscal adjustment has made substantial progress. A front-loaded fiscal adjustment effort
was needed to turn the fiscal position around, and has led to a cumulative decline in the headline
deficit of about 5 percent of GDP in 2011–12. Nominal deficit targets have proven difficult to
achieve without one-off measures, both in 2011 and 2012. Nevertheless, the structural primary
adjustment over these two years amounted to close to 6 percent of GDP, with across-the-board
spending adjustment measures and a significant increase in the tax burden. Structural fiscal reforms
have progressed, covering a wide range of measures on tax administration, public financial
management, and containing fiscal risks from state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and private-public
partnerships (PPPs).
14.
Structural reforms are also progressing. A large number of growth-enhancing structural
reforms have been legislated, but full implementation of many lies still ahead. There has been
progress in: reaching a tri-partite agreement on labor market reforms, unclogging the court system,
promoting competition, privatizing viable companies, and fostering an efficient rental housing
market. Much less headway has been made on entry barriers and excessive rents in the non-tradable
sectors, with limited progress in the energy markets.

Portugal’s short-term growth outlook
remains difficult, but the convergence process is
expected to regain momentum over the medium
term, as reforms start to bear fruit. Output is
expected to contract by 3 percent in 2012, and the
recession is likely to extend into 2013, with a gradual
recovery in the latter part of the year. Over the medium
term, staff’s baseline envisages growth to settle close to
2 percent by 2015, implying a moderate speed of
convergence toward living standards in high EU income

PORTUGAL

countries (Box 2: How Fast Can Portugal Grow?). While this moderate speed of convergence requires
a significant improvement in productivity performance relative to earlier trends, this should be
feasible in view of Portugal’s still large distance from the international best-practice growth frontier
and so far modest pay-off to the ongoing wide-ranging reforms. Nevertheless, Portugal’s mediumterm output level is expected to settle about 20 percent below its pre-crisis trend.
16.
External adjustment is expected to continue, with the current account in broad
balance in the medium term. Adjustment has taken place at a much faster pace than had been
anticipated at the time of the last Article IV consultation (2009), which foresaw a current account
deficit 7½ percentage points of GDP higher than is forecast for this year. The 2009 forecast also
entailed a very gradual reduction in the current account deficit thereafter and a continuing
deterioration of the negative IIP position to 135 percent of GDP at the end of the forecast horizon,
compared to the current forecast of 90 percent in 2017. The current account adjustment to date has,
however, been realized in the face of a relatively small improvement in relative prices. A key
question thus is whether the improvement to date is simply cyclical or of a more durable nature. The
fact that export growth has contributed to the lion’s share of the adjustment does suggest that part
of this adjustment should endure. But going forward only modest further relative price adjustment is
assumed, raising the possibility that current account deficit could widen again with a recovery in
economic activity. This is evident when one looks at the question from a savings-investment balance
perspective. The adjustment is projected to be underpinned by stable private savings, investment
staying at the historical low of 16 percent of GDP, and continued fiscal consolidation. In the
presence of continued financing constraints, further relative price change would be required to
restore external sustainability, implying a continuation of recessionary dynamics.

However, downside risks to these projections are significant. A range of safeguards are
in place to mitigate these risks—including the commitment by European leaders to provide
adequate support to Portugal until market access is restored, provided the program is on track. But,
particularly if these risks were to materialize simultaneously a reassessment of the current program
strategy might be unavoidable:


with activity and confidence indicators still negative, fiscal adjustment could curtail growth even
more than the mission’s revised and now more conservative assumptions allow for. Similarly,
and while projections are already conservative, corporate deleveraging could weigh on
aggregate spending and employment even more than is assumed in the present baseline.



with core European markets slowing, the risk of weaker demand for Portuguese exports is
elevated despite consistent growth in other markets. And, progress on addressing euro area
policy fissures could disappoint, with renewed detrimental effects on confidence and prospects
for a recovery in investment.



progress in restructuring SOEs and the relatively orderly deleveraging witnessed so far,
migration of contingent liabilities from either state-owned enterprises or the private sector to
the sovereign balance sheet remains a possibility.



some of the fiscal measures under the program could be challenged on constitutional grounds,
as happened in 2012. Should this be the case, the authorities stand ready to enact alternative
measures to ensure the fiscal program remains on track.



political and social consensus could weaken further, undermining the government’s ability to
stay the course of fiscal adjustment and structural adaptation.

20.
Portugal needs to successfully mitigate these risks in order to avoid spillovers to the
rest of the euro area. The Portuguese economy is highly dependent on developments in Europe—

10

reflecting both strong trade and financial links—but the euro area in particular would also be
affected by adverse developments in Portugal should the current program strategy fail. Contagion
has been quick to spread among the euro area periphery countries but also to other euro area
members in the past couple of years, including through rising asset price correlations and
deteriorating confidence and some reversal in financial integration. It is thus imperative that the
Portuguese authorities implement the program to the fullest extent possible to avoid the
emergence of renewed stress in the euro area. At the same time, particularly if such implementation
of the program fails to engender the desired results, it will be important for European partners to
provide the support required to ensure the program remains fully financed. Clearly, progress in the
implementation of the policies currently under discussion to strengthen the architecture of the euro
area, including crisis resolution mechanisms, would also facilitate program implementation in
Portugal.
Authorities’ Views
21.
The authorities saw some upside risk to these projections. They are confident that the
reform efforts already in train will be sufficient to re-balance profit mark-ups in the tradable and
non-tradable sectors at levels consistent with achieving external stability, pointing to the large and
rapid adjustment in the current account since the start of the program. In addition, they also pointed
to the large educational and structural policy gaps, which although acting as constraints in the
short-term are also a source for rapid catch-up hope in the medium- to long-term. Under these
circumstances, they saw upside risks to both medium-term growth and external adjustment
projections.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
There was agreement between staff and the authorities on the main causes of the current crisis and
policies to address them. On the causes, with the benefit of hindsight, it is was agreed that it included:
(i) the lack of any convergence growth since the late-1990s, with growth in Portugal about the same as
in other northern European members of the euro area; (ii) consumers, businesses, and the public sector,
however, behaving as if convergence growth was taking place and borrowing heavily at the low
interest rates facilitated by membership of the EA; and (iii) the resulting higher spending having
induced a real exchange rate overvaluation and a large debt overhang. With the real exchange rate
and leverage clearly out of line with the economy’s growth capacity, the onset of the global financial
crisis drove the economy further away from the convergence growth path, eventually triggering the
2011 crisis. There was also consensus that, while economically and socially difficult, policies now need
to be geared toward unwinding public and private sector imbalances to lay the grounds for a durable
recovery. Relatedly, in the context of the monetary union, reforms to engineer a strong supply response
are the only way to make the economy more competitive and return to a convergence growth path.
The Article IV discussions consequently focused on key elements of these two broad policy objectives.

A. Policy Theme #1: Addressing Accumulated Financial Imbalances
The Road to Fiscal Responsibility
22.

Restoring and anchoring fiscal discipline poses two challenges:



Keeping fiscal adjustment on track. Some two-thirds of the required fiscal adjustment
targeted under the program has been effected, but a sizeable adjustment effort still lies ahead.
The extensive reliance on large income tax increases in the 2013 budget has created
considerable disquiet. Hence, finding the right combination of spending and revenue measures
will remain at the forefront of the adjustment program. The objective remains a gradual reversal
in the upward trend in public debt to ensure debt sustainability and allow timely re-access to
financial markets. As evidenced by a recent Constitutional Court ruling regarding public wage
and pension cuts in the 2012 budget, fiscal adjustment measures need to meet legal criteria that
are at times difficult to anticipate.



Anchoring fiscal responsibility. This requires strengthening the budgetary framework, in line
with Portugal’s obligations under the EU’s fiscal compact.

Staff’s Views
23.
While the need for further fiscal adjustment is not controversial, public discussion is
needed to reach consensus on what levels of spending and taxation the country wants. The
public expenditure review that is underway should help identify additional spending adjustment
options that lead to fair burden sharing. This would help rebalance the adjustment mix and bring it
closer to the original objective—one third revenue, two thirds expenditure. Given that Portugal’s
spending is heavily concentrated on social transfers and public wages, accounting for about twothirds of the total (Box 3: Growth-Friendly, Equitable, and Sustainable Fiscal Reform in Portugal), these
outlays will have to be the focus of the core of spending reforms. Moreover, relatively high public
employment, high wage premium in comparison to the private sector, and more generous pensions
than in peer countries alongside limited old-age poverty alleviation, suggest that spending cuts can
be implemented while increasing efficiency and equity. On the tax side, the tax-to-GDP ratio is
already in line with what would be expected for Portugal’s development levels. Given that the 2013
budget will push this ratio even further, additional revenue-mobilizing measures are not
recommended. Nevertheless, there is scope to implement a growth-oriented tax reform, which
should reduce distortions through streamlining and targeting tax expenditures, and to strengthen
tax compliance, including through greater use of the anti-money laundering framework.1
24.
Anchoring fiscal discipline over the medium and long term will require setting reform
priorities. Much has already been achieved in addressing deep-seated public financial management
weaknesses, such as insufficient fiscal reporting, restricted budgetary coverage, inadequate PPP

legal framework, and ineffective expenditure commitment controls. However, a large agenda still lies
ahead. This includes for instance reducing budget fragmentation, improving the medium-term fiscal
framework—including by making it consistent with the EU fiscal compact—and moving towards
accrual accounting. The authorities’ 2013–15 public financial management strategy is an important
instrument establishing priorities to guide this comprehensive reform. Continuing to build up a
stronger implementation capacity at the Ministry of Finance will also be important.
Authorities’ Views
25.
Re-thinking of the roles of the state is necessary to bring expenditure down to a
sustainable level. Apart from achieving the deficit targets, lowering the primary expenditure-GDP
ratio substantially over the medium term will generate fiscal space for growth-enhancing capital
expenditure and to allow a gradual reduction of the tax burden. This will require a re-thinking of the
allocation and distribution functions of the state. Reducing expenditure in line with these aims will
be a complex political process. This process will have to be open and transparent, and the end result
consistent with Portugal’s social consensus to preserve a welfare state.
26.
The authorities would have preferred to anchor fiscal discipline with a hard
constitutional balance rule, but there was no political consensus for this route. Mindful of
Portugal’s long-standing political economy biases toward higher spending and deficits, the
Portuguese authorities argued, both at the European and the domestic level, for a constitutional
amendment to underpin future fiscal discipline. Amending the Portuguese constitution would have
been, however, fraught with procedural difficulties, and it was also not possible to achieve sufficient
political consensus. Instead, the EU fiscal compact will be implemented via the budget framework
law, likely with broad political support.

Deleveraging Private-Sector Balance Sheets
27.
The corporate sector is under strong pressure to deleverage, posing downside risks to
growth, bank profitability, and the sovereign balance sheet. As illustrated by the experience in
other countries, corporate deleveraging is expected to be protracted, taking a continued toll on
investment, while efforts to cut labor cost could drive up unemployment further (Box 4: Portugal’s
Corporate Leverage in Perspective). In addition, adverse shocks relative to the baseline, including to
growth or funding costs, could provoke a disorderly deleveraging process, raising corporate default
rates and bank losses.
28.
Banks are facing a number of vulnerabilities, and will need to change their business
model to avoid a new leverage cycle. Several of the large banks have a need to gradually
deleverage their balance sheets, allowing them to reduce dependence on Eurosystem liquidity
support over the medium term. Moreover, banks face a further erosion of their profitability as a
result of weak credit conditions and high funding costs. In the near term, the low mortgage interest
rate environment will continue to put a drag on bank profitability, underlining the importance of
cost discipline. At the same time, there is a need to maintain the supply of credit to healthy firms in

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

PORTUGAL

order to avoid credit constraints causing irreparable damage to firms that are in a position to
contribute to the economic recovery.
Staff’s Views
29.
The corporate deleveraging process poses significant challenges, but there are tools to
manage associated risks. In particular, the risks can be mitigated by working on three fronts. First,
keeping banks sound. The central bank’s regular supervisory inspections and stress test exercises
aim at ensuring banks have adequate capital under the current baseline and are able to withstand
adverse shocks. Moreover, additional buffers are already envisaged under the program, in case
further capital needs were to arise. Second, effectively implementing the new corporate and
household debt restructuring frameworks. Corporate debt restructuring is a critical element of the
deleveraging process to ensure viable firms can effectively sustain the economic recovery. In this
regard, the new corporate restructuring toolkit aims at reducing the risks of cumbersome court
procedures, by introducing fast-track and out-of-court procedures. However, ongoing efforts are
needed to monitor the effective application of the new toolkit, notably to set the right incentives for
firms to apply for restructuring well before their viability becomes at risk. Finally, the supervision and
regulatory frameworks can be used to limit ever-greening and ensure that credit flows to the most
dynamic enterprises.
30.
To avoid another leverage cycle, several medium-term measures are in order. First, the
ongoing deleveraging process is expected to gradually reduce banks’ reliance on non-deposit
funding and prevent a reemergence of excessive asset growth. Second, use of macro-prudential
policy tools, such as net stable funding and leverage ratios (consistent with Basel III requirements),
as well as more targeted tools, such as sectoral risk weights or loan-to-value caps, can help to
counteract a renewed buildup of excessive leverage of bank balance sheets. Third, the larger banks
are actively pursuing measures to rationalize their operations, with particular focus on reducing the
cost base of their domestic retail networks, which are characterized by a relatively high number of
branches per inhabitants, and improving profitability. Strict cost control would be especially
important if the projected increase of the banks’ interest income would not materialize.
The Authorities’ Views
31.
The key priority is to improve credit conditions and costs for Portuguese companies.
Credit markets in the euro area are presently fragmented, with uneven credit conditions for
companies with similar fundamentals. This puts Portuguese companies at a severe competitive
disadvantage inside the monetary union. This problem should be addressed at both the euro area
and Portuguese levels: segmentation of credit markets in the euro area needs to be corrected,
mainly by removing excessive sovereign risk premia which are hampering the effectiveness of the
monetary transmission mechanism; and, at the Portuguese level, high credit spreads also reflect
informational inefficiencies at the banks’ level. Portuguese banks’ credit risk evaluation before the
crisis largely reflected subdued risk aversion at a global scale, which has significantly increased in the
present environment. Initiatives to promote information sharing, for example through establishing a
privately-run and publicly-available credit rating system, could help alleviate informational

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PORTUGAL

inefficiencies, notably for SMEs, and support a more effective pricing of risks by banks. In parallel,
steps are being taken to promote firms’ access to capital markets and alternative funding options,
through specialized institutions and structural funds. Securitizing mortgage portfolios could also
help take pressure off banks to compensate for low mortgage spreads through higher corporate
lending spreads.

B. Policy Theme #2: Restoring Competitiveness and Growth
32.
Restoring tradable sector competitiveness requires lowering costs across both tradable
and non-tradable sectors, and reducing excessive mark-ups in non-tradable sectors. Unit labor
cost will remain under pressure from high unemployment and low vacancies, and impetus to
productivity growth due to firm restructuring and structural reforms should also help lower costs. A
more competitive tradable sector could provide the main growth engine to bring Portugal closer to
the best-practice international growth frontier. But it is also important that structural reforms in the
non-tradable sectors provide incentives to innovate and cut costs, steps that would lower
intermediate input costs in the tradable sectors. Finally, the public sector needs to contribute more
to facilitate economic dynamics and risk taking, including through court reforms and appropriate
incentives to promote tradable sector activities. Reducing administrative burden and red tape is also
important to boost non-price competitiveness.
33.
The longer-term growth outlook will also depend on tackling deeper-seated growth
bottlenecks, in particular Portugal’s human capital gap. In spite of significant progress in raising
the education of the new flows into the labor force, Portugal’s labor force as a whole remains
among the least educated in the OECD. Closing this gap will take a long time and requires a
sustained multi-year effort. Relatedly, if the recent increase in emigration—particularly that of the
younger and better-educated population—over the past two years continues into the medium- to
long-term, it will further constrain the contribution from human capital directly as a factor input and
indirectly through lower total factor productivity growth.
Staff’s Views
34.
Significant improvements in external competitiveness through cost channels have
already been set in train. Although the fiscal devaluation has not been possible, progress has been
made in lowering labor cost. Recent measures in the labor market to reduce high employment
protection and increase incentives to work should further support these gains. The reform that
phases out rent control will enhance labor mobility. Judicial and licensing reforms under
consideration should also help lower costs of doing business, making Portugal a more attractive
investment destination.
35.
The program has so far been less successful in increasing incentives towards the
tradable sector. This largely reflects the absence of policy levers but also procedural difficulties in
rolling back excessive rents in sheltered sectors (network industries for instance). The reduction in
labor and other production costs achieved under the program so far have been beneficial to both
the tradable and nontradable sectors. Moreover, the risk is that further labor and credit cost

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

PORTUGAL

reductions would again lead to the sheltered sector attracting a disproportional share of the
economy’s resources, including FDI, owing to the persistently excessive non-tradable mark-ups.
While stricter enforcement of competition laws and regulations will clearly help, including by
providing the relevant regulatory agencies with the needed independence and resources, a more
forceful approach may well be required. If growth remains lopsided towards non-tradable activities,
more intrusive regulatory approaches coupled with a reexamination of existing contracts in network
industries may be unavoidable.
36.
As a more competitive tradable sector emerges, catch-up growth will have to rely on
gradually closing the human capital and structural policy gaps. The medium-term growth
outlook requires higher productivity growth than experienced in the past decade, and this can be
achieved through timely and effective implementation of the package of structural reforms under
the current program.
The Authorities’ Views
37.
External competitiveness is being restored faster than widely acknowledged. In
particular, fiscal adjustment and corporate deleveraging are putting pressure on non-tradable prices,
reversing the earlier process of declining competitiveness. Firms—including traditionally
domestically-oriented—are fast adapting to the domestic economy conditions, seeking new markets
abroad. And the impact of this is already evident in the sharp improvement in the current account
balance, which is more structural than cyclical. Moreover, over the medium term, improved
competition regulation has a key role to play. A more efficient state is another key ingredient for a
more competitive economy, including by channeling EU funds to more productive uses than in the
past.
38.
If the policy reforms underway stick in the medium term, they will fundamentally tilt
the institutional playing field toward fostering sustainable catch-up growth. Loose fiscal
policies and easy credit conditions in the past had created an illusion of converging living standards,
when in fact these policies underpinned growing financial imbalances and mis-allocated the
economy’s resources to activities with low social rates of return. The program has not only initiated a
wide range of structural reforms to overcome key growth bottlenecks and attract tradable sector
FDI, but it should also help durably correct the biases that rewarded policy makers for choosing
policy recipes that were popular in the short run, including at elections, but proved ultimately
unsustainable in the long run.

STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
Portugal’s current economic predicament is the legacy of policy failures in the face of
a rapidly changing environment. Economic institutions and policies proved ill-adapted to the
demands and opportunities of monetary union and globalization. The rapid transition from decades
of financial repression and monetary instability proved difficult. Monetary union, instead of
delivering on the promise of sustainable catch-up growth to EU living standards, facilitated the
accumulation of economic and financial imbalances. The competitiveness of the tradable sector

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PORTUGAL

eroded. Abetted by a banking system prone to allocating too much credit and mispricing risks,
leverage in the non-tradable sector increased markedly, notwithstanding weak productivity growth.
The public sector in turn financed rapidly growing spending, particularly on social protection,
through higher taxes and accumulating debts. Policy responses were, at best, muted. Banks lost
access to wholesale funding in mid-2010. And, in the first half of 2011, Portugal’s government was
shut out from financial markets.
40.
In response, the Portuguese authorities have mounted an impressive policy effort to
gradually reverse the accumulated imbalances and forestall future crisis. A front-loaded fiscal
adjustment program is aiming at restoring credibility in government bond markets, while jumpstarting external adjustment. Financial sector measures seek to keep banks well capitalized and
liquid, while facilitating orderly deleveraging. And structural reforms, ranging from reforming
inefficient courts to phasing out rent controls, aim to revitalize the economy’s supply side.
Considerable progress has already been made. In spite of setbacks, underlying fiscal adjustment has
advanced markedly; external account adjustment has also made significant strides.
41.
Yet the near-term outlook is uncertain, and sizable medium-term economic challenges
remain. With trading partner growth slowing, the economy will likely be in recession in 2013, while
unemployment will rise further from the already record high levels. Beyond the short term,
maintaining and anchoring fiscal discipline and deleveraging private-sector balance sheets will
remain imperatives, but also generate headwinds for growth. In particular, fiscal adjustment needs
to continue, although revenue shortfalls—partly reflecting a more rapid external adjustment and a
less favorable tax base composition—have delayed the achievement of the original nominal deficit
path. Fostering more competitive tradable sectors while reducing excessive mark-ups in the nontradable sectors requires politically difficult structural reforms. Overcoming these challenges will
continue to test Portugal’s so far remarkably sturdy social and political consensus.
42.
Given the still significant fiscal adjustment ahead, further public debate is needed on
how to share the burden of remaining fiscal adjustment fairly and in a growth-friendly
manner. Fiscal spending, particularly on public wages and social transfers, ratcheted up for many
years, with a weak link between the state’s goals and the budget’s spending allocation. The main
focus will have to be on further rationalizing public sector pay and employment as well as reforming
pensions and other social transfers, aiming at more efficient public services and more equitable redistribution. At the same time, while it will be difficult to reduce the overall tax burden in the coming
years, there is scope to reduce tax distortions, simplify the tax system, and strengthen tax
compliance. A broader tax base would allow reducing the current high income tax rates, including of
the corporate income tax, to help attract more FDI. Beyond progressing on fiscal adjustment,
anchoring fiscal responsibility will require a much stronger budgetary framework. The obligation to
implement the EU fiscal compact offers a good opportunity to reach political consensus to hard-wire
budgetary prudence into the country’s legal fabric. Maintaining the efforts to strengthen oversight
and control over revenue mobilization and public financial management will also be critical to
deliver on budget promises.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

PORTUGAL

43.
While the over-indebted private-sector is gradually adjusting, high debts still pose
risks to growth and bank profitability. Corporate sector deleveraging is essential to restore firms’
productivity and growth, but it is expected to take time and lower prospects for investment in the
short to medium term. While adequate banks’ buffers have managed to prevent an abrupt
adjustment, risks of adverse shocks raising corporate defaults and resulting in additional bank losses
remain. Private household leverage appears more manageable, also reflecting the absence of a past
housing bubble in Portugal and low mortgage rates, but also calls for close monitoring given rising
unemployment and income losses.
44.
To lower the risk of a renewed run-up in private indebtedness, Portugal needs to
sustain the ongoing reforms to foster a sound financial system. Bank deleveraging is expected
to reduce banks’ reliance on non-deposit funding. In addition, the proactive use of macro prudential
policy tools could help forestall excessive bank asset growth. Moreover, banks need to continue
rationalizing process, focusing on reducing the cost base of their domestic operations. Initiatives to
promote capital markets can also help diversify firms’ funding structure. Finally, tax policy initiatives
could lower the bias of firms toward debt-financing over the medium term.
45.
A more competitive tradable sector is the key to sustaining growth and reducing high
unemployment over the medium term. As highlighted by the experience of other countries,
particularly in the EU, a competitive tradable sector that is well integrated into regional and global
supply chains is the most effective engine for sustainable convergence growth. Progress on this
front requires structural reforms across all sectors that target growth bottlenecks, reduce production
costs, and compress excessive profit mark-ups in the non-tradable sector. While the external
current account deficit narrowed at an unexpectedly fast pace over the last two years, this welcome
development still needs to be locked in by a durable improvement in the country’s competitive
fundamentals. The program’s structural reform agenda goes some way towards doing this. But
additional steps may be needed to increase the momentum and depth of reforms, which could
include additional targeted incentives to promote tradable sector activities.
46.
Success of the program will also depend on whether European policymakers forge
ahead with reforms to overcome euro area fissures. While implementation of the adjustment
program remains the key for mending Portugal’s own deep-seated economic problems, these
domestic efforts will need to be complemented by reforms of euro area arrangements to clear a
path not only toward a durable return to market financing for Portugal but also to avoid a repeat of
the build-up of unsustainable imbalances in the future. The public commitment by European leaders
to render adequate support to Portugal until market access is restored, as long as the program is on
track, provides a valuable safety net. To overcome credit market segmentation and restore an
appropriate monetary policy transmission, it would also be important to further clarify the steps
Portugal would need to take, as the country starts regaining bond market access, before qualifying
for the ECB’s Outright Monetary Transactions.

measure of both price and unit cost developments in
the tradable and non-tradable sectors, developments that otherwise would require analyzing a number of
separate and sometimes difficult-to-interpret real exchange rate measures.2
To calculate mark-ups, the economy was partitioned into three sectors: (1) tradables; (2) non-tradables that
produce goods and services for markets; and (3) non-tradables that are not produced for markets. The third
sector includes mainly public sector services, and the relevant mark-up comparison is only between sectors
(1) and (2). The mark-up estimates are based on detailed input-output table data and gauge the profit as
a percentage of total cost, i.e. the sum of the cost of labor, capital, and intermediate inputs. For Portugal, the
trends in the sectoral profit mark-ups over time reflected two main factors:
 Unit capital costs fell sharply in both sectors around the time of euro adoption, boosting
temporarily mark-ups across all sectors, but then increased gradually, reflecting rising depreciation
charges and higher cost of credit. High unit capital costs presently represent a major drag on the
profitability of the tradable sector.
 Unit labor cost in the non-tradable sector increased also fast, but remained under relatively firm
control in the tradable sector. However, the relatively favorable unit labor cost developments in the
tradable sector were not sufficient to prevent the gradual compression of tradable sector mark-ups.

In the run-up to and after euro adoption, productivity
growth in Portugal has lagged that of peers. Real GDP grew
by over 2 percent on average during 1992–2007, but this
reflected mainly an expansion of the labor force and the capital
stock. Total factor productivity (TFP) growth was negligible,
compared to an annual average of about ½ percent for EU’s
best performing countries (EU-9) and close to 1 percent on the
U.S. Even when controlling for the difference in human capital—
which explains about one third of the difference in labor
productivity with the more advanced OECD countries—TFP
growth was much lower than that of the stronger performers;
and relative TFP (also sometimes referred to as technical
efficiency) actually declined over this period.

The human capital and structural policy gaps appear to play
a critical role in explaining the lack of convergence. TFP convergence tends to be faster when human capital
is higher and when market institutions are more developed. In the

long time to significantly boost human capital, efforts in this area could also help growth prospects. The
challenge is rather that reaching the 2-percent growth mark in the medium-term implies both a rapid
turnaround in underlying TFP growth and a recovery (even if modest) in investment, despite strong headwinds
from public and private sector deleveraging.

Box 3. Growth-Friendly, Equitable, and Sustainable Fiscal Reform in Portugal1
Portugal’s public finances need to be put in a long-term sustainable footing. The sharp increase in
public spending over 2000–10, mainly fueled by the expansion of social protection, was not accompanied
by sustainable sources of revenue or output growth. As a result, imbalances in the public accounts
accumulated throughout the past decade, often masked by the adoption of temporary measures.
Moreover, there was aggressive off-budget spending leading to a buildup of substantial contingent
liabilities. The effect has been to leave the sovereign as one of the most indebted countries in Europe, with
public debt increasing by 55 percentage points of GDP since 2006.
The ongoing consolidation has started to address these imbalances but further fiscal adjustment is
needed, and there is broad political consensus that this should be focused on the spending side.
Close to two-thirds of public spending falls on pensions and the public sector wage bill, making cuts in
these areas unavoidable.

At-risk-of-poverty rate, population 65 and
older

The need for pension reform means that care has to be taken to avoid the adjustment falls on
socially vulnerable groups. But many aspects of the current pension system are regressive, suggesting
that the there is scope to enhance the targeting of social protection while protecting those at risk of
poverty. For example, each percentage point of pension spending reduces old-age poverty by only about
5 percentage points, below the European average of 7 percentage points. Part of the reason for this is that
40 percent of old age pension spending goes to the top 10 percent of the income distribution in the whole
population. The reform options include: aligning benefits from specialized pension regimes with the
general public pension system; equalizing eligibility conditions for all who retire starting in 2014;
eliminating grandfathering for those who are not yet retired; and increasing the statutory retirement age
(currently at age 65).

On the wage bill front, the main challenge is with excess employment in some areas. There has been
some progress in reducing the wage bill, but studies show that the wage premium for public employees is
about 10 percent above the average European country. This wage premium is the highest in the education
sector, which also employs more people than peer countries but with poor educational outcomes.
Increasing the civil service working hours is another reform option, with public sector employees working
35 hours per week, the lowest level among OECD countries.
Revenue challenges are related to the composition of the tax burden composition. The tax system
could be made more growth-friendly through: lowering the taxation on capital and increasing that on
consumption; and streamlining of sizable untargeted tax expenditures, generating space for rate reductions
in the corporate and personal income taxes. Simplifying the tax system and improving tax compliance
would ensure a fair playing field for doing business in Portugal.

Box 4. Portugal’s Corporate Leverage in Perspective1
Portugal has entered the crisis with a highly leveraged corporate sector, fuelled by low lending rates and easy
access to bank credit since Euro adoption. The current corporate debt overhang of Portuguese firms is well
above peer-countries levels in the Euro area and the high-debt thresholds identified in the literature, while
comparable to past crisis episodes with corporate deleveraging.

During the leveraging up process, a substantial portion of debt went into the balance sheets of firms in nontradable sectors, including the large share of small and medium enterprises. With the crisis, the risk of
corporate default, especially in these segments, has increased significantly. Although banks appear adequately
provisioned, also thanks to ongoing supervisory efforts, the high sensitivity of firms’ balance sheets to macrofinancial shocks calls for constant monitoring of developments in the sector.

Banking sector fiscal costs (Percent of GDP)

The elevated corporate debt overhang has weighted on the country’s investment and growth paths in the
run-up to the crisis. Reducing debt to more sustainable levels is needed to allow resources to be redirected to
the most productive and innovative segments of the economy and secure the long-term viability of the
private sector. However, based on past experiences, this process is expected to be protracted and entail
sizable macro-financial costs upfront. Its impact on the Portuguese economy is already visible and could
deepen further, especially given limited fiscal space and weak external demand in the Euro area. Although the
migration of losses from private to public balance sheets has been contained so far, past crisis experiences
provide evidence that risks can increase going forward.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator,
g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency--not used here), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an
appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

1/ General government gross debt (ESA 95 definition).
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ Includes change in deposits, unidentified financial transactions, and cash-accrual adjustments. For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as general government deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

APPENDIX I. PUBLIC DEBTS SUSTAINABILITY
ANALYSIS (DSA)
1.
This appendix updates earlier analysis of Portugal’s public debt. The basis for the
current debt projections—the macroeconomic framework
140
General Government Debt
finalized in the course of the sixth review under the EFF—
(Percent of GDP)
differs little from the fifth review framework that was used
120
as a basis for the previous DSA. Consequently, the results
presented below are very close to the outcome of the
100
previous DSA (see IMF Country Report No. 12/292).
2.
Under the revised baseline, the public debt is
projected to peak at 122 percent of GDP in 2014 and
then decline gradually, returning to its pre-crisis level
by 2030. The new, slightly lower, debt peak (compared to
124 percent of GDP in the previous DSA) is largely due to
the government’s increased use of deposits to reduce the
stock of debt, projected to take place in 2013.

3.
The baseline assumes Portugal’s return to markets in mid-2013 and full
implementation of the programmed large fiscal
140
General Government Debt
adjustment. As in the previous DSA, it is assumed that the
(Percent of GDP)
yields on Portugal’s medium- and long-term obligations will
120
decline from 7 percent in 2013 to 5 percent in the mediumterm and that the structural primary surplus will stabilize at
100
3¼ percent of GDP. Still, the baseline is not as ambitious as
the fiscal adjustment implied by Portugal’s current mediumterm budget framework (“fiscal compact”), which sets the
80
structural deficit at 0.5 percent of GDP or below starting

4.
Plausible shocks could considerably worsen the
dynamics of Portugal’s public debt. A protracted recession or a realization of large contingent
liabilities would each lead to a rapid increase in debt-to-GDP ratio (by 10–15 percentage points)
followed by a gradual decline. In contrast, a temporary spike in interest rates would raise the debt
trajectory only slightly, compared with the baseline. A permanent increase in interest rates would
markedly slow down the rate of debt decline.2 Finally, a combined shock—protracted recession,

1

Under the baseline, the medium-term structural deficit is between 1.0 and 1.5 percent of GDP.

2
Protracted recession: five percentage points cumulative decline in growth in 2013–15. Contingent liabilities:
15 percent of GDP in 2013. Temporary interest rate spike: 400 bps on all liabilities in 2013–2015. Permanent
increase in interest rates: 200 bps on medium- and long-term debt.

contingent liabilities, and temporary interest rate spike—would render Portugal’s debt dynamics
unsustainable.

Portugal’s public debt will remain sustainable under the baseline assumptions and in
most cases of plausible shocks. As noted in the previous DSA, this result hinges on successful
implementation of the large fiscal adjustment and return to trend growth by 2015. Some of the
plausible shocks could lead to unsustainable outcomes, in which case swift policy response will be of
the essence.

Exchange Rate Arrangement
Portugal’s currency is the euro, which floats freely and independently against other currencies.
Portugal has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Section 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange
system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions, other
than restrictions notified to the Fund under Decision No. 144 (52/51).

Safeguards Assessment
The first-time safeguards assessment of the Banco de Portugal (BdP), concluded in September 2011,
found that current safeguards are adequate; it recommended changes to the BdP Law to formalize
BdP’s autonomy and oversight over the Governor and the executive board in line with good
governance practices. In addition, the assessment recommended extending the supervisory
responsibilities of the Audit Board to other tasks such as oversight of internal control functions,
financial reporting and audit. The authorities have already taken steps to implement the
recommendations. A review of Fund related transactions with the debt management agency (IGCP)
has been conducted by the Court of Auditors in 2011.
Article IV Consultations
Portugal is on a 24-month consultation cycle during the Extended Arrangement. Staff discussions for
the 2009 Article IV consultation were conducted on a mission to Lisbon during November 19–30,
2009. The Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on January 20, 2010.

PORTUGAL—STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of December 10, 2012)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General. Data provision to the Fund is adequate for surveillance purposes.
Real Sector. Since 2000 INE publishes a full set of national accounts based on ESA95
methodology, including quarterly GDP estimates.
Fiscal sector. Data have undergone a number of revisions during the transition to ESA95, sizably
altering revenue and expenditure and hampering comparisons across years. From 2001 onward,
budgets have been presented in a manner consistent with recent changes in national and fiscal
accounting methodology. Quarterly general government statistics on an accrual basis are
available as derived from the national accounts statistics.
Trade and Balance of Payments. Data are provided according to the IMF’s fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual. The external trade data meet the timeliness standards. The portfolio
investment collection system has a simplified threshold of €500 million, which is relatively high in
comparison with many EU countries. The authorities estimate however, that only about 1.5
percent of transactions are not captured on a monthly basis by this threshold, and that this
reporting simplification does not significantly hamper the quality of the monthly balance of
payments. Moreover, they indicate that all transactions below this threshold are included in the
first release of the annual balance of payments data, and the monthly numbers are revised
accordingly.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Portugal is subject to the statistical requirements
and timeliness and reporting standards of Eurostat
and the European Central Bank (ECB). Portugal
subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS), and the relevant metadata have
been posted on the Dissemination Standards
Bulletin Board.

No data ROSC is available.

SIXTH REVIEW UNDER THE EXTENDED ARRANGEMENT
AND REQUEST FOR WAIVERS OF APPLICABILITY OF ENDDECEMBER PERFORMANCE CRITERIA

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Economic developments and program performance. Program implementation
remains good: all end-September PCs and structural benchmarks for the review were
met. Fiscal performance has been broadly in line with the program, and external
adjustment continues to proceed at a faster pace that envisaged. Reflecting these
positive achievements and an improvement in market conditions at the euro area level,
yields on government bonds have continued to decline, reaching their lowest level
since early 2011.
Sixth Review. Policy discussions focused on the parameters for the newly launched
comprehensive public expenditure review and a new initiative to make the corporate
income tax system more conducive to investment and competitiveness. Discussions
also covered how to address the risk of revenue shortfalls, the tight credit conditions
faced by firms, and further steps to improve labor market flexibility.
Outlook and risks. Domestic activity indicators are still strongly negative. Output is
expected to contract by 3 percent this year, and there are downside risks to the
expected 1-percent contraction next year. Staff expects a recovery in the second half
of 2013, but much will also depend on broader euro area developments. The debt
outlook remains sustainable, although the room for maneuver is narrow—under the
new baseline public debt will peak at 122 percent of GDP, declining gradually
after 2014.
Staff supports the authorities’ request for completion of the sixth review,
including waivers of applicability of the end-December performance criteria. The
purchase subject to completion of this review would be in an amount equivalent to
SDR 724 million.

criteria for which data are available and structural benchmarks for the 6th review have been met.
More broadly, external adjustment continues to exceed expectations; fiscal performance is largely in
line with the program objectives; financial stability continues to be maintained; and structural
reforms are being advanced. In this context, and playing off the more benign market environment,
sovereign yields have continued to decline to their lowest levels since early 2011. Some
corporates—including banks—have also resumed borrowing in international capital markets at
medium-term maturities. Nevertheless, domestic activity indicators are still strongly negative, and
support from external demand is hostage to broader euro area economic developments. With
revenue collections already on the weak side, this points to downside risks to the macroeconomic
outlook and fiscal targets.
2.
Program implementation has remained strong amidst a more tense social and political
climate. The 2013 budget was adopted by Parliament, consistent with earlier understandings. The
government has launched a comprehensive public expenditure review to identify the permanent
measures that will underpin the adjustment effort over the next several years. In addition, important
pieces of legislation have been submitted to Parliament or adopted, moving the structural reform
agenda forward. But austerity fatigue is also running high. With unemployment set to continue
rising and disposable incomes set for a further fall, opposition parties and civil society organizations
are increasingly voicing strong objections to key elements of the program.
3.
This sixth program review was conducted in conjunction with the 2012 Article IV
discussions. A separate Article IV report presents an analysis of the institutional weaknesses and
policy failures that led to the 2011 economic crisis, progress to date in addressing economic
imbalances, and medium-term prospects and risks. This review report focuses on the program
review aspects of the mission’s discussions. The centerpieces of policy discussions in this review
were: (i) the parameters for the newly launched comprehensive public expenditure review and (ii) a
new initiative to make the corporate income tax system more conducive to investment and
competitiveness. Discussions also covered how to best address the risk of revenue shortfalls, the still
tight credit conditions faced by firms, and further steps to improve labor market efficiency.

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
4.
Output is so far evolving as envisaged under the program baseline, but there are signs
of weakness. Real output contracted by 0.9 percent (quarter-on-quarter) in the third quarter,
somewhat smaller than the 1.1 percent expected under the program. This reflected stronger-thanexpected private sector activity, with signs of the contraction in industrial production bottoming out
in the third quarter. However, more recent high frequency confidence and activity indicators point to
possible further weakness going forward. On balance, staff and the authorities agreed to maintain
the growth forecast broadly unchanged—with output contracting by 3 percent this year and the

Staff still expects a recovery in the second half of 2013, driven by a turnaround in
investment; but much will also depend on broader euro area developments. The recovery is
expected to be underpinned by a gradual increase in investment outlays by more export-oriented
firms as capacity constraints become more binding. Risks to this forecast remain non-trivial. For
instance, there could be further drag on growth from fiscal adjustment or corporate deleveraging,
weighing much more on spending and employment than currently assumed. This outlook also
requires that the conditions in the euro area do not deteriorate subtstantially and that export
demand picks up in the second half of 2013. (see Article IV report for more details on the
macroeconomic outlook and related risks).

The speed of external adjustment continues to exceed expectations, prompting an
upward revision to the current account balance projections. Exports of goods and services fell
by close to 7 percent year-on-year in September, reflecting a strike by port workers in reaction to
the ongoing reforms (see below), as well as weakening demand in Europe, but growth of goods
exports picked up again to 5 percent in October. Overall, year-to-date export growth was robust

10 percentage points from the low point in
late 2008—or close to staff’s revised, but still
conservative year-end projection. The current account deficit is now projected to reach about
1 percent of GDP in 2013, compared to 1.7 percent of GDP at the time of the 5th review.
8.
The debt outlook remains sustainable, although the room for maneuver is narrow.
Public debt will peak at some 122 percent of GDP in 2013–14 and start declining steadily thereafter.1
As before, the debt path remains very sensitive to the economic growth and interest rate
assumptions. And the possible migration of contingent liabilities from either state-owned
enterprises or the highly indebted nonfinancial corporate sector to the sovereign balance sheet, via
the banking system, remains a high risk factor for the debt trajectory. As noted in earlier reports, the
combination of plausible shocks could generate an unsustainable dynamics (see DSA appendix in
Article IV report).

ADVANCING FISCAL CONSOLIDATION
A. Recent Fiscal Developments
9.
Revenue performance continues to show signs of weakness. State tax revenues were
about 0.2 percent of GDP below projections at end-October (on a cumulative basis), reflecting
mainly the continuing shift in economic activity from domestic demand to the lighter-taxed exports
and an unanticipated increase in corporate income tax reimbursements. In spite of this, and contrary
to initial expectation, the end-September performance criterion on the government cash deficit was

budget, which is in line with the

understanding reached at the time of the 5th
review (see IMF Country Report No. 12/292 for a full discussion), is consistent with achieving the
program’s 4½ percent of GDP deficit target on current policies and prospects. The consolidation is
underpinned by a mixture of revenue increases, which account for 80 percent of the total
adjustment, and expenditure cuts (MEFP ¶3). The budget is an important step in putting Portugal’s
finances on a sustainable footing. It postulates continued fiscal consolidation, with a structural
primary adjustment close to 2 percentage points of potential GDP. Successful implementation will
bring the structural primary adjustment in 2011–13 to 80 percent of the required total.

B. Policy Discussions
11.
The mission discussed ways to address the significant downside risks to the fiscal
targets:


Given the revenue underperformance, staff estimates that, in the absence of offsetting
measures, the 2012 deficit would be about ¼ percentage points of GDP higher than the target
of 5 percent of GDP (including receipts from the sale of an airport concession).3 But the
authorities were adamant this would be offset through tighter spending execution. To this end,
all new capital spending commitments have been frozen since end-September. There is also a
risk of slippages in the execution of the program with Madeira, but the authorities are proactively containing spending to avoid any impact on the deficit target.



With the underlying revenue slippage set to carry over to next year, and given the risks to the
macroeconomic outlook, the authorities have agreed to prepare contingency measures for 2013
worth at least ½ percent of GDP on the spending side—mainly by frontloading the measures
from the ongoing public expenditure review.

2

With the preliminary data indicating that the end-September PC on government cash balance might have
been missed, the authorities had requested a waiver of non-observance, which was granted at the time of the
fifth review.
3

As noted in the staff report for the fifth review, reaching the 5.0 percent deficit target is contingent on the
above-the-line classification of the expected revenue from the sale of airport concessionaire ANA (0.7 percent
of GDP). Staff and the authorities are still discussing the proper statistical treatment. The outcome of the
discussion will not affect the magnitude of Portugal’s fiscal consolidation effort.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

PORTUGAL

12.
Discussions also covered the scope and parameters of the recently initiated public
expenditure review. The fiscal adjustment envisaged for 2013 relies heavily on raising revenues.
This has prompted considerable public disquiet, and there is some political consensus for a
thorough reassessment of the country’s spending priorities. To this end, the authorities have
launched a comprehensive expenditure review—including with input from Fund technical
assistance—with the aim of improving the efficiency and sustainability of the government
operations. In quantitative terms, the objective is to identify savings of up to €4 billion (close to
2.5 percent of GDP) during the course of 2013–14. The authorities plan to discuss their findings with
staff at the time of the next program review in February 2013 (MEFP ¶4).
13.
The mission strongly welcomed the expenditure review. With the tax-to-GDP ratio
already in line with peers and the 2013 budget set to push this ratio even higher, a large part of the
medium-term fiscal adjustment will need to come from expenditure restraint. This would help bring
the adjustment mix closer to the original program objective—one third revenue, two thirds
expenditure. And given that Portugal’s spending is heavily concentrated on pensions and public
wages—accounting for about two-thirds of total spending, these outlays will have to be at the
center of spending reforms. These areas are particularly sensitive; and it will be important to ensure
a broad, open, and transparent consultation process to build domestic support for these critical
reforms.
14.

Fiscal structural reforms continue to focus on minimizing fiscal risks.



Public financial management. Following broad consultation with the various stakeholders and
FAD TA, the government is on track to meet the end-year structural benchmark on the
submission of the local and regional finance laws to Parliament. The total stock of domestic
arrears was further reduced—to 2.4 percent of GDP at end-October—reflecting repayments of
health sector arrears under a settlement program agreed earlier. But going beyond the
parameters of this program, the authorities plan to settle an additional €432 million in arrears.
The mission expressed its misgiving, stressing that underlying accumulation of arrears is not yet
under control, especially in SOE hospitals. The authorities argued that with the new expenditure
commitment control systems now rolled out in most spending units, the underlying
accumulation of arrears will soon be stopped. Moreover, they agreed that this repayment would
not proceed until there is evidence that: (i) cash management needs are carefully prioritized; and
(ii) the impact on the deficit is properly assessed.



Revenue administration. Given the revenue underperformance this year and the greater reliance
of the 2013 adjustment on tax handles, the focus on tax noncompliance is being strengthened.
In particular, the authorities are working toward a new compliance risk management approach
over a 2–3 year period, with two projects focusing on High Net Wealth Individuals (HNWI) and

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PORTUGAL

Self-Employed Professionals (SEP) to be implemented immediately.4 The end-December
structural benchmark on the implementation of the Large Taxpayer Office was met. Progress has
also been achieved in resolving high value tax court cases. Nevertheless, some organizational
reforms, such as streamlining the excessive number of local offices of the revenue
administration, have been postponed. Staff also stressed the need for a deeper analysis on
compliance trends and performance indicators, including the adoption of a risk management
unit.


Public-private partnerships (PPPs). The authorities have developed a plan to reduce PPP costs by
about €250 million in 2013, and up to €400 million after 2014. It includes several measures such
as the reduction of scope of contracts, changes in the toll framework, and reduction of the
private partners’ internal rate of return. The mission stressed the need to ensure the long-term
fiscal sustainability in the renegotiation process, minimizing contingent risks and promoting
transparency.

15.
The objective of restoring operational balance for the SOE sector before end-2012 has
been achieved. Further cost-cutting is still needed in some firms that still show deficits, and they
have been asked to present plans for the next fiscal year accordingly, while firms in surplus have
been asked to find ways of generating new revenue streams from non-core activities to help pay
down debts and meet the partial reinstatement of the salaries. The authorities have generally been
successful in ensuring that amortizing debts are rolled over, and no new use of direct treasury
financing for firms outside the perimeter of general government is foreseen in the 2013 budget. But
rolling over high legacy debts in several firms remains a risk.
16.
The privatization process is on track. The authorities have received bids for the airport
concession company ANA. Completion of the sale is expected in early in 2013. The sale process for
the postal company, CTT, is expected to be launched in the second quarter of 2013, and completed
by year-end, while privatization of the rail cargo company CP Carga is expected to be launched in
early 2013. Overall, interest has been strong in the privatization process, and completion of the ANA
transaction should bring privatization proceeds to about 80 percent of the originally programmed
revenues.

SAFEGUARDING FINANCIAL STABILITY

Moreover, two Portuguese banks have recently reaccessed international bond markets in the wake of

But credit conditions remain among the tightest in the euro area.



While large corporations maintain reasonable access to financing, smaller firms are facing
particularly difficult credit conditions. Bank credit growth to large firms in recent months has
remained positive, coupled with several international bond issues by large firms in recent
months—for the first time since early 2011—as well as placements in domestic retail markets.5
However, credit pressures remain elevated for small and micro enterprises, notably those
operating in the non-tradable sectors. Credit to these firms by domestic banks has been
declining at a pace of about 10 percent year-on-year in recent months (compared to about
5 percent for the non-financial private sector) (Figure 5).



Most notably, the cost of credit for Portuguese firms remains extremely high compared to euro
area peers. This applies to all market segments, including the more dynamic export sector. While
the relatively higher lending rates in Portugal largely reflect differences in sovereign spreads
across the region, the ongoing drag on banks’ profitability is also playing an important role on
credit conditions. In particular, high provisions, low rates on legacy portfolios, and the costly
remuneration of the contingent instruments injected by the state are putting pressures on the
lending rates applied by banks to new corporate loans, despite the recent decline in deposit
rates.

B. Policy Discussions
19.
There were extensive discussions on the principles and modalities of the bank
recapitalization process. All major banks have been successfully recapitalized through private
and/or public support, and the recapitalization of one smaller bank, delayed pending completion of
its group restructuring, is also being finalized. Consequently, banks are on track to meet the endyear 10 percent Core Tier I requirement under the program. The authorities affirmed that recourse
to the public funds being made available under the program for bank recapitalization exercise is
being anchored by the following principles: a successful assessment of viability by the Banco de
Portugal’s (BdP) underpinned by conservative funding and capital plans by the banks; burdensharing with the private sector, as evidenced by successful private placements; and adequate
safeguards to protect the interest of taxpayers, including through banks’ restructuring plans, in line
with EU state aid rules.
20.
Notwithstanding the progress to date, the authorities share staff views on the need for
vigilance. The BdP is continuing with its efforts to ensure the resilience of the banking system. The
BdP’s new onsite inspections program, focused on asset classes that are more sensitive to current
market conditions (e.g. construction, commercial real estate, tourism), highlighted only limited
impairment deviations, which are expected to be further mitigated by the impairment
reinforcements in the corporate segment already projected by banks for 2012Q4. In addition, the
latest quarterly stress test exercise indicated that, following the recent capital augmentation, bank
capitalization levels are sufficient to meet the additional 6 percent Core Tier I requirement under the
adverse scenario. However, overdue loans by non financial corporations and, to a lesser extent,
households are on the rise, calling for continued vigilance. Resources from the Bank Solvency
Support Facility (BSSF) remain available to lend support to viable banks should further capital needs
arise, although banks are encouraged first and foremost to seek private solutions.

22.
The authorities’ have stepped-up their efforts to facilitate an orderly deleveraging
process.


Building on their initial proposal on alternative funding options for the corporate sector (see 5th
Review Staff Report), the Ministry of Finance, in collaboration with the BdP and other
stakeholders, is prioritizing the development of initiatives aimed at promoting access to funding
by SMEs (MEFP ¶14). These include measures to promote SMEs’ access to capital markets
through pooling of debt instruments, notably commercial paper; the rationalization of existing
government initiatives to support credit and investment in the more innovative segments of the
economy; efforts to support upgrading and sharing of information on SMEs by the private
sector (see SI Chapter III). Nevertheless, pending more detailed plans, staff stressed the need to
avoid any additional fiscal burden or risks.



Moreover, given the ongoing concerns on local funding and lending conditions in Portugal, the
authorities intend to continue consultation with the European Commission on the rate of
remuneration of the contingent instruments used for recapitalization purposes.



As part of their efforts to promote an orderly corporate balance-sheet adjustment, the
authorities are closely monitoring the effectiveness of the newly introduced corporate debt
restructuring toolkit. In particular, efforts are ongoing to ensure early restructuring by viable
firms experiencing financial difficulties, including by promoting effective coordination with the
tax authorities. The authorities are coordinating with banks to assess the potential impact and
mitigate risks associated with the implementation of recently approved measures to facilitate
household debt restructuring (including mortgages).

23.
The mission also took stock of the ongoing progress of enhancing the bank
recapitalization and resolution frameworks. Forthcoming amendments seek to allow the state to
exercise control over an institution (structural benchmark). In addition, amendments will provide for
a mandatory recapitalization process using public funds when an institution’s capital falls below the
minimum level required and it either does not present a recapitalization plan or does not amend
such plan in accordance with feedback from the BdP (MEFP ¶18). Moreover, as part of the ongoing
authorities’ efforts to strengthen the early intervention and resolution framework, the supervisory
notices on recovery plans and bridge banks have been issued and the regulation governing the
organization and operation of the resolution fund has come into force. The authorities continue to
work on the legislation relating to the banks’ contributions to the resolution fund and the
supervisory notice on resolution plans.

BOOSTING COMPETITIVENESS AND GROWTH

Labor and product market reforms have continued to advance in recent months:

labor market mismatches (see 4th review staff report). Continuous progress is being made in
broadening the reach of Vida Ativa, a new targeted training initiative, and improving the role of
public employment services. On the education front, efforts are concentrated on improving the
quality of secondary education and vocational training.


Steps are being taken to foster competition and reduce excessive licensing. A framework law for
regulation is under preparation. It will aim at guaranteeing the independence of the various
sectoral regulators, including by strengthening their financial, administrative and management
autonomy. Initiatives to tackle excessive licensing procedures, regulations and other
administrative burdens—which are impeding the establishment, operation, and expansion of
firms—are moving forward.



Reforms to boost price competitiveness in ports are advancing. The Port Law amending the
traditionally highly protected port work regime was passed by Parliament in first reading. It aims
at lowering wage costs substantially and facilitating a more flexible use of labor. The authorities
have reduced fees on port use (TUP-Carga) by 10 percent.

25.
Reforms to improve the efficiency of the judicial system have progressed well. The
authorities have taken steps to further resolve the backlogged enforcement cases including by
adopting a decree law for a set of urgent measures designed to combat the court case backlog. The
two end-November 2012 structural benchmarks—the new Code of Civil Procedure to speed up the
court procedures and the implementation of the judicial roadmap to streamline the court
structure—were met (see Box 1). Progress has also been achieved in the area of the enforcement
agents’ framework in terms of an overhaul to the fee system that incentivizes enforcement and the
framework for supervision and monitoring (MEFP ¶25).

B. Policy Discussions
26.
The mission has reached understandings on steps to further enhance labor market
flexibility. Significant measures have already been adopted over the past year to improve the
functioning of the labor market, including the recent reform of wage bargaining to ensure wages
better reflect heterogeneous firm-level conditions. The government agreed to further lower
severance payments to 12 days per year of service (MEFP ¶21), bringing them in line with relevant
comparators in the European Union—a draft Law to this effect is to be submitted to Parliament in
December. Under the old regime, severance pay was among the highest in advanced countries, even
following the reductions introduced last year.
27.
Staff also discussed follow-up actions to the ongoing product market reforms
(MEFP ¶22). In particular, while the framework law for regulation is being prepared, the authorities
are amending the statutes of the electricity regulator (ERSE) to give it the appropriate powers,
independence, and autonomy ahead of full market liberalization in January 2013. Regarding the
functioning of ports, another 10-percent cut in ports user fees will be made effective in January. In
addition, to ensure the effective transmission of lower unit labor costs to end-users of port services

Box 1. Progress in Judicial Reform
Two key judicial reform projects (i.e., the new Code of Civil Procedure and the new Judicial Organization
Law to implement the judicial roadmap) have reached a major milestone with the submission to
Parliament of two draft laws (end-November 2012 structural benchmarks). This constitutes the first
comprehensive reform in these areas in almost a century and concludes a process of intense stakeholder
consultation lasting more than a year. The reforms, which are of the medium to long-term nature, seek to
improve the efficiency of the judicial system.
The new draft Code of Civil Procedure aims at expediting the civil and enforcement process. The Code
enables conciliation and mediation throughout the different stages of the civil process, strengthens the powers
of the judge to expedite the civil process, focuses the civil process on substance rather than form, reduces
appeal and considerably expedites enforcement procedures. The Code includes many elements of a modern
civil process consistent with international best practices.
The draft Judicial Organization Law focuses the judicial organization on flexibility, specialization, and
concentration. The law strengthens the personnel flexibility in allocating resources across the country in terms
of judges, courts, and courthouses, increases specialization within the judiciary, fosters a better management of
courts including through centralized management and concentration, and enables the establishment of time
management tools. As a result, the court system will be trimmed significantly.
Both law reform projects need to be adopted by Parliament and are scheduled to enter into force by
early 2014. The authorities have also started to focus their efforts to ensure a proper implementation of these
new laws once approved by Parliament.

following adoption of the Ports Law, the government will encourage price reductions under existing
contracts, revise incentives for port operators by adopting a new performance-based model for
future concessions, and encourage entry of new operators.
28.
The mission also initiated discussions on ways to make the corporate income tax (CIT)
system more conducive to investment and competitiveness. With the policy tool to boost
investment and growth highly constrained, staff welcomed the authorities’ initiative to review the
effectiveness of the existing CIT model. The objective is to assess the competitiveness of the
Portuguese corporate income tax system in comparison to peers, and prepare a comprehensive
reform aimed at making Portugal a more attractive investment destination (MEFP ¶5). As part of this
exercise, the authorities will analyze the current incentives schemes and work on proposals to
enhance their effectiveness, with a view to encouraging the tradable and high value-added sectors,
consistent with EU competition rules. The results of this analysis will be discussed during the 7th
review.

FINANCING AND RISKS
29.
Conditions in sovereign debt markets have been strong of late. Following the successful
bond exchange in early October, and playing off a more benign market environment in the wake of
the ECB’s policy pronouncements and the recent agreement at the European level to unlock further
additional assistance to Greece, spreads have fallen significantly. Secondary market yields on 10year bonds at close to 7 percent—broadly in line with the market re-access interest rate assumed in
staff’s DSA—represent a substantial step towards sustainable levels. Concerns remain that the rally

PORTUGAL

may reflect relatively transient factors, particularly in the wake of the announcement of OMT, while a
critical mass of interest from longer-term investors would be needed for lower yields to endure.
Demand for Treasury bills remains solid, with yields stabilizing at low levels, and average maturities
rising. These more favorable market conditions also facilitated the international corporate issuance
noted above.

Under these conditions, the authorities’ strategy for a gradual return to markets
remains viable. The authorities are confident that a good cash management strategy will be
sufficient to cover needs while access is gradually restored within the current program resource
envelope. Specific plans comprise exploiting scope for further Treasury bill issuance, stopping
outflows from retail savings instruments issued by the state through offering higher rates of return
(this strategy is already yielding results), and seeking to ensure the roll-over of medium-term
instruments where possible. The authorities are actively engaging with potential investors, including
through road-shows, with a view to issuing debt at two- or three-year tenors when market
conditions allow.
31.
Against this backdrop, exceptional access remains justified. Notwithstanding improved
market conditions, exceptional access under the program remains critical to address Portugal’s
funding needs. While public debt is assessed to be sustainable over the medium term, sustainability
cannot be asserted with high probability. Nonetheless, systemic risk from contagion to other
vulnerable Euro Area countries should Portugal fail to fully service its debts justifies exceptional
access. Regaining market access within the period that Fund resources are outstanding is feasible,
though risks of delays remain. Commitments by Euro Area leaders to provide resources adequate to
meet needs until Portugal can regain full market access, as long as the program remains on track,
give assurances that financing will be available to repay the Fund. Implementation capacity and
prospects for program success remain reasonably strong, given the good track record to date and
sufficient political support, including through the large parliamentary majority of the governing
coalition.
32.
Capacity to repay the Fund remains adequate. The Fund’s exposure to Portugal rises to
substantial levels, reaching 17 percent of GDP in 2014, with debt service expected to peak in 2018,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

PORTUGAL

at 5.9 percent of exports of goods and services, or 2.8 percent of GDP. Export strength has partially
compensated the increased burden on the economy from Euro weakness, and downward revisions
to nominal GDP. Despite fiscal and political setbacks, program implementation capacity remains
strong, and the rapid closure of the external imbalances also provides assurance that adequate
resources will be available to repay the Fund.
33.
Downside risks to the attainment of the program’s objectives remain high, and would
require a prompt policy response. In particular, the materialization of downside risks to the
macro-fiscal outlook noted above—see also Article IV report for a more detailed presentation of
medium-term risks to the adjustment process—may require prompt implementation of corrective
measures to preserve the achievements to date in strengthening confidence. Should, for example,
some of parts of the 2013 Budget be challenged on constitutional grounds, it will be important to
rapidly enact offsetting measures to keep the fiscal program on track. On the financing front,
renewed stress in euro area financial markets or materialization of fiscal risks could further delay
market re-access, and room for maneuver is limited in view of the significant medium-term
financing needs.

STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
The authorities continue to maintain a strong policy and reform effort. Reflecting this,
fiscal adjustment is advancing and the external position continues to improve at a faster pace than
expected. A significant proportion of the imbalances that tipped the economy into crisis have now
been unwound. Sovereign yields have continued to decline, although also reflecting easing market
conditions at the euro area level.
35.
All the same, the reduction of imbalances entails considerable sacrifices in the form of
rising unemployment and lower disposable incomes. The social and political climate is markedly
more difficult, with resistance to adjustment policies and reforms testing the government’s resolve.
This has in turn engendered considerable uncertainty and is weighing on confidence. While an
economic turnaround is still envisaged to begin in the course of next year, further adjustment needs
and the recession in the euro area represent significant risks to the growth outlook.
36.
With few easy alternatives available, sustaining the adjustment effort is unavoidable.
The financing constraint remains binding and public and private sector debt levels are very high. In
this context, there are no easy alternatives to further adjustment to bring public finances in order
and gradual deleveraging to improve private sector balance sheets. And within the constraints of the
monetary union, fostering a more competitive economy by consistently implementing difficult
structural reforms is the only way to underpin sustainable external adjustment and strong growth.
Significant progress has been achieved on all of these fronts, but consolidating the gains to date
requires determination to advance toward the program objectives.
37.
Tight budget implementation is critical, and the authorities should stand ready to take
further action to ensure the fiscal program remains on track. The government remains
committed to achieving the deficit target of 5 percent of GDP in 2012 and a deficit of 4.5 percent of
16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PORTUGAL

GDP in 2013. But with signs of revenue weaknesses already visible, staff welcomes the government’s
pledge to identify contingency measures. This is particularly important as risks to the macro-fiscal
outlook remain significant. Continued efforts in consistently implementing the law on expenditure
commitment controls, further strengthening revenue administration, and tighter control over SOEs
and PPPs will also be important to limit risks to budget execution. If some of the 2013 budget
provisions are revoked by the Constitutional Court, alternative measures should also be promptly
enacted.
38.
Staff strongly supports the authorities’ objective to rebalance the adjustment effort
toward expenditure going forward. A tax-to-GDP ratio already in line with peers, heavy reliance
on raising new revenues in 2013, and disappointing revenue performance so far put a high premium
on completing the planned expenditure review. Early identification of specific spending reform
options for the next few years would help bolster confidence. But because Portugal’s spending is
heavily concentrated on sensitive outlays such as social transfers and public wages, it will be
essential to build as broad a consensus as possible behind the required reforms.
39.
Risks to financial stability need to be monitored vigilantly. The recapitalization of the
banking sector and the strengthening of banking supervision and resolution frameworks are
advancing. Liquidity in the banking system, underpinned by stable deposits, continues to benefit
from exceptional support from the Eurosystem. Deleveraging in the banking system has proceeded
apace, although access to credit at reasonable conditions remains difficult for exporting companies
and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Staff welcomes measures to ensure adequate
funding, including initiatives to improve information-sharing on SMEs and facilitate their access to
capital markets.
40.
Fostering a more competitive economy is imperative. Progress on labor and product
market reforms as well as in the judiciary area should go a long way in making the economy more
efficient. However, it remains unclear whether reforms to date are sufficient to address the large
external competitiveness gap or will engender an adequately strong supply response to avoid a
prolonged demand-driven slump. Staff urges the authorities to continue exploring alternative policy
options to catalyze significant reductions in production costs and compress excessive non-tradable
sector profit margins. This entails rigorous enforcement of competition laws and regulations as well
as identifying and tackling more decisively any explicit and implicit policies that limit market entry
and hinder competition. The planned comprehensive reform of the corporate income tax could also
help foster investment and competitiveness, while cost reductions for ports will ensure a more
competitive framework in this part of the transport infrastructure that is critical for exports.
41.
The success of the program also depends critically on continued external support and
successful crisis policies at the euro-area level. Considerable uncertainties persist and Portugal
remains vulnerable to shocks stemming from other euro area countries or policy failures at the
regional level. While implementation of the authorities’ adjustment program is the key for mending
Portugal’s deep-seated economic problems, these domestic efforts need to be complemented by
institutional reforms at euro-area level to clear a path toward a durable return to market financing.
The commitment by European leaders to support Portugal until market access is restored, as long as
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

PORTUGAL

the authorities persevere with strict program implementation, continues to provide a valuable
financing assurance. Recourse to the ECB’s Outright Monetary Transactions would help address
credit market segmentation and restore an appropriate monetary policy transmission.
42.
Staff recommends completion of the sixth review and the granting of waivers of
applicability.

APPENDIX I. PORTUGAL: LETTER OF INTENT
Lisbon, December 19, 2012
Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, DC 20431
Dear Ms. Lagarde:
1.
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) describes the
progress made in recent months towards the objectives laid out in our program supported by the
Extended Arrangement. It also updates previous MEFPs and highlights the policy steps to be taken
in the next months.
2.
The end-September deficit and debt performance criteria were met and the two endNovember structural benchmarks on the submission to Parliament of the new Code of Civil
Procedure and the reform of the court organization were also met.
3.
We remain strongly committed to the program’s policies and objectives and expect the
agreed 5 percent deficit target for 2012 to be achieved. The 2013 budget was approved by the
Parliament, including a range of tax and spending measures that should ensure the general
government deficit of 4½ percent of GDP will be achieved next year. To advance with the additional
fiscal adjustment that is required in coming years, we have initiated a comprehensive public
expenditure review exercise to be completed early in 2013.
4.
Consistent with our commitment to implement a multi-year strategic plan to strengthen
fiscal discipline, we are intensifying our efforts to prevent the increase in the stock of existing
domestic arrears. We are reforming the SOE sector, which has been brought to overall operational
balance, as per our commitment, after many years of chronic deficits. We will continue this
restructuring effort, and to actively manage their high legacy debt burden. Moreover, the
privatization is proceeding as scheduled and we are advancing our strategy to put the PPPs on a
sustainable financial path.
5.
Our policy efforts to preserve financial stability will continue, as banks are on track to meet
the 2012 capital requirements, following the recent capital exercise. Banco de Portugal (BdP)
continues on its supervisory effort to ensure adequate recognition of impairment levels, as
evidenced by the successful completion of the latest on-site inspection. In addition, the
recapitalization and resolution framework will be further strengthened. The Portuguese authorities
are preparing a proposal for the setting-up of a mechanism to securitize high-quality mortgage
credit with a supranational guarantee. Moreover, we are exploring a new proposal to rationalize and
redirect to the most productive segments of the economy existing government initiatives, including
the setting up of a revolving mechanism to leverage EU structural funds. Finally, we will also

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

PORTUGAL

continue consultation with the European Commission on the rate of remuneration of financial
instruments used for recapitalization purposes. In pursuing this route, we are motivated by concerns
on local funding and lending conditions.
6.
We have made important advances in many dimensions of our ambitious structural reform
agenda, and will continue to press ahead with measures to improve the business environment and
help spur investment. Measures to actively promote employment and improve education are being
expanded. With the completion of the reduction of severance payments, to be soon submitted to
Parliament, we will have reduced the rigidity of labor contracts substantially. A landmark revision of
the Ports Work Law in discussion in the Parliament will increase efficiency and help reduce costs for
exporters. Going forward, we will continue to pursue a streamlined and more effective licensing and
regulatory framework along with a reform in corporate taxation, as part of our strategy to attract
more investment and boost competitiveness.
7.
On the basis of the strength of the policies defined in this letter, and in light of our
performance under the program, we request the completion of the sixth review under the Extended
Arrangement, the seventh purchase under the arrangement in the amount of SDR 724 million, as
well as a waiver of applicability for the end-December deficit and debt performance criteria.
8.
We remain confident that the policies described in the current and previous MEFPs are
adequate to achieve the objectives under the program. We stand ready to take additional measures
should they be needed to meet the objectives of the economic program and will consult with the
IMF, the European Commission, and the ECB, in advance of any necessary revisions to the policies
contained in this letter and attached Memorandum.
9.

This letter is copied to Messrs. Juncker, Rehn, and Draghi.

Sincerely yours,
/s/
Vítor Gaspar
Minister of State and Finance

ATTACHMENT I. PORTUGAL: MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC
AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
December 19, 2012
1.
Activity. The outlook for growth and inflation remains broadly in line with the program
framework. In the third quarter of 2012, real GDP contracted by 0.8 percent (over the previous
quarter), somewhat smaller than the 1 percent assumed under the baseline. The main drag on
growth remains the ongoing private sector deleveraging, ongoing fiscal adjustment, and, in more
recent months, the marked slowdown in activity in the euro area. Looking ahead, we expect output
to trough in the first half of 2013 followed by a gradual recovery in activity from the third quarter,
limiting the contraction in output on average to 1 percent in 2013. The decline in investment is
expected to slow down, as the strong export growth of recent quarters is expected to foster some
increase in capacity utilization. The current account deficit is projected to continue narrowing from
6.5 percent of GDP last year to under 3 percent in 2012 and under 1 percent in 2013. The
employment outlook unfortunately looks set to remain difficult, with projected average
unemployment rates of 15½ percent this year and 16½ percent in 2013. Moreover, downside risks
to both the output and employment outlook are significant, and avoiding still weaker outcomes will
depend greatly on developments in the euro area.

FISCAL POLICY
2.
Budget 2012. Revenue performance has been somewhat weaker than envisaged in recent
months. This is explained by macroeconomic developments (continued rebalancing of activity from
domestic demand to net exports) and some temporary factors such as an unanticipated increase in
tax reimbursements). Tight spending execution is being maintained, ensuring the end-September
government cash deficit was met. While there are downside risks, the general government deficit
objective of 5 percent of GDP for 2012 should be achieved reflecting our plans to sustain firm
spending discipline. This is after the inclusion of revenue from the one-off sale of the ANA
concession, which is expected to generate 0.7 percent of GDP. Overall, in 2012, the structural
primary deficit is estimated to have improved by some 2½ percentage points of GDP.
3.
Budget 2013. The 2013 budget was approved by Parliament on November 28. It includes a
range of tax and spending measures: increases in personal income tax (PIT) rates and introduction of
the streamlined PIT structure; increases in property and excise tax collection; changes to the
corporate income tax to reduce debt bias; the streamlining of public services, and improved
targeting of social transfers (see MEFP for the fifth review for a fuller description). Reflecting the
discussions in the Parliament, we have been able to improve the composition of the adjustment,
allowing us to reduce the surcharge on personal income tax by from 4 to 3½ percent, offset mainly
by spending cuts. Overall, the measures adopted in the budget should ensure that the general
government deficit to 4½ percent of GDP next year is achieved. As customary, we stand ready to
take additional measures, if need be, to ensure this deficit objective is met.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

PORTUGAL

4.
Expenditure Review. To underpin the additional fiscal adjustment that is required in
coming years, we have initiated a comprehensive public expenditure review exercise—to be
discussed at the seventh review—with contributions from a broad range of stakeholders in the
Portuguese society. Once the initial assessment is completed, we intend to initiate a consultation
with social and political partners to ensure that this review has the broad-based support to reform
the role and functions of the Portuguese state. The objective will be to refocus the role of the State
in Portugal in order to ensure the sustainability, the effectiveness, and the equity of its social
functions. This will allow generating spending savings of about €4 billion in 2013 and 2014. To this
end, this exercise will aim at ensuring better value-for-money from the public sector. Furthermore, a
crucial consideration will be to reallocate resources toward growth-friendly spending areas.
5.
CIT. In parallel with the expenditure review we are launching a comprehensive reform of our
corporate income taxation, so as to make Portugal a more attractive investment destination and
boost competitiveness. We will analyze the competitiveness of the Portuguese corporate income tax
system in comparison to peers—including its rates, tax expenditures, depreciation, loss-carryover
rules, holding regimes, and group taxation rules. In addition, we will reform our tax policy in order to
promote the internationalization of Portuguese groups and attract FDI, as well as the effectiveness
of existing tax incentives schemes, particularly in tradable and high value-added sectors. The results
of this analysis, which will be discussed during the 7th review, will help us devise strategic reform
objectives for the CIT system. The 2013 budget foresees the possibility of broadening the scope of
existing tax benefits aimed at boosting investment. We will ensure that any new initiative
implemented under the budget provisions be fully consistent with our strategic reform objectives as
well as EU State Aid rules, while assuring that this reform will be budget neutral.

CONTAINING FISCAL RISKS
6
Public Financial Management. We are committed to implement our 2013-2015 PFM
Strategic Plan in order to strengthen fiscal accountability and transparency, reduce budgetary
fragmentation, and build institutional capacity. To this end, we will proceed to transpose the new EU
economic and fiscal governance framework by year-end and conduct a review of the Budgetary
Framework Law in 2013, streamlining budget procedures. We will intensify our efforts to prevent the
underlying increase in the stock of domestic arrears of the health sector, which still reflects
commitments in excess of funding. We will work closely with the Autonomous Region of Madeira to
ensure that the region’s commitment control system is in full compliance with the new commitment
control law. We are on track to submit the Regional and Local Finance Laws to Parliament by yearend (structural benchmark).
7.
Revenue Administration. We will continue to strengthen our tax compliance strategy and
to modernize the revenue administration. In particular, our VAT invoicing reform will enter into force
on January 1st, 2013. We will also phase-in a new tax compliance management approach over a
three-year period, with the implementation of two pilot projects on key risk sectors—the High Net
Wealth Individuals and the Self-employed Professionals—by July 2013. The new approach will be
guided by a comprehensive tax compliance report, including a risk analysis by economic sector and

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PORTUGAL

taxpayer size, to be discussed in the 7th review. We are on track to fully implement the Large
Taxpayer Office by year-end (structural benchmark). The streamlining of the revenue
administration’s local offices will be completed by June 2014, aiming at closing down half of the
existing branches. We are accelerating efforts to successfully conclude the property revaluation
process and we expect to reach about 4 million properties by year-end. This far-reaching project will
be finalized by March 2013. Finally, the tax administration has systematically improved its
performance in tax courts’ decisions.
8.
Public Administration. Our public administration reform is advancing and we will continue
to press ahead with the objective to shape a more efficient State. The PREMAC program, which
reduced around 27 percent of management positions and 40 percent of administrative units across
the central administration, was successfully concluded. The reduction in the number of public
employees is projected at 3.5 percent in 2012, well above the 2 percent program target. Looking
ahead, we remain committed to continue streamlining excess employment in a targeted way. We
will also improve training and qualification of public employees and reinforce human resources
management policies across all administrations. In this context, labor and social protection regimes
will converge to private sector rules, increasing productivity and improving the quality of public
services.
9.
State-Owned Enterprises. We continue to make progress in restructuring the SOE sector.
We have achieved our objective of restoring operational balance to the sector as a whole before the
end of 2012. Completion of cost cutting programs at firms still in deficit, consolidation of functions
at merged firms, voluntary redundancies and efforts to raise non-core revenues will ensure this
significant turnaround is sustained and deepened in 2013. We will continue to actively manage the
high legacy debt burdens of these companies. Some small SOEs with non-essential functions are
being wound down, and we are developing a strategy to sell or rent non-vital real estate assets.
10.
Privatization. The privatization program remains on–track. We will accept final bids for the
airport concession company ANA and the airline TAP soon, successfully meeting our development
and financial objectives, with financial completion expected early in 2013. With the completion of
this sale, 80 percent of the program objective to raise €5 billion will have been met. We will launch
the privatization process for the postal company CTT in the second quarter of 2013, with a view to
completing the process by the end of the year. The sale of the rail cargo firm CP Carga will be
launched early in 2013, to be completed in the second or third quarter. A strategic plan for the water
sector, which envisages the sale or concession of the waste management business, is being
prepared.
11.
Public-Private Partnerships. We are advancing our strategy to put the PPPs financial model
on a sustainable path. The first stage of the road PPPs strategy has been concluded and is expected
to lead to savings in excess of €1 billion, in NPV terms, starting in 2014. This will be reached by
reducing maintenance costs of the sub-concessions contracts. However, a sustainable solution to
the Portuguese road model will only be achieved after the completion of the ongoing second phase,
which includes a gradual change in the risk matrix of some PPP projects, resulting in a significant

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

27

PORTUGAL

reduction in the availability payments by the State starting in March 2013. The newly-created PPP
Unit will technically support and monitor all phases of the renegotiation process.

SAFEGUARDING FINANCIAL STABILITY
12.
Credit and Funding Conditions. Reflecting both demand and supply factors, aggregate
credit continues to decline. But within this overall picture, there are large differences between
domestic and foreign sources of financing and among firms. Credit to large firms has continued to
expand, supported by successful bond issuances in both the domestic and international markets,
whereas loans by domestic banks to SMEs exposed to the non-tradable sector continued to contract
significantly. Demand for credit by firms remains conditioned by the need to reduce the large debt
burdens they face. The supply of credit is being affected inter alia by the banking system’s need to
move to a sustainable business model. In particular, very low rates on the legacy mortgage
portfolios are proving a drag on banks’ profitability, pushing up lending rates on new loans to
companies, including in the more dynamic export sector. The combination of measures being taken
by us and at the euro area level, including non-standard measures by the ECB to restore the proper
transmission of monetary policy, have started to stabilize conditions. Tentative signs of progress
include the recent issuance of a bond abroad by two commercial banks—the first such issuance
since mid- 2010.
13.
Liquidity. Exceptional Eurosystem liquidity support is playing a pivotal role in limiting
liquidity pressures and mitigating the lingering risk of excessive credit contraction. Moreover, the
eligibility of additional collateral has allowed Portuguese banks to reinforce buffers and is playing a
critical role in supporting their resilience against potential adverse shocks. In parallel, to facilitate the
functioning of the domestic interbank market, the BdP has launched a platform for interbank
unsecured lending and is developing a new one for secured transactions, which is expected to be
launched by in early 2013. Banks are expected to gradually reduce their dependence on the
Eurosystem liquidity over the medium term, as the deleveraging process smoothly runs its course
and collateral buffers are successfully strengthened on a sustainable basis.
14.
Orderly Corporate Deleveraging. As the required corporate sector deleveraging process
advances, it is also crucial that the most productive and innovative segments of the economy,
notably among SMEs, are not subject to undue funding strains and can effectively support the
economic recovery. To this end, the Ministry of Finance, together with BdP and other stakeholders,
are developing a range of measures that seek to facilitate credit to productive firms, foster the
diversification of firms’ financing alternatives, and reduce information asymmetry and promote more
efficient financing allocation. These could include the aggregation of SMEs’ debt instruments to
promote access to capital markets; initiatives to help mitigate risks to lenders by upgrading and
promoting sharing of information on SMEs; the rationalization and redirection to the most
productive segments of the economy of existing government initiatives. We will continue to ensure
that these steps do not burden or pose risks to public finances.

28

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PORTUGAL

15.
Private Sector Restructuring. Private sector debt restructuring plays an essential role in the
recovery of viable but financially vulnerable corporates and households. We continue facilitating a
smooth application of the newly adopted or amended legal frameworks for corporate debt
restructuring (such as the fast track in court restructuring tool, PER or SIREVE, mediated by IAPMEI).
In particular, we continue raising public awareness about the new restructuring tools to promote
early access by viable debtors in financial distress, while facilitating solutions to any remaining
obstacles to their effective application. We will also evaluate the potential impact of the recently
adopted household debt restructuring mechanisms on banks’ balance sheets. These efforts are
being supported by BdP’s initiatives to avoid banks’ evergreening and promote prompt
restructuring of problem loans.
16.
Bank Supervision. Efforts to strengthen the resilience of the banking system are continuing.
The BdP’s new onsite inspections program (OIP), launched last May and focused on assets related to
the construction and commercial real estate sectors, has been completed, with the banks being
expected to reflect the OIP findings in their 2012 annual accounts. This initiative is part of BdP
regular supervisory activities, which are currently focused on assets classes that are more sensitive to
existing market conditions. In parallel, the BdP has completed the next round of quarterly stress
tests, while banks’ implementation of the earlier recommendations on stress testing is progressing.
Banks that have completed the capital augmentation exercise—including through successful private
issuances—and despite higher impairment levels, are on track to meet the end-2012 capital targets
under the program. The BdP continues to closely monitor compliance with the capital requirements,
with a view to promptly take appropriate action if needed.
17.
BSSF Resources. We remain committed to providing further support to the banking sector,
if needed. We will continue to encourage banks to seek private solutions in the event new capital
needs were to arise. Nevertheless, resources from the Bank Solvency Support Facility (BSSF) remain
available to support viable banks if needed, in line with state aid rules and subject to strict
conditionality, with the aim to avoid subsidizing private shareholders and preventing migration of
private liabilities to the public sector balance sheet. The resources in the BSSF will solely be utilized
to provide public support, if needed, to the banking system.
18.
Bank Recapitalization and Resolution Frameworks. We will enhance the legal framework
governing banks’ access to public capital while continuing to strengthen the early intervention and
resolution framework. The decree law on the banks’ contributions to the resolution fund is expected
to be approved by end-December, and the supervisory notice on resolution plans will be finalized by
the same date. We will swiftly transpose the new EU Directive on bank resolution as soon as it
enters into force. The government will, in consultation with the ECB, and the EC and the IMF, submit
to Parliament by end-January 2013 (structural benchmark) amendments to the law governing banks’
access to public capital so as to allow the State, under strict circumstances, to exercise control over
an institution and to perform mandatory recapitalizations. Such amendments will be in line with EU
State Aid rules and will strike an appropriate balance between preserving the private structure of the
banking system and safeguarding the use of public resources.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

29

PORTUGAL

19.
BPN SPVs. We are implementing the strategy for managing the distressed assets from
Banco Português de Negócios (BPN). We are finalizing the terms of reference for the mandate of the
professional third party that will manage the credits currently held by Parvalorem, with the aim to
maximize recoveries while minimizing operational costs. The competitive bidding process to select
the asset manager will be launched by end-2012, with a view to complete the tender process by
mid-2013. We will also ensure timely disposal of the subsidiaries and the assets in the other two
state-owned SPVs. CGD’s state guaranteed claim will be gradually settled in cash, according to the
schedule agreed with the EC, ECB, and IMF staff. Any net recoveries realized on the assets will also
be applied towards the settlement of CGD’s claim.

BOOSTING EMPLOYMENT, COMPETITIVENESS, AND GROWTH
20.
ALMPs. We are delivering on commitments to support employment through Active Labor
Market Policies and to improve education. The objective is to improve the employability of the
young and disadvantaged categories and ease labor market mismatches. Continuous progress is
being made in broadening the reach of Vida Ativa, our new targeted training initiative, and
improving the role of public employment services. On the education front, we are focusing our
efforts on the quality of secondary education and vocational training.
21.
Labor Market Institutions. Significant steps have been taken over the past six months to
make the labor market more dynamic and efficient—including the adoption of a new labor code, the
reform of unemployment benefits and, more recently, the reform of the wage-setting mechanism.
By mid-December 2012, we will submit to parliament a law to lower severance payments further to
12 days per year of service, bringing them in line with relevant comparators in the European Union.
The law will be applied to all contracts while protecting acquired rights and maintaining the cap at
12 months of pay. Once this step is complete, the government will have reduced the restrictiveness
of employment protection legislation significantly.
22.
Ports and Energy. A landmark revision of the Ports Work Law, which was submitted to
Parliament in September, substantially lowers wage costs and removes constraints to optimizing the
use of labor. The Law is to be adopted by yearend. Follow-up measures to ensure the effective
transmission of lower unit labor costs to end-users of port services include (i) encouraging price
reductions under existing contract, (ii) revising incentives for port operators by adopting a new
performance-based model for future concessions, and (iii) encouraging entry of new operators.
Finally, responding to exporters’ concern, we have reduced fees on port use (TUP-Carga) by
10 percent. Another 10-percent cut will be made effective in January. We are pursuing our efforts to
cut energy costs, including by reducing excessive rents in the electricity sector.
23.
Business Environment. Initiatives to tackle excessive licensing procedures, regulations and
other administrative burdens—which are impeding the establishment, operation, and expansion of
firms—are advancing in line with the sixth update of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU).
24.
Regulation. We are preparing a framework law for regulation that draws on the findings
and recommendations of the recently completed expert report, benchmarking the responsibilities,
30

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PORTUGAL

resources, and independence of the main sectoral regulators against international best practices.
The framework law, which will guarantee independence, as well as financial, administrative and
management autonomy, and benefit from broad consultation with the regulatory bodies concerned,
will be submitted to parliament by end-March 2013. While this important law is being prepared, we
are amending the statutes of the electricity regulator (ERSE) to give it the appropriate powers,
independence, and autonomy ahead of full market liberalization in January 2013.
25.
Judicial. We have further advanced the reforms to improve the efficiency of the judicial
system, including by meeting the two end-November structural benchmarks on the judicial
roadmap and the new Code of Civil Procedure. Moreover, despite the challenges in addressing the
backlog court cases, an additional 17,000 enforcement cases have been cleared, bringing down the
total number by about 113,000 enforcement cases since November 2011. We have adopted a
decree law for a set of urgent measures designed to combat the court case backlog. The interagency task forces have set quarterly targets for reviewing enforcement cases to be closed by midFebruary 2013. To this end, we have further stepped up our efforts by expanding the task forces to
small claims court cases in specific courts. Finally, and in order to relieve civil courts from mandatory
intervention to determine bad debt status for VAT purposes, a comprehensive reform of the VAT
rules applicable to bad debts was approved in Parliament.

ATTACHMENT II. PORTUGAL: TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF
UNDERSTANDING
December 19, 2012

1.
This Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) sets out the understandings regarding
the definitions of the indicators subject to quantitative targets (performance criteria and indicative
targets), specified in the tables annexed to the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies. It
also describes the methods to be used in assessing the Program performance and the information
requirements to ensure adequate monitoring of the targets. We will consult with the EC, the ECB,
and the IMF before modifying measures contained in this letter or adopting new measures that
would deviate from the goals of the Program, and provide the EC, the ECB, and the IMF with the
necessary information for Program monitoring.
2.
For Program purposes, all foreign currency-related assets, liabilities, and flows will be
evaluated at “Program exchange rates” as defined below, with the exception of the items affecting
government fiscal balances, which will be measured at spot exchange rate (i.e., the rate for
immediate delivery) prevailing on the date of the transaction. The Program exchange rates are those
that prevailed on May 5, 2011. In particular, the exchange rates for the purposes of the Program are
set €1 = 1.483 U.S. dollar, €1 = 116.8390 Japanese yen, €1.09512 = 1 SDR.
3.
For reporting purposes, the MoF and BdP will employ the reporting standards and templates
considered to be appropriate given the transmission of data covered by this TMU, unless otherwise
stated or agreed with the EC, the ECB and the IMF.
General Government
4.
Definition. For the purposes of the Program, the General Government, as defined in the
Budget Framework Law, Law No. 91/2001 of August 20, amended by Law 22/2011 of May 20,
includes:


Central Administration, including the agencies and services that are not administratively
and financially autonomous, agencies and services that are administratively and
financially autonomous (Serviços e Fundos Autónomos – SFA).



4.1.2. Other entities, including Incorporated State-owned enterprises (ISOE), or extrabudgetary funds (EBF) not part of the State Budget, but which are, under the European

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PORTUGAL



4.2. Regional and Local Governments, that include:


4.2.1. Regional Governments of Madeira and Azores and Local Governments
(Administrações Regionais and Locais);



4.2.2. Regional and local government-owned enterprises or companies, foundations,
cooperatives and other agencies and institutions, which are, under the ESA95 and ESA95
Manual on Government Deficit and Debt rules, classified by the INE as Local
Government.



4.3. Social Security Funds comprising all funds that are established in the general social
security system.



This definition of General Government also includes any new funds, or other special
budgetary and extra budgetary programs or entities that may be created during the
Program period to carry out operations of a fiscal nature and which are, under the ESA95
and ESA95 Manual on Government Deficit and Debt rules, classified by the INE in the
correspondent subsector. The MoF will inform the EC, ECB, and IMF of the creation of any
such new funds, programs, entities or operations at the time of its creation or statistical reclassification or, in the case of Regional and Local Governments, at the time the Government
acknowledges its creation.



The General Government, as measured for purposes of Program monitoring in 2012, shall
not include entities nor operations (including pension funds) that are re-classified into the
General Government during 2012, but shall include those reclassified in 2011.1

5.

Supporting Material


5.1. Data on cash balances of the State Budget will be provided to the EC, the ECB and the
IMF by the MoF within three weeks after the end of the month. Data will include detailed
information on revenue and expenditure items, in line with monthly reports that are
published by the MoF.



5.2. Data on the cash balances of the other parts of General Government as defined in
paragraph 42 will be provided to the EC, the ECB and the IMF by the MoF within seven weeks

1

An operation refers to part of a legal entity that is involved in the production or delivery of goods and
services—including government services provided on a nonmarket basis. As such, it does not include
transactions relating to the assets or liabilities of an entity. For example, should an entity handle a number of
PPPs, reclassifying only one PPP would be considered as reclassifying an operation. In contrast, taking over part
of an entity’s debt by the government would not qualify for the exclusion. On this issue, see also paragraph 13.
2

In 2011, data exclude regional and local government-owned enterprises or companies, foundations,
cooperatives and other agencies and institutions, which are, under the ESA95 and ESA95 Manual on
Government Deficit and Debt rules, classified by the INE as Local Government, i.e., entities referred in paragraph

4.2.2.

debt issuance (securities), change in the domestic and foreign currency assets and liabilities
of the Central Government at the BdP and other financial institutions will be provided to the
EC, the ECB, and the IMF by the BdP within 40 days after the closing of each month.



5.4. BdP will provide to the EC, the ECB, and the IMF detailed monthly data on the financing
of the General Government, as defined in ESA95, within seven weeks after the closing of
each month.

de Portugal and Parpública (outside the perimeter) will also be provided.

QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA, INDICATIVE CEILINGS, AND
CONTINUOUS PERFORMANCE CRITERIA: DEFINITIONS AND
REPORTING STANDARDS
A. Floor on the Consolidated General Government Cash Balance
(Performance Criterion)
6.
Definition. The consolidated General Government cash balance (CGGCB) is defined as the
sum of the cash balances of the entities covered by the State Budget, the ISOE, the Regional and
Local Governments, and the Social Security Funds, and other entities and EBFs, as defined in
paragraph 4. Privatization receipts will be excluded from cash receipts. In 2012 and beyond,
revenues from the reclassification of pension funds into the general government will not be
accounted for as cash revenues for the purpose of the calculation of the consolidated general
government cash balance. In 2012-13, the cash proceeds from the sale of the ANA airport
concession will be accounted for as cash expenditure-reducing transactions. The net acquisition of
financial assets for policy purposes, including loans and equity participation will be recorded as cash
expenditures, except for transactions related to the banking sector support and restructuring
strategy under the Program. Called guarantees (excluding those related to the banking sector
support and restructuring strategy), where entities of the General Government make cash payments
on behalf of entities that are not part of the General Government, will be recorded as cash
expenditures.

36

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PORTUGAL

6.1. The Cash Balance of the State Budget. The cash balance of the State Budget will be
measured from above the line, based on budget revenues (recurrent revenue plus nonrecurrent
revenue, including EU revenues, minus tax refunds) minus budget expenditures of the State
Budget as published monthly on the official website of the DGO of the MoF, and in line with the
corresponding line items established in the State Budget. Budget expenditures will exclude
amortization payments but include salaries and other payments to staff and pensions; grants to
Social Security Funds, medical care and social protection; operational and other expenditure,
interest payments; cash payments for military equipment procurement; and EU expenses.
6.2. The Cash Balance of the Regional and Local Governments, Social Security Funds, ISOE
and Other Entities or EBFs. The cash balance of each of these parts of the General Government
will be measured from above the line, based on revenues minus expenditures as it will be
provided by the DGO of the MoF in the monthly General Government budget execution report
(see Para 5), and in line with the corresponding line items established in their respective
budgets. All entities including ISOE that prepare accrual-based financial statements will submit
monthly cash flow statement in accordance with form and content specified by the MoF. The
reporting by Local Government will be phased as set out in paragraph 8 below.
6.3. Adjustor. The 2012 and 2013 quarterly floors on the consolidated general government cash
balance will be adjusted for the cumulative amount of arrears settled in the context of the
arrears clearance strategy: (i) health sector arrears (up to €1.95 billion), and (ii) local government
arrears settled through the €1 billion credit facility created in May 2012. The targets will also be
adjusted for the clearance of other arrears provided an agreement to this effect was reached
with IMF staff.
Other Provisions
7.
For the purpose of the program, the expenditure of the central government that is
monitored excludes payments related to bank support, when carried out under the program’s
banking sector and restructuring strategy. However, any financial operation by central government
to support banks, including the issuance of guarantees or provision of liquidity, will be immediately
reported to the EC, ECB, and IMF.
8.
Quarterly consolidated accounts for the General Government on a cash basis will be
reported for internal, EC, ECB, and IMF monitoring 7 weeks after the reference period, starting with
the first quarter of 2012. The reports will be published externally starting with December 2011 data.
SOEs will be consolidated with the general government accounts starting with the first quarter 2012.
The larger municipalities (defined as those with a population of 100,000 voters or more) are required
to provide monthly reports under current arrangements, and their cash balance will be included in
the calculation of the monthly cash General Government balance. The cash balance of the smaller
municipalities, i.e. those with a population of under 100,000 voters, will be excluded until any
necessary legal changes requiring them to provide monthly reports have been put in place. In this
transitory period, the MoF will provide a monthly estimate of the cash balance of these smaller
municipalities excluded from the General Government reports to the EC, the ECB, and the IMF.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

37

PORTUGAL

9.

Supporting Material
9.1. Data on cash balances of the State Government, ISOEs, Regional and Local Government and
Social Security Funds will be provided to the EC, the ECB and the IMF by the MoF within seven
weeks after the end of each month. The information provided will include general government
net acquisitions of financial assets for policy purposes, including loans and equity participations,
as well as called guarantees where entities that are part of the General Government make cash
payments on behalf of entities that are not part of the General Government.
9.2. The MoF will submit quarterly data on General Government accounts determined by the INE
in accordance with ESA 95 rules, showing also the main items of the transition from cash
balances to the General Government balances in national accounts. The reconciliation will be
accompanied by necessary explanatory materials for any indication of potential deviation of the
annual general government cash target from the annual general government accrual target
determined in accordance with ESA 95 rules.

B. Non-Accumulation of New Domestic Arrears by the General
Government (Continuous Indicative Target)
10.
Definitions. Commitment, liabilities, payables/creditors, and arrears can arise in respect of
all types of expenditure. These include employment costs, utilities, transfer payments, interest,
goods and services and capital expenditure. Commitments are explicit or implicit agreements to
make payment(s) to another party in exchange for that party supplying goods and services or
fulfilling other conditions. Commitments can be for specific goods and services and arise when a
formal action is taken by a government agency, e.g., issuance of a purchase order or signing a
contract. Commitment can also be of a continuing nature that require a series of payments over an
indeterminate period of time and may or may not involve a contract, e.g. salaries, utilities, and
entitlement payments. Liabilities are present obligations of the entity arising from past events, the
settlement of which is expected to result in an outflow from the entity of resources (usually cash)
embodying economic benefits or service potential. In relation to commitment, the liability arises
when a third party satisfies the terms of the contract or similar arrangement. Payables/creditors are
a subset of liabilities. For the purposes of the program payables/creditors exclude provisions,
accrued liabilities. Arrears are a subset of payables/creditors. For the purposes of the Program
domestic arrears are defined as payables/creditors (including foreigner commercial creditors), that
have remained unpaid for 90 days or more beyond any specified due date (regardless of any
contractual grace period). In case no due date is specified, arrears are defined as payables/creditors
that have remained unpaid for 90 days or more after the date of the invoice or contract. Data on
arrears will be provided within seven weeks after the end of each month. The continuous indicative
target of non-accumulation of new domestic arrears requires that the total arrears at the end of any
month are not greater than the corresponding total at the end of the previous month—based on
the same perimeter with respect to the entities covered. This also includes arrears that are being
accumulated by the SOEs not included in the General Government.

38

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PORTUGAL

11.
Supporting Material. The stock of arrears will be measured through a survey. Reports on
the stock of arrears of the General Government are being published monthly. The MoF will provide
consistent data on monthly expenditure arrears of the General Government, as defined above. Data
will be provided within seven weeks after the end of each month and will include total arrears
classified by the different constituent sectors of the General Government sub-sector as defined in
paragraph 4, as well as the monthly amounts of (i) health sector arrears settled with the banks’
pension funds transfers’ resources, and (ii) local government arrears settled through the €1 billion
credit facility created in May 2012.
12.
Adjustor. The monthly change in the stock of arrears will be adjusted for any stock
adjustment related to the arrears clearance strategy: (i) health sector arrears, as well as local
government arrears settled through the €1 billion credit facility created in May 2012. This will allow
monitoring the underlying flow of new arrears.

C. Ceiling on the Overall Stock of General Government Debt (Performance
Criterion)
13.
Definition. The overall stock of General Government debt will refer to the definition
established by Council Regulation (EC) No 479/2009 of 25 May 2009 on the application of the
Protocol on the Excessive Deficit Procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European
Community. For the purposes of the Program, the stock of General Government debt will exclude:
(i) debt contracted for bank restructuring, when carried out under the Program’s banking sector
support and restructuring strategy; (ii) IGCP deposits; and (iii) (from end-September 2011) the
‘prepaid margin’ on all EFSF loans.
14.
Adjusters. For 2012, the ceiling of the overall stock of General Government debt will be
adjusted upward (downward) by the amount of any upward (downward) revision to the stock at
end-December 2011 general government debt of EUR183.33 billion. From 2013 onwards, the ceiling
of the overall stock of General Government debt will be adjusted upward (downward) by the
amount of any upward (downward) reclassification of entities or operations that affects the stock at
end-December of the previous year.
15.
Supporting Material. Quarterly data on the total stock of General Government debt as
defined in paragraph 12 will be provided to the EC, ECB and IMF by the BdP no later than 90 days
after the end of each quarter, as reported to the ECB and the Eurostat. Monthly estimates will be
provided to the EC, ECB and IMF by BdP no later than seven weeks after the end of each month.

D. Non-Accumulation of New External Debt Payments Arrears by the
General Government (Continuous Performance Criterion)
16.
Definition. For the purposes of the Program, the definition of debt is the same as in
paragraph 12. An external debt payment arrear will be defined as a payment on debt to
nonresidents, contracted or guaranteed by the general government, which has not been made

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

39

PORTUGAL

within seven days after falling due (taking into account any applicable contractual grace period). The
performance criterion will apply on a continuous basis throughout the Program period.
17.
Supporting Material. Any external debt payment arrears of the General Government will be
immediately reported by the MoF.

E. Bank Solvency Support Facility
18.
The dedicated Bank Solvency Support Facility (BSSF) account will be maintained at the Bank
of Portugal. As per previous review, resources for the BSSF will be agreed at each review and
deposited in the dedicated account.

F. Overall Monitoring and Reporting Requirements
19.
Performance under the Program will be monitored from data supplied to the EC, the ECB,
and the IMF by the MoF and BdP. The authorities will transmit to the EC, ECB, and IMF any data
revisions in a timely manner.

APPENDIX II. PORTUGAL: LETTER OF INTENT TO THE
EUROPEAN COMMISSION AND THE EUROPEAN
CENTRAL BANK
Lisbon, 20 December 2012
Mr Jean-Claude Juncker
President
Eurogroup
Mr Vassos Shiarly
Minister of Finance
Cyprus
Mr Olli Rehn
Vice President
European Commission
Mr Mario Draghi
President
European Central Bank
Dear Sirs,
The attached Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) describes the progress made in recent months
towards the objectives laid out in our Programme. It also updates previous MoUs and highlights the
policy steps to be taken in the months ahead.
We remain strongly committed to the programme’s policies and objectives and expect the agreed
5 percent deficit target for 2012 to be achieved. The 2013 budget was approved by the Parliament,
including a range of tax and spending measures that should ensure that the general government
deficit of 4½ percent of GDP will be achieved next year. To advance with the additional fiscal
adjustment that is required in coming years, we have initiated a comprehensive public expenditure
review exercise to be completed early in 2013.
Consistent with our commitment to implement a multi-year strategic plan to strengthen fiscal
discipline, we are intensifying our efforts to prevent the increase in the stock of existing domestic
arrears. We are reforming the SOE sector, which has been brought to overall operational balance, as
per our commitment, after many years of chronic deficits. We will continue this restructuring effort
and actively manage their high legacy debt burden. Moreover, the privatisation is proceeding as
scheduled and we are advancing our strategy to put the PPPs on a sustainable financial path.
Our policy efforts to preserve financial stability will continue, as banks are on track to meet the 2012
capital requirements, following the recent capital exercise. Banco de Portugal (BdP) continues on its
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PORTUGAL

supervisory effort to ensure adequate impairment levels, as evidenced by the successful completion
of the latest on-site inspection. In addition, the recapitalisation and resolution framework will be
further strengthened. The Portuguese authorities are preparing a proposal for the setting-up of a
mechanism to securitise high-quality mortgage credit with a supranational guarantee. Moreover, we
are exploring a new proposal to rationalise and redirect to the most productive segments of the
economy existing government initiatives, including the setting up of a revolving mechanism to
leverage EU structural funds. Finally, we will also continue consultations with the European
Commission on the rate of remuneration of financial instruments used for recapitalisation purposes.
In pursuing this route, we are motivated by concerns on local funding and lending conditions.
We have made important advances in many dimensions of our ambitious structural reform agenda,
and will continue to press ahead with measures to improve the business environment and help spur
investment. Measures to actively promote employment and improve education are being expanded.
With the completion of the reduction of severance payments, to be soon submitted to the
Parliament, we will have reduced the rigidity of labour contracts substantially. A landmark revision of
the Ports Work Law in discussion in the Parliament will increase efficiencies and help reduce costs
for exporters. Going forward, we will continue to pursue a streamlined and more effective licensing
and regulatory framework along with a reform in corporate taxation, as part of our strategy to
attract more investment and boost competitiveness.
On the basis of the strength of the policies defined in this letter, and in light of our performance
under the Programme, we request the completion of the sixth review under the Economic
Adjustment Programme and the release of the seventh instalment under the Programme in the
amount of EUR 1 600 million.
We remain confident that the policies described in the current and previous MoUs are adequate to
achieve the objectives under the Programme. We stand ready to take additional measures should
they be needed to meet the objectives of the Economic Adjustment Programme and will consult
with the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF in advance of any necessary revisions to the
policies contained in this letter and attached Memorandum.
This letter is copied to Ms Christine Lagarde.
Sincerely yours,
/s/

Minister of State and Finance

ATTACHEMENT I. MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING ON
SPECIFIC ECONOMIC POLICY CONDITIONALITY
Sixth Update – 20 December 2012
With regard to Council Regulation (EU) n° 407/2010 of 11 May 2010 establishing a European
Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM), and in particular Article 3(5) thereof, the sixth update of
the Memorandum of Understanding on specific economic policy conditionality (MoU) details the
general economic policy conditions as embedded in Council Implementing Decision 2011/344/EU of
17 May 2011 on granting Union financial assistance to Portugal.1
The first disbursement of financial assistance from the EFSM took place following the entry into
force of the MoU and of the Loan Agreement.
The Council Implementing Decision specifies that the release of further instalments is conditional on
a positive conclusion of the reviews of conditionality that will take place throughout the three-year
duration of the programme. These reviews will assess progress made with respect to the policy
criteria in the Council Implementing Decision and specified in the Memorandum of Economic and
Financial Policies (MEFP) and in this updated MoU, as well as Council Recommendations in the
context of the Excessive Deficit Procedure.
The sixth quarterly review was carried out in November 2012. It assessed compliance with the
conditions to be met by end-October and the need and scope for additional policy steps. This sixth
update of the MoU reflects the findings of the sixth review. The following reviews taking place in any
given quarter will assess compliance with the conditions to be met by the end of the previous
quarter or, where applicable, up to date of the mission.
If targets are missed or expected to be missed, additional action will be taken. The authorities
commit to consult with the European Commission (EC), the European Central Bank (ECB) and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the adoption of policies falling within the scope of this
updated Memorandum, allowing sufficient time for review. Staff of the EC, the ECB and the IMF will,
in cooperation with the Portuguese authorities, monitor and assess progress in the implementation
of the programme and track the economic and financial situation. Staff will also monitor whether the
implementation and effects of measures taken by the Portuguese authorities fall short of the
commitments of previous versions of the MoU; such commitments might be re-inserted. To this
effect the authorities commit to provide all required information as soon as available. In areas where
there are risks of significant delays in the implementation of policies under this programme the
authorities in cooperation with the EC, the ECB and the IMF consider making use of technical
assistance.
Prior to the release of the instalments, the authorities shall provide a compliance report on the
fulfilment of the conditionality.
On 8 April 2011, Eurogroup and ECOFIN Ministers issued a statement clarifying that financial support of the
EU (European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, EFSM) and the euro-area (European Financial Stability Facility,
EFSF) would be provided on the basis of a policy programme supported by strict conditionality and negotiated
with the Portuguese authorities, duly involving the main political parties, by the Commission in liaison with the
ECB, and the IMF. Further to the EU support from the EFSM, loans from the EFSF will contribute to the financial
assistance. The Loan Facility Agreement on the EFSF financing contribution specifies that the disbursements
thereunder are subject to the compliance with the conditions of this Memorandum.

1. Fiscal policy
Objectives
Reduce the Government deficit to 5% of GDP in 2012, 4½ % of GDP in 2013 and 2½ % of GDP in
2014 by means of high-quality permanent measures and minimising the impact of consolidation on
vulnerable groups. The fiscal consolidation over the medium-term up to a balanced budgetary
position will be maintained, notably by containing expenditure growth. Growth-friendly tax policy
will be pursued through, among others, a comprehensive reform of corporate taxation to promote
investment and competitiveness.
Fiscal policy in 2012
1.1. The government will achieve a general government deficit of no more than EUR 8.3 billion (5
percent of GDP) in 2012 on ESA95 basis.2 [Q4-2012]
1.2. Throughout the year, the government will rigorously implement the Budget Law for 2012, as
amended by the Supplementary Budget. In addition, the government has adopted measures to
confine the deficit to 5% of GDP in 2012 by freezing budget appropriations for investment projects
not yet initiated, generating savings in intermediate consumption and raising stamp duties on high
value properties and withholding tax rates on capital income. Within the year, progress will be
assessed against the (cumulative) quarterly ceilings for the consolidated general government cash
balance in the MEFP, as defined in the TMU, without prejudice to full-year ESA-95 deficit targets.
[Q4-2012]
1.3. The authorities will frontload to 2012 some of the 2013 budget measures affecting social
benefits to obtain savings worth at least 0.1% of GDP. These include, inter alia, cuts in
reimbursements of funeral expenses, transfers in case of death, and dependency supplements.
Fiscal policy in 2013
1.4. The government will achieve a general government deficit target of no more than EUR 7.5 billion
(4½ percent of GDP). [Q4-2013]
1.5. Throughout the year, the government will rigorously implement the Budget Law for 2013.
Progress will be assessed against the (cumulative) quarterly ceilings for the consolidated general
government cash balance in the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP), as
defined in the Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU), without prejudice to full-year ESA95 deficit targets. [Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4-2013]

2

In 2012, operations related to the banking sector support and restructuring strategy under the programme
will not be considered for the assessment of compliance with the programme target for the general
government deficit.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PORTUGAL

1.6. Permanent consolidation measures of slightly above 3% of GDP have been proposed with the
2013 Budget Law to reach the 4 ½ % of GDP deficit target in 2013. The measures listed below will
be detailed and carried out with the 2013 Budget Law [Q4-2012], unless otherwise specified:

curbing some fiscal benefits.

Increase corporate tax revenues by at least EUR 200 million by:
i.

limiting the deductibility of interest costs;

ii.

curbing tax benefits;

iii.

reducing the threshold for application of the highest tax rate on profits;

iv.

amending the method for special prepayment applicable to companies under the
regime for taxation of groups of companies.

Increase other indirect taxes (by at least EUR 685 million), such as:
i. excises by raising taxes on tobacco, alcohol and natural gas;
ii. property taxes by broadening the property taxation base after revaluation, and stamp
tax surcharges for high-value properties;
iii. financial transaction tax.

1.17.
Maintain the standstill rule for tax expenditures at central, regional or local level, except for
the possibility of introducing additional tax benefits aimed at boosting investment.
1.18. Increase social contributions (at least EUR 270 million), by including supplementary
payments to public employees and unemployment benefits in the social contributions' calculations.
1.19. Strengthen efforts to fight tax evasion, fraud and informality for various types of taxes inter
alia by increasing means available for audits, increasing penalties for the most serious tax crimes and
introducing a new VAT invoicing system.
1.20. With a view to addressing risks of budgetary execution in 2013 the authorities will prepare
contingency measures worth at least ½ percent of GDP. Most of these will come from a frontloading
of the measures of the comprehensive expenditure review and will be further specified at the
seventh review. A significant share of these measures will consist in additional reductions in the
wage bill and increased efficiency in the functioning of public administration, namely as regards
working time organisation. Moreover, budgetary appropriations will be adjusted in case budgetary
execution risks materialise.
Fiscal policy in 2014
1.21. The government will achieve a general government deficit of no more than EUR 4.3 billion
(2½ percent of GDP) in 2014. [Q4-2014].
1.22. A comprehensive expenditure review has been initiated with the objective to enhance the
efficiency and equity of public policy, while generating spending savings of about EUR 4 billion in
2014. In the framework of this review, the identification, quantification and timetable of
implementation of measures will be fully specified by mid-February 2013 in time for the seventh
review. The exercise will aim at reducing redundancies across the public sector functions and
entities, and reallocating resources toward growth-friendly spending areas. [Q1-2013] The fiscal
consolidation plans for 2014-15 will be fully detailed in the 2013 Stability Programme. [Q2-2013]

1.23. Within the year, progress will be assessed against the (cumulative) quarterly ceilings for the
consolidated general government cash balance in the Memorandum of Economic and Financial
Policies (MEFP), as defined in the Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU), without
prejudice to full-year ESA-95 deficit targets. [Q1 and Q2-2014]
2. Financial sector regulation and supervision
Preserve financial sector stability; maintain liquidity and support a balanced and orderly
deleveraging in the banking sector; ensure adequate financing and working capital for the
productive sectors; strengthen banking regulation and supervision; develop and implement
solutions that provide financing alternatives to traditional bank credit for the corporate sector;
optimise the process for recovering the assets transferred from BPN to the three state-owned SPVs;
streamline state-owned Caixa Geral de Depósitos; complete the bank resolution framework and
reinforce the Deposit Guarantee Fund and the Guarantee Fund for Mutual Agricultural Credit
Institutions; complete the corporate and household insolvency frameworks and smoothen their
implementation.
Maintaining liquidity in the banking sector
2.1.
Encourage banks to strengthen their collateral buffers on a sustainable basis and to take
full advantage of the broadening of the range of eligible collateral for the purpose of Eurosystem refinancing. The Banco de Portugal (BdP), in close cooperation with the ECB, will continue to monitor
closely the liquidity situation of the banking system and stands ready to take the appropriate
measures to maintain sufficient system liquidity. [Ongoing] A new platform for interbank unsecured
lending has been put in place and the BdP is expected to extend it to secured interbank lending by
the beginning of next year.
Deleveraging in the banking sector
2.2.
The banking system should in the medium run eliminate its funding imbalances. Monitor
the banks' implementation of the funding plans aiming at an indicative loan-to-deposit ratio of
about 120% in 2014. It is important that the pace and composition of deleveraging should not
jeopardise the provision of appropriate credit to finance productive investment and working capital
in the private sectors of the economy, not least SMEs. Fiscal adjustment and an attendant reduction
in the public sector’s financing are crucial for reconciling potentially conflicting objectives. In
addition, the BdP will implement the measures taken to discourage evergreening of doubtful loans
with a view to facilitating an effective adjustment of bank balance sheets respecting EU state aid
rules. In this context, banks are identifying and reporting recently restructured loans due to debtors’
financial difficulties and the first report by the BdP is expected by end-November 2012. These steps
will be taken without burdening or posing risks to public resources. Banks' funding and capital plans
and broader credit developments will continue to be monitored closely. There is room for the
necessary deleveraging to take place in an orderly manner and it is crucial that the pace and
composition of the deleveraging remain consistent with the macroeconomic framework of the
programme. [Ongoing]

PORTUGAL

Capital buffers
2.3.
Ensure that the programme target of a Core Tier 1 ratio of 10% by end-2012 target is
reached including through the monitoring of the restructuring plans banks having received public
capital support were requested to draw up, aiming at enhancing the banks' resilience.
2.4.
BdP is closely monitoring compliance with the capital requirements for all banks, with a
view to promptly take appropriate action if needed. [Ongoing]
2.5.
Remain committed to provide further support to the banking system, if needed. Resources
from the Bank Solvency Support Facility (BSSF) are available in line with state aid rules to further
support viable banks, subject to strict conditionality. Avoid subsidizing private shareholders and
prevent further migration of private liabilities to the public sector balance sheet. In the event new
capital needs were to arise, banks are encouraged to seek private solutions. [Ongoing]
Caixa Geral de Depósitos (CGD)
2.6.

Continue to streamline the state-owned CGD group.

Banking regulation and supervision
2.7.
The BdP will continue to strengthen its supervisory organisation, optimise its supervisory
processes and develop and implement new supervisory methodologies and tools. The field work of
a new onsite inspections program (OIP) launched in May 2012 by the BdP has been completed in
the major banking groups. The OIP findings are expected to be reflected in 2012 annual accounts of
these institutions. This initiative is part of BdP regular supervisory activities, which are currently
focused on assets classes that are more sensitive to existing market conditions.
2.8.
In addition, the BdP is stepping up the monitoring of banks, including via ad hoc audits.
[Ongoing]
2.9.
BdP will remain committed to close coordination with home and host country supervisors,
both within and outside the EU. [Ongoing]
Monitoring of bank solvency
2.10.
The BdP will continue to monitor on a quarterly basis the banks’ potential capital needs
with a forward looking approach under stress conditions. In this context, banks will reflect the OIP
findings in the implementation of the SIP recommendations on asset quality and stress testing
methodologies by end-December 2012, with the update of the treatment of collective impairments
expected to be finalized at the latest by end-June 2013.
Banco Português de Negócios
2.11.
Gradually settle CGD’s state guaranteed claim on the SPVs in cash, according to the
schedule agreed with the EC, ECB and IMF. Any recoveries on the assets held by the three stateowned SPVs will also be used to promptly repay CGD. [Ongoing]
2.12.
Outsource the management of the credits currently held by Parvalorem to a professional
third party, with a mandate to gradually recover the assets over time. Select the party managing the
credits through a competitive bidding process, to be launched by end-2012, at the latest, and with

48

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PORTUGAL

a view to complete it by mid-2013. Include proper incentives to maximise the recoveries and
minimise operational costs into the mandate. Ensure timely disposal of the subsidiaries and the
assets in the other two state-owned SPVs.
Bank resolution framework
2.13.
The early intervention, resolution and deposit guarantee framework has been
strengthened. The authorities are asked to conclude the implementing measures, In particular, the
following actions will be taken: (a) the approval of a decree-law on the banks' contributions to the
resolution fund by end-2012 and (b) the approval of a supervisory notice on the resolution plans by
the same date, taking into account, to the extent possible in view of the deadline, the EBA
recommendations and templates. The implementation of the recovery and resolution plans of the
banks will give priority to those of systemic importance.
2.14.
The legislator will closely follow the process of adoption of the EU Directive on resolution
and revise the national resolution framework as soon as the Directive enters into force. [Ongoing]
Bank recapitalisation framework
2.15.
The Government will, in consultation with the ECB, and the EC and the IMF staff, submit to
Parliament by [end-January 2013]3 amendments to the legal framework governing access to public
capital to allow the State, under strict circumstances and in accordance with state aid rules, to
exercise control over an institution and to perform mandatory recapitalisations.
Corporate and household debt restructuring framework
2.16.
Implement the recently established framework for financial institutions to engage in outof-court debt restructuring for households, smoothen the application of the framework for
restructuring of corporate debt and implement an action plan to raise public awareness of the
restructuring tools. [Ongoing]
Monitoring of corporate and household indebtedness
2.17.
Continue the monitoring of the high indebtedness of the corporate and household sectors
through the quarterly reports. [Ongoing]
Encouraging the diversification of financing alternatives to the corporate sector
2.18.
The Ministry of Finance, the BdP, and other stakeholders, have put forward a set of
preliminary proposals to encourage the diversification of financing alternatives to the corporate
sector4.
i. Develop and evaluate the different options put forward with a view to set priorities
[Ongoing] and submit a detailed assessment on the proposal concerning the grouped
issuance of corporate debt, in particular of SMEs, to obtain capital markets financing [endJanuary].

credit insurance schemes with a view to take appropriate measures to promote exports [Q12013].

3. Fiscal-structural measures
Objectives
Improve the efficiency of the public administration by eliminating redundancies, simplifying
procedures and reorganising services; regulate the creation and functioning of all public entities
including SOEs, PPPs, foundations, associations; re-focus their activities to core public policy
objectives and enhance their cost efficiency and fiscal sustainability; streamline the budgetary
process, including by adopting new financing laws at regional and local level; strengthen risk
management, accountability, reporting and monitoring of all parts of the general government.
Government action will build on the recommendations provided by the IMF/EU technical assistance
missions.
Public Financial Management framework
Reporting and Monitoring
3.1.
Publish a comprehensive report on fiscal risks each year as part of the budget. The report
will outline general fiscal risks and specific contingent liabilities to which the general government
may be exposed, including those arising from Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs), SOEs and explicit
guarantees to the banks. Technical assistance will be provided if necessary.
3.2.
Publish a tax expenditure report each year as part of the budget. The report will define a
clear methodology to estimate and to evaluate tax expenditures, in line with international best
practices. The report will cover central, regional and local administrations.
3.3.
Reduce the number of Serviços e Fundos Autónomos (SFA) in view of reducing budget
fragmentation and improving efficiency in the general government. In particular, this reform will be
deepened by reviewing the classification of own revenues to enlarge central government revenues.
[Q3-2013]
Arrears
3.4.
The stock of domestic arrears will be significantly reduced by the end of the programme
period. A significant part of the existing arrears was reduced as laid down in the strategy for the
settlement of arrears. The Inspeção Geral de Finanças (IGF) will carry out inspections throughout the
process to verify compliance of the commitment control system through a risk-based approach.
[Ongoing]
3.5.
IGF will reinforce the verification of local governments' arrears claims and commitment
control systems. Disbursements under the "Programa de Apoio à Economia Local" (PAEL) will only
take place where IGF has certified the full functioning of the commitment control system.
Transparency of the use of the credit line will be ensured through the monthly publication of the

50

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PORTUGAL

amounts lent, disbursed, and used to settle arrears and other liabilities by municipality in the
framework of the PAEL. [Ongoing]
Budgetary framework
3.6.
Publish a fiscal strategy document for the general government annually in April. The
document will be in compliance with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact and will
specify 4-year medium-term economic and fiscal forecasts and 4-year costs of new policy decisions.
Budgets will include a reconciliation of revisions to the 4 year fiscal forecasts attributable to policy
decisions and parameter revisions e.g. policy decisions, changes in the macroeconomic environment.
3.7.
Review the Budget Framework Law to take account of the reinforced EU fiscal framework
and the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union
(fiscal compact). The revised law will also accommodate the developments in the regional and local
financing laws. [Q4-2012] Conduct a review of the Budget Framework law to enhance budgetary
procedures and principles of budgetary management, reinforce accountability, transparency and
simplification. [Q4-2013]
3.8.
Define in detail the characteristics of the medium-term budgetary framework, including
medium-term fiscal strategy, decision-making and prioritisation process, carry-over rules,
commitment controls, and appropriate contingency reserves and related access rules after
modification of the Budget Framework Law. [April-2013]
Regional and local budgetary frameworks
3.9.
The government will ensure that the measures to implement the new budgetary framework
at central government level will also be applied at regional and local level. Adequate structures of
monitoring, fiscal reporting, and commitment control will be put into place. [Ongoing]
3.10.
The budgetary frameworks at local and regional levels will be considerably strengthened, in
line with recommendations by the IMF/EC technical assistance mission of July 2011 and the new EU
fiscal policy framework. A draft proposal to revise the regional finance law and the local finance law
will be submitted to Parliament by [Q4-2012]5. They will include the following main elements:
i.

5

fully adapt the local and regional budgetary frameworks to the principles and rules in
the revised Budgetary Framework Law, namely in what concerns (i) the inclusion of all
relevant public entities in the perimeter of local and regional government; (ii) the
multi-annual framework with expenditure, budget balance and indebtedness rules,
and programme budgeting; and (iii) the interaction with the function of the Fiscal
Council. The revision will also foresee that: (i) the Fiscal Council reviews regional
governments own revenue projections and multi-annual fiscal plans (ii) a contingency
reserve is included under the overall current expenditure envelope as a buffer against
negative revenue surprises or erroneous expenditure planning, and (iii) the revised
legal and institutional PPP framework is applied (see below);

Structural benchmark in the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 51

PORTUGAL

ii.

strengthen fiscal accountability, in particular by: (i) tighter financial requirements for
regional and local SOEs and other regional and local public bodies; (ii) a revision of the
regime of transfers between the State and the regions and the local authorities; (iii)
strengthening the supervisory power from the State on budgetary execution and (iv)
apply tighter debt ceilings combined with the adoption of a multi-tiered monitoring
system as suggested by the July 2011 technical assistance mission. This reform should
follow international best practices;

iii.

limit the scope for lower tax rates in the Autonomous Regions vis-à-vis the rates
applied in the mainland and ensure that the resulting additional revenues from
increasing the regional rates are used as a priority for fiscal consolidation.

iv.

Strengthen the auditing and enforcement powers of the central tax administration to
exercise control over the whole territory of the Republic of Portugal including currently
exempt tax regimes.

v.

Include requirements for data provision to support the revenue projections, balancing
the need to preserve tax secrecy and the elaboration of sound forecasts.

3.11.
Create a working group with representatives from the Ministry of Finance, the Autonomous
Regions and the local authorities to prepare a proposal for common revenue forecasting guidelines
for subnational governments. [Q2-2013]
3.12.
The Government's financial arrangement with the Autonomous Region of Madeira (RAM),
which is in full compliance with the Memorandum of Understanding, will be implemented. The
Portuguese Government will monitor progress of implementation by RAM and present the results
on a quarterly basis in advance of the reviews of the Memorandum of Understanding [Ongoing].
Public Private Partnerships
3.13.
Following the strategic plan presented by the government, PPP road contracts will be
renegotiated in order to obtain substantial fiscal gains, notably in 2013, while ensuring a sustainable
reduction in government liabilities. [Ongoing]
3.14.
The government will further work towards implementing the PPP framework law and
making the new technical unit in the Ministry of Finance fully operational by completing staffing and
developing the tools for managing and monitoring all PPPs. No PPP will be launched until the
institutional framework measures are fully effective. [Ongoing] Regions will be encouraged to
design a similar framework for assessing fiscal risks derived from PPP, concessions and other public
investments, as well as for monitoring their execution. [Q4-2012]
3.15.
The annual PPP report will provide a comprehensive assessment of the fiscal risks stemming
from PPPs and concessions. The report will provide information and analysis at sectoral level and an
analysis of credit flows channelled to PPPs through banks (loans and securities other than shares) by
industry and an impact assessment on credit allocation and crowding out effects. This particular
element will be done in liaison with the Banco de Portugal. The report will serve as input to the fiscal
risks assessment for the budget. [Q3-2013]

State-owned enterprises
3.16.
SOEs with commercial activity will reach operational balance from end of 2012 onwards.
This will be achieved by substantially reducing operational costs and raising revenues. To this end
the government is implementing the comprehensive SOEs strategy by reviewing the revenue
structure and service provision of SOEs, with numerical targets on cost reductions, including
measures to realign wages, reduce employment, and additional measures as appropriate. The
government is further assessing options for managing the heavy debt load of SOEs, including
Parpública. [Ongoing]
3.17.
The government submitted to Parliament a draft law to strengthen the governance of SOEs
in accordance with international best practices. It reviews the existing shareholder approach, giving
the Ministry of Finance a decisive role in financial matters of the enterprises, including monitoring of
local SOEs. This will enhance the monitoring powers of the central administration over all SOEs. In
addition, the timing and content of financial and operational reporting will be defined. The decisions
adopted at central level to improve the efficiency of the enterprises while reducing their financial
burden will be implemented at all SOEs, taking into account their specificities. It will include the
prohibition for SOEs within the general government to incur new debt with the private sector. No
additional SOEs will be created until this law is adopted. [Ongoing]
3.18.
Equivalent measures on operational results, debt, restructuring and governance will be
taken at the local and regional levels, while respecting their administrative autonomy as foreseen in
the law. The annual and quarterly SOEs reports will assess progress towards achieving these
objectives for central and local SOEs. Each Autonomous Region will provide similar annual reports.
These will serve as inputs to the fiscal risks analysis in the budget. [Ongoing]
Privatisation
3.19.
The government is implementing its privatisation programme under the new framework law
for privatisation. The privatisation plan targets front-loaded proceeds of about EUR 5 billion through
the end of the programme. The sale of GALP and the small remaining stake in REN on the free
market have been delayed until market conditions improve. The privatisation or concession of the
cargo handling subsidiary of CP (CP Carga) will be concluded by the [Q2-2013]. The tenders for the
privatisation of the national air carrier (TAP) and the airport operator Aeroportos de Portugal (ANA)
were launched in the third quarter, with a view to final decisions by end-2012 and the financial
completion of these transactions in early 2013. The privatisation of Correios de Portugal (CTT) will
be launched, once changes underway in regulation of this sector have their full impact, in order to
complete the sale in 2013. The sale or concession of a television channel and radio station
belonging to RTP and concessions for transport operators in Lisbon and Porto upon completion of
restructuring of the public transport firms in these cities are being considered. CGD's health
insurance will be sold in 2012 and the process to sell its insurance arm (Caixa Seguros) to a final
buyer is ongoing. The privatisation programme will be expanded to include additional companies
and assets for sale or concession in 2013.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 53

PORTUGAL

3.20.
With a view to introducing private capital and management in the water company Águas de
Portugal (AdP), a strategy will be prepared. This strategy will include considerations of the
competitive and regulatory environment and organisational consequences. [Q4-2012]
3.21.
The government is working together with the municipalities and regional governments in
order to identify the scope for further privatisation, by preparing an inventory of their assets,
including real estate. [Q4-2012]
Revenue administration
3.22.
The Government will conclude the implementation of the undergone merger of the tax
administration, customs administration and the information technology service (DGITA) in a single
entity, Autoridade Tributária e Aduaneira (AT) by Q4-2012.
3.23.
The reform of the AT will be deepened in 2013 by targeting a business function-type
structure. In particular, the following elements will be implemented:
i.

reduce the number of municipal offices by at least 25 per cent in 2013 [Q4-2013]
and 25 per cent in 2014 [Q2-2014]];

ii.

increase in the resources devoted to auditing in the tax administration to at least 30
per cent of the total staff, mostly through reallocations of staff within the tax
administration and other parts of the public administration. The threshold should be
attained by Q4-2012;

iii.

publish quarterly reports on duration and costs of tax cases starting from Q4-2013
within four months after the end of the relevant quarter.

3.24.
To strengthen control and simplify compliance, exchange of information between the
collection units of the Tax Authority and the Social Security administration will be significantly
strengthened by means, among others, of a unified monthly tax return covering withholding
information [Q1-2013] as well as a unified form on Independent Workers' annual revenue [Q22013].
3.25.
The government will address the bottlenecks in the tax appeal system by progressing with
clearing cases worth more than EUR 1 million [Q4-2012] with the support of the tax court judges.
3.26.
Also as part of the development of a modern tax compliance management framework, a
fully-fledged Large Taxpayer Office (LTO) will be operational by [Q4-2012]6.
3.27.
With the aim of curving down fraud and evasion, a reform on the VAT invoicing system will
enter into force on 1st January 2013. The reform implies mandatory invoicing across all sectors and
transactions, a centralized VAT monitoring database, a system to electronically monitor goods in
circulation and a tax incentive for final consumers to ask for invoices in hard-to-tax sectors. An
evaluation report of the measures will be prepared [Q2-2013].

3.28.
The authorities will continue to focus on measures to combat fraud and evasion and
strengthen taxpayers' compliance. To this end the authorities will:
(i) prepare a report to analyse the current tax compliance situation, including a risk analysis
of different economic sectors and categories of taxpayers by the seventh review. Following
the results of the report, appropriate steps will be taken if necessary to reinforce tax
compliance.
(ii) continue building capacity in revenue administration by phasing in a more modern
approach to managing compliance over a three-years period.
Public administration
Central, regional and local administration
3.29.
The government will monitor and promote streamlining of foundations at the local and
regional level. [Ongoing]
3.30.
Review the regulation on the creation and the functioning of associations and observatories.
The revised regulation will also facilitate the closure of existing associations and observatories and
define the monitoring and reporting mechanisms to be put in place. [Q2-2013]
3.31.
Building on the study by the inter-ministerial working group for territorial issues, potential
duplications of activities and other inefficiencies between the central administration, local
administration and locally-based central administration services will be identified and the existing
framework to eliminate the identified inefficiencies reformed. [Q4-2012]
Shared services
3.32.
Develop the use of shared services in the central administration by fully implementing the
ongoing projects and by regularly assessing the scope for further integration:
i.

complete the implementation of the strategy of shared services in the area of
financial resources (GeRFIP). [Q1-2013] GeRFIP will also be implemented in the
Autonomous Region of Madeira and in the Autonomous Region of Azores [Q42013];

ii.

fully implement the strategy of shared services in the area of human resources
(GeRHuP) in the Ministry of Finance’s entities [Q4-2012], with the exception of the
Tax Authority for which this is scheduled for end-June 2013. Other Ministries will
follow in 2013. The Autonomous Region of Madeira will implement GeRHuP
gradually;

iii.

rationalise the use of IT resources within the central administration by implementing
shared services and reducing the number of IT entities in individual Ministries or
other public entities in line with the “Overall Strategic plan to rationalise and reduce
costs on ICT in Public Administration”. [Q4-2012]

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 55

PORTUGAL

3.33.
Reduce the number of local branches of line ministries (e.g. tax, social security, justice). The
services should be merged in citizens’ shops covering a greater geographical area and developing
further the e-administration over the duration of the programme. [Q4-2013]
Human resources
3.34.
Limit staff admissions in public administration to achieve annual decreases in 2012-2014 of
at least 2 per cent per year (in full-time equivalents) in the staff of central administration and 2 per
cent in local and regional administrations (in full-time equivalents); including a significant reduction
of fixed-term contracts. The government will ensure the implementation of this measure at local
administration level and will promote the initiatives needed so that each region will present its plan
to achieve the same target. [Ongoing]
3.35.
The government will present a comprehensive review of wage scales in the general
government, to identify unwarranted differences in remuneration between the public and the
private sector for similar types of qualifications. [Q4-2012] The comprehensive study of SOEs will
follow in Q2-2013.
3.36.
Accelerate the convergence of the system of social protection for staff that are in the
Regime de Proteção Social Convergente (RPSC) to the rules of Regime Geral de Segurança Social.
[Q4-2013]
3.37.
The Special Mobility scheme will be reviewed aiming at being more oriented to support
Public Administration Reform, addressing training and requalification for a better allocation of
Human Resources. The existing Special Mobility Law need to be revised: (i) to ease/simplify the
procedures for the management of the employees that can be targeted with this tool; (ii) to address
the compensation that would be set to decline further over time and its duration; and (iii) to be
applied to all sectors of Public Administration, including teachers and health professionals. [Q22013]
Health care system
Objectives
Improve efficiency and effectiveness in the health care system, inducing a more rational use of
services and control of expenditures; generate additional savings in the area of pharmaceuticals to
reduce the overall public spending on pharmaceutical to 1.25 percent of GDP by end 2012 and to
about 1 per cent of GDP in 2013; generate additional savings in hospital operating costs and devise
a strategy to eliminate arrears.
The government will take the following measures to reform the health system:
Financing
3.38.
The revision of NHS moderating fees (taxas moderadoras) and improvements in the billing
and collection of payments from insurance companies and fees for the treatment of crossborder/foreign patients will result in additional revenues of EUR 150 million in 2012 and an
additional 50 million in 2013. [Q4-2012]

56

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PORTUGAL

3.39.
In the light of the urgency and size of the savings needed in the health sector to address
large arrears and budget limitations, plans to achieve a self-sustainable model for health-benefits
schemes for civil servants will be accelerated. The current plan foresees that the overall budgetary
cost of existing schemes - ADSE, ADM (Armed Forces) and SAD (Police Services) - will be reduced by
50 per cent of the employers contribution in 2013 through transfer of resources to the NHS in
exchange for the provision of services by Q4-2012. The employer’s contribution rate will be reduced
to 1.25% in 2014 and will be accompanied by an adjustment in the scope of health benefits [Q32013]. The system would become self-financed by 2016.
Pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceuticals
3.40.
Enact legislation which automatically reduces the prices of medicines when their patent
expires to 50 per cent of their previous price. [Q4-2012]
3.41.
The government implements an annual revision of prices of medicines and of countries of
reference in order to achieve cost savings. Second price revision to be published in January 2013.
3.42.
The government will monitor monthly pharmaceutical expenditures and ensure that the
overall public pharmaceutical expenditure does not exceed the target of 1.25 per cent of GDP in
2012 and 1 per cent of GDP in 2013. [Ongoing]
Prescription and monitoring of prescription
3.43.
Continue to improve the monitoring and assessment system of doctors' prescription
behaviour regarding medicines and diagnostic in terms of volume and value and vis-à-vis
prescription guidelines and peers. Feedback continues to be provided to each physician on a regular
basis (e.g. quarterly), in particular on prescription of costliest and most used medicines. [Ongoing]
3.44.
Continue to devise and enforce a system of sanctions and penalties, as a complement to the
assessment framework [Ongoing]. Assess the possibility of establishing agreements with private
sector physicians for the application of prescription rules as applied in the NHS.
3.45.
Strictly monitor the implementation of the legislation making it compulsory for physicians at
all levels of the system, both public and private, to prescribe by International Non-proprietary Name
(INN) to increase the use of generic medicines and the less costly available product. An
implementation report will be published by December 2012.
3.46.
Continue to publish prescription guidelines with reference to medicines and the realisation
of complementary diagnostic exams on the basis of international prescription guidelines, audit their
implementation and integrate them in the electronic prescription system. A first set of guidelines is
introduced in the e-prescription system by Q2 2013.
3.47.
The government will produce a report assessing the effectiveness of the enacted legislation
aimed at removing all effective entry barriers for generic medicines, in particular by reducing
administrative/legal hurdles in order to speed up the use and reimbursement of generics. [Q12013]
3.48.
The above measures should aim at gradually and substantially increasing the share of
generic medicines to at least 30 per cent of all outpatient prescription (in volume) in 2012. In 2013

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 57

PORTUGAL

the target for NHS reimbursed medicines will be 45% of all outpatient prescription (in volume) and
will increase to 60% in 2014.
Centralised purchasing and procurement
3.49.
Reinforce the centralised acquisition of vehicles, utilities, external services and other cross
functional goods and services by all entities included in the NHS, in order to reduce costs through
price volume agreements and fighting waste. A detailed action plan will be published by November
2012.
3.50.
INFARMED will continue implementing the uniform coding system and a common registry
for medical supplies. [Ongoing]
3.51.
Reduce by an additional 10 percent the overall spending of the NHS with private providers
delivering diagnostic and therapeutic services (with particular reference to dialysis and
rehabilitation). Regularly evaluate and if necessary revise (at least every two years) the remuneration
paid to private providers with the aim of reducing the cost of more mature diagnostic and
therapeutic services. [Q4-2012]
3.52.
Implement the centralised purchasing of medical goods through the recently created
Central Purchasing Authority (SPMS), using the uniform coding system for medical supplies and
pharmaceuticals. Continue to implement the compulsory use of a formulary in all hospitals to
monitor the stock and flows of hospital medicines and medical supplies and monitor compliance
with central purchasing. [Ongoing]
3.53.
Take further measures to increase competition among private providers and between
private and public providers in relevant areas of service provision such as dialysis and the
pharmacies sector in view of ensuring competition and fair prices in private markets. [Q4-2013]
Primary care services
3.54.
As part of the reorganisation of health services provision and notably the concentration and
specialisation of hospital services and the further development of a cost-effective primary care
service, the Government reinforces measures aimed at further reducing unnecessary visits to
specialists and emergencies and improving care coordination. [Ongoing] This will be done through:

58

i.

increasing the number of USF (Unidades de Saúde Familiares) units contracting with
regional authorities (ARSs) using a mix of salary and performance-related payments
as currently the case. Extend performance assessment to the other primary care units
(UCSPs). Make sure that the new system leads to a reduction in costs and more
effective provision;

ii.

setting-up a mechanism to guarantee the presence of family doctors in needed areas
to induce a more even distribution of family doctors across the country;

iii.

moving human resources from hospital settings to primary care settings and
reconsidering the role of nurses and other specialties in the provision of services;

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PORTUGAL

iv.

updating patients' registration lists and the national register in order to increase by
at least 20 per cent the maximum number of patients per primary care/family doctor
for health centres and by 10 per cent for the USF.

Hospital services
3.55.
Implement the strategy to clear arrears in the health sector, within the overall strategy for
settling and avoiding the re-emergence of arrears. Ensure standardised and tight control procedures
for all health sector entities to ensure expenditure commitments stay within the budget allocated to
each entity and therefore prevent the re-emergence of arrears. [Q4-2012]
3.56.
Hospital SOEs will change the existing accounting framework and adopt accounting
standards and appropriate IT systems in line with the requirements for private companies and other
SOEs. This will help improving the management of the enterprises and the quality of the financial
oversight by the general government. [Q4-2013]
3.57.
Implement measures aimed at achieving a reduction of at least EUR 200 million in the
operational costs of hospitals in 2012. This is to be achieved through the reduction in the number
of management staff, concentration and rationalisation in state hospitals and health centres with a
view to reducing capacity. [Q4-2012]
3.58.
Continue the publication of clinical guidelines and set in place an auditing system of their
implementation. [Ongoing]
3.59.
On the basis of the comprehensive set of indicators, produce regular annual reports
comparing hospital performance (benchmarking). Establish a web-portal with publicly available
information. The first report is to be published by end 2012 and its results should be used to
establish targets for less performing hospitals. [Q4-2012]
3.60.
Continue work to ensure full interoperability of IT systems in hospitals, in order for the ACSS
to gather real time information on hospital accounting and activities and to produce monthly
reports to the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Finance. [Ongoing]
3.61.
Continue with the reorganisation and rationalisation of the hospital network through
specialisation, concentration and downsizing of hospital services, joint management (building on the
Decree-Law 30/2011) and joint operation of hospitals. The aim is to adjust hospital provision within
the same health region, notably in the presence of newly established PPP hospitals, adjust the
activity of some hospitals from curative care towards areas such as rehabilitation, long-term and
palliative care and revise emergency and transplantation structures. These improvements aim at
eliminating unnecessary duplication, achieving economies of scale and deliver additional cuts in
operating costs by at least 5 percent in 2013 while improving the quality of care provided. A detailed
action plan is published by 30 November 2012 and its implementation is finalised by end-2013.
Overall, from 2011 to 2013, hospital operational costs must be reduced by at least 15 per cent
compared to 2010 level. [Q4-2012]
3.62.
Annually update the inventory of all health staff and prepare regular annual reports
presenting plans for the allocation of human resources in the period up to 2014. The report specifies
plans to reallocate qualified and support staff within the NHS. [Q2-2013]

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 59

PORTUGAL

3.63.
Update the current legal framework applying to the organisation of working time of
healthcare staff, including introduction of rules to increase mobility within and across Health
Regions, adoption of flexible time arrangements and review of payment mechanisms for emergency
work, the prevention regime and per call payments, notably by aligning overtime remuneration in
the health care sector with the general legal framework recently adopted. In this context, overtime
compensation should be reduced by 20% in 2012 and another 20% in 2013.[Q4-2012].
Regional health authorities
3.64.
Improve monitoring, internal control and fiscal risks management systems of the
Administrações Regionais de Saúde. [Q4-2012]
Cross services
3.65.
Continue to develop the system of patient electronic medical records and ensure access to
all relevant health care facilities. [Ongoing]
3.66.

Reduce costs for patient transportation by one third compared to 2010. [Q4-2012]

4. Labour market and education
Labour market
Objectives
Revise the unemployment insurance system to reduce the risk of long-term unemployment while
strengthening social safety nets; reform employment protection legislation to tackle labour market
segmentation, foster job creation, and ease the transition of workers across occupations, firms, and
sectors; ease working time arrangements to contain employment fluctuations over the cycle, better
accommodate differences in work patterns across sectors and firms, and enhance firms’
competitiveness; promote labour cost developments consistent with job creation and enhanced
competitiveness; ensure good practices and appropriate resources to Active Labour Market Policies
to improve the employability of the young and disadvantaged categories and ease labour market
mismatches.
Address early school leaving and improve the quality of secondary education and vocational
education and training, with a view to raising the quality of human capital and facilitate labour
market matching.
Reforms in labour and social security legislation will be implemented after consultation with social
partners, taking into account possible constitutional implications, and in respect of EU Directives and
Core Labour Standards.
Unemployment benefits
4.1.
Following the reform of the unemployment benefit system (Decree-law 64/2012 and
Decree-law 65/2012 of 15 March) - which introduces a declining profile for unemployment benefits,
reduces the maximum monthly amount of benefits, reduces the maximum unemployment benefits
duration and increases coverage by reducing the contribution period for eligibility and by extending
the system to a clearly-defined category of self-employed - the government will prepare by Q4-

60

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PORTUGAL

2012 an analysis on benefit dependency and long-term unemployment with a view to assessing
whether further measures are needed to address possible deficiencies by Q1-2013.
Employment protection legislation
4.2.
The government will carry out reforms in the employment protection system aimed at
tackling labour market segmentation, fostering job creation, and easing adjustment in the labour
market. [Ongoing]
4.3.
Severance payments [Ongoing]. Following the entry into force of law n. 53/2011 concerning
the reform in the severance payments for new hires in line with the MoU and the entry into force of
law n. 23/2012, the government will further reduce severance payments. In consultation with social
partners, the Government will:
o

submit to Parliament by mid-December draft legislation aiming at aligning the
level of severance payments with the EU average of 12 days, applied to all
contracts while protecting accrued-to-date entitlements and maintain the cap of
12 month of pay;

o

consider the implementation of a compensation fund for severance payments
possibly allowing the severance pay entitlements financed from the fund to be
transferable to different employers.

4.4.
Following the changes to the dismissal rules as stated in law n. 23/2012, the government will
prepare a report on the effects of these changes on relevant labour market indicators by Q3-2013.
Wage setting and competitiveness
4.5.
The government will promote wage developments consistent with the objectives of
fostering job creation and improving firms’ competitiveness with a view to correcting
macroeconomic imbalances. To that purpose, the government will:
i. commit that, over the programme period, any increase in the minimum wage will
take place only if justified by economic and labour market developments and agreed
in the framework of the programme review [Ongoing];
ii. ensure wage moderation when deciding on the extension of collective agreements
that fulfil the criteria set out in Council of Ministers Resolution 90/2012, by taking
into account the implications of the extension on competitiveness of non-affiliated
firms [Ongoing];
iii. prepare an independent review by Q4-2012 on:
o

how the tripartite concentration on wages can be reinvigorated with a view to
defining norms for overall wage developments that take into account the
evolution of the competitive position of the economy and a system for
monitoring compliance with such norms;

o

the desirability of shortening the survival (sobrevigência) of contracts that are
expired but not renewed (art 501 of the Labour Code).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 61

PORTUGAL

4.6.
The Government will promote wage adjustments in line with productivity at the firm level.
Following the implementation of the organised decentralisation (which creates the possibility for
collective agreements to define conditions under which works councils can negotiate functional and
geographical mobility, working time arrangements and remuneration) and the decrease of the firm
size threshold to 150 workers for unions to delegate power to conclude collective agreements to
works councils, the government will, by Q1-2013, assess in a report the effects of these measures
and how they are being applied in collective agreements. If needed, an action plan will be prepared
in consultation with the social partners by Q2-2013 to ensure that works councils are given the
possibility to negotiate wages at firm level.
Active labour market policies
4.7.
The Government will ensure good practices and an efficient amount of resources to
activation policies to strengthen job search effort by the unemployed and to other Active Labour
Market Policies (ALMPs) to improve the employability of the young and disadvantaged categories
and ease labour market mismatches. Following the preparation of a report assessing the
effectiveness of ALMPs and the publication of the Council of Ministers Resolution n.20/2012, which
sets a plan to improve ALMPs, including the role of Public Employment Services (PES) , the
Government by Q4-2012 will present a report:
i. detailing expenditures and sources of financing of the different ALMPs;
ii. assessing the role played by the job counselling/ job search assistance and
activation/sanctions systems in facilitating the transition out of unemployment;
iii. reviewing the implementation of the Council of Ministers Resolution n. 20/2012
regarding the reorganisation of the PES and other ALMPs;
iv. proposing specific action to improve the effectiveness of training measures in light
of the results of the report assessing the effectiveness of employment and training
measures.
Education and training
4.8.
The government will continue action to tackle low education attainment and early school
leaving and to improve the quality of secondary education and vocational education and training,
with a view to increase efficiency in the education sector, raise the quality of human capital and
facilitate labour market matching. To this purpose, the government will:
i. set up an analysis, monitoring, assessment and reporting system in order to
accurately evaluate the results and impacts of education and training policies,
notably plans already implemented (notably concerning cost saving measures,
vocational education and training and policies to improve school results and contain
early school leaving). The tool should be fully operational by Q2-2013;
ii. in line with the action plan to improve the quality of secondary education the
Government will: (i) continue to promote trust agreements with public schools and
report about progress [ongoing]; (ii) define and implement a simple formula-based
funding framework comprising performance evaluation criteria and accountability

62

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PORTUGAL

for public schools and schools under autonomy agreements [Q4-2012]; (iii) present
an assessment of the new inspection model, including the planned follow up to
recommendations of previous external evaluations [Q4-2012];
iii. in line with action plan on vocational and educational training (VET) the Government
will report on: (i) involvement of businesses in the provisions of traineeships
[ongoing]; (ii) action taken to reorganise modalities for the provision of VET,
improve the quality and attractiveness of VET, and to enhance students' orientation
and career guidance [Q4-2012]; (iii) the establishment of "professional schools of
reference". [Q1-2013]
iv. present an assessment on the latest developments in the apprenticeship system.
[Q1-2013]

5. Goods and services markets
Objectives
Reduce entry barriers in network industries and sheltered sectors of the economy such as services
and regulated professions so as to increase competition and reduce excessive rents. These measures
should help improving the competitiveness of the Portuguese economy by lowering input prices,
raising productivity and improving the quality of the products and services provided. This should
contribute decisively to the social balance of the programme by reducing unwarranted sector
protection and rents so that all segments of the society participate in the burden sharing of the
needed adjustment.
Energy markets
Objectives
Complete the liberalisation of the electricity and gas markets; ensure the sustainability of the
national electricity system and avoid further unfavourable developments in the tariff debt; ensure
that the reduction of the energy dependence and the promotion of renewable energies is made in a
way that limits the additional costs associated with the production of electricity under the ordinary
and special (co-generation and renewables) regimes; ensure consistency of the overall energy policy,
reviewing existing instruments. Continue promoting competition in energy markets and to further
integrate the Iberian market for electricity and gas (MIBEL and MIBGAS).
Liberalisation of electricity and gas markets
5.1.
In order to fully transpose the Third EU Energy Package: a) adopt the law on the penalty
system of the regulator and b) ensure the National Regulatory Authority’s independence, autonomy
and all powers foreseen in the package by adopting by [November-2012] the new regulators'
bylaws agreed in July 2012, consulting the EC/ECB/IMF if changes are introduced. Ensure that the
new bylaws are effective before end of year in time for the liberalisation of the electricity and gas
market [Q4-2012].
5.2.
Take measures to accelerate the establishment of a functioning Iberian market for natural
gas (MIBGAS), through regulatory convergence and the harmonisation of the tariff structures in

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 63

PORTUGAL

Portugal and Spain. In particular, in accordance with the roadmap of 30 September 2011 agreed
with the Spanish authorities, the regulators of each country will:

i.

present proposals to harmonise the tariffs for access to the interconnection networks
taking into account the outcome of the public consultation conducted in January
2012 [Q1-2013];

ii.

prepare a report analysing and developing options to improve the harmonised
mechanism for capacity allocation and congestion management of cross-border
flows with Spain, including the introduction of virtual reverse flows and other
mechanisms allowing smaller players to make efficient use of the LNG Sines facility
[Q4-2012];

iii.

apply a harmonised allocation and congestion management mechanism to all the
interconnection capacity between Portugal and Spain, in line with the EU network
codes and guidelines in this respect [Q1-2013].

5.3.
Clarify the national legal framework with respect to the scope of competencies of the
logistics operator and define based on a cost-benefit analysis a way of convergence of the existing
two platforms for electricity and natural gas. [Q4-2012]
Ensure sustainability of the national electricity system
5.4.
Conclude the measures approved in the Council of Ministers on 17 May 2012 to reduce
excessive rents and to address the sustainability of the national electricity system. Cost reduction
measures address the following compensation schemes: power guarantee, special regime
(renewables - excluding those granted under tender mechanisms – and cogeneration), CAE’s (power
purchase agreements) and CMECs, and will reduce policy cost by at least EUR 1275 million in Net
Present Value (NPV)7 [Q4-2012]. The updated estimation of cost reductions that will be achieved as
well as progress towards elimination of the tariff debt (dívida tarifária) by 2020 will be presented and
assessed in the seventh review.
5.5.
Conclude the announced measures to limit the policy costs embedded in CMECs and PPAs
by Q4 2012. In particular, as an element in revising the rate of return to bring it in line with the cost
of capital at the moment the CMEC compensation was defined plus, if warranted, a risk premium of
the assets that the mechanism remunerates: (i) approve the pieces of legislation that reduce the
CMEC annuity discount rate from 7.55% to below 5% in terms that do not allow the increase of the
new established rate (yielding a NPV of EUR 120 million); and (ii) set a compensation for the
extension of exploitation licences of the power plants in Sines and Pego8 yielding NPVs of EUR 5575 million and EUR 30-50 million respectively, providing details on the valuation methodology
leading to these figures. The updated estimation of cost reductions that will be achieved will be
presented and assessed in the seventh review.
7

Computed using a discount rate of 7.55% back to June 2012.

8

Pego power plant compensation will not be included when determining the reduction of the rate of return of
the CMEC.

64

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PORTUGAL

5.6.
Present a report on the CMEC scheme including the foreseen annual compensation amounts
to each beneficiary and past payments since 2007 and the forecast of future payments. The report
will also describe the process for the extension of the concession of the public hydro resource by the
former CAE hydro power plants, its correspondent economic valuation, and the rationale for the
direct award instead of a tender process. The report will assess and consider all the information
available within the governmental and the official bodies (General Directorates, Regulator, State
representative in the contracts). [Q4-2012]
5.7.
Conclude the announced measures to limit the policy costs of renewables under the special
regime - excluding those granted under tender mechanisms by [Q4-2012]. In particular (i) following
the agreement in principle with wind power producers, approve the legislation to implement the
compensation to be paid by the producers (yielding a NPV of EUR 110 million); and (ii) introduce a
maximum duration for the feed in tariff in small hydro plants (yielding an NPV of EUR 200 to 250
million). The updated estimation of cost reductions that will be achieved will be presented and
assessed in the seventh review.
5.8.
Accelerate convergence to market-based pricing for co-generation operators in parallel with
electricity market developments under the EU internal electricity and gas market legislation. The
remuneration scheme for co-generation will be further revised to improve efficiency of the support
system in ensuring continued guaranteed access of operators to electricity networks and markets
with the calculation of explicit subsidies based on relevant price factors in the context of a
competitive electricity market. The revision should ensure that the design of the support scheme
allows a dynamic correlation between electricity market prices and the efficiency premium when the
values of avoided externalities are not adequately reflected in electricity and other factor prices. This
revision will be undertaken in line with the framework of the transposition of the energy efficiency
directive [Q1-2013]. Ensure through annual audits that plants not fulfilling the requirements for cogeneration do not receive the support, and report on the progress. [Q2-2013]
5.9.
For new contracts in renewables, revise downward the feed-in tariffs and ensure that the
tariffs do not over-compensate producers for their costs and they continue to provide an incentive
to reduce costs further, through digressive tariffs. For more mature technologies develop alternative
mechanisms (such as feed-in premiums). Report on action taken will be provided in Q3-2013.
5.10. Decisions on future investments in renewables, in particular in less mature technologies, will
be based on a rigorous analysis in terms of its costs and consequences for energy prices.
International benchmarks will be used for the analysis and an independent evaluation will be carried
out. Report on action taken will be provided in Q3-2013.
Telecommunications and postal services
Objectives
Increase competition in the market by lowering entry barriers; guarantee
network/infrastructure; strengthen power of the National Regulator Authority.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 65

PORTUGAL

Telecommunications
5.11. Ensure an efficient, objective, transparent and non-discriminatory mechanism for the
designation of the universal service provider(s), in compliance with the Court of Justice ruling of 7
October 2010. Re-negotiate the concession contract with the undertaking currently providing the
universal service, by reducing the scope of the services covered, so as to exclude the universal
service and following the launch of a new tender process in October, proceed with the designation
of universal service provider(s). [Q2-2013]
5.12. Following the corrective measures already taken, monitor the competitive situation in the
telecommunications sector, in particular wholesale and retail broadband access, and mobile
origination charges. [Ongoing]
Postal services
5.13. Following the transposition of the Third Postal directive, further liberalise the postal sector
by amending the decree-law laying down the framework of the concession contract and
renegotiating the amendment of said contract with CTT, in order to reflect the new law (Law
17/2012) transposing the Third Postal Directive; ensuring in particular that the current designation
period for the universal service provision is shortened to 2020 and that investment needs and return
on investment are taken into account when setting new designation periods. [Q4-2012]
Transport
Adopt a strategic plan to: rationalise networks and improve mobility and logistic conditions in
Portugal; improve energy efficiency and reduce environmental impact; reduce transport costs and
ensure financial sustainability of the companies; strengthen competition in the railways sector and
attract more traffic; integrate ports into the overall logistic and transport system, and make them
more competitive.
Strategic Plan for Transport
5.14.

66

Implement the Strategic Plan for Transport for 2011-2015 [Q4-2012], namely:
i.

continue the reforms in the transport SOEs to achieve their EBITDA balance, by
focusing efforts on the reduction of operational costs;

ii.

reduce the forecast debt burden of Estradas de Portugal through the reduction of
PPP contracts’ scope still in the construction phase, revision of shadow-toll
schemes and the adjustment of the CSR (Road Service Contribution) to the inflation
level. Analyse additional measures to further reduce the forecast debt burden of
Estradas de Portugal;

iii.

focus the investment priorities in projects that present a positive cost-benefit ratio
and contribute to the competitiveness of Portuguese exports, namely in the port
and freight rail sectors;

iv.

reform the transport and infrastructures’ regulatory framework in order to improve
the effectiveness, efficiency and independence of the entities regulating the
transport sector. [Q1-2013]

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PORTUGAL

5.15. Present a long term vision of the transport system and a list of actions to improve its
efficiency and sustainability [Q4-2012]. It will specifically include an assessment of the existing rail,
road and port networks and present a set of investment priorities for the 2020 and 2030 horizons,
taking also into account TEN-T networks, with an estimate of the financial needs and the foreseen
sources of financing [Q2-2013].
Railways sector
5.16.

Continue with the transposition of the EU Railway Packages and in particular:
i.

ensure that the rail regulator enjoys the independence required under the EU rail
Directives, in particular regarding the rules of appointment and dismissal of the
director of the rail regulator. Strengthen the capacities of the railway regulator to
fulfil its regulatory mandate effectively, including by exploring synergies with other
transport regulators in the context of the revision of national regulatory agencies.
[Q1-2013];

ii.

continue to implement the plans to bring the infrastructure manager to
operational balance, in particular by reducing operational costs by at least 23 per
cent in 2012 compared to 2010 [Q4-2012]. On the revenue side, track access
charges for freight services should not be increased in order to prevent a
deterioration of the competitiveness of rail freight services. Reintroduce incentives
to REFER to reduce costs and access charges. Provide annual progress reports on
the implementation of balancing revenues and expenditures [Q2-2013];

iii.

ensure that the new Public Service Obligation (PSO) contracts concluded on rail
passenger transport respect EU legislation including Regulation (EC) No
1370/2007, and in particular provide a detailed breakdown of state contributions
for each line under PSO. Develop administrative capacity for a stepwise
introduction of competitive tendering of PSOs starting with some suburban
services. Ensure that the awarding authority has the required level of
independence and competence and guarantees fair conditions of tendering [Q42012];

iv.

extend the performance scheme on infrastructure charges to other operators [Q42012];

v.

review and render more effective the yield management on long-distance
passenger ticket prices. [Q1-2013];

vi.

to prepare the privatisation of the freight branch of the state-owned rail operator,
carry out an analysis for transferring part or whole of CP Carga's rolling stock to a
rolling stock operating company [Q2-2013];

vii.

ensure that the main rail terminals currently owned by CP Carga are transferred to
another entity that will guarantee non-discriminatory access to all rail freight
operators. [Q4-2012].

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 67

PORTUGAL

Ports
5.17. Adopt the revised legal framework governing port work as presented to Parliament by [Q42012]. A review of the overall savings generated and the impact of the introduction of the law on
port usage cost will be made by August 2013.
5.18. Take further steps to improve the governance model of the ports system with the objective
to enhance the competitiveness and the efficiency of ports in line with the Strategic Plan of
Transport 2011-2015. The Government will deliver and enforce policies that ensure strong
integrated policy-making, strategic planning and surveillance functions common to all ports in the
country. Moreover, policy decisions will be taken and enforced so that (i) efficiency gains and costsavings are passed through to port customers; and (ii) concession-holders of terminals and land
facilities in ports respect minimum performance criteria. [Q4-2012]
Road pricing
5.19. Adopt the necessary legislative amendments in order to achieve full compliance with
Directive 1999/62/EC (Eurovignette Directive) and the EU Treaty and, in particular, to guarantee nondiscriminatory application of tolling schemes to non-resident road users [Q4-2012]. After the
deadline of this measure, rebates in tolling schemes that pursue compelling reasons of territorial
and social cohesion may only be applied if their compliance with the EU law is demonstrated.
Other services sector
Objectives
Eliminate entry barriers in order to increase competition in the services sector; soften existing
authorisation requirements that hinder adjustment capacity and labour mobility; reduce
administrative burden that imposes unnecessary costs on firms and hamper their ability to react to
market conditions.
Sector-specific legislation of Services
5.20. Further to the adoption of a significant number of amendments to the sector specific
legislation, complete the adoption of the outstanding sectorial amendments (such as construction,
universities and higher education courses) necessary to fully implement the Services Directive and
submit them to Parliament where necessary by [Q4-2012] in view of approval by [Q1-2013]. For
those amendments already submitted to the Parliament (such as real estate) approval is expected by
[Q4-2012].
Regulated professions
5.21. Review and reduce the number of regulated professions and in particular eliminate reserves
of activities on regulated professions that are no longer justified, through adoption by the
Parliament of the law for professions where regulation does not involve a professional body (Ordens
or Câmaras) by [Q4-2012]. Following the final report by the Comissão de Regulação do Acesso a
Profissões (CRAP), launch by [Q1-2013] a second phase investigation of the review of regulated
professions to eliminate unjustified requirements by [Q2-2013].

68

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PORTUGAL

5.22. Further improve the functioning of the regulated professions (such as accountants, lawyers,
notaries) for which regulation involves a professional body (Ordens or Câmaras) by (i) carrying out a
comprehensive review of requirements affecting the exercise of activity with a view to eliminating
those not justified or proportional, such as those restrictions to the use of commercial
communication (advertising) prohibited by the Services Directive, and (ii) by adopting measures to
further improve the recognition of professional qualifications in compliance with the Professional
Qualifications Directive To achieve the objectives referred to above the government has, following
the public consultation, submitted a draft horizontal legal framework to Parliament in view of
approval by [Q4-2012]. Upon enactment, the professional bodies will make the necessary changes
in their statutes by [Q1-2013].
Administrative burden
5.23.

Continue the simplification reform effort by:
i.

adapting the content and information available at the Point of Single Contact (PSC)
for the 48 amended regimes to ensure conformity with the Services Directive and for
those that have not required amendments so far by [January 2013] and make
available online forms for the completion of procedures by [Q1-2013]. Constantly
adapting the content and information available at the PSC to the remaining 20
sector-specific regimes that are about to be adopted to ensure conformity with the
Services Directive (see 5.20 above) at the latest 1 month after the adoption of each
sector-specific regime, clearly differentiating information on requirements applicable
to established providers and to cross-border ones, and by making available online
forms and extend on-line procedures for all sectors covered by the Services Directive
no later than 2 months after adoption of the sector-specific regime;

ii.

adapting the content and information available at the PSC for the 15 regimes
approved to ensure conformity with the Professional Qualifications Directive by
[January 2013] and online forms by [Q1-2013]. Constantly adapting the content
and information available at the PSC to the new legislation to be adopted to ensure
conformity with the Professional Qualifications Directive at the latest 1 month after
the adoption of amendments, clearly differentiating information on requirements
applicable to established providers and to cross-border ones, and by extending online forms and procedures for each profession no later than 2 months after adoption
of amendments;

iii. making available in PSC on-line procedures for the registration, installation,
modification, occupation of public space regimes, and closing up of restaurants, bars
and other establishment for the 5 municipalities (Porto, Águeda, Abrantes,
Portalegre and Palmela) covered by "Zero Authorisation" pilot project (DL 48/2011)
by [Q4-2012]. Foster collaboration from municipalities in providing the content for
the working hours map for the stores and establishments services and advertisement
regimes for which they have full competence to make the PSC operational [Q42012]; Identify and classify municipalities where the availability of those procedures
through the PSC would have the most significant economic impact by [November-

PORTUGAL

2012] to prepare for the extension of this tool to major municipalities by [January2013]. Make fully operational the “Zero Authorisation” project that abolishes
authorisations/licensing and substitute them with a declaration to the PSC for the
wholesale and retail sector and restaurants and bars by [Q2-2013]. The platform will
be available to all levels of administration, including all municipalities [Q2-2013];
iv. extending PSC to services not covered by the Services Directive [Q4-2013];
v.
5.24.

extending the "Zero Authorisation" project to other services sectors of the economy
[Q4-2013].

Provide a monthly update of the detailed work programme of AMA to fulfil 5.23.

6. Housing market
Objectives
Improve access to housing; foster labour mobility; improve the quality of housing and make better
use of the housing stock; reduce the incentives for households to build up debt.
Property taxation
6.1.
The government will continue to step up the appraisal of the taxable value of the housing
stock. In particular, the measures will: (i) ensure that the taxable value of the properties in 2012 is
close to the market value and (ii) property valuation is updated regularly (every year for commercial
real estate and once every three years for residential real estate as foreseen in the law).
6.2.
The government will gradually rebalance property taxation towards the recurrent real estate
tax (IMI) and away from the transfer tax (IMT), while considering the socially vulnerable. [Q3-2013]
Comprehensive review of the housing market
6.3.
Following the adoption of the amendments to the New Urban Lease Act Law 6/2006 and the
Decree Law which simplifies the administrative procedures for renovation, the government will
undertake a comprehensive review of the functioning of the housing market with the support of
internationally-reputed experts. The review will determine whether the new legal provisions adopted
are sufficient to make the housing market more dynamic and, if necessary, will propose new policy
measures. [Q2-2013]

7. Framework conditions
Judicial system
Objectives
Improve the functioning of the judicial system, which is essential for the proper and fair functioning
of the economy, through: (i) ensuring effective and timely enforcement of contracts and competition
rules; (ii) increasing efficiency by restructuring the court system, and adopting new court
management models; (iii) reducing slowness of the system by eliminating backlog of courts cases
and by facilitating out-of-court settlement mechanisms.

70

Court backlog
Recognising the urgency of the judicial reform to make the judicial system more efficient and more
effective, the government will:
7.1.

Aim to resolve the backlog of court cases by Q2-2013.

7.2.
Implement targeted measures to achieve steady reduction of the backlogged enforcement
cases. In particular, set quarterly targets for closing enforcement cases and prepare quarterly reports
on implementation status, by inter-agency task forces with the fifth report to be completed by midFebruary 2013.
7.3.
Present a revised draft bill for enforcement agent's framework (i) strengthening the authority
and financing structure of the oversight body and enhancing the accountability of enforcement
agents, and (ii) to include a fee structure that incentivises speedy enforcement which will be
approved by the government by end-February 2013.
7.4.
Publish quarterly reports on recovery rates, duration and costs of corporate insolvency cases
starting from [Q3-2011], within four months after the end of the relevant quarter.
Competition, public procurement and business environment
Objectives
Ensure a level playing field and minimise rent-seeking behaviour by strengthening competition and
sectoral regulators; eliminate special rights of the state in private companies (golden shares); reduce
administrative burdens on companies; ensure fair public procurement processes; improve
effectiveness of existing instruments dealing with export promotion and access to finance and
support the reallocation of resources towards the tradable sector.
Competition and sectoral regulators
7.5.
The Government shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the Portuguese State or
any public bodies do not conclude, in a shareholder capacity, shareholder agreements the intention
or effect of which hinder the free movement of capital or which influence the management or
control of companies [Ongoing]. The Portuguese State will ensure that CGD alienates its
participation in Galp. [Q4-2012]
7.6.
Going beyond elimination of special rights of the State, the authorities also commit to
ensure that obstacles to free movement of capital will not be created by their action. The authorities
acknowledge that the discretion granted under the amended article 13(2) of the Framework Law of
Privatisations (Law 11/90 amended by Decree 3/XII of the Parliament of 5 August 2011), if used, shall
be restricted solely to the concrete privatisation operation and thus used in such a proportionate
manner that privatisation's implementing laws will not set or allow holding or acquisition caps
beyond the privatisation transaction. [Ongoing]
7.7.
Monitor the inflow of cases and report on the functioning of the specialised court for
Competition, Regulation and Supervision, assessing the situation in terms of risk of potential court
backlogs. [Q4-2012]

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 71

PORTUGAL

7.8.
Take the necessary actions to ensure the effective functioning of the Competition Authority
financing model [Q4-2012]. Following the efforts made in order to guarantee the enlarged scope of
action of the Competition Authority, report on the conditions for the proper execution of its
mandate [Q4-2012].
7.9.
Building on the independent report on the main National Regulator Authorities, the
government will prepare a framework law for regulators in broad consultation with the Regulator
Authorities. This law will establish a regulatory environment that protects the public interest and
promotes market efficiency. The law will guarantee the Regulator's independence and financial,
administrative and management autonomy to exercise their responsibilities, in full compliance with
EU law. The law will also contribute towards the effectiveness of the competition authority in
enforcing competition rules therefore supporting and complementing the effect of the recently
adopted competition law. The framework law will be submitted to parliament by [Q1-2013].
Public procurement
The government will modify the national public procurement legal framework and improve public
contracts award practices to ensure a more transparent and competitive business environment and
improve efficiency of public spending. In particular, it will:
7.10. Submit a report analysing the effectiveness and impact of the amendments to the revised
Public Procurement Code as well as of the enhanced role of the Court of Auditors in ensuring
compliance with public procurement rules by [Q1-2013].
Business environment
7.11. Make operational the procedures for requesting VAT exemptions for exporting firms and to
simplify procedures associated with indirect exports as part of the “Simplex Exports” programme.
[Q4-2012]
7.12. Following the plans presented at the sixth review, adopt measures to facilitate access to
finance and to export markets for SMEs. A limited number of instruments should be sought,
focusing primarily on SMEs, especially those in the most productive and innovative segments of the
economy, while ensuring these initiatives will not pose significant fiscal risks. Progress will be
reported by [Q4-2012].
7.13. Promote liquidity conditions for business by timely implementing the New Late Payments
Directive. [Q1-2013]
7.14. Continue reducing administrative burdens by including municipalities and all levels of public
administration within the scope of the Simplex Programme. [Q1-2013]
Licensing environment
Objectives
The government is launching a new comprehensive programme to tackle excessive licensing
procedures, regulations and other administrative burdens in the economy. These explicit and implicit
barriers represent a major obstacle for economic growth in Portugal. Companies face substantial
costs and uncertainty which affect investment decisions, thus limiting job creation. Furthermore,
72

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PORTUGAL

these barriers affect small and medium-sized enterprises in a disproportionate way because they
have fewer resources to surpass these obstacles, deteriorating the competitive environment. Foreign
investment is also affected disproportionally because national companies have information
advantages. The various new initiatives laid out below cover all families of licenses and will have a
substantial impact in the business environment. The reviews of the legal regimes of environment
and territory planning and of industrial and commercial licencing aim at ensuring their mutual
compatibility.
Regulatory simplification
7.15. To deal with the legacy of excessive licences procedures and other administrative burdens,
carry out a full inventory and an analysis of the costs of all regulations in the economy (at central,
regional and local levels). [Q2-2013] On the basis of the analysis the government will devise a
roadmap for a regulatory simplification.
7.16. To prevent future growth in excessive licenses and regulations, study the feasibility of a rule
that prohibits at all levels of government the creation of a new regulation generating costs for
businesses without the elimination of an existing regulation or regulations with an equivalent cost.
The feasibility of such rule will be decided by [Q1-2013] with a view of being in place by [Q2-2013].
7.17. Create a working group to analyse and fast-track applications for the licensing of planned
investment projects which are left unresolved or undecided for more than 12 months [Q4-2012].
Environment and territory planning
7.18. In consultation with the relevant stakeholders, review the legal regimes at all levels of
Government in the area of territorial planning, in order to increase and facilitate the establishment
of investors while at the same time limiting urban sprawl. In particular, review the following legal
regimes, in the area of territorial planning:
i.

new Base Law of Soil and Territorial and Urbanism Planning (Lei dos Solos), that
should be aligned with the new Industrial Licensing regime (measure 7.24 ii) [Q42012];

ii. National Ecological Reserve/ Risks (REN): (1) Changes to Decree-Law 166/2008
(RJREN); (2) Publication of strategic orientations regarding modifications of REN's
municipal delimitations; (3) Revocation of Ordinance 1356/ 2008 (Compatible REN
actions); 4. Joint Dispatch of the Secretaries of State of Environment and Territorial
Planning and of Internal Administration in order to determine the creation of Risk
Sectorial Plan [Q4-2012];
iii. review the legal regimes of the Territorial Management Instruments (RJIGT) and of
the related regulations [Q4-2012];
iv. diploma for the regularization of activities not in accordance with Territorial
Management Instruments [Q4-2012];
v. diploma for the harmonization of Territorial Planning Regional Plans – new
generation [Q4-2012];

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 73

PORTUGAL

vi. review the Legal Regime for Urbanism and Building (RJUE) , that should be aligned
with, the new Industrial Licensing regime (measure 7.24 ii) [Q1-2013].
7.19. Increase a nationwide land registration system (registo cadastral) to allow a more equal
(perequitativa) distribution of benefits and costs in the execution of urban planning. The
government will:
i.

implement a Legal Regime of Land Registration (registo cadastral) [Q4 2013];

ii. create a diploma on Land Registration and Land Registration Experts [Q4-2013];
iii. review the cartography for plans regime [Q4-2013], and the diploma on
Cartography [Q4-2013];
iv. enforce the Council of Ministers Resolution 56/2012 by Q4-2013, to collect all land
registration procedures, currently scattered in various departments.
7.20. Change the legal regime for Environment Impact Evaluation in order to increase the speed
and effectiveness of this regulation and reduce associated monetary and time costs. [Q4-2012].
Industrial Licensing
7.21.

Implement the new Industrial Licensing regime by means of:
i.

fully implement the approved Programme of Responsible Industry (“PIR - Programa
da Indústria Responsável” [Q2-2013];

ii.

review the following legal norms and regimes that are crucial for a successful
implementation of the approved System of Responsible Industry (“SIR - Sistema da
Indústria Responsável”):
a. implement zero licensing procedures for Type 3 [Q4 2012] and Type 2 industries
[Q1 2013] including fully integration of these procedures in the one-stop shop
(“Balcão do empreendedor”). Implement fast-track procedures for Type 1
industries [Ongoing];
b. define and establish the Zones of Responsible Enterprises (ZER – Zonas da
Indústria Responsável) by [Q1-2013], which will allow the installation of
industries in areas previously licensed with all industrial, building and
environmental provisions required by national and European law;
c.

create and define standardized industrial licenses [Q1-2013];

d. ensure that the new Industrial Licensing is aligned with, and strengthened by, the
review of the New Base Law of Soil and Territorial and Urbanism Planning while
at the same time limiting urban sprawl (measure 7.21 i) [Q4-2012];
e. ensure that the new Industrial Licensing is aligned with, and strengthened by, the
review of the Legal Regime for Urbanism and Building (RJUE - measure 7.21 vi)
[Q1-2013].

74

IMF Completes Sixth Review Under an EFF Arrangement with Portugal,
Approves €838.8 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the sixth
review of Portugal’s performance under an economic program supported by a 3-year, SDR
23.742 billion (about €27.51 billion) Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement. The
completion of the review enables the immediate disbursement of an amount equivalent to
SDR 724 million (about € 838.8 million), bringing total disbursements under the EFF
arrangement to SDR 19.126 billion (about €22.16 billion).
The Executive Board also approved a request for waivers of applicability for the endDecember 2012 performance criteria (PC). This waiver was necessary because the Executive
Board meeting was scheduled to take place after end-December but prior to the availability
of data to assess the relevant PCs
The Executive Board today also concluded the 2012 Article Consultation with Portugal. A
Public Information Notice will be issued in due course.
The EFF arrangement, which was approved on May 20, 2011 (see Press Release No. 11/190)
is part of a cooperative package of financing with the European Union amounting to €78
billion over three years. It entails exceptional access to IMF resources, amounting to 2,306
percent of Portugal’s IMF quota.
After the Board discussion, Ms. Nemat Shafik, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair,
said:
“The authorities’ policy and reform effort has been impressive. Considerable progress has
already been made in fiscal and external adjustment, and sovereign spreads have narrowed
significantly, which bodes well for the authorities’ strategy of regaining market access.
Nonetheless, the near-term outlook is uncertain, and sizable medium-term economic

2

challenges remain. In light of this, the authorities need to sustain efforts to make the tradable
sector more competitive, boost long-term growth, and further advance fiscal consolidation.
“The fiscal objectives remain appropriate, provided economic developments unfold as
expected. However, a public debate on how to best share the burden of the remaining sizable
fiscal adjustment is needed. Given an already high tax burden, the expenditure review that is
aimed at rebalancing the adjustment mix is welcome. Going forward, a broader tax base and
strengthened compliance would help generate space for lower income tax rates, particularly
for corporate income tax, with a view to fostering investment and competitiveness.
Significant progress has been made on the fiscal structural agenda, but continued strong
implementation will be needed to achieve durable fiscal consolidation.
“The authorities have a strong track record in preserving financial stability, but need to
continue to monitor risks vigilantly. Progress has been made in keeping the banks well
capitalized and adequately financed. Improved credit conditions will be important to
facilitate economic recovery and ensure an orderly deleveraging by highly indebted firms.
“The progress on labor and product market reforms, as well as in the judiciary, is
encouraging. However, the authorities should vigorously pursue structural reforms to lock in
a durable improvement in competitiveness, growth, and employment.
“In addition to domestic efforts, success will depend critically on continued external support
and successful crisis policies at the euro area level. Support from the Eurosystem is important
to contain credit market segmentation and improve monetary policy transmission.”

Statement by Andrea Montanino, Executive Director for Portugal and
José Cardoso, Advisor to Executive Director
January 11, 2013

1 - Overview
We welcome the IMF staff reports. We note the broad appreciation of the efforts undertaken
by the Portuguese authorities in implementing the program. Indeed the program is helping to
correct the structural imbalances in the Portuguese economy, namely in terms of fiscal
consolidation, indebtedness of the private sector, and external accounts.
The Portuguese authorities remain fully committed to the program while recognizing the need
to address social and political tensions that are being fuelled by the prolonged recession and
mounting unemployment. The authorities recognize that efforts to alleviate the costs of the
adjustment are necessary, and are working towards the resumption of growth. The structural
reforms foreseen in the program will contribute to improving the growth potential, but their
benefits will only materialize in the medium term. In the shorter term, the possibility of
providing policy stimulus to the economy is limited by the ongoing adjustment. However,
easing the cost of financing of the private sector, which now is elevated, could provide a
substantial stimulus going forward. This involves, inter alia, taking steps for the return of the
sovereign to the financial markets at an acceptable cost. Recent market developments have
been encouraging in this respect as some large firms and banks have been able to effectively
access the international bond markets. The support of our international partners and progress
in the resolution of the euro area crisis is playing a key role in this process. In particular,
addressing the current fragmentation of financial markets which are impairing the
transmission mechanism of monetary policy in a number of euro area countries, including
Portugal, would have important beneficial consequences, as highlighted in the IMF report.
Progress on this front would improve confidence and reduce uncertainty, thus creating a
favorable environment for a turnaround in investment in the near term.
The recovery of investment also depends on the creation of a more favorable business
environment. In this context, the Government is reforming the Corporate Income Tax that
should be aligned with international best practices. The broad objectives of the reform will be
discussed with the troika during the 7th review and will be implemented towards the end of
the year. By making the system more efficient and expanding the tax base, this reform should
lead to lower effective tax rates on corporations in 2014.
More generally, the authorities recognize that, although the budget consolidation is
excessively tilted to the revenue side in 2013, the expenditure review under way should allow
for a rebalancing of the program in 2014 so that the fiscal consolidation will be achieved
mainly via expenditure reduction. The expenditure review should lead to savings that will
allow some room for lowering the tax burden that will be positive for growth in the medium
term. Indeed, a moderate recovery in economic activity is forecasted for 2014. This recovery
could be reinforced by positive effects of the structural reforms that may start to be felt during
this year.

2

2 - Fiscal Policy
While final figures on the end-2012 fiscal outturns are not yet available, it is now clear that
there will be a major correction of the fiscal balance in 2012. This is not apparent in the
headline figures as the deficit will rise from 4.4 percent of GDP in 2011 (which was lower
than the program target of 5.9 percent) to an expected 5 percent of GDP in 2012, in line with
the revised target. However, it should be noted that the 2011 budget balance included around
3 percent of GDP of temporary measures, while the 2012 budget includes around 1 percent of
GDP of temporary measures. A better gauge of the progress is the structural deficit which,
according to the IMF staff's estimates, will decline by 2.4 percent of GDP in 2012, after
showing a reduction of 2.5 percent of GDP in 2011. This is a very significant structural
adjustment that shows that the fiscal consolidation has proceeded at a good pace, even against
an unfavorable and deteriorating external environment.
Since the end of the review mission, we have proceeded with the work on the expenditure
review. A technical mission of the IMF was held in December to help organize the work that
is now ongoing with the line Ministries. The government is promoting an open discussion
with the political parties and with the civil society on the role of the state that should lead to a
more consensual approach to the exercise. If necessary, some of the identified measures will
be frontloaded to address implementation risks.
The government has also taken decisive steps to structurally change the fiscal framework. At
year-end, the Council of Ministers approved three important law proposals that will
significantly enhance public financial management in Portugal.
The first was the revised Budget Framework Law, where the government transposed the new
requirements of the European fiscal framework (fiscal compact). The new law gives more
prominence to the structural balance and to the correction of excessive debt in line with the
Treaty on Stability Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union. The
Law proposal specifies a comprehensive set of rules that significantly enhance fiscal
discipline and transparency. It requires the government to take action when the deficit or the
debt deviates from given thresholds. The structural balance rule states that the structural
balance cannot be less than the annual goal set in the Stability and Growth Program. In
addition, until the medium-term objective is reached, the annual adjustment in the structural
balance cannot be less than 0.5 percent of GDP, and the growth rate of public expenditure, net
of extraordinary measures on the revenue side, cannot exceed the reference rate medium-term
GDP growth potential, as defined in the Stability and Growth Program. In turn, the debt rule
implies that when the debt ratio, corrected by the cycle, is above 60 percent of GDP, the gap
between the actual debt ratio and 60 percent needs to be reduced at a rate of 1/20th per year on
a three-year average.
The second and third draft laws approved in December were the local and regional finance
laws. The new legislation will enhance the fiscal discipline of these sectors, which in the past
have been an important source of budgetary slippages. With the approval of these laws,
Portugal will have completed the main legislative reforms on the budgetary framework. While
constant improvement of the legislative instruments is needed, now the emphasis will be on
the operationalization and enforcement of the reinforced budgetary framework.

3 - Financial Sector Policies
The Portuguese banking system has been strengthening its resilience to the challenges
underlying the adjustment process of the Portuguese economy. These include the ongoing
sovereign debt crisis in the euro area, against the background of an economic contraction in
the area. On the other hand, the Portuguese economy has benefited markedly from the ECB’s
announcement of the Outright Monetary Transactions programme, which has eased
conditions in the sovereign debt markets in the euro area as well as in other financial market
segments. In Portugal, this trend also benefited from the progress in the fiscal consolidation
front, which is also contributing toward the improvement of international investors’ risk
perception regarding the Portuguese State and systemic risk in the banking system.
The strengthening in the banks’ resilience has been materializing on several dimensions. First,
banks are gradually converging to a more-balanced structural liquidity position. In particular,
the liquidity position of the Portuguese banks, when measured by liquidity gaps of up to one
year, has improved substantially since the start of 2012, reflecting the permanent nature of
financing from the ECB over this timeframe and the reinforcement of the available collateral
in the context of the new eligibility rules for monetary policy operations. Reference should
also be made to the gradual reduction of the loans-to-deposits ratio implying the convergence
toward a financial structure less vulnerable to liquidity shocks arising from changes in
international investors’ risk perceptions. In this context, the new platform for interbank
unsecured lending developed by Banco de Portugal, which started operating on September 3,
2012, is working smoothly, facilitating the redistribution of liquidity among domestic banks.
Portuguese banks’ access to the international financial markets is, however, still limited. This
notwithstanding some Portuguese banks have recently issued debt in the medium- and longterm international financial markets, which marks a quite favorable development in this
domain.
Second, banks have been strengthening their own funds through equity market issues, capital
subscribed by the State – or hybrid instruments eligible as Core Tier 1 – and earnings
retention. This allowed banks to comply with the EBA’s Core Tier 1 capital requirements for
end-June 2012 as well as with the solvency requirements set by Banco de Portugal for end2012. In addition, by end-2012, a small bank resorted to the Bank Solvency Support Facility
established under the Programme, amounting to €1.1 billion. A total of €5.6 billion – out of
the €12 billion available in the Facility – have thus been used to capitalize private banks in
Portugal. The most recent stress test exercise, conducted by Banco de Portugal in November
2012, in tandem with the quarterly Funding and Capital Plans, confirmed the resilience of all
participating banks. This exercise continued to reveal the importance of the capital increases
carried out in June 2012, as banks were able to absorb the severe adverse scenario and yet still
keep a core tier 1 ratio above 6 percent.
Third, the supervision of the banking system and the regulatory framework continued to be
strengthened. Several initiatives are worth highlighting in this respect. On the one hand, with
a view to discouraging evergreening of problematic loans, Banco de Portugal published an
Instruction aimed at ensuring the identification in the banks’ information systems of
restructured credits due to financial difficulties of the borrower. In parallel, a supervisory
mechanism was put in place which requires banking institutions to report those restructured
loans on a quarterly basis, therefore allowing a more accurate evaluation of the credit
portfolio quality of the banking system. Banco de Portugal is currently analyzing the data
received (banks were required to report historical quarterly information since June 2011). On
the other hand, as part of its regular prudential supervision activity, Banco de Portugal has

4

been closely monitoring banks’ exposures to the construction and real estate sectors, which
have been particularly affected by the current macroeconomic downturn. A new On-site
Inspections Programme was thus launched, aimed at assessing the adequacy of impairment
levels recorded by the eight largest banking groups with regard to their exposure to the sectors
in question. For the eight groups as a whole, and with reference to June 30, 2012, the
Programme estimated a need to reinforce the value of impairments recorded for the exposure
analyzed by €861 million, so as to reach robust provisioning levels. The estimated impact of
this reinforcement on the aggregate Core Tier 1 ratio projected for end-December 2012 was
negligible, and did not compromise Banco de Portugal’s capital ratio requirement of 10
percent as of the end of the year.
Finally, the deleveraging of the banking sector has continued. Since mid-2010, the loan-todeposits ratio of the eight largest banking groups in Portugal was reduced from around 160
percent to around 125 percent. This compares with an indicative objective of 120 percent in
2014 for the banks individually considered. The decline of the loans-to-deposits ratio has been
occurring in a context in which household deposits are still recording positive growth rates
but, as expected, have been decelerating throughout 2012. Despite the maintenance of
restrictive credit market conditions – rooted inter alia in heightened risk perception levels by
banks – the evidence suggests that banks have not induced sizeable supply-side constraints on
credit flows to the most dynamic and productive segments of the economy, including
exporting firms. However, albeit declining, bank lending interest rates remained high, as
highlighted in the IMF staff report. In addition, there is a high degree of heterogeneity in
firms’ access to the credit market. In particular, the diversification of sources of financing –
notably credit from non-residents and bond market issuances – is not available for SMEs. It is
therefore important to safeguard that the deleveraging of the banking sector occurs in tandem
with the deleveraging in the corporate sector. In this regard, authorities have been working on
proposals to promote alternative sources of financing for firms. Moreover, it is also worth
underlining the idea of setting-up a vehicle – in a European context – to reduce the weight of
legacy mortgage credit in banks’ balance sheets. This would allow banks to immediately
deleverage through a stock adjustment, without impacting the financing of the economy.
Further, it would allow banks to restructure the asset side of the balance sheet and would
contribute to a smoother functioning of the monetary transmission mechanism in the euro
area.
4 - Structural Reforms
The government remains committed to pressing ahead with structural reforms that promote
the potential growth of the Portuguese economy. The IMF report provides an accurate
description of the main measures being taken.
With regard to the product market, during the 6th review the Government discussed measures
that aim to reduce the costs of the use of ports which should help foster export
competitiveness.
In the context of the ongoing structural reform of the labor market, and following the revised
Labour Code that came into force in August, new restrictions on automatic extensions of
collective agreements were set. This resolution helps to promote competitiveness of
enterprises by requiring a minimum representativeness to proceed with the extension of
specific conditions (for example, wage conditions) for smaller companies.
In health, we keep implementing our policy, closely monitoring all measures of cost control,

5

rationalizing supply, and implementing operational improvements that have been approved in
recent months. Measures, such as the compulsory e-prescription, and changes in pharmacies'
margins, in international reference price system, and in pricing of generics are already
yielding results and will produce important savings.
An important agreement was reached with health professionals that allowed a review of the
current legal framework for the organization on working time and mobility of staff. This is
also a step to improve the coverage of primary care services, which will reduce the use of
emergency care in unnecessary cases. We are working on an action plan for the
reorganization and rationalization of the hospital network in 2013.
Upon the adoption of the new Urban Lease, Renovation Works, and Urban Rehabilitation
laws, all necessary regulations have been published to allow for the extraordinary update of
the rents, for the establishment of sunset clauses in all of the old lease agreements (signed
before 1990), and for the extrajudicial eviction procedures for breach of contracts.
The horizontal legal framework on public professional associations was approved in
Parliament, which is an important step in liberalizing the exercise and activity of highly
regulated professions. The full transposition of the EU Services Directive is proceeding
rapidly, whereas the transposition of the Qualification Directive has already been completed.
Following the conclusion of the independent report on the main regulatory authorities, a new
regulatory architecture is being prepared with the drafting of the regulatory framework law
nearing an end.
We remain committed to following the necessary reforms to have a judicial system that
contributes to improving our business environment, having a faster resolution of conflicts, and
reducing the backlog cases. Upon the new Insolvency Code and the new Arbitrage Law
having come into force, and also the implementation of several measures to reduce the
backlog of enforcement cases, new important steps were taken, with the conclusion of the
new judicial map and of the revised Code of Civil Procedure, which were submitted to
Parliament.
Reducing the administrative burden for companies by simplifying licensing procedures at all
levels remains a priority.
With regard to the privatization process, the government successfully concluded the important
privatization of the airport concession ANA. The outcome exceeded expectations and will
generate overall revenue to the state of €3.08 billion. The program goal of €5 billion in
privatization proceeds is thus well within reach. The TAP privatization did not go ahead as
planned, as the single bidder did not present the necessary assurances required for the
transaction. The government will work to launch a new tender for the privatization of TAP as
soon as possible. We reaffirm our commitment to continuing with the privatization program,
which we consider to be an important tool for opening up the Portuguese economy, and to
bringing new investment that will increase Portugal's competitiveness in the medium term.
5 - Final Remark
The government is fully committed to pursuing the agenda of structural transformation of the
Portuguese economy in order to improve competitiveness and the potential GDP growth rate.
This transformation will lead to jobs creation, sustainable economic growth, and prosperity.
