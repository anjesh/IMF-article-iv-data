EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

The economy continues its modest recovery, driven by donor-related expenditure
and the resumption of activity in rural areas. The pace of growth is expected to pick
up in 2006 as reconstruction efforts intensify.

•

Macroeconomic policy over the medium term will be designed to support the
government’s reconstruction efforts, and create a stable macroeconomic
environment that will facilitate private sector development. To this end, the
government will therefore pursue balanced budgets on a cash basis for some time,
reflecting domestic and external financing constraints, supported by a monetary
policy geared to containing inflation.

•

Liberia faces daunting reconstruction challenges. The country’s physical
infrastructure is largely destroyed and its human capital eroded after many years of
intermittent conflict. Moreover, public institutions are largely dysfunctional and
corruption is endemic.

•

The new government has endorsed the Governance and Economic Management
Assistance Program (GEMAP) that aims to strengthen economic governance
and financial management and rebuild Liberia’s key economic institutions.
Reestablishment of confidence in these institutions is crucial to maintaining stability,
securing sustained external support and encouraging private investment.

•

Fiscal management deteriorated markedly toward the end of the National
Transitional Government of Liberia’s (NTGL) period in office, but corrective
measures are being taken by the new government. As a result of slow revenue
collection and excessive expenditures, sizable arrears emerged. The new government
has reestablished the Cash Management Committee (CMCo) to avoid further build-up
of domestic arrears.

•

The Central Bank of Liberia (CBL) is taking steps to strengthen its financial
position and has developed a framework for monetary operations and bank
restructuring. Further efforts, however, are required to eliminate its budget deficit.

•

To help build a policy track record, a staff-monitored program (SMP) has been
agreed for the period February–September 2006. The SMP is fully consistent with
the GEMAP as well as with the new government’s program of key priorities and
deliverables for the first 150 days of its term in office.

•

The SMP aims at achieving significant and irreversible progress in rebuilding
key government institutions. It is based on an ambitious set of quantitative and
structural benchmarks, the attainment of which is considered necessary to help
maintain the current momentum for economic reform.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Liberia faces daunting reconstruction challenges following about fifteen years of
intermittent civil war through 2003.1 The country’s physical infrastructure has been largely
destroyed, government institutions lack the basic capacity for economic management, and the
country’s once considerable human capital has been significantly eroded. Poverty in Liberia
is also pervasive, particularly in rural areas; real GDP per capita (in 2005 prices) is estimated
to have declined by almost 90 percent from US$1,269 in 1980 to US$163 in 2005.
Unemployment reportedly remains at over 80 percent, and a similar percentage of the
population subsists on less than US$1 a day, with no access to basic health, education, and
other social services.
2.
Little progress was made in implementing key reforms during the National
Transitional Government of Liberia’s (NTGL) term in office from late-2003 to midJanuary 2006. Consequently, only limited progress was made in improving Liberia’s
relations with the international community. UN sanctions on timber and diamond exports,
imposed in mid-2003, were extended further in late 2005. Liberia’s cooperation with the
Fund showed a modest improvement; while monthly token payments to the Fund were made
regularly, policy implementation deteriorated.2 During the last Article IV consultation
discussions in April 2005, Directors urged the authorities to formulate concrete action plans
to address weaknesses in financial management and economic governance. Despite advice
and support from Liberia’s international partners in these areas, the momentum of reform
weakened in the course of 2005.
3.
In light of growing concerns, the NTGL and Liberia’s key international partners
agreed in September 2005 on a long-term international assistance program to
strengthen governance and financial management. The key features of the Governance
and Economic Management Assistance Program (GEMAP) are: (i) improving financial
management and accountability in all key budgetary institutions and the Central Bank of
Liberia (CBL), inter alia by deploying international experts with binding co-signature
authority alongside Liberian counterparts; (ii) strengthening the judicial system, and
combating corruption; (iii) providing technical assistance to rebuild local capacity in
economic management; and (iv) joint oversight over the implementation of the program by a
steering committee chaired by the Head of State, and comprising key ministers and local

2003.

Liberia has been in continuous arrears to the Fund since 1984. A declaration of noncooperation was issued in 1986, and the country’s voting and related rights were suspended
in March 2003 because of a protracted lack of cooperation. At end-February 2006, Liberia’s
arrears to the Fund amounted to SDR 519 million, or 728 percent of quota. Liberia’s
forthcoming annual obligations are estimated at about SDR 11 million. The authorities have
made monthly token payments of US$50,000 since January 2004; payments were increased
to US$60,000 since November 2005.

donor representatives. The GEMAP is expected to become fully operational by mid-2006,
following the full deployment of international experts at key institutions, and could remain in
place until Liberia reaches the completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative.3
4.
The new President, Mrs. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, a former senior UNDP official,
was inaugurated on January 16, 2006.4,5 She expressed a strong desire to work with the
international community to rebuild Liberia’s shattered economy and endorsed the GEMAP.
As a first step to implementing a credible reform program that can be supported by the
international community, the government has worked closely with the international partners
to identify key objectives and deliverables for the first 150 days of the administration (the
remainder of the 2005/06 fiscal year).
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
A. Recent Economic Developments
5.
The economy continued to recover in 2005, largely driven by donor activities.
Real GDP is estimated to have grown by 5.3 percent in 2005, following a modest growth of
2.6 percent in 2004. This reflected the gradual improvement of security in rural areas, and
restoration of activity in those sectors benefiting from donor assistance (mainly the service
sector).6 Overall, economic activity in 2005 is estimated to have returned to about 75 percent
of the prewar level.

Price and exchange rate developments reflect the return of relative stability to
Liberia. Recently, however, there have been signs of a rise in inflation, in part reflecting
higher donor expenditure. The Liberian dollar has been trading in a range of 55–60 Liberian
dollars per U.S. dollar for the last 12 months.

7.
The external trade deficit has increased sharply during the postconflict period to
about 30 percent of GDP (Table 2). Exports have remained depressed, mainly on account of
the continued UN ban on timber and diamond exports and a gradual decline in rubber
production resulting from the neglect of rubber plantations. However, a high level of imports
has been sustained, driven by humanitarian aid, donor assistance, and the large presence of
UNMIL officials and peacekeepers in the country. International reserves have remained at a
very low level, reflecting in part the continued financial weakness of the CBL.
8.
Despite a strong recovery in both revenue and expenditure, fiscal management
deteriorated markedly toward the end of the NTGL’s period in office (Table 3).
Revenue collection increased by about 3½ percent of GDP in 2004 following the end of the

-8-

conflict, and this strong recovery continued in the first half of 2005, allowing a similar
expansion in total spending. However, collections slowed down significantly towards end2005, largely reflecting a breakdown of controls in customs and the delay in implementing
measures to strengthen revenue administration. At the same time, expenditure decisions were
taken in a non-transparent manner, circumventing the Cash Management Committee (CMCo)
which had been set up to avoid further accumulation of arrears. Excessive allotments granted
for some ministries by the Bureau of the Budget and the indiscriminate issuance of vouchers
by line ministries undermined a balanced cash-based budget, and sizeable domestic arrears
were incurred. At end-January 2006, domestic arrears accumulated under the NTGL
(excluding those to the CBL, and commercial banks) amounted to US$20 million, about 25
percent of the annual budget. In addition, the implemented budget deviated significantly from
its original structure, reflecting the latitude given to the head of state to authorize such
changes.
9.
The CBL succeeded in accommodating the increased demand for local currency
while largely avoiding pressures on prices and the exchange rate (Table 4). This was
achieved despite a considerable increase

10.
The banking sector continues to be weak. Commercial banks remain fragile due to
low profitability and poor asset quality. The CBL incurred a cash shortage on account of
substantial unserviced claims on the government, and continued to draw on its international
reserves to finance current outlays, resulting in a slower accumulation of foreign reserves
than had been expected.
11.
Governance concerns arose under the NTGL as new concessions and contracts,
mainly in natural resource sectors, were granted in a nontransparent manner and on terms
unfavorable to the Government. In addition, in 2004-05, EU-sponsored audits of the main
revenue-generating agencies and an ECOWAS audit of travel expenses revealed pervasive
mismanagement of public funds prior to and during the NTGL’s term of office.
12.
For 2006, the economy is expected to continue to recover, based on strong donor
inflows and a revival of rural activities, following the reestablishment of security and return
of refugees to their communities. Real GDP is projected to grow by about 8 percent, led by
agriculture and services. Notwithstanding the large donor presence, inflation is expected to
remain modest, being contained to single digits. With a gradual decline in rubber exports and
further increase in donor-funded imports, the trade deficit is projected to widen further.

-9-

III. DISCUSSION OF ECONOMIC POLICIES
13.
The discussions took place against a background of rising expectations for the
new government in the context of deep-rooted problems inherited from the past. The
new government has inherited largely dysfunctional public institutions and pervasive
governance problems, as well as challenges related to rebuilding Liberia’s destroyed physical
and social infrastructure. Expectations among the population for visible progress are
mounting while donors are insisting on significant and irreversible progress in rebuilding key
government institutions and raising economic growth.
A. Recent Reform Efforts
14.
Immediately following its inauguration, the new government implemented
several key steps to begin addressing long-standing problems. These included: (i) the
enforcement of pre-shipment inspections for imports and exports;7 (ii) more prudent budget
allotments for line ministries; (iii) the reestablishment of the CMCo to contain expenditures
within available cash revenues; and (iv) the initiation of a review of all concessions and
contracts signed by the NTGL. The CBL, while still running a cash deficit, is also taking
steps to strengthen its budgetary management.
15.
The new government also formulated a comprehensive program for its first 150
days in office, in collaboration with donors.8 Regarding economic policy, the government
specifically aims to: (i) establish sound financial management and budgeting, (ii) increase
revenue and control expenditure, and (iii) implement the GEMAP.
B. Medium-Term Outlook and Policies
16.
The authorities indicated that macroeconomic policy over the medium term will
be designed to support the government’s reconstruction efforts, and create a stable
macroeconomic environment that will facilitate private sector development. To this end,
the government will pursue balanced budgets on a cash basis for some time, reflecting
domestic and external financing constraints, supported by a monetary policy geared to
containing inflation.
17.
The government stressed that a key element of its strategy in the short- and
medium-term would be to achieve significant progress in rebuilding key institutions, as
envisaged under the GEMAP (Box 1). This includes putting in place a functioning
budgetary process, including planning, execution, internal controls, and regular reporting, as

petroleum imports.

The program covers four broad categories: security, economic revitalization, basic services
and infrastructure, and governance.

well as strengthening the main revenue-generating agencies so that they can fulfill their role
in a fully transparent and accountable fashion.
18.
The authorities agreed that reestablishment of confidence in Liberia’s key
economic institutions and improving the business climate would be crucial to securing
sustained external support and attracting private investment, but also stressed that Liberia’s
reconstruction would require sustained external financial and technical assistance. To this
end, the authorities have fully endorsed the GEMAP, with a view to establishing a sustained
track record of economic management. Such a track record would be a prerequisite for
Liberia to make progress toward normalizing relations with international financial
institutions and eventually addressing its debt overhang.
19.
The authorities and the staff agreed that the main fiscal challenges are to
strengthen revenue collection and improve expenditure control so as to channel
available resources to poverty-reducing activities, while ensuring sufficient
transparency and accountability. In light of external and domestic financing constraints,
the authorities agreed that the budget should remain balanced for some time. There is also a
need to make the main revenue-generating agencies fully transparent and accountable, and
channel their collections fully to the budget, as envisaged under the GEMAP.
20.
In the monetary sector, the key actions in the period ahead include
strengthening the CBL and the banking system, and introducing additional monetary
policy instruments to enable a more active policy over the medium term for
maintaining low inflation. Further efforts will be required to address the weak financial
position of the CBL and to restructure fragile commercial banks. To expand the scope for an
active monetary policy, the staff suggested that the CBL consider the development of
additional instruments as the expected increase in the demand for local currency gradually
widens the scope for monetary policy in the as-yet highly dollarized economy.9
21.
The authorities pointed to Liberia’s large external debt overhang as a key
constraint to securing financing for their reconstruction efforts, and attracting potential
foreign investment. The staff stressed that the establishment of a strong track record of
implementing reforms and prudent policies would be key to making progress toward the
resolution of the debt overhang.

9

At present, the only effective instruments are reserve requirements and foreign exchange
auctions.

- 11 -

Box 1: Medium-Term Prospects for Liberian Economy
To illustrate the positive effects of economic reforms, the staff prepared two medium-term scenarios. The basic
assumption underlying both scenarios is that the government will be pursuing prudent macroeconomic policies,
but the two scenarios differ in the assumed pace of structural reforms, the scale of aid inflows, and the timing of
the lifting of UN sanctions.
The “baseline scenario” assumes that strong
implementation of reforms under the GEMAP
will trigger significant financial and technical
support from donors. In addition, the early
establishment of an environment conducive to
private investment and the lifting of UN sanctions
on timber and diamond exports in 2007 could
potentially attract large FDI flows. A strong
recovery in real output growth in forestry and
minerals is assumed to support higher real GDP
growth of about 8 percent annually during 200610.

The “lower-case scenario” is premised on a
slower pace of reform and lower level of donor support, which would allow only modest growth, insufficient to
create significant new employment opportunities, or raise living standards. Real GDP would grow by about
4 percent annually as existing capacity is gradually brought back into production. As a consequence, the real
GDP per capita would be lower by 15 percent by 2010 than under the baseline scenario. Compared with the
baseline scenario, FDI flows are assumed to be lower by 2–3 percent of GDP, and inflation would also be
lower, reflecting less demand pressure due to lower donor inflows.

reconstruction needs and assumed strong policy performance that would likely elicit continued strong donor support.

4/ This scenario, based on weaker policy performance, assumes donor inflows equal to two-thirds of those in the baseline.

C. Fiscal Issues
22.
The government needs to contain its expenditure within available resources
under the current difficult financing environment, while persisting with efforts to
strengthen revenue collection. Current efforts to strengthen public revenues are expected to
raise the ratio relative to GDP to around 15–16 percent in the coming years. This increase in
revenues, together with possible donor assistance, should be channeled toward poverty
reducing expenditures.
23.
In light of the crucial importance of reestablishing a functioning and transparent
budget process, the discussions focused on the long-standing weaknesses of financial
management and the measures to strengthen fiscal policies in the short term. Immediate
actions are needed to enhance revenue collection and strengthen expenditure control,
consistent with previous technical assistance recommendations. For the remainder of the
2005/06 fiscal year,10 the government agreed to a balanced cash budget that prioritizes
expenditures in order to maintain its core functions and to ensure the clearance of recent civil
service pay arrears.
24.
On the revenue side, the authorities are fully committed to implementing key
revenue-enhancing measures. They agreed with the need to strengthen the Large Taxpayer
Unit (LTU), through creating an audit unit within the LTU, in order to further enhance
revenue collection efficiency. From a medium-term perspective, the authorities have
requested technical assistance from the Fund on tax policy reforms to broaden Liberia’s
revenue base and to reduce gradually its dependence on trade taxation.
25.
The staff also stressed the importance of ensuring equitable treatment of tax
payers and enhancing transparency. To this end, the authorities agreed to: (i) discontinue
the current practice of allowing settlement of tax obligations through the delivery of goods or
services; (ii) establish a program to address overdue tax/duty obligations; and (iii) review and
rationalize the extensive list of duty exemptions. Furthermore, as envisaged under the
GEMAP, transparency in resource flows from revenue-generating agencies is to be enhanced
with the placement of external experts as financial controllers at these agencies.
26.
On the expenditure side, the staff emphasized the importance of strengthening
commitment control, as well as proper cash management, to avoid the emergence of
domestic arrears (Box 2). The authorities agreed with this view, and committed to fully
implement a comprehensive commitment control system by end-June 2006.

Box 2. Expenditure Management System in Liberia
To establish discipline in expenditure management in the context of limited local capacity, the NTGL
first centralized all its accounts at the CBL, and then established a cash management system (under
the CMCo), and took preliminary steps to implement an interim commitment control system in mid2004, based on Fund technical assistance.
However, these systems failed to work as intended during the last two years, primarily owing to the
lack of cooperation within the NTGL, and insufficient checks and balances within the system.
Specifically, the following deficiencies were observed:
(1) Indiscriminate allotments for line ministries by the Bureau of the Budget (BoB) without
consultation with the Ministry of Finance (MoF) about actual revenue collection.
(2) Commitments made by line ministries in excess of their allotments. Purchasing orders were
deemed official commitments without the approval of the Bureau of General Auditing (BGA)
at the MoF.
(3) Spending decisions made outside the CMCo.
The new government has committed to address these problems and take decisive actions to strengthen
expenditure control, as envisaged under the GEMAP. Specifically, the following steps have been
taken under the new government:
(1) The BoB shall make allotments in consultation with the MoF. The BoB is scheduled to be
merged into the MoF by July 2006.
(2) The government will make a public announcement that it will certify commitments and
validate all purchase orders with the BGA stamp in order to avoid over-commitments by line
ministries.
(3) External experts are in place at the CMCo and the CBL with co-signatory authority to make
sure no disbursements are made on the margin of the CMCo. The CMCo documents are also
being publicized on the MoF’s web site.

27.
The authorities agreed with the staff that any additional resources should be
spent for poverty reducing expenditures. The staff noted that progress with the reform
effort is likely to attract grants, also in the form of budgetary support, once the budget
process has been sufficiently strengthened. Together with higher revenue, these resources
should be channeled toward basic infrastructure and social services in the context of the
poverty reduction strategy that will be developed through a consultative process. The
authorities indicated an intention to prepare an interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (IPRSP) by end-September 2006.
28.
To improve the budgetary process, the government intends to enhance
transparency and accountability. As a first step, the government plans to introduce new
legislation by mid-2006 that would limit the discretion granted to the administration to
change budget allocations without legislative approval. In addition, the budget will be posted
on the website of the Ministry of Finance with regularly updated information on progress in
implementation.

- 14 -

D. Monetary and Exchange Rate Issues
29.
The staff continues to support the CBL’s monetary policy framework which has
helped to hold inflation to about 7 percent in 2005. This framework, which was
formulated with MFD technical assistance, recognizes that in the highly dollarized and very
open Liberian economy, the exchange rate is the main transmission mechanism through
which monetary imbalances affect prices. Moreover, the CBL lacks credible monetary
indicators that capture U.S. dollar liabilities. Against this background, and in view of
uncertainty about the pace of increase in the demand for local currency in rural areas, the
CBL will continue to use the exchange rate as an indicator of domestic monetary conditions
and gear its management of Liberian dollar liquidity to maintaining broad stability in the
exchange rate.
30.
The staff cautioned that trends in the demand for local currency in Liberia’s
highly dollarized environment should be carefully assessed.11 In response, the CBL noted
that, for 2006, a further strengthening in the demand for Liberian dollars would be expected
with a further rebound in economic activity as internally displaced persons and refugees
continue to return to their rural homes, and a continued recovery in other economic activity
on account of the strengthening of internal security. The staff suggested that the money
supply in local currency should be cautiously expanded to maintain a broadly stable
exchange rate, and also stressed that scarce foreign reserves should not be used to defend the
exchange rate in the event of downward pressure due to exogenous shocks. The CBL
concurred with this view.
31.
From a medium-term perspective, the staff encouraged the CBL to explore the
scope for expanding an active monetary policy. For this purpose, the CBL noted that it
planned to prepare for (i) the introduction of purchase auctions of foreign exchange, (ii) the
establishment of a liquidity monitoring framework, and (iii) over the medium-term, the
development of money and capital markets. The staff broadly agreed with the approach but
stressed that the use of securities (either government- or central bank-issued) should only be
considered once the current unsustainable public debt and the weak financial position of the
CBL have been fully addressed.
32.
The authorities informed the staff that a Money Management Committee had
been established, but that at this stage the Committee had been primarily engaged in
administrative issues. The staff welcomed the establishment of the Committee, but urged the
authorities to expand its mandate to also include responsibility for the preparation of
monetary operations and the implementation of monetary policy.
33.
The banking system remains fragile and undercapitalized (Box 3). In light of the
weakness of the banking sector, the staff encouraged the CBL to continue to monitor closely
developments in the banking sector, to fully implement regulatory guidelines related to credit
risk management, and to develop restructuring plans for undercapitalized banks that are fully

- 15 -

consistent with the Bank Restructuring and Resolution Policy formulated in 2005 with MFD
technical assistance. The CBL noted that a resident supervisor had been placed at one bank,
and that restructuring plans had already been developed for two banks. Plans for the
remaining banks were expected to be developed by end-March 2006. In addition, the
authorities indicated that no new bank licenses would be granted for the time being.

The banking sector is highly liquid but remains fragile. The overall risk-weighted capital
adequacy ratio has been negative; the nonperforming loan ratio remained high at close to 20
percent at end-2005. The income structure is also weak, with substantial reliance on noninterest income (i.e., fees and commissions), representing around 80 percent of total revenue.
34.
The staff noted with concern the continued weakness in the financial position of
the CBL, despite a significant retrenchment program in early 2005, and urged it to take
steps to eliminate the cash deficit.12 The CBL supported this objective, but noted that that
the budget for 2006 would have to accommodate commitments made by the previous
management of the CBL.13,14 The CBL agreed to target a balanced current budget (excluding
the capital spending and one-off costs relating to the retirement of the previous executive
management) for the remainder of the year. Furthermore, to help facilitate efforts toward
prudent expenditure management, and to enhance transparency, the new management of the

The government’s failure to service its debts to the CBL, which are denominated in U.S.
dollars, leads to the cash deficit and lower CBL net foreign assets. The level of Liberian
dollar base money is unchanged. Although U.S. dollar currency in circulation in Liberia will
be higher, the magnitude is small relative to the quantity of U.S. dollars in the economy.

E. Governance Issues
35.
The staff is encouraged that the GEMAP is being implemented in full
collaboration with Liberia’s international partners. Regular meetings among the
government and local donor representatives are being held to operationalize the GEMAP and
review its implementation, while external experts have already been posted at the Ministry of
Finance and the CBL, helping to ensure the full functioning of the CMCo. Other experts will
be deployed at key revenue-generating agencies by mid-2006.15
36.
The staff discussed with the new government their plan to strengthen
governance and combat corruption. Specifically, it endorsed the government’s goal of
formulating a national anti-corruption strategy, drawing on the recent anti-corruption
program studies by UNDP and the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID).
The new government also intends to request support from international experts for help with
the investigation of serious fraud, corruption and economic crimes.
37.
The staff encouraged the new government to take all steps necessary to allow for
the lifting of UN sanctions on timber and diamond exports (Box 4). The new government
is currently working with key external partners toward fulfilling the conditions for a lifting of
the sanctions on timber exports.

15

Three more experts are expected at key revenue-generating agencies by end-April.

- 17 -

Box 4. United Nations (UN) Sanctions on Liberian Diamonds and Timber
In 2003, the UN Security Council imposed sanctions on Liberian diamond and timber
exports.16 The sanctions resulted from the recognition that revenue from the illicit trade in
diamonds and timber played a major role in fueling West African conflict.
In December 2005, the Council determined that insufficient progress had been made for
lifting of sanctions and renewed the measures for a further period of six months. A panel of
UN experts will assess the progress made towards meeting the conditions for lifting the
measures and report to the Council in June 2006.17
The new government is planning to take the following actions:
•

Timber: Following a public announcement nullifying all existing forestry
concessions in January 2006, the government plans to allocate future concessions
using the Public Procurement and Concession Act of 2005 guidelines, which require
competitive bidding. The authorities are also planning a system to establish control
over forest resources.

•

Diamond: To remove the ban on diamond exports, the authorities are planning to
establish an effective Certificate of Origin regime for trade in Liberian rough
diamonds that is transparent and internationally verifiable with a view to joining the
Kimberly process.
F. Donor Activities and Technical Assistance

38.
Following the 2003 peace agreement, donor activities in Liberia have increased
sharply. Donor disbursements are estimated at US$460 million during 2004–2005 and
projected to continue at a similar pace in 2006 (Box 5). These donor funds are spent entirely
outside the government’s budget. The authorities expressed concerns about the lack of
budget support but recognized that past governance problems made it difficult for donors to
provide resources in this form. The staff agreed that improved governance and greater
transparency and accountability in the use of public resources were a precondition for budget
support in the future.

16

While diamond mining played a minor role in the economy prior to the sanctions, the
timber sector constituted about 18 percent of real GDP, 5 percent of formal sector
employment, and 60 percent of exports in 2002.

17

To remove the timber sanctions, the Council called on the authorities, with the assistance
of the international community, to establish transparent accounting mechanisms, to review
concessions, and to promote development of sustainable forest management.

The GEMAP also serves as a key framework to coordinate the activities of
international donors to ensure effective and efficient technical assistance. The United
States provides assistance in budget preparation, and forestry management. The EU intends
to focus on economic governance, based on its above-mentioned audits as well as providing
support for the financial controllers of the major state-owned enterprises. The Fund and the
World Bank closely coordinate their work on expenditure management. The Fund has also
taken the lead in tax and customs administration and financial sector issues, while the World
Bank focuses on procurement, forestry and public enterprise reform, and community-driven
development.

- 19 -

G. Public Debt
40.
Liberia’s external debt is clearly unsustainable. According to preliminary data for
end-2005, the stock of external public debt, most of which has been in arrears, amounted to
US$3.7 billion in nominal terms (Table 5). At end-2005, the NPV of debt to GDP and
exports ratios were 790 percent and 3,040 percent, respectively, well above the relevant debt
sustainability thresholds of the LIC DSA framework (Appendix II).18
41.
Liberia’s records on external debt were largely lost during the period of conflict.
The authorities have attempted to contact their external creditors to obtain loan documents on
their external debt obligations. Responses have been incomplete, particularly regarding
commercial debt as the holders of those claims are in many cases no longer the original
creditors. The staff urged the authorities to make further efforts to fully reconcile their
external debt data with that of creditors as this would be an essential ingredient in moving
Liberia eventually to the decision point under the HIPC Initiative. The authorities indicated
that they would not contract or guarantee any new public sector external debt before the debt
overhang has been resolved.
42.
Liberia’s debt problem is further compounded by a sizable, but uncertain, stock
of domestic arrears. The authorities estimate the stock of unverified domestic arrears at
about US$0.7 billion, most of which is to the CBL and commercial banks, although there are
also significant arrears on salaries and pensions and to suppliers. The staff urged the
authorities to complete the verification of all outstanding domestic claims, as a precursor for
the development of a domestic debt resolution strategy. Several options for domestic debt
resolution have been proposed by US experts, all of which call for a substantial discount
from the face value of the claims.19 The staff noted that a strategy would need to be
developed to normalize relations with creditors. It also stressed that, in light of the adverse
implications for the domestic banking sector, restructuring strategies for both commercial
banks and the CBL would need to be defined in advance.20 The authorities concurred with
these views.
H. Trade Regime and Competitiveness
43.
Liberia’s external competitiveness has been severely eroded by the destruction of
infrastructure and loss of human capital as a result of internal conflict. Lack of reliable
economic data prevents the computation of standard indicators of external competitiveness.
18

The thresholds for a country ranked as a poor policy performer according to the World
Bank’s CPIA index are 30 percent and 100 percent, respectively.

19

These options envisage a larger reduction (80-90 percent of the obligations) for larger
creditors (with a claim more than US$1 million), and less for smaller creditors.

20

In December 2005, the government debt to the commercial banks accounted for 9 percent
of total assets, and for the CBL, government debt accounted for 58 percent of total assets.

- 20 -

The nominal exchange rate of the Liberian dollar vis-à-vis the US dollar has stabilized over
the last two years. The authorities did not see domestic cost levels as a major obstacle to
business activity. In their view, the lack of basic infrastructure (transport and
telecommunications) and utilities (electricity, water, sanitation) presented a far more
significant hurdle to commercial and export activities. They also recognized that an uncertain
business climate brought on by an unstable political situation and erratic regulatory
implementation discourages domestic or foreign investment. The staff agreed that the
creation of a stable business environment, with predictable application of laws and
regulations, would be crucial to fostering private sector development.21
44.
Import tariffs are set at a relatively moderate level ranging from 2.5 to
25 percent.22 The staff encouraged the authorities to take stock of their tariff regime and
consider the benefits of regional and international trade integration. The authorities indicated
a desire to harmonize Liberia’s trade regime with that of ECOWAS; they saw a
harmonization of goods classification with international standards as a first step in that
direction. The authorities also expressed interest in seeking fast-track membership of the
WTO.
I. Relations with the Fund
45.
The staff welcomed the authorities’ efforts to improve relations with the Fund.
In a clear departure from the past, the commitment to policy implementation has already
been illustrated through the quick steps taken to address long-standing problems in fiscal
management and economic governance. Furthermore, the prospects for maintaining the
current momentum in policy reforms are encouraging in view of the agreement reached on
the SMP as well as the new government’s strong desire to work with the international
community as envisaged under the GEMAP. The staff acknowledged the authorities’
intention to continue monthly token payments of US$60,000 to the Fund, as well as to make
regular payments to the World Bank and the AfDB.23 The staff explained that a continuation
of regular payments and implementation of sound policies would form the basis for the
Fund’s Executive Board to consider whether to commence the process of de-escalating the
Fund’s remedial measures against Liberia.24 Moreover, the staff noted that, if sufficient
21

The Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) recently reported on the investment
climate in Liberia, and identified several key obstacles, including (i) the large-scale informal
sector which impedes fair competition, (ii) weak law enforcement, and (iii) low capacity in
the public and private sector.

22

In exceptional cases, a rate of 42.5 percent is charged. Export taxes are 2.5 percent on
unprocessed goods and 4 percent on precious metals.

23
24

US$25,000 per month to the former and US$15,000 to the latter.

In cases of protracted arrears to the Fund, the Fund can take four main remedial measures
against a member country; declaration of ineligibility; declaration of noncooperation;
suspension of voting rights; and compulsory withdrawal from the Fund’s membership. The
(continued)

- 21 -

financing assurances and resources for eventual debt relief become available, strong
performance under the SMP could form a basis for a subsequent rights accumulation
program (RAP), which in turn could lead to a comprehensive arrears clearance operation, a
decision point under the HIPC initiative, and eventually to eligibility under the MDRI.25
J. Data Issues
46.
Serious data deficiencies continue to hamper surveillance. The authorities
acknowledged the need to prepare timely and reliable national income and balance of
payments statistics. In January 2006, the authorities began compiling data for a new
consumer price basket, which is expected to replace the previous basket in January 2007. The
staff welcomed improvements in the quality of monetary statistics (also reflecting Fund
technical assistance), but regretted little improvements in the reliability of fiscal information,
attributable to the neglect of a monthly reconciliation exercise based on the account
statements from the CBL. The authorities agreed to conduct the exercise on a regular basis.
IV. PROGRAM RISKS AND MONITORING
47.
Despite the authorities’ stated commitment to economic reforms, considerable
risks remain. Peace and security remain fragile, and obtaining political support from the
legislature will be important to support the efforts of the new government. On the policy side,
the authorities will also require technical assistance from the international community to
achieve some of the key structural benchmarks, including formulating strategies on domestic
debt resolution and bank restructuring, and completing the review of the concessions and
contracts.
48.
A committee comprising key officials will closely monitor program
implementation. Also, as indicated in the authorities’ technical memorandum of
understanding (TMU)(Appendix I, Attachment II), reports on program implementation will
be communicated to Fund staff through the Resident Representative on a regular basis. The
quantitative and structural benchmarks are specified in Tables 1 and 2 of the MEFP. The
three test dates for the staff-monitored program are set at end-March, end-June, and endSeptember 2006.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
49.
As a postconflict country, Liberia faces daunting reconstruction challenges.
Government institutions have a weak capacity for economic management. Decisive and
de-escalation of these remedial measures, however, can be considered, following a sustained
period of cooperation on both economic policies and payments to the Fund and with firm
prospects of its continuation.
25

Under the current sunset clause of the enhanced HIPC Initiative, Liberia would need to
have started a Fund-supported program by end-December 2006.

- 22 -

continued efforts are required to reduce pervasive poverty and high unemployment, and to
put the country on track toward sustainable economic recovery.
50.
Liberia’s recent history of policy implementation has been poor. This has
reflected limited local capacity and a lack of political will to address long-standing
governance problems. While the NTGL agreed to the GEMAP, it is regrettable that economic
governance and fiscal management continued to deteriorate further toward the end of the
NTGL’s period in office. As a consequence, the new government has inherited a severely
mismanaged economy, characterized by endemic corruption and dysfunctional public
institutions.
51.
Rebuilding Liberia’s economy and reducing pervasive poverty requires
immediate and decisive action. In particular the authorities should focus on reestablishing
an effective budget process and strengthening capacity in key economic institution to
improve economic governance. The new government’s endorsement of the GEMAP is
welcome, and it is important that GEMAP experts are quickly put in place for the program to
become fully operational.
52.
The staff is encouraged that the new government has already implemented
several important measures to address long-standing governance problems. Key recent
actions include rigorous enforcement of pre-shipment inspections for imports and exports,
more prudent budget allotments for line ministries, and reestablishment of the CMCo to
contain expenditures within available cash revenues.
53.
Effective implementation of the public expenditure management framework is
critical to channel scarce resources to their most effective uses. In view of past problems,
it is imperative that the Bureau of the Budget is brought into the Ministry of Finance, that the
interim commitment control system is fully implemented so that only purchase orders with
the Bureau of General Accounting’s seal are considered valid, and that legislation is enacted
to limit the power of the administration to change budget priorities and allotments between
line ministries without prior legislative approval. These actions will provide greater certainty
to line ministries and allow the CMCo to work effectively, so as to ensure that government
spending is limited to available cash and that domestic arrears are not incurred.
54.
Raising the level of fiscal revenues is imperative if the government is to start
meeting the most critical needs of the Liberian people. Key steps include: continuation of
rigorous enforcement of pre-shipment inspections; maintaining security at the port, ensuring
that all duties are paid, including on rice and petroleum; and reviewing the numerous tax and
duty exemptions granted by the NTGL.
55.
Liberia requires continued strong support from the international donor
community. The authorities’ 150 day plan represents an important reform agenda, which
aims to start irreversible change through rebuilding key government institutions, maintaining
and strengthening security, and meeting some of the urgent needs of the population. Looking
ahead, it will be important for the government to initiate a consultative process for the
development of a poverty reduction strategy focusing on the maintenance of macroeconomic
stability, the provision of basic social services, and strengthening the climate for private

- 23 -

sector development and investment. Strengthening public expenditure management systems
and governance will be essential to permit an increasing share of donor support to be
channeled through the budget.
56.
The staff considers that the current monetary policy framework, aiming to
contain inflation by maintaining a stable exchange rate, continues to be appropriate in
view of the high degree of dollarization of the domestic economy, and in the absence of
other credible monetary indicators. However, the authorities should stand ready to
accommodate increased demand for the Liberian dollar, and should not use scarce foreign
exchange reserves to defend the exchange rate in the event of downward pressure due to
exogenous shocks.
57.
The staff is concerned that the CBL has been drawing on its reserves to finance
its cash deficit. However, the new CBL management’s resolve to strengthen the CBL’s
financial position is encouraging. This will require ensuring that staffing and capital spending
costs are strictly controlled, as well as effectively implementing the recently introduced
procurement guidelines that apply to all the public institutions. It is important to move as
quickly as possible to a balanced budget in the CBL’s operations, both in view of the very
low level of official reserves, the liquidity impact of a cash deficit, and because of the need to
secure support for the eventual restructuring of the CBL.
58.
The staff welcomes the new government’s resolve to address long-standing
economic governance concerns, as envisaged under the GEMAP. Specifically, it is
important to develop quickly a national anti-corruption strategy and a domestic debt
resolution strategy in collaboration with international partners. It will also be critical to make
fast progress in fulfilling the requirements for the lifting of UN sanctions, which would have
a significant and positive impact on economic activity and government revenues.
59.
There is a critical need to build on the first encouraging steps to reconstruct a
core statistical database to enable effective economic policy making. The authorities
should seek further technical assistance from external partners in this area, especially on the
national accounts, consumer price index, and balance of payments, as well as basic data on
social indicators. To help reconstruct the statistical database, the Fund is planning to extend
further technical assistance in the areas of fiscal and monetary operations.
60.
The staff is encouraged by the government’s enthusiasm and determination to
implement a policy of zero tolerance for corruption and to strengthen the effectiveness
of public institutions. However, past experience has shown the difficulty of implementing
new measures in an environment of highly constrained resources and capacities. The staff
therefore urges the authorities to ensure that each government agency cooperates fully in
bringing to fruition these systemic improvements. Effort also needs to be made to utilize the
available technical assistance effectively so that capacity is developed in ministries to
transform current plans in these areas into reality.
61.
The SMP is centered on ambitious macroeconomic and structural benchmarks.
This program also provides a window of opportunity to make progress toward the eventual
resolution of Liberia’s debt overhang. Satisfactory implementation of the SMP would

- 24 -

provide a basis for the Fund to consider the de-escalation of the remedial measures that the
Fund has imposed on Liberia. Moreover, if sufficient indications of support from donors are
forthcoming, strong performance under the SMP could form a basis for a subsequent

APPENDIX I

Monrovia, April 12, 2006
Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
USA
Dear Mr. de Rato,
As you know, the Liberian economy has suffered significant setbacks during the past
fifteen years on account of civil conflicts, and economic mismanagement by successive
governments. The task of reconstructing the Liberian economy is immense, but we believe
that we will succeed in this important undertaking.
A key element of the government’s strategy is to demonstrate a decisive departure
from historical practices in order to maintain public support for the difficult challenges that
lie ahead. In support of this, the Liberian government is committed to implementing an
economic and financial program to be monitored by IMF staff for the period through
September 2006, with a view to commencing the task of rebuilding key public institutions,
restoring credible financial management, and accelerating structural reforms. Such a program
should facilitate our dialogue with multilateral and bilateral donors and the eventual deescalation of the remedial measures previously imposed by the IMF on Liberia. We also hope
that the successful execution of the program would pave the way toward a subsequent Fundsupported arrangement and eventually lead to the resolution of Liberia’s debt overhang.
The policies and measures set forth in the attached memorandum (Attachment I)
reflect the understandings reached with the IMF staff during the February 2006 Article IV
mission, which we believe can achieve the objectives of the program. We will, however, take
any additional measures that may become necessary for this purpose. We will remain in close
consultation with IMF staff on the adoption of such measures, and in advance of any
revisions to the policies contained in the MEFP. The government will provide the IMF staff
with all information that it requests to assess the implementation of the staff-monitored
program. A Technical Memorandum of Understanding defining the indicative targets of the
staff-monitored program and the data to be reported is also attached (Attachment II).
Sincerely yours,
/s/
Joseph Mills Jones
Governor of the CBL

Liberia
Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies
The Government’s Economic Program
for the period February – September 2006
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Following the signing of the peace agreement in Accra, the National Transitional
Government of Liberia (NTGL) took office in October 2003. In parallel, the UN established
a peace-keeping mission in Liberia (UNMIL), and security in the country gradually
improved. Economic management, however, did not improve due to the lack of cooperation
within the NTGL. Presidential elections in October and November 2005 took place in a
relatively secure environment. Mrs. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, who won the run-off election on
November 8, was inaugurated as President of Liberia on January 16, 2006. The new
government inherited a severely mismanaged economy, characterized by endemic corruption
and dysfunctional public institutions. The new government is formulating a “150-day plan”
of priority short-term reforms and deliverables. The plan is fully consistent with the
Governance and Economic Management Assistance Program (GEMAP)1, and underpins the
economic program for the period February-September 2006 described in this Memorandum
on Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) that will be monitored by the staff of the IMF.
The key features of the GEMAP are described in Attachment III.
II. CURRENT ECONOMIC SITUATION
2.
Liberia’s recent history has left deep marks on the population and economy. Poverty
is pervasive; real GDP per capita (in 2005 prices) is estimated to have declined by almost
90 percent from US$1,269 in 1980 to US$163 in 2005; unemployment is estimated to be
over 80 percent; a large share of the population was displaced by conflict; the most recent
household survey, conducted by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in 2000,
indicated that 76 percent of the population was living on less than US$1 per day;
malnutrition and disease, including tuberculosis, cholera, malaria, and yellow fever are
prevalent; and about one-fourth of infants die before reaching the age of 5. Liberia’s
HIV/AIDS prevalence rate is estimated at about 10-12 percent. The destruction of both
physical infrastructure (roads, railways, electricity and water, and telecommunications) and
human capital (through armed conflict, emigration, lack of access to education, and poor
health) have serious consequences for Liberia’s growth potential. In addition, efforts to

Prior to the elections, the NTGL agreed with key international partners on a long-term
international assistance program to strengthen governance and financial management in light
of increasing concerns over public financial management and the indiscriminate granting of
concessions for Liberia’s timber and mineral sectors.

- 34 -

ATTACHMENT I

formulate and implement consistent macroeconomic policy is severely hampered by the lack
of management capacity in government institutions and accurate and timely data.
3.
Economic developments in 2003-2005 closely mirror political events; driven by
domestic instability and a UN ban on exports of timber and diamonds2, real GDP declined by
about 31 percent in 2003. Real output growth is estimated to have been 2.6 percent and
5.3 percent respectively in the subsequent two years in line with the gradual improvement in
security in rural areas, and restoration of activity in those sectors benefiting from donor
assistance (mainly the service sector). The volatility in prices and the exchange rate declined
following the cessation of hostilities in mid-2003. Recently, however there have been signs
of a rise in prices, in part reflecting higher donor expenditure. The exchange rate vis-à-vis the
U.S. dollar has returned to preconflict levels (following a depreciation of about 23 percent in
2002), and is currently trading in a range of 55–57 Liberian dollars per U.S. dollar.
4.
Fiscal management deteriorated markedly toward the end of the NTGL’s period in
office. Revenue collection stagnated towards end-2005, largely reflecting a breakdown of
controls in customs, while expenditure decisions were taken in a non-transparent manner,
circumventing the Cash Management Committee (CMCo) which had been established
earlier. Excessive allotments granted for some ministries by the Bureau of the Budget and the
indiscriminate issuance of vouchers by line ministries undermined a balanced cash-based
budget. As a result, sizeable domestic arrears were accumulated. At end-January 2006,
domestic arrears accumulated under the NTGL (excluding those to the Central Bank of
Liberia (CBL) and commercial banks) amounted to US$20 million, about 25 percent of the
annual budget.
5.
Governance concerns arose as new concessions and contracts, mainly in the mineral
sectors, were granted in a nontransparent manner and on unfavorable terms. In addition, in
2004–05, EU-sponsored audits of the main revenue-generating agencies and an ECOWAS
audit on travel expenses also revealed pervasive mismanagement of public funds prior to and
during the transitional government’s term of office.
6.
The banking sector continues to be weak. Commercial banks remain fragile due to
low profitability and poor asset quality. Nevertheless, operating banks are liquid, reflecting
an increase in donor-related deposits and the low demand for loans from the private sector in
the fragile economic environment. The CBL, incurring an income shortfall on account of
substantial unserviced claims on the government, has drawn on its international reserves to
finance outlays, resulting in a slower accumulation of foreign reserves than had been
expected.
7.
The external environment remains difficult, even though donor assistance has
increased to levels substantially higher than during the pre-conflict era. While imports almost

played in fueling conflict in the region and of concerns over the gross mismanagement of
economic resources.

- 35 -

ATTACHMENT I

doubled in 2004, and remained at that level in 2005, exports have remained at low levels on
account of the UN ban on the export of timber and diamonds. The overall balance of
payments deficit rose further in 2004 and 2005, financed largely by a further accumulation of
external payments arrears. Liberia’s external debt has been in arrears for more than two
decades, and is unsustainable; at end-2005, the ratio of debt to exports was estimated at about
3,040 percent, while the ratio of debt to GDP amounted to about 790 percent.
III. THE GOVERNMENT’S ECONOMIC PROGRAM: FEBRUARY – SEPTEMBER 2006
8.
Following about fifteen years of intermittent civil war, Liberia faces daunting
challenges to put in place a policy framework that will support economic recovery, and begin
to address the pervasive poverty. To meet these challenges, the government established the
Liberia Reconstruction and Development Committee (LRDC) to implement a broad
development strategy under four pillars: (i) economic revitalization; (ii) infrastructure and
basic services; (iii) governance and the rule of law; and (iv) security. A key element of the
government’s strategy in the short run will be to achieve significant progress in rebuilding
key government institutions. It will aim to: (i) re-establish a functioning budgetary process
(planning, execution, internal and external controls, and regular reporting); (ii) rebuild the
main revenue-generating agencies so that they can fulfill their role in a fully transparent and
accountable fashion; and (iii) make the operations of the CBL and the banking system fully
market-based and transparent. To this end, the government has already implemented a
number of important measures to improve public finance management and enhance
transparency, including: (i) fully enforcing pre-shipment inspections by the pre-shipment
verification company, BIVAC; (ii) ensuring prudent allotments by the Bureau of the Budget
for line ministries in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance; (iii) reestablishing the
CMCo to contain spending commitments within available cash revenues; and (iv) developing
a plan for reviewing all concessions and contracts signed by the NTGL, and placing a
moratorium on awarding new concessions until a transparent bidding process has been
established.
9.
The government’s program assumes effective implementation of the GEMAP,
prudent macroeconomic policies, the gradual revitalization of exports once UN sanctions are
lifted, and post-war reconstruction. Real GDP is projected to grow by around 7–8 percent in
2006. Average annual inflation is projected to remain modest at around 8 percent, anchored
on a stable exchange rate. The trade deficit is projected to widen further as the growth of
donor-financed imports rise by more than exports. Official reserves, are projected to increase
modestly, with the cover of non-donor financed imports rising from 0.5 months at end-2005
to 0.8 months at end-2006. Given Liberia’s resource constraints and low level of income,
restoration of physical infrastructure and achieving sustained high economic growth will
require substantial external support for an extended period.
10.
The government will also initiate the development of a poverty reduction strategy
aimed at restoring basic social services, and addressing the “Monrovia-bias” that fueled the
civil conflict. In this context, the government will prepare an interim Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) by end-September 2006.

- 36 -

ATTACHMENT I

A. Fiscal Policy
11.
The challenge for the government is to convince Liberians and Liberia’s development
partners that the country’s scarce resources are being used efficiently to rebuild the economy
and to start addressing pressing social needs. To this end the government will focus on the
rebuilding of fiscal institutions to enhance revenue collection, and to strengthen public
expenditure management. Recognizing Liberia’s significant public debt burden, the
government will pursue a balanced budget for the foreseeable future; deficit spending will
only occur to the extent that external donor support on grant terms becomes available (see
Table 1).
12.
The government will implement a broad range of reforms to enhance the efficiency of
revenue collection and broaden the tax base (see Table 2). These reforms include enforcing
pre-shipment inspections for imports and exports and strengthening the Large Taxpayer Unit.
In addition, the government will establish a program to address overdue tax/duty obligations.
Furthermore, as envisaged under the GEMAP, transparency of resource flows from revenuegenerating agencies is expected to be considerably enhanced with assistance from the
external experts at five revenue generating agencies (namely the National Port Authority
(NPA), Roberts International Airport (RIA), the Liberia Petroleum Refining Corporation
(LPRC), the Forestry Development Agency (FDA), and the Bureau of Maritime Affairs
(BMA)).3 The government will integrate the Bureau of the Budget and the Bureau of
Maritime Affairs into the Ministry of Finance by end-June 2006. With technical assistance on
tax policy from the IMF, the government will also aim to shift gradually revenue from the
current trade-based structure to domestic activities.
13.
On the expenditure side, the government will ensure that adequate expenditure
controls are in place. With assistance from external experts at the Ministry of Finance (MoF)
and the CBL, the CMCo will ensure that spending decisions are made within actual revenue
collections (to avoid the reemergence of cash deficits) and follow prioritized cash plans for
all ministries and institutions. The government will also continue to utilize technical
assistance from the IMF, World Bank and others to strengthen public expenditure
management capacity, including through the implementation of an interim commitment
control system. In addition, the government will ensure full and effective implementation of
the newly adopted procurement policy to strengthen public procurement practices. For the
remainder of the 2005/06 fiscal year4, the government will prioritize expenditures in order to
maintain its core functions, and to effectively pursue the 150-day plan; the budget for
2005/06 will therefore be amended accordingly.
14.
To improve the budgetary process, the government intends to enhance transparency
and accountability. As a first step, the government will take action to limit the discretion

granted to the administration to change budget allocations between line ministries without
legislative approval. Legislation to this effect will be introduced in tandem with the
submission of the 2006/07 budget by end-June 2006. In addition, the budget (including any
revisions) will be posted on the website of the Ministry of Finance with regularly updated
information on progress with implementation. A timetable for the preparation of the 2006/07
budget will be established by end-March 2006.
15.
The government intends to have a balanced budget for some time, reflecting domestic
and external financing constraints. Nonetheless, progress with the reform effort is likely to
attract grants, also in the form of budgetary support, once the budget process has been
sufficiently strengthened. Together with higher revenue, these resources will be channeled
toward basic infrastructure and social services in the context of the poverty reduction strategy
that will be developed through a consultative process.
16.
The government intends to review the strategy for the resolution of domestic debt,
that was developed in 2005 with external assistance, and will carefully consider
implementation of the options with due consideration to available resources and potential
consequences for the domestic banking sector. As an immediate step, the government will
establish the stock of domestic debt, and complete the process of verification. Subsequently a
domestic debt resolution strategy will be finalized, consistent with a restructuring plan for
CBL.
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
17.
The principal objective of the CBL is to maintain price stability. Given that the role of
monetary policy in a highly dollarized economy is very limited, the CBL will continue to use
the exchange rate as a key indicator of demand for local currency. The current system of
regular foreign exchange auctions will be used to control the pace of increase in domestic
liquidity. The CBL will therefore resume the program of regular foreign exchange auctions,
using the supply of U.S. dollars from the government for the payment of civil service salaries
and wages in Liberian dollars. The use of the statutory reserve requirement system will also
be explored in the event that additional actions are required to manage domestic liquidity.
18.
The CBL will build up foreign reserves, consistent with the objective of maintaining
stability in the exchange rate. It will target strengthening its net foreign exchange position to
a minimum of US$13.2 million by end-September 2006 (see Table 1). In light of the scarcity
of liquid foreign assets, the CBL will not use its resources to defend the local currency in the
event of downward pressures on the currency.
19.
Over the longer-term, the CBL expects to develop the capacity to manage liquidity in
the banking sector through monetary instruments in order to provide an additional means of
managing the exchange rate, particularly given the scarce availability of foreign reserves. In
this regard, the CBL will gradually introduce a range of reforms, including strengthening the
framework for liquidity monitoring, and preparing the framework for the eventual issuance
of short-term securities.

- 38 -

ATTACHMENT I

20.
Given the extent of dollarization, the CBL will continue to maintain the present dual
currency arrangement, with both the Liberian and U.S. dollar as legal tender. However, the
government believes that the pursuit of a credible monetary policy, complemented by
sustainable fiscal policy, together with efforts to develop Liberia’s financial system and
improve the health of the banking sector, will in due course increase the demand for local
currency, and consequently allow for a gradual de-dollarization of the economy. In the
meantime, the expansion of domestic currency will be carefully managed to be consistent
with the demand for Liberian dollars and maintaining a stable exchange rate.
21.
In the banking system, the CBL will strengthen supervision in accordance with the
Bank Restructuring and Resolution Policy which was adopted in January 2005. Consistent
with IMF recommendations, the CBL will also implement the following additional measures
to strengthen the regulatory environment and the capacity of banking supervision: (i) no new
banks will be licensed for the time being; and (ii) the CBL will place resident supervisors
with troubled banks.
22.
The CBL will continue with current efforts to strengthen its financial position.
Strategically, the CBL may not achieve a balanced budget in 2006, but will eliminate the
cash deficit over the next few years to complement other efforts to rebuild Liberia’s
international reserves. To strengthen management capacity and governance at the CBL, the
newly appointed Chief Administrator at the CBL, with binding co-signature authority for
operational and financial matters, assumed his position on February 6, 2006, and is expected
to make considerable contributions in these areas. In addition, the recently appointed
Executive Governor is also expected to further strengthen management of the CBL.
Moreover, the CBL will commission an external audit of its accounts for the 2005 financial
year by an auditor of international repute.
C. Structural Reforms
23.
The government recognizes that economic recovery requires not only a consistent
macroeconomic framework, but also a clear and transparent legal and regulatory environment
that can support a revival of both domestic and foreign direct investment. To this end, the
government will approach the international community to provide further policy advice and
technical assistance to support capacity building in the public sector, including civil service
reform, and strengthening of the judicial system.
24.
The government will stand firm against corruption. It will request support from
international experts in the investigation of serious fraud, corruption and economic crimes.
Additionally, the government also plans to develop by end-May 2006 a comprehensive anticorruption strategy inclusive of a policy matrix for implementation.
25.
The government will strengthen economic governance, as envisaged under the
GEMAP. As a first step, it is conducting a stocktaking exercise for all the concessions given
and contracts made under the NTGL and, with external assistance, will formulate a strategic
plan to deal with these concessions. In addition, the government will improve controls over
the granting of concessions and contracts, implementing a basic procurement system through
the establishment of the Public Procurement and Concessions Commission, and joining the

- 39 -

ATTACHMENT I

Kimberley Process Certification Scheme and the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative (EITI). The government will pursue trade reform and will seek to become a
member of the WTO. Furthermore, in cooperation with the World Bank and other
international partners, the government will develop a concrete plan of action to meet the
conditions for lifting of UN sanctions on exports of timber and diamonds.
26.
The government has initiated a comprehensive program for the first 150 days of its
administration to rehabilitate public infrastructure (roads, electricity generation, provision of
water, renovation of Monrovia port, schools, and health clinics); to improve education and
health services through assignment of more teachers and health workers, and strengthening
programs to combat malaria, HIV/AIDS, and other diseases; to promote employment, inter
alia, through targeted public works programs; to continue preparatory work for a civil service
reform program; to improve security; and to support revitalization of agriculture through
targeted support to farmers.
IV. TECHNICAL AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE
27.
The government’s efforts to rebuild the economy, facilitate economic growth, and
reduce poverty will require a functioning and efficient public administration. The short-term
objectives are to build program implementation and monitoring capacity, and put in place the
necessary administrative capacity to lay the foundation for monitoring a Fund-supported
program, as well as programs of assistance of other development partners. To this end, the
objective of this program is to achieve significant progress with strengthening key
government institutions; as envisaged under GEMAP, attention will initially be focused on
the Ministry of Finance, other key agencies, and the CBL. The government has requested
technical and financial support for this purpose from the IMF, World Bank, and other
development partners.
28.
The government currently lacks accurate and timely data required to formulate
economic policy, and to monitor its implementation since much of the database was
destroyed during the period of conflict. Significant support from international agencies will
be required for an extended period to rebuild Liberia’s database. In this context, support will
be required for improving basic economic indicators, such as the national accounts, consumer
price index and balance of payments, as well as basic data on social indicators, inter alia,
through support for a national census and household survey.
V. RELATIONS WITH THE IMF AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL CREDITORS
29.
The government recognizes the need to make swift progress toward normalizing
relations with the international community with a view to the eventual resolution of Liberia’s
debt overhang. The government will therefore make every effort to establish a sufficient
track record of sound economic management under the staff monitored program (SMP) and
to continue with monthly payments of US$60,000 to the IMF, as well as US$25,000 to the
World Bank and US$15,000 to the African Development Bank. The government expects
sustained progress in these areas to lead to a de-escalation of the IMF’s remedial measures
imposed on Liberia, and to a subsequent IMF-supported program.

Given the urgency of meeting Liberia’s social and reconstruction needs, a substantial
reduction in the external debt burden will be an important element of the country’s economic
strategy. To this end, the government intends to contact its bilateral and commercial
creditors, and inform them of the government’s desire for a comprehensive resolution to the
debt overhang problem. The government also intends to consult with the multilateral
institutions (including the IMF, World Bank and African Development Bank) on modalities
for eliminating arrears with those institutions, with a view to eventually seeking
comprehensive debt relief through the HIPC and the Multilateral Debt Relief (MDR)
Initiatives. The government recognizes that developing a strong track record under the SMP
is an important first step in achieving this goal.

Technical Memorandum of Understanding for the Staff-Monitored Program for 2006
Liberia, April 12, 2006
1.
This memorandum describes the definitions of the quantitative and structural
indicators for the staff monitored program (SMP) for 2006 (Tables 1 and 2 of the
Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) as agreed between the authorities
of Liberia and the staff of the IMF. It also specifies the agreed periodicity and deadlines for
transmission of data to the staff of the IMF for program monitoring purposes.
I. QUANTITATIVE INDICATORS AND ADJUSTORS
A. Quantitative indicators
2.

The quantitative indicators (Table 1 of the MEFP) are the following:
a. floor on government revenue;
b. floor on the fiscal balance (on a cash basis);
c. ceiling on noncash tax/duty payment;
d. ceiling on new domestic borrowing;
e. ceiling on new domestic payments arrears of the government;
f. ceiling on new external debt contracted or guaranteed;
g. ceiling on the CBL’s cash expenses;
h. ceiling on new payments arrears of the CBL;
i. floor on the CBL’s cash balance (on a cash basis);
j. floor on the net changes of CBL’s net foreign exchange position; and
k. token payments to the Fund

3.
Quantitative indicators have been set for end-March, end-June, and end-September
2006.
B. Definitions and computation
4.
For the purposes of the SMP, the government is defined as the central
government of Liberia. This definition excludes public entities with autonomous legal
personality whose own budget is not included in the central government budget.
5.
The government revenue includes all tax and non-tax receipts transferred into the
GOL general accounts at the CBL and excludes external loans and grants. It is measured on a
cash basis.

- 45 -

ATTACHMENT II

6.
The fiscal balance, on a cash basis, is defined as the difference between (a) total
central government revenue (excluding grants) defined in paragraph 5 of this TMU; and
(b) total current expenditure plus investment expenditure (excluding foreign-financed
investment).
7.
The noncash tax/duty payment is defined as settlement of duty/tax obligations by
delivering goods or services without cash paid by taxpayers.
8.
The new domestic borrowing is defined as new claims on the central government by
the banking system (including the CBL) starting February 1, 2006. It comprises the stock of
all outstanding claims on the central government (loans, advances, and any government debt
instruments, such as long-term government securities) by the banking system, less all
deposits held by the central government with the banking system.
9.
New domestic payments arrears of the government are calculated as the difference
between payments due on commitments engaged since February 1, 2006 and actual payments
made on those commitments. Government payments due include all expenditure for which
commitment vouchers have been officially approved by the Bureau of General Accounting of
the Ministry of Finance, non-discretionary expenditure (such as wages and salaries, pensions,
utilities, and other expenditures for which commitments are automatic and not at the
discretion of the government, including domestic debt).
10.
The indicators for external debt are cumulative ceilings on new external debt
contracted or guaranteed by the government from February 1, 2006. For the purposes of the
SMP, the indicator for external debt applies not only to debt as defined in point No. 9 of the
Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt, adopted by the Executive
Board of the IMF on August 24, 2000 but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for
which value has not been received. For purposes of these guidelines, the term “debt” is
understood to mean a current, that is, not contingent, liability, created under a contractual
arrangement through the provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or
services, and which requires the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets
(including currency) or services, at some future point(s) in time; these payments will
discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts can take a
number of forms, the primary ones being as follows: (i) loans, that is, advances of money to
the obligor by the lender made on the basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the
funds in the future (including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans, and buyers’
credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans,
under which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by
repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements and
official swap arrangements); (ii) suppliers’ credits, that is, contracts where the supplier
permits the obligor to defer payments until some time after the date on which the goods are
delivered or services are provided; and (iii) leases, that is, arrangements under which
property is provided that the lessee has the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of
time that are usually shorter than the total expected service life of the property, while the
lessor retains the title to the property. For the purpose of the guideline, the debt is the present
value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the
period of the agreement, excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair, or

- 46 -

ATTACHMENT II

maintenance of the property. Under the definition of debt set out above, arrears, penalties,
and judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual
obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not
considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.
For the purposes of monitoring the SMP, arrangements to pay over time obligations arising
form judicial awards to external creditors do not constitute nonconcessional external
borrowing.
11.
The CBL’s cash expenses are defined as the sum of (i) recurrent expenditures and
(ii) capital spending, on a cash basis. The ceiling on the expenses will be fully adjusted for
the CBL’s cost of the forthcoming external audit of the CBL by auditors of international
repute.
12.
New payments arrears of the CBL are calculated as the difference between
payments due on commitments engaged since March 1, 2006 and actual payments made on
those commitments. For the purpose of the Memorandum, the CBL commitments due
include all expenditure for which goods and services have been delivered but not been paid.
13.
The CBL’s cash balance is defined as the difference between (a) total recurrent
revenues of the CBL (the sum of interest income and non-interest income) on a cash basis;
and (b) total current expenditure plus capital expenditure on a cash basis.
14.
The CBL’s net foreign exchange position is defined as the difference between (a)
the CBL’s gross foreign liquid assets, as currently defined in the Monetary Survey Data, and
(b) the sum of its gross foreign liquid liabilities and liquid liabilities denominated in US
dollar, as currently indicated in the table on monetary sector.
15.
The token payments to the IMF is defined as a monthly payment of US$60,000.
The IMF staff may request the authorities to deposit payments into an escrow account
established at another institution overseas.
II. PROGRAM MONITORING
A. Program–Monitoring Committee
16.
The Liberian authorities shall maintain a program-monitoring committee composed
of senior officials from the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank of Liberia, and other
relevant agencies. The IMF Resident Representative will have observer status on this
committee. The committee shall be responsible for monitoring the performance of the
program, recommending policy responses, informing the Fund regularly about the progress
of the program, and transmitting the supporting materials necessary for the evaluation of
performance criteria and benchmarks. The committee shall provide the Fund with a progress
report on the program on a monthly basis within four weeks of the end of each month, using
the latest available data.

Governance and Economic Management Assistance Program
In September 2005, Liberia’s key international partners (US, EU, UN, and ECOWAS) jointly
formulated the Governance and Economic Management Assistance Program (GEMAP). The
new government has also endorsed the program. The GEMAP aims at strengthening
governance and financial management, in light of the bitter experience of financial
mismanagement under the previous governments. The key features of the GEMAP are:
•

Financial Management and Accountability: measures to secure public revenue
include: (i) the deployment of international experts with binding co-signature authority in
selected institutions and enterprises; (ii) offering international management contracts for
five state-owned enterprises (SOEs) through competitive bidding; and (iii) establishing
escrow accounts for revenue generated by SOEs, and strictly enforcing the provisions of
Executive Order No. 2, which mandates the centralization of the authority to collect
revenue at the Ministry of Finance, and of government accounts at the Central Bank of
Liberia.

•

Improving Budgeting and Expenditure Management: public expenditure management
will be strengthened through: (i) capacity building; (ii) revamping business processes;
(iii) providing an Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS);
(iv) deploying international experts with binding co-signature authority; (v) ensuring
effective commitment control; (vi) developing realistic cash and procurement plans; and
(vii) establishing an empowered Technical Secretariat for the Cash Management
Committee (CMCo).

•

Improving Procurement Practices and Granting of Concessions: in accordance with
Executive Order No. 3, transparency in procurement will be strengthened through:
(i) implementation of the new procurement law; (ii) implementation of a basic
procurement system requiring mandatory listing, open competitive bidding, and
publication of tender results; (iii) adequate coverage in the print and other media of
tender results; (iv) deployment of specialized expertise to strengthen the process for
granting of concessions, contracts, and licenses; and (v) support for the Contract and
Monopolies Commission (CMC) to strengthen its compliance role and empower it to
review concessions, contracts, and licenses. In addition, Liberia will join the Kimberley
Process Certification Scheme and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative
(EITI).

•

Establishing Effective Processes to Control Corruption: to strengthen the judicial
system and combat corruption, the international community will provide: (i) policy
advice, technical assistance and support for the renovation of facilities; and (ii) technical
support from the sub-region to assist investigations of fraud, corruption, and economic
crimes. In addition, establishment of an independent Anti-Corruption Commission should
be considered.

•

Supporting Key Institutions: international assistance will be provided to a number of
key institutions such as the General Auditing Office (GAO), General Services Agency
(GSA), Governance Reform Commission (GRC), and Contracts and Monopolies

- 50 -

ATTACHMENT III

Commission (CMC), including through international experts with co-signature authority;
awarding of a contract for an external audit agent to support the work of the GAO; and
provision of technical assistance to the Ministry of Finance and the GRC.
•

Capacity Building: to support the efforts of international experts, emphasis will be
placed on building domestic capacity. To this end, the work of the Institute of Public
Administration will be revitalized to support ongoing efforts to revise the Civil Service
Manual and preparation of a Code of Conduct for Civil Servants.

APPENDIX II

Assessing Debt Sustainability
Liberia’s external debt is very large and clearly unsustainable. Preliminary estimates
based on incomplete data indicate that Liberia’s external debt amounted to about
US$3.7 billion in nominal terms at end-2005 (see Table 5 of the main text).1 Of this total, it
is estimated that US$1.6 billion were owed to multilateral creditors (of which US$740
million to the Fund), US$1 billion to the bilateral creditors (of which US$830 million to Paris
Club members), and about US$1.1 billion (including accrued interest and penalty interest) to
commercial creditors and suppliers. Almost all of this debt has been in prolonged arrears.
Calculations using the low-income country external debt template indicate that, at
end-2005, the NPV of Liberia’s external debt relative to GDP and exports of goods and
services was 790 percent and 3,040 percent, respectively (Tables A1 and A2, Figure A1).
These ratios are many times higher than the relevant debt burden thresholds of the LIC DSA
framework.2
Under a baseline scenario that represents an extension of the staff’s medium-term
baseline scenario, the debt burden indicators decline over time owing to the assumed strong
growth of the economy and exports but never come close to the debt burden thresholds.3
Thus, the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio declines to 460 percent by 2010 and 240 percent by
2024, while the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio declines to 1,540 percent by 2010 and
780 percent by 2024.
Alternative scenarios and stress tests underscore the unsustainability of Liberia’s
external debt.4 Under a historical scenario, which sets important variables at their average
values for 1999–2004, the debt burden indicators decline at a slower pace than in the
1

Most of Liberia’s official records on external debt were lost during the years of conflict and
the process of obtaining statements from creditors has not been completed. Data on debt to
multilateral creditors are relatively complete but less so for bilateral and particularly
commercial creditors. The latter reflect estimates by the authorities and staff.

2

The thresholds for a country ranked as a poor policy performer according to the World
Bank’s CPIA index, as Liberia is, are 30 percent and 100 percent, respectively
3

Under this baseline scenario, real GDP is assumed to grow at about 8 percent per year
during 2006-10 and 5 percent per year thereafter. Exports are assumed to expand rapidly
during 2006-10 as timber exports recover following the lifting of UN sanctions. Moreover,
Liberia is assumed to continue to accumulate arrears and not have access to any new
borrowing for the entire projection period.
4

At this stage, it would be premature to present a scenario incorporating possible debt relief
because of uncertainty regarding the timing of arrears clearance. This will depend on the
mobilization of adequate financing assurances, and Liberia's success in building a track
record of macroeconomic management and structural reforms. However, if and when debt
relief becomes available, Liberia's debt sustainability outlook would, of course, improve
dramatically.

- 52 -

APPENDIX II

baseline. Thus, the NPV of debt-to-GDP and to-export ratios are at 470 percent and
1,560 percent, respectively, in 2024, about twice their levels under the baseline. Under the
most extreme stress test, represented by a one standard deviation shock to exports in 2006–
07, the debt burden indicators first rise sharply and then converge slowly to the levels under
the historical scenario, despite the larger decline in the stock and flow indicators relative to
the baseline projections.
The application of the LIC DSA framework to the case of Liberia clearly illustrates
that country’s external debt is unsustainable situation. To address its external debt problem,
Liberia will need to demonstrate a strong commitment to sound macroeconomic and
structural policies but will also require substantial support, including exceptionally deep debt
relief, from the international community.

APPENDIX IV

Liberia: Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of March 12, 2005)
The World Bank suspended disbursements to Liberia in December 1986, as a result of
mounting arrears and Liberia’s loans were placed in non-accrual status in June 1987. To that
date, disbursements had totaled US$141.3 million from 22 IBRD loans and US$91.5 million
from 17 IDA credits; only US$ 43.6 million owing on these disbursements has been repaid.
By 12 March 2006, Liberia’s arrears to the World Bank had mounted to US$435.3 million,
reflecting further interest charges. Liberia has an outstanding obligation of US$2.2 million to
the World Bank, since 24 August 2005, to fulfill the Maintenance of Value (MOV) clause in
the Bank's Articles of Agreement.
Following the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in August 2003 and the installation of the
National Transitional Government of Liberia (NTGL) in October 2003, the Bank co-hosted
with the UN and US the International Reconstruction Conference for Liberia in February
2004. In March 2004, the Executive Directors of the Bank discussed the Liberia Country Reengagement Note. In April 2004 a US$4.0 million grant from the Bank’s newly created
LICUS Implementation Trust Fund was approved to fund four activities, in the areas of
community empowerment, including a rapid social assessment; public procurement and
financial management; forestry sector management; and coordination and implementation of
the Results-Focused Transition Framework (RFTF). A US$25.0 million grant from Bank
IBRD surplus, was endorsed by the Executive Directors of the Bank in August 2004 and
approved by the Bank’s Board of Governors in October 2004. This grant, the TFLIB, extends
funding of the above activities, funds additional activities in the area of infrastructure, and
will provide support for the internationally-supported Governance and Economic
Management Assistance Program (GEMAP) agreed with the NTGL in September 2005. The
first sub-grant from this source of funding, the Technical Assistance Component for
Infrastructure Rehabilitation (US$5.0 million), was approved in December 2004, and the
second sub-grant, Community Empowerment (US$6.0 million), in February 2005. Other subgrants are being prepared.
Since July 2004 the Bank has a Senior Country Officer in Monrovia to coordinate the Bank’s
activities in Liberia.
The working environment in Liberia is characterized by close coordination and consultation
among the Government, the Bank, the IMF, the UN group, bilateral donors, local and
international NGOs, and civil society. This approach was fostered during the transition
through the high-level RFTF Implementation and Monitoring Committee, and since then
through the Liberia Reconstruction and Development Committee; and through the Economic
Governance Steering Committee of the GEMAP and its Technical Team. In December 2005
the Bank became a member of the International Consultative Group on Liberia.

APPENDIX V

Liberia: Statistical Issues
1.
There are substantial weaknesses in Liberia's economic statistics that hamper
effective surveillance, largely because the civil war caused widespread destruction of
databases and the loss of administrative and institutional capacity for the systematic
compilation of statistics. Fund statistics missions visited Monrovia in 2003, 2004 and January
2006 in order to assist the authorities in rebuilding some capacity to compile statistics in the
areas of national accounts, monetary and fiscal statistics and balance of payments. The
government passed new legislation in July 2004 creating the Liberia Institute of Statistics and
Geo-Information Services as a semi-autonomous agency. This agency, expected to be
operational in FY 2005/06, will have the lead role for national coordination and
reestablishment of economic and social statistics. As one of fifteen countries participating in
the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) Project for Anglophone African
Countries, Liberia has undertaken to use the GDDS as a framework for the development of
its national statistical system. Metadata and detailed plans for improving the data over the
short and medium term were posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(DSBB) on October 24, 2005. The Anglophone Africa project (funded by the U.K.
Department for International Development (DFID)) aims to assist participating countries to
implement the plans for improvement identified in the metadata, to meet GDDS
recommended statistical practices.
2.
The Central Bank of Liberia (CBL) is now regularly reporting monetary and financial
and exchange rate statistics for publication in International Financial Statistics (IFS), but
their quality and timeliness need to be improved.
3.
The CBL publishes data on money and banking, prices and output, fiscal operations
and debt, interest and exchange rates, and foreign trade in its statistical bulletin, Liberia
Financial Statistics, on a bimonthly basis with a lag of about six months. It also publishes the
quarterly Financial and Economic Bulletin, covering the previous four quarters, with a lag of
about six months. Real sector
4.
Annual estimates of production by sector are prepared by the National Accounts Unit
of the Ministry of Planning and Economic Affairs (MPEA). The Fund staff has estimated
total GDP by sectoral origin for the period 1997–2004 with the assistance of the MPEA.
There is currently no estimate for GDP by expenditure. A household survey is required as a
base for more reliable data.
Prices
5.
The Price Unit of the MPEA began producing a consumer price index in late 1998,
with May 1998 as the starting date and reference period. However, the weights are based on
an expenditure survey of 100 Monrovia households conducted in 1963–64. Targeted
sampling frequencies vary from bimonthly for food items to biannual for rents and personal
care and services, with actual collections often delayed. A survey conducted in June 2004
updated the two subgroups of rent and personal care and health services in the Monrovia

- 62 -

APPENDIX V

consumer price index. Monthly data have been reported to the Fund at the same time as
publication, which generally involves a lag of about six months.
Government finance statistics
6.
The authorities provide information on fiscal accounts to the staff on a regular basis
but they have not reported data for publication in the Government Financial Statistics
Yearbook (GFSY) since 1988, nor have they provided data for the IFS for several years. The
Ministry of Finance provides monthly disaggregated data on government revenue, and
current and capital expenditure. There is, however, considerable scope for improvement in
the quality and consistency of government finance statistics. Data on domestic arrears and on
financing items are unreliable.
Monetary statistics
7.
The August 2004 monetary and financial statistics (MFS) mission reviewed in detail
the methodology for the collection of monetary data, established procedures for their regular
compilation, and suggested changes in CBL’s accounting records and commercial banks’
reports to improve overall data quality. In cooperation with the authorities, and based on
available information, the mission compiled monetary data for the period June 2002–
June 2004. The CBL has made progress in compiling monetary aggregates according to
international standards, and reporting of data by commercial banks has improved.
8.
While progress has been made in moving toward international standards, substantial
weaknesses persist. Important steps to strengthen the CBL’s accounting system remain to be
taken, including proper accounting for foreign reserves and the appropriate segregation of
required reserves by currency denomination and classification of other assets and liabilities.
In addition, while the reporting of preliminary statistics by commercial banks has improved,
the response by banks to requests for explanations and follow-up to noted inconsistencies
continues to be weak.
9.
A MFS mission in 2006 is expected to address these issues, and also to introduce
standardized forms for reporting monetary data and to develop an integrated monetary
database.
10.
The monetary and financial statistics reported monthly to IFS are usually submitted
by e-mail or fax with a two-month lag; the latest return includes data up to January 2006.
Balance of payments and external debt
11.
Official balance of payments statistics have not been reported comprehensively since
the 1988 Article IV consultation; however, the Fund staff has prepared provisional balance of
payments statistics in cooperation with the CBL, the Ministry of Commerce (MoC), MPEA,
and the Ministry of Finance (MoF). The CBL is responsible for compiling the balance of
payments in coordination with other agencies. Some progress has been made in compiling
certain current and financial account components—mainly on trade and related services,
government expenditures, remittances, and on nonresident deposits in the financial account—

but lack of primary source data and errors in distinguishing between components in services,
income and transfers underscore the need for technical assistance for capacity building. A
stronger effort must be made to resolve and reconcile the significant discrepancies that exist
in the trade data reported by the various agencies. The CBL has completed a census of
foreign direct investment enterprises in preparation for an investment survey following the
recommendations made by the STA mission in July 2004.
12.
Significant gaps exist in the records of external public debt, particularly that related to
bilateral and commercial creditors. A task force comprising staff seconded from the CBL,
MoF, MPEA, General Auditing Office (GAO) and the Bureau of the Budget (BOB) is
currently making progress in obtaining loan agreements and financial statements from
external creditors to update the external debt database maintained by the MoF. As part of
strengthening capacity for balance of payments and external debt statistics compilation, STA
trained three Liberian officials in 2005—one attended balance of payments course held in
Washington in May/June 2005, and two separately attended external debt statistics courses
held in Washington (July 2005) and Tunis, Tunisia (November 2005). STA is planning a
follow-up balance of payments technical assistance mission to Liberia in FY 2007.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with
Liberia
On April 26, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with The Republic of Liberia.1
Background
The Liberian economy continued to recover in 2005, largely driven by donor activities. Real
GDP is estimated to have grown by 5.3 percent in 2005, following a modest growth of 2.6
percent in 2004. This reflected the gradual improvement of security in rural areas, and
restoration of activity in those sectors benefiting from donor assistance (mainly the service
sector). Exports remain depressed, largely owing to continued UN sanctions on timber and
diamond exports, while import levels remain high due mainly to large donor assistance.
International reserves remained at a very low level, reflecting the continued financial
weakness of the Central Bank of Liberia (CBL). Price and exchange rate developments
reflect the return of relative stability to Liberia. Recently, however, there have been signs of
a rise in inflation, in part reflecting higher donor expenditure. The Liberian dollar has been
trading in a range of 55–60 Liberian dollars per U.S. dollar for the last 12 months.
Immediately following the inauguration of President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, the new
government implemented several key steps to begin addressing long-standing problems in
financial management and economic governance. These included: (i) the strict enforcement
of pre-shipment inspections for imports and exports; (ii) more prudent budget allotments for
line ministries; (iii) the reestablishment of the Cash Management Committee (CMCo) to
contain expenditures within available cash revenues; and (iv) the initiation of a review of all
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions
with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and
financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and
policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for
discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing
Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this
summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

-2concessions and contracts signed by the National Transitional Government of Liberia
(NTGL). The CBL, while still running a cash deficit, is also taking steps to strengthen its
budgetary management.
For 2006, the economy is expected to continue to recover, based on strong donor inflows
and a revival of rural activities, following the reestablishment of security and return of
refugees to their communities. Real GDP is projected to grow by about 8 percent, led by
agriculture and services. Notwithstanding the large donor presence, inflation is expected to
remain modest, being contained to single digits. With a gradual decline in rubber exports
and further increase in donor-funded imports, the trade deficit is projected to widen further.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the new Liberian authorities’ resolve to work closely with
their international partners in addressing the daunting challenges of rebuilding Liberia’s
economy and reducing pervasive poverty. As a first key step, Directors welcomed the
agreement that had been reached on an ambitious macroeconomic program for the period
February-September 2006 to be monitored by the Fund staff. They stressed that
strengthening public financial management, improving economic governance, and
rebuilding essential capacity and infrastructure are essential to place Liberia on a path
toward sustained economic recovery and poverty reduction.
Directors were encouraged by the new government’s endorsement of the Governance and
Economic Management Program (GEMAP), which aims to strengthen economic
governance and financial management, and help to rebuild Liberia’s key economic
institutions. They welcomed the authorities’ early actions to reverse the weakening of public
financial management that had occurred under previous governments, including through the
enforcement of pre-shipment inspections, more prudent budget allotments for line
ministries, and the re-activation of the CMCo to contain expenditures within available cash
revenues.
Directors agreed that further decisive steps to strengthen public expenditure management
would be key to ensuring that scarce resources are channeled to their most effective uses.
They urged the authorities to establish an effective and transparent budgeting process,
including planning, execution, and internal controls. In the short run, Directors stressed the
importance of ensuring that allotments to line Ministries are consistent with available
resources, and of fully implementing the interim commitment control system to prevent the
accumulation of new payments arrears.
Directors urged the authorities to persevere with their efforts to raise the level of public
revenues. They encouraged them to continue rigorous enforcement of pre-shipment
inspections, to strengthen the Large Taxpayer Unit, and to review and rationalize the
extensive list of duty exemptions.
Directors noted that the weak financial position of the CBL continues to affect the rebuilding
of scarce foreign exchange reserves and the capacity to implement effective monetary and
exchange rate policies. While they welcomed efforts to minimize the CBL’s cash deficit
in 2006, Directors urged the new management to take appropriate measures to eliminate
this deficit as soon as possible. They called for a strengthening of the regulatory functions of

-3the central bank, and emphasized that it will also be essential to continue with efforts to
strengthen the domestic banking sector through developing and implementing restructuring
plans for undercapitalized banks.
Directors generally agreed that the current framework of pursuing price stability through
maintaining a broadly stable exchange rate remains appropriate in the current dollarized
environment. Directors cautioned, however, that trends in the demand for local currency
should be carefully assessed. They also encouraged the authorities to continue with efforts
to strengthen the domestic financial sector in order to eventually allow for a more active
monetary policy.
Directors welcomed the new government’s determination to implement a policy of zero
tolerance of corruption. In this regard, they encouraged the authorities to develop a national
anti-corruption strategy, and to commence its implementation as soon as practicable.
Directors also urged the government to complete the review of concessions, contracts and
licenses granted under the previous government and make rapid progress in meeting the
requirements for lifting UN sanctions. In this connection, the authorities were encouraged to
increase transparency in the forestry sector in line with the guidelines of the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).
Directors noted the challenges involved in addressing Liberia’s high internal debt and
unsustainable external debt. They urged the authorities to complete the process of verifying
outstanding obligations, which will require the support of donors and creditors, and to
develop a strategy to address domestic payments arrears. Directors concurred that
satisfactory implementation of the staff monitored program (SMP), along with continued
repayments to the Fund, would be important for providing a basis for considering the timely
de-escalation of the Fund’s remedial measures. Prompt and sufficient indications of support
from donors and strong performance under the SMP would be important steps toward the
clearance of arrears to the Fund, and a formal IMF arrangement. Satisfactory performance
under such an arrangement would help pave the way toward Liberia’s timely participation in
the HIPC Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, and, in turn would lead to a
resolution of Liberia’s debt overhang. Directors welcomed the start of the work on
developing an interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper.
Directors noted that the limited availability and poor quality of key economic data continue
to hamper effective surveillance. They encouraged the authorities to seek technical
assistance, including from the Fund, to improve basic economic data, especially the
national accounts, consumer price index, and the balance of payments, as well as basic
data on social indicators.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV
Consultation with Liberia may be made available at a later stage if the authorities consent.

Statement by Ms. Antoinette M. Sayeh, Minister of Finance, Republic of Liberia
Executive Board Meeting
April 26, 2006
Along with my colleague and Central Bank Executive Governor Mills Jones, I am
very honored to address the Executive Board on behalf of the Government and people of
Liberia. My ability to do so marks a new chapter in Liberia’s relationship with its
international partners and with the IMF in particular. It reflects this institution’s recognition
of the important strides made over the past three months in returning Liberia to a path of
reconstruction and development, and we are deeply grateful for this early vote of confidence.
Political and Social Context
1.
Liberia is emerging from two decades of economic mismanagement and 15 years of
brutal civil war which devastated our economy and human assets, leaving deep scars in our
social fabric. Our peace is still very fragile, made possible in large measure by the presence
of some 15,000 United Nations troops. Electricity is the privilege of the fortunate few who
own and can purchase fuel for generators, as is running water. More than 80 percent of our
labor force is unemployed while basic education and health care remain unavailable or
unaffordable for most of our children and people. There are still large numbers of internally
displaced persons and ex-combatants who need to return to their homes and who require
reintegration into Liberian society. We have accumulated huge external and domestic
arrears, and our revenues and resources have been pillaged.
2.
This is broadly what President Sirleaf and her administration inherited upon
assumption of office earlier this year, after a free and fair election contested by many. We
have spared no time in acknowledging and acting on the monumental challenges we face.
Corrective Measures Implemented
3.
We immediately set out to restore basic financial management and address longstanding governance problems. To that end, we embraced the Governance and Economic
Management Reform Program (GEMAP), notwithstanding its origins as a response to a
government seen to be dysfunctional by both the Liberian public and the international
community that had abdicated its responsibilities. We do so because we believe GEMAP can
be helpful in beginning to tackle the financial management challenges we face. Anxious to
have the United Nations sanctions imposed on our timer and diamond exports lifted, we
quickly set out to make tangible progress in meeting the requirements.
4.
Recognizing the urgency of restoring credibility with our external partners, our
government immediately took the actions needed to begin discussions with Fund staff on a
Staff Monitored Program (SMP). These included extending the pre-shipment inspection
program for imports to rice and petroleum; making the Cash Management Committee
operational; implementing measures to increase transparency in the management of

-2diamond and timber resources; outlining a process of review of all contracts signed by the
transitional government; and taking action to stop the hemorrhage in the Central Bank of
Liberia’s finances. And we signaled our policy of enhancing the accountability of
government officials by requiring ministers to declare their assets upon assumption of
office.
5.
These efforts were complemented by action to collect overdue taxes and cease the
practice of non-cash payment of taxes, as well as by measures to rationalize the payroll. As
a consequence of the measures taken to date, revenues collected in January-March 2006
were some 34 percent higher than during the same period last year, and above the SMP
projections. For the first time in many months, we are current in paying civil servants’
salaries and in a position to finance basic operational spending, although inefficiencies in
processing line ministries expenditures have constrained operational spending so far.
6.
The 150-day plan issued recently – focused on the four key areas of security,
economic revitalization, infrastructure and basic social services, and governance and the rule
of law -- reflects our commitment to delivering measurable results, and to being held
accountable for them. Our people’s expectations are high, and showing concrete
improvements in their lives – limited electricity, some jobs, improved roads -- is essential to
our ability to maintain support for the difficult reforms ahead. To chart a medium-term
reconstruction strategy focused on reducing poverty, we have begun work on an Interim
Poverty Reduction Strategy, which we hope to complete by end-June 2006. In this
connection, let me take this opportunity to express our gratitude for IMF assistance that is
helping us formulate a medium-term policy agenda on public expenditure management and
revenue enhancement.
Fiscal, Structural, and Monetary Policy Reform Agenda
7.
The government is cognizant of the need to rebuild our budgetary institutions to
support more effective budget management and ultimately channeling of external assistance
through the budget.. To this end we intend to submit legislation to reintegrate the Bureau of
the Budget and the Bureau of Maritime Affairs into the Ministry of Finance where they
originated. A new public procurement code is being implemented, and financial
management is being strengthened through the Cash Management Committee (CMCo). We
are reviewing the recommendations of the recently completed IMF report on public
expenditure management and believe that their implementation over time will help to
significantly strengthen budget preparation, execution, and reporting. Efforts to rationalize
and introduce a more competitive import tariff structure are necessary, as are measures to
expand the tax base. We expect to begin introducing some of these with the new 2006/2007
budget, on the basis inter alia of a forthcoming IMF mission on tax policy.
8.
Our commitment to implementing reforms aimed at rationalizing government
institutions to increase their efficiency and responsiveness is strong. In this connection, we
have begun work on comprehensive civil service reforms, building on the progress already
made in using a civil service census to address payroll irregularities. Here again, we will
need donor support in helping to reintegrate redundant civil servants into the private sector.

-39.
We remain resolutely committed to tackling the endemic corruption which is a major
obstacle to Liberia’s development. An anti-corruption strategy is being formulated to this
end. In addition to civil servants’ declaration of assets, a Code of Conduct for public
servants is being prepared, and the strategy will also seek to address, inter alia, longstanding weaknesses in the judicial system, as well as the inadequate pay levels that have
encouraged corruption.
10. Our reading of post-conflict experience suggests that early identification of
constraints to private sector investment is critical to returning the economy to a growth path.
To this end, we are currently reviewing the recommendations of a recently completed study
of the environment for private sector activity by the World Bank’s Foreign Investment
Advisory Service. Beyond restoring our traditional sources of growth and exports in the
rubber, timber, and iron ore sectors, reforms aimed at encouraging new sources of growth in
the secondary sector will be considered.
11. We are cognizant of the need to modernize Liberia’s monetary and financial sector in
order to keep inflation within manageable levels, support fiscal policy efforts, and create the
enabling environment for promoting investment and economic growth. Critical to this effort
is the issue of restructuring of the Central Bank to pursue effective monetary policy and
ensure the stability of the financial system. We are accordingly seeking Fund technical
assistance and advice, with the view to implementing a lasting solution supportive of
sustained growth and development.
12. Consolidating our fragile peace should be enhanced by the recent establishment of the
Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and by the continued presence of UN troops over the
medium term, for which we are deeply grateful.
Developing and Enhancing Capacity
13. The long years of war and mismanagement have undermined capacity and depleted
our skilled human resources, many of whom left the country. Ministries and government
agencies (as well as the private sector) remain severely short of qualified personnel and
skilled staff, particularly at the middle levels. While appreciative of technical assistance
from partners in addressing critical gaps in the short term, the government is concerned that
capacity building is not being accorded the priority it deserves by donors.
14. Developing and enhancing Liberia’s capacity will require a combination of
repatriation of Diaspora Liberians, technical assistance to build skills, and creating an
environment and civil service that rewards the utilization of knowledge and skills. The
Government is currently working on an capacity development strategy to provide the
context in which the various donor initiatives are coordinated. In the short term, work is
underway with UNDP, and will be initiated with the International Organization for
Migration, to support more adequate remuneration on a temporary basis for returning skilled
Liberians.

-4External Assistance and Partnership
15. Given the magnitude and complexity of our reconstruction and development
challenges, coordinated and sustained support from the international community will be
critical, including through debt relief to address the crippling external debt overhang. With
the establishment of a track record already underway, and additional progress to be achieved
under the SMP. We believe that the basis is being established for the early clearance of
arrears with the three multilateral institutions-IMF, World Bank and the AfDB. We hope to
see a de-escalation of the Fund’s remedial measures against Liberia, in line with this track
record. Meanwhile, we would for consideration to be given at this time to lifting the
declaration of non-cooperation, which would be formal recognition of the commitment and
effort by the Liberian government to normalize relations with the Fund.
16. We are grateful for the new financial commitments some of our partners have made
during these first three months, and look forward to their speedy disbursement, as well as to
additional new commitments in line with the ambitious reconstruction agenda ahead. Let me
add that the partnership we seek goes beyond just a financial one – we are committed to
engaging our partners on our strategic agenda both during and beyond the preparation of the
I-PRSP. We have already put in place a forum for this engagement in the form of the
Liberia Reconstruction and Development Committee (LRDC) chaired by the President and
its sub-committees (consistent with the 150-day plan, these are security, economic
revitalization, infrastructure and basic services, and governance and the rule of law).
17. We look to the international community not only for financial resources, but for
assistance in the rebuilding our institutions and capacity, and in providing policy advice and
technical assistance. The new government is committed to ensuring that international
support to Liberia is well coordinated, efficiently utilized and accounted for. We look
forward to discussing our medium-term strategy, the acceleration of disbursements from
existing donor commitments, and the steps to clear our external arrears at the two
partnership meetings we plan to organize in July and September this year.
Conclusion
18. The government faces the monumental challenges of implementing reforms to lay the
basis for reconstruction and development, while showing concrete progress quickly, in order
to consolidate Liberia’s fragile peace and meet the very high expectations of our people. In
addition to our own steadfast commitment, tackling these challenges requires urgent debt
relief as well as sustained and coordinated donor support for many years to come. We have
set out to build the track record required to make the case for this, and are thankful for the
hard work of Fund staff that has made Executive Board consideration of an SMP possible at
an early date. We are indeed encouraged by the goodwill shown by all of our partners, and
look forward to their continued engagement with us in consolidating Liberia’s peace and
improving the lives of its desperately poor people.
