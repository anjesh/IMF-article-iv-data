IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Turkey
On March 25, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Turkey.1
Background
Turkey’s economic growth continues to show resilience despite several shocks. Growth
remains based on domestic demand, in turn, supported by accommodative monetary and
fiscal policies. Domestic consumption will receive an additional boost in 2016 after a
30 percent minimum wage increase and relaxation of macro prudential regulation. As a result,
external imbalances continue to accumulate with large FX mismatches in the non bank
corporate sector: despite a lower current account deficit on the back of lower oil prices, the
NIIP remains heavily negative and increasing, with large financing needs.
The economy remains vulnerable to external shocks and the main risk for Turkey remains an
acceleration of capital outflows. Hence, rebalancing of the economy, by increasing the
structurally low domestic saving rate and reducing external vulnerabilities, remain priorities.
To this end, the government has announced an ambitious program of reforms aiming to
increase potential growth and reduce external imbalances in the medium term. Priority should
be given to those aimed at boosting domestic savings, productivity and female labor force
participation.
Additionally, demand management policies in the form of tighter fiscal and monetary, should
be implemented to contain domestic demand until structural reforms deliver results.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the Turkish economy’s resilient growth notwithstanding
shocks in 2015. At the same time, they noted that inflation is high and that external
imbalances and dependence on external financing pose vulnerabilities. They, therefore,
underscored the need to rebalance the economy through macroeconomic policies and
structural reforms aimed at increasing domestic savings and raising potential growth.
Directors noted that the fiscal stance this year aims to support growth. They considered that
the authorities had been implementing prudent fiscal policy. Looking ahead, they emphasized
that strengthening the fiscal position would contribute to reducing external imbalances,
lowering inflation, and creating additional space to respond to shocks. Directors
recommended prioritizing growth-enhancing spending and adopting a prudent wage policy.
They also suggested improving risk management related to public-private partnerships.
Directors generally saw a need for a tighter monetary stance to bring down inflation. They
agreed that normalizing the monetary policy framework would improve communication and
enhance monetary transmission. Directors also recommended rebuilding international reserve
buffers.
Directors took positive note that the banking sector remains well capitalized. They welcomed
the gradual reduction in the use of non-core funding and the lengthening of maturities of
banks’ wholesale external financing. Nonetheless, indirect exposure to foreign exchange risk
remains elevated and profitability has declined. Directors encouraged the authorities to
consider additional steps to reduce incentives for the non-financial corporate sector to take on
exchange rate risk.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ comprehensive structural reform agenda and encouraged
faster implementation to promote economic rebalancing. They supported funding the private
pension and severance pay systems to raise saving, and highlighted the importance of
improving labor market flexibility, female labor participation, and labor productivity to
increase potential growth. Directors commended the authorities for hosting over 2.5 million
Syrian refugees and for their efforts to integrate them into the labor market.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes
the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context: Growth in 2015 was resilient to several shocks, supported by buoyant domestic
demand. In 2016, a 30 percent minimum wage increase, relaxation of macro prudential
regulations, and accommodative monetary and fiscal policies will continue fuelling
domestic consumption, keeping growth at about 4 percent. The fiscal stance is projected
to relax somewhat in 2016, with tightening delayed to 2017. The central bank has kept
the policy rate unchanged, has postponed normalization of the monetary framework,
and is using international reserves to offset pressures on the Lira. Inflation is set to
exceed the target again by a wide margin. Macro prudential measures have successfully
curbed consumer credit growth but some relaxation will occur in April. The current
account deficit is declining thanks to lower oil prices. Nonetheless, the net international
investment position remains heavily negative and external financing needs are
substantial. The government has announced an ambitious program of reforms aiming at
increasing potential growth and reducing external vulnerabilities over the medium term.
Policies: Growth is consumption-driven and dependent on external savings, making the
economy vulnerable to external shocks. Rebalancing the economy and thus reducing
these vulnerabilities remain a priority. Structural reforms should focus on increasing
private savings, which are too low to sustain investment, and improving the labor
market, which is marred by rapidly increasing labor costs, stagnant productivity, and a
low employment rate, especially among women. While structural policies take time to
yield fruits, domestic demand should be contained. Fiscal policy should be tightened by
about 1½ percent of GDP by 2018 to increase domestic savings. The monetary policy
framework should be normalized and the stance should be further tightened. The central
bank should rebuild its depleted stock of international reserves. Macro prudential
measures should be strengthened, while buffers in the banks should be maintained.

RESILIENT GROWTH BUT EXTERNAL IMBALANCES
A. Context
1.
The economy is broadly growing at potential but external imbalances keep
accumulating. With the economy projected to grow at 3.8 percent in 2015, output and
unemployment gaps are practically closed. The current account deficit (CAD) is improving on the
back of better terms of trade. However, at about -50 percent of GDP, the net international
investment position (NIIP) is large by international standards and deteriorating under the baseline.
Moreover, given the high share of short-term debt, the country’s annual external financing needs
are around 27 percent of GDP.

B. Current Trends
2.
In 2015, growth displayed resilience despite several shocks with monetary policy
insufficiently tight (see Section C below) and fiscal policy neutral (see Section D below).


4

Political uncertainty. Two parliamentary elections, the war in Syria, escalating tensions with
Russia, resumption of the armed conflict in the South East, and terrorist attacks generated
security and political uncertainty, undermining consumer confidence and investors’ risk appetite.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TURKEY



Weak investment and declining profitability. In line with other emerging markets, investment
has been lagging, even as investment was strong in 2015Q2. Moreover, the tighter external
and domestic financing conditions, the increasing burden of corporate debt in foreign
exchange (FX), and the consequent decreasing profitability compounded by increasing real
unit labor costs (ULCs), have been taking a toll on investment.



Capital outflows have put pressure on the Lira. The large Lira depreciation increased the
burden of FX debt for the non financial corporate (NFC) market, now standing at a gross
US$291 billion, or US$184 billion on a net basis. Non-exporting entities were particularly
affected (see IMF 2016b) and this contributed to low private investment.



Depressed external demand. While demand from the EU registered some marginal pick up,
oil exporting trade partners were hit by a sharp fall of fuel prices. Hence, the contribution of
net exports to real growth remained negative (see paragraph 8 below).

3.
Yet, several factors have made the economy more resilient to shocks. Turkey has been
one of the countries that benefitted the most from the low international oil prices in 2015. The lira
depreciation increased the competitiveness of exporting firms. In addition, it improved households’
net wealth, in lira terms, as households have net FX assets amounting to around 14 percent of GDP
in September 2015. Corporate profit remains high, despite the long-term downward trend.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

TURKEY

Moreover, companies have long FX positions over the short term, thanks to sizable FX deposits, and
more than half of NFCs’ external debt has maturity of more than 3 years.
4.
Still, growth is below both the historical average and the authorities’ long-term target.
Economic growth is lower than the 5 percent 2002–15 average and authorities’ announced 5 percent
target due to ever decreasing contribution of investment and negative contribution of net exports.
5.
Potential growth is also slowing. With both capital and labor growing strongly on average
from 2006–14, the slowdown in potential output growth is due to stagnant total factor productivity
(TFP) growth (Box 1 and IMF 2016b).

Box 1. Turkey: Potential Output in Turkey
Potential output growth started to decline in 2006, dropped further going into the global financial
crisis, and has since remained low—mainly as a result of lower potential TFP growth. The decline in TFP
was partially offset by capital accumulation and an increase in labor force participation from 46 percent in 2007
to 50 percent in 2013, thanks to a 7 percentage point increase in female labor force participation and the
female employment rate (IMF 2016b).
Potential output growth is expected to average 3–3½ percent from 2015–20 under current policies.
Labor force growth is expected to contribute ½–1 percent to potential output growth. Capital stock growth is
expected to contribute about 2 percent to potential output. With about 2½–3 percent contribution from
capital and labor, potential TFP growth of ½–1 percent is necessary for Turkey to achieve a potential output
growth of 3–3½ percent going forward. This is a significant increase from the negative growth rates after the
global financial crisis but less than during the first half of the 2000s.

6.
The employment rate is low, especially among women. The employment rate (at about
46 percent) remains much lower than the OECD average. The low female labor force participation
and low retirement age are among the factors behind low employment levels. At an estimated
10.2 percent, the unemployment rate remains high, in part due to the rigid labor market rules
(including a high labor tax wedge and high firing costs) and educational mismatches. Moreover,

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TURKEY

absorbing the over 2.5 million refugees—who have been recently granted work permits—is a further
challenge, as they may compete directly for employment with lower-skilled women.
7.
Inflation remains high. Both headline and core inflation1 came out at 9.6 percent in January
2016, well-above the 5 percent target, partly due to exchange rate pass-through. Consequently,
expectations remain poorly anchored; with end-year headline inflation expectations increasing from
7 to more than 8 percent in 2015.

8.

At the same time, external vulnerabilities remain high:



The current account deficit remains large despite lower fuel imports and the 2015 depreciation.
The 2015 CAD is estimated to have improved to 4.4 percent of GDP due to lower energy
prices. However, the trade balance excluding gold and fuel deteriorated. Export revenues fell
because of weak growth in trading partners and increasing ULCs. The real effective exchange
rate (REER) depreciated by only 6.9 percent because high domestic inflation offset much off
the nominal depreciation of the Lira. Overall, the economy’s external position remains
moderately weaker than the level consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable
policies (Annex IV).

1

Core-I inflation excludes energy, food, nonalcoholic beverages, alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, and gold.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TURKEY



The quality of external financing is a concern. The maturity of bank loans increased after a
change in reserve requirement rules (Section E below and Annex IV). However, the financial
account balance (excluding reserves) shrunk to about 2 percent of GDP in 2015 with net
portfolio flows turning negative. Net FDIs remain low, net errors and omissions are large and
volatile, and the CBRT has used its international reserves to finance part of the CAD.



The large negative NIIP contributes to the CAD through increasing interest payments. Turkey’s
NIIP reached -50 percent of GDP in 2015 supported by favorable valuation effects (Box 2)
with FDI and equity portfolio shrinking while debt portfolio increasing. By 2021, the NIIP is
projected to deteriorate to -60 percent of GDP. Debt service payments are large, simply due
to the sheer size of the NIIP, and are projected to increase given the large share of debt with
short maturities and variable interest rates, and increasing international rates.

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TURKEY



A large external debt with high external financing. The external debt increased to 56 percent
of GDP in 2015 with banks continuing to leverage up in wholesale FX financing. While the
debt repayment profile over the next 12 months is broadly smooth, about one third of
external debt is short-term, and financing needs remain above 25 percent of GDP over the
projection horizon (Annex IV).

TURKEY

Box 2. Turkey: Net international Investment Position Valuation Effects
Turkey’s persistent current account deficits led to the accumulation of one of the largest negative NIIP
among emerging markets, in excess of about -50 percent of GDP. During 2000–15, foreign liabilities,
consisting of mainly debt, at the expense of FDI and other equity investment, increased from 57 to 83 percent
of GDP and exceeded US$600 billion. Over the same period, foreign assets grew from 20 to 33 percent of GDP
(to about US$227 billion).
In the last few years, however, the total change in the NIIP fell short of the cumulative CAD by a large
margin. In 2010–14 the difference between the sum of current account deficits and the change in the level of
NIIP was US$109 billion. This means that absent favorable effects from valuation and other factors, NIIP would
stand close -70 percent of GDP in 2015. Part of the difference was driven by introduction of the Reserve Option
Mechanism (ROM) in 2011. Banks were allowed to meet their reserve requirements on lira-denominated
liabilities by using foreign exchange and gold. By the end of 2014, the use of ROM in gold reached about
US$16 billion. These gold holdings became part of the CBRT’s gross reserves and were reflected in the
countries’ foreign assets. The remaining portion of the mismatch between the dynamic of the CAD and the
NIIP is explained by an increasing role of net errors and omissions (NEO) and favorable valuation effects. In
2010–14 the net value of BoP transactions captured by the NEO term exceeded US$9.9 billion. While the nature
of NEO is mixed, CBRT believes that this item, to a large extent, represents savings abroad. Finally, by 2010, the
combined share of foreign equity investments and debt denominated in Turkish lira reached 57 percent of the
total stock of liabilities. This helped to limit the growth of foreign liabilities during Lira depreciation. At the
same time, FDI and portfolio flows, items that are most sensitive to price and FX changes, constitute a larger
share of gross liabilities than assets. Hence, changes on the liabilities side dominate the dynamics of the NIIP
for a given size of stock. The cumulative impact of the aggregated ‘valuation’ changes over 2010–14 is
estimated at about 10 percent of 2014 GDP.
Valuation effects supported a modest NIIP improvement in 2015 to about -50 percent of GDP. Apart
from the CBRT, in the beginning of 2015 Turkey was short in USD, euro, and Turkish Lira. In 2015, the Turkish
Lira depreciated 21 percent against the US dollars and 6 percent against the EUR, improving the NIIP in USD
terms. Overall, the effect of FX and other changes on the NIIP value in US dollars was in the order of
US$90 billion, which is significantly larger than valuation effects registered in previous years.

A low private saving rate is the primary cause of external vulnerabilities. Many factors
contribute to the low private saving rate: (i) the expansion of safety nets and rapid urbanization,
lowering precautionary savings; (ii) possibly financial deepening (which empirically typically has an
ambiguous impact on saving); and (iii) low international real interest rates which are still providing
cheap FX financing. For 2015, even the low (by peer country standard) private investment rate of
16 percent generates a private sector saving-investment gap of -3.8 percent of GDP. In contrast, the
public saving-investment gap is around -0.5 percent, supported by an overall prudent fiscal policy.
10.
Buffers in the economy have decreased. In the private sector, the profitability of non-bank
corporates and the capital adequacy and profitability of banks have all decreased. In the public
sector, fiscal buffers remain high as a primary surplus and trend real GDP growth above the real
interest rate imply that the debt to GDP ratio continues to decline gradually (Annex III). Finally, the
CBRT has been intervening in the market through auctions and direct sales of net reserves to
importing SOEs. Therefore, Gross International Reserves (GIRs) have declined and fell below
90 percent of the IMF assessment of reserve adequacy (ARA) metric (Annex IV).

C. Medium Term Projections
11.
The minimum wage increase will boost consumption. In January 2016, the government
raised the net minimum wage by 30 percent, fulfilling an electoral promise. This increase poses
challenges for the labor markets, competitiveness, and the fiscal balance (Box 3). In addition,
relaxation of macroprudential measures on consumer credit scheduled for April will provide further
incentives for consumption.
12.
A loosening of the fiscal stance is envisaged for 2016. The nonfinancial public sector
primary surplus will decline by about 0.6 percent of GDP, in part due to the impact of the minimum
wage increase and spending related to electoral promises (Table 5). For 2017–18, it is expected to
recover to its 2015 level as the support related to the minimum wage increase is discontinued and
other current spending is contained.

Box 3. Turkey: The Increase in the Minimum Wage
The minimum wage was increased by 30 percent in January. The increase—raising the net minimum wage
to about TL1300 per month—is expected to directly impact more than 8 million workers in the formal sector.
During the year, in order to ameliorate the impact on the labor market and the corporate sector, the
government will provide support amounting TL100 per month for workers earning up to gross TL2,550 per
month.
The minimum wage is relatively binding in
Turkey. Ever since a similar sharp increase in
2004, the ratio of the statutory minimum
wage to median wages has been the highest

among OECD countries. The increase could

The increase in labor costs will amount to
about 1.1 percent of GDP, although

for the first year. If the impact on the labor

market is small, consumption could increase by about 0.6 percent of GDP, boosting the economy and
government revenues—reducing the net cost to the government to about 0.3 percent of GDP. However, a less
benevolent scenario, with lower formal employment, will hinder growth while increasing the net fiscal costs.

13.

Current policies will boost consumption in the near term….



In 2016, growth is projected to be 3.8 percent, supported by domestic consumption thanks
to minimum wage increase, by the relaxation of macroprudential policies, and
accommodative fiscal and monetary policies. Exports are contained due to still lackluster
growth in the EU and from oil exporting countries, and because of sanctions from Russia
(Box 4 and Table 2).



In 2017, growth is projected to decline slightly, reflecting slower real wage growth,
recovering oil prices, and the envisaged fiscal consolidation.



In the medium term, growth is projected to stabilize at around 3.5 percent, driven by
domestic demand. The contribution from net exports is not expected to increase
substantially unless reforms improve competitiveness.

… but will hardly help rebalancing (Table 3 and Table 4). In 2016, despite low external
demand, the CAD would improve to 3.5 percent of GDP mainly because of low oil prices. For
2017–2018, staff assumes a gradual recovery in the EU and in the Middle East, and limited wage
growth, helping to push the non-oil balance into a surplus and boosting the overall current account.
Nevertheless, over the medium term the deficit
is expected to climb again, with the moderately
overvalued CPI-REER, higher energy prices and
low competitiveness (as real earnings continue
to grow more than productivity) returning the
CAD to 4.4 percent of GDP.
15.
Consequently, external debt,
financing requirements, and the NIIP would
deteriorate. The external debt and the NIIP
would stabilize at around 56 and 60 percent of
GDP, respectively (Annex II). External financing
requirements would remain at around 26 percent of GDP as the progressive lengthening of external
liabilities induced by the recently adopted macroprudential measures would compensate for the
negative impact of higher international interest rates (Annex II).
16.
On balance, the risks to the medium term baseline are on the downside, leaving Turkey
exposed to a sudden stop (Annex I).


On the positive side, the recent agreements to reopen EU accession chapters could serve as
an anchor for reforms. The intensification of trade with Iran and a stronger than expected
recovery in the EU and neighboring countries could further help reduce external imbalances.
Finally, the prompt passage and implementation of reforms promised by the new
government may yield results earlier than envisaged, with higher than expected productivity
gains.



On the negative side, the large annual financing needs, low and declining net international
reserves (NIR), the short-term nature of capital inflows, and the ever larger negative NIIP are
important risks. The US Federal Reserve could accelerate interest hikes and further increase
the cost of external financing. Political pressure on the CBRT could re-merge, especially in
the process of appointment of several board members. The recent increase in terrorist
activity, the unrest in the South East, and any deterioration of the political situation could
take a large toll on investors’ confidence. The escalation of sanctions from Russia may
further disrupt external demand. The 30 percent minimum wage increase could have a larger
than estimated negative impact on formal employment, corporate profits and private
investment.

On balance, the downward risks can affect the outlook in the short run while the positive risks will
affect the scenario only in the medium term, so the balance of risks is negative in the short term.

Box 4. Turkey: Impact of Sanctions from Russia
Toward the end of 2015, Russia introduced restrictions on its economic relationships with Turkey.
Sanctions concerned a wide range of food and manufacturing imports from Turkey, tourism and construction
services, and included restrictions on hiring Turkish citizens. Visa-free travel to Russia was suspended starting
from January 2016. Construction of a nuclear plant project in Turkey was put on hold. Later, restrictions were
eased for selected manufacturing companies with production on Russian territory, and construction companies
with long-term contracts. Turkey had launched an anti-dumping probe against Russian steel.
Before the collapse of the oil price, trade turnover between the two countries was approaching
US$38.2 billion. Exports to Russia, including its share in the
shuttle trade, constitute about 1.3 percent of Turkey’s GDP.
Russia is the second largest country by tourist arrivals, and an
important consumer of Turkish food and industrial products.

including about US$3.5 billion losses in the tourism sector.
The announcement of economic restrictions created disruptions in late 2015, and it will take time for the
producers to redirect exports to other markets. Export revenues, however, were already shrinking as Russia was
in recession and some large construction projects were finalized. Meanwhile further reduction of commodity
prices will limit the increase in the deficit of Turkish trade with Russia.

POLICY AGENDA: ACHIEVING EXTERNAL EQUILIBRIUM
AND HIGHER GROWTH
A. Key Policy Dilemma
17.
Turkey faces a pressing need to reduce its sizable external imbalances. On the supply
side, structural reforms are necessary to boost the private saving rate, increase competitiveness and
ultimately raise potential output. But reforms will deliver results only over the medium term. In the
meantime, vulnerabilities should be reduced with demand policies, including monetary and fiscal
policies, and some prudential measures in the financial sector.
18.
The staff’s recommended mix of cyclical and structural policies would ultimately
reduce the CAD and stabilize the NIIP. The key items include the following:

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TURKEY



Structural reforms. Increasing funding of the private pension and the severance pay system
would deliver the largest dividend to
permanently increase the saving rate. In
addition, labor market reforms aimed at
increasing participation, in particular of
women and refugees, and productivity
would increase potential output (Section B
below).



Tighter monetary policy. A tighter monetary
policy would help re-anchor expectations,
contain NFC balance sheet effects, and is
justifiable in the context of rapidly decreasing global liquidity (Section C below).



Higher reserves. The combination of higher reserves—currently at 86 percent of the IMF ARA
(Section C below and Annex IV)—and other policies would contribute to a real effective
depreciation of the Lira, which staff assesses as moderately over-appreciated (Annex IV). This
would improve external competitiveness by adjusting relative prices, which is a much more
desirable avenue than externally imposed income compression (Section C below).



Tighter fiscal policy. A consolidation of 1.5 percent of GDP over 2016–18 would contribute to
rebalancing by increasing aggregate savings (Section D below).

19.
The staff’s policy recommendations would lower growth in the short term but increase
potential output and stabilize the NIIP in the medium term. Demand management policies
recommended by staff would reduce growth by 1-2pps relative to the baseline in the short term.
However, these policies would also decrease the probability of a disruptive sudden stop, and,
crucially, would reverse the NIIP’s negative trend, and would help bring down inflation to its target.
Macro stability would favor savings and investment, Structural reforms promoting savings and
productivity would support higher growth in the medium term. The combination of prudent macro
policies and structural reforms would ensure sustainable growth with a contained current account
deficit.

B. Structural Reforms
Background
20.
Private savings are insufficient to finance long-term growth. Current domestic savings
are insufficient to finance domestic investment despite the fact that domestic investment, at around
20 percent of GDP, is also low by international standards (see paragraph 9 above).
21.
The employment rate is well below the OECD average, especially for women, and
unemployment is high. The reasons for this poor performance are rigid labor market rules

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

TURKEY

(including high hiring and firing costs) and educational mismatches. In addition, the over 2 million
refugees, who have been recently granted working permits, add pressure.
22.
The authorities’ reform program lacks prioritization and implementation thus far
remains in progress. Proposed reforms include modifying the private pension system to increase
funding and participation, reforms in the education sector and labor market to boost
competitiveness, boosting revenues by expanding some tax bases, and deepening capital markets to
encourage corporates to borrow from domestic markets.
23.
The minimum wage is already high in comparison to other EMs in the region. The
minimum wage has been increasing in real terms in the last decade, standing over 50 percent of
average wages in 2015, and is a key factor pushing up ULCs (paragraph 11 above and Box 3). More
than 30 percent of employees are estimated to earn minimum wages or less.

Staff position
24.
Priority should be given to reforms aimed at decreasing the saving-investment gap
and increasing competitiveness. Specifically, reforms aimed at increasing funding in the private
pension and the severance pay systems (Box 5) while maintaining a tight fiscal stance, should be
implemented swiftly. These reforms could raise the private saving rate (IMF 2016b), especially as the
current pay-as-you-go pension system remains generous by international standards.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TURKEY

Box 5. Turkey: Boosting Private Savings
The authorities have put raising the private saving rate forward as an important policy goal to reduce
the economy’s external vulnerability. They have introduced a subsidized third pillar pension scheme, and,
more recently, a savings subsidy for dowry and housing accounts. They have piloted an auto-enrollment
funded pension scheme, and are committed to extend the auto-enrollment scheme nationwide. Lastly,
proposals to reform the severance pay scheme by making it a funded and transferable benefit have been put
forward. The authorities have also used macroprudential tools to limit credit growth, motivated by the aim of
curbing excessive household borrowing.
Going forward, full and swift implementation of the pension and severance pay reform plans is key.
Given the urgency of reducing vulnerabilities and the time lag with which new policies will affect the saving
rate, efforts should begin as soon as possible. In addition, Turkey’s relatively young population and declining
fertility rate imply the country is enjoying a demographic dividend. This provides a window of time to increase
savings in anticipation of almost inevitable population ageing in the future. Macroprudential policies limiting
credit growth should also remain part of the policy mix. IMF (2016b) provides more details on policy options.
These reforms will likely have other benefits besides increasing domestic savings and reducing external
vulnerabilities. They include more labor market flexibility through severance pay portability; lowering of old
age poverty rates through higher pension savings; and boosting domestic capital market development. They
may hence provide an important contribution towards the authorities’ stated goal of boosting the long term
growth potential of the economy.

25.
The authorities should pursue a prudent minimum wage policy and help integrate
refugees into the labor market. Increasing the minimum wage faster than productivity is growing
could hinder competitiveness and long-term growth prospects, and foster informality. For this year,
the government support will ameliorate the impact on labor costs—although a more focused
government support could have reduced the fiscal costs. For the future, it will be important to
contain increases in the minimum wage at or below programmed inflation. Integration of the large
number of refugees is a difficult economic and social challenge, and will require considerable fiscal
effort (it is estimated that over 700000 children require schooling.) However, refugees could provide
a boost to economic growth if integrated into the labor market (Box 6).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

TURKEY

Box 6. Turkey: Refugees in Turkey
Turkey has one of the largest refugee populations in the world. Since the beginning of the Syrian crisis in
March 2011, Turkey has received over 2.5 million
refugees. According to the authorities, Turkey has
spent over US$10 billion (including foreign
contributions of US$0.4 billion) on refugees, since
2011.
Refugees have had an impact on informal
labor markets. By end 2014, 86 percent of
refugees had left the refugee camps and moved
mostly to the provinces near the Turkish-Syrian
border (45 percent) and to Istanbul (14 percent).
Until January 2016, refugees were not allowed to
work legally and worked only in the informal
sector, with possibly some negative effect on the labor market of low-educated, female Turkish workers in
informal agricultural jobs.
Authorities are working to integrate refugees in the labor market. In January 2016, and also in the context
of collaboration with the EU, new legislation allows refugees to work with some restrictions to avoid disruptive
effects on the labor market. The authorities are also working on an action plan to improve integration,
especially in education (considering the large number of refugees of school age) and housing, also leveraging
future grants from the EU.

Authorities’ position
26.
The authorities agree that structural reforms are necessary to reduce external
imbalances. Their agenda builds on three blocks:


their 10th development plan, which is in advanced stage of implementation and which they
argue will deliver results this year, including more FDI to produce products currently imported,
better commercialization of R&D, and the development of capital markets;



critical structural reforms in the areas of the rule of law, education, private pensions, the labor
market, income tax, and the judiciary, and aim at increasing competitiveness, labor market
flexibility, savings, and in this way, potential output; and



the enlargement of the custom union with the EU to services, public procurement, and possibly
agriculture. Talks are likely to start in 2017H1.



In 2016, the coverage of the private pension system will be increased by introducing automatic
assignment of workers.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TURKEY

27.
The authorities shared the view that the raise in minimum wage would have an
immediate boost to growth and inflation. They also had concerns about the potential challenges
of the wage increase for labor markets and competitiveness. Citing the strong fiscal position, they
viewed the temporary labor subsidy as appropriate, because it would reduce the pressure on firms
from higher wage bills and ameliorate possible negative consequences on employment and labor
market formality.

C. Monetary Policy
Background
28.
In 2015, monetary tightening was insufficient to lower inflation. The CBRT tightened the
monetary stance moderately and in an opaque way by further limiting the share of liquidity at the
one-week repo rate. However, inflation is still above target.

29.
The CBRT has not normalized its monetary framework. By purposely confusing the signal
on the stance, the unorthodox monetary policy framework has impaired monetary transmission and
not delivered target inflation. After announcements in August 2015, the CBRT has taken only
marginal steps to normalize the framework, eliminating the liquidity facility for primary dealers and
simplifying the collateral framework. However full normalization has been postponed.
30.
Reserves are below the IMF ARA metric. The CBRT has been intervening in the market
through auctions and direct sales of net reserves to importing SOEs. Therefore GIRs have declined
and remain well below the IMF assessment of reserve adequacy (ARA) metric.

Staff position
31.
The monetary stance should be tightened. The one-week repo rate should be quickly
increased into solidly positive real territory, and be sustained to bring inflation back towards the
target. Macroprudential policies cannot be a substitute for such tightening. Given the CBRT’s low
credibility and the widespread de facto indexation combined with the recent large minimum wage
increase, achieving disinflation solely through monetary tightening could entail high output losses.
Instead, monetary policy should be supported by fiscal consolidation and structural reforms

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

TURKEY

(decreasing indexation), which would help contain the growth in ULCs, rebalance the economy, and
re-anchor expectations.
32.
The monetary policy framework should be normalized and communication
strengthened. The CBRT should normalize its framework, by narrowing the interest rate band and
providing all liquidity demanded by the market at a single policy rate. A normalized framework
would facilitate effective CBRT communication and thus help rebuild credibility. In addition, the
CBRT should provide clear guidance on how it intends to react to demand and supply shocks,
including to the expected increase in inflation in 2016 stemming from the minimum wage hike.
33.
Net reserves should be increased to help weather shocks. An increase in gross reserves
of the order of US$14 billion in 2016 and another US$6 billion in 2017 would be needed to achieve
the ARA metric. Thereafter, they would need to be allowed to grow at the same pace as GDP. The
increase in GIR should be accompanied by a commensurate increase in NIR.2 This could be partly
achieved by halting off-market sales and daily FX auctions (while maintaining the option to conduct
auctions), and refraining from interventions in the absence of disorderly market conditions. Tighter
monetary policy will serve to alleviate pressure on the currency that may ensue, and, market
conditions permitting, would allow for opportunistic FX purchases by the CBRT to further strengthen
its reserve position.

Authorities’ position
34.
The central bank felt that the current monetary framework has served the economy
well and that the stance is appropriate. It has allowed them to set a high marginal rate of funding,
while at the same time relieving some of the pressure on banks through a lower average funding
rate. They plan for a gradual return to the 5 percent inflation target over the next three years. In this
regard, they see the high marginal funding rate as appropriately tight, and stressed that while
headline inflation may still remain high until 2016Q2 due to the minimum wage increase and food
inflation representing a large share of the CPI basket, other measures of core inflation have started
to decline. In addition, they emphasized the role of macroprudential policies in containing financial
stability risks associated with excessive consumer credit growth. Given the strong relationship of
consumer credit growth and imports, they saw measures to contain the growth of credit as being
more important than REER depreciation to reduce external imbalances, especially as they believed
the exchange rate was already consistent with fundamentals. Finally, in February the government
announced price caps on certain red meat products whose inflation has been particularly elevated.
They assess the probability of a sudden stop as low, and do not see the need for additional
monetary tightening as recommended by Staff.
35.
The monetary framework will be simplified when capital flow volatility is reduced.
Following the roadmap for simplification announced in August 2015, the CBRT had started to
2

The main difference between gross and net international reserves is accounted for by banks’ FX deposits in the
CBRT, which stood at about US$80 billion in the end of 2015, including about US$25 billion of ROM in FX.

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TURKEY

simplify its monetary framework. However, later the authorities considered that it is prudent to delay
the simplification process given the recent global financial volatility. Simplification will resume once
global volatility subsides.
36.
Gross international reserves are expected to stop decreasing after2016Q1. The CBRT
management expects off-market FX sales to the main state-owned energy company (Botaş) as well
as on-market FX demand from the only refinery company in Turkey (Tupraş) to decrease in the
coming months, driven by delayed effects of lower oil and gas prices. In addition, the amount and
frequency of FX auctions may be reconsidered going forward. Taken together, the central bank
expects GIRs to stabilize from end-March onward.

D. Fiscal Policy
Background
37.
The fiscal stance was broadly neutral in 2015 but the structure of the budget has
worsened. Above-target expenditure has been offset by stronger than envisaged tax revenues,
particularly domestic VAT and some excises, as well as one-off contributions to social security from
an amnesty. The fiscal tightening envisaged in the 2015–2017 medium term plan (MTP) did not
materialize.
38.
The fiscal stance will loosen in 2016. Consolidation is being delayed mostly to
accommodate new spending related to election promises and a temporary labor subsidy to
ameliorate the impact of the increase in the minimum wage (Box 7). Consolidation is resumed later
on, albeit with less ambitious targets than in the 2015–2017 MTP. Enhancing long-term growth and
strengthening domestic savings through structural reform remains the backbone of the MTP’s
ambitious structural reform agenda.
39.
Fiscal targets do not support rebalancing and face important risks. With a modest
consolidation of ½ percent of GDP in three years, fiscal policy targets fall short from a stance that
would provide sufficient support for the

Box 7. Turkey: The New MTP Targets Provide Less Support to Rebalance the Economy
The Medium Term Program (MTP) has ambitious
targets and optimistic assumptions. It seeks to
accelerate long-term growth through structural reforms
and to raise domestic savings to rebalance the economy. It
envisages strong growth, reaching 5 percent in 2017, and a
current account balance that declines to 3½ percent of
GDP. The MTP assumes that the effect of structural reforms
will increase potential output growth to 5 percent in two
years, with employment increasing quickly. It seeks to
reach the 5 percent inflation target, but only in 2018. The
non-financial primary surplus target accommodates the
minimum wage and other election related spending in 2016, postponing consolidation until 2017.

40.
There is scope to improve risk management and enhance reporting, particularly at the
fiscal “periphery.” A decade-long decline in debt to GDP, the extension of public debt maturities to
reduce annual financing needs, and the adoption of IPSAS 32 accounting standards highlight the
government’s efforts to strengthen risk management and reporting. Nonetheless, public-private
partnerships (PPP) have been increasing rapidly since 2009, which requires stronger central
oversight, approval, disclosure, and anti-corruption measures. However, the government fiscal risk
register, alternative macro-fiscal scenarios, and long-term fiscal projections—including on
pensions—are not published.

Staff position
41.
Staff recommends a consolidation of 1½ percent of GDP by 2018. While fiscal
sustainability is not a concern, the stronger stance seeks to contribute to (i) support an increase in
domestic savings; (ii) facilitate the CBRT’s efforts to reach its inflation target; (iii) boost policy space
given the increasing fiscal risks related to the use of PPPs and guarantees, and the leverage and
indebtedness of private sector. The consolidation should focus on current expenditure and there is
also scope to mobilize revenues—including through higher carbon taxes (Box 8)—and by lowering
informality. Investment should not be further cut given still large infrastructure needs, as this would
also generate incentives to use PPPs even if the risks outweigh the benefits.
42.
The authorities should further strengthen their risk management and reporting. Staff
stressed the need for central oversight, approval and disclosure of PPPs. It also highlighted that a
fiscal risk statement can help to manage risks, improve economic efficiency and reduce borrowing
costs.

Authorities’ position
43.
The authorities assess that the slack in the economy calls for a stimulus in 2016,
especially given the strong overall fiscal position. The authorities estimate that output is about

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TURKEY

1 percent below potential and the fiscal impulse will put the economy closer to internal equilibrium,
albeit generating some inflationary pressure, which is recognized in the new MTP. A looser fiscal
stance is also necessary to accommodate electoral promises. The authorities recognize the need to
strengthen the fiscal stance in the medium term to preserve fiscal buffers, to support price stability,
and to increase domestic savings.
44.
The authorities agreed that the minimum wage increase might have some negative
impact, and plan to use some of their fiscal space to ameliorate the effect on firms and the
labor market. They agree that the minimum wage will foster domestic consumption, working
against the rebalancing of the economy. However, they consider this a temporary shock with
consolidation efforts resumed in 2017.

E. Financial Sector
Background
45.
Bank buffers are above regulatory
minima, but continue to deteriorate. Banks had
an average capital adequacy ratio of 15.6 percent
(13.2 percent Tier-1) at the end 2015.
Macroeconomic stress tests by the supervisor and
the central bank show that banks are resilient to
significant shocks, and prudential regulation
prohibits providing household credit in FX.3
However, return on average equity (ROAE) has
declined to 11.3 percent, partly as a consequence
of compressed net interest margins and fee rebates the banks had to pay their customers. This may
restrict opportunities for banks to raise capital, at a time where capital increases may be needed for
some banks to stay above the 12 percent level (at which more intense regulatory scrutiny starts to
apply). Total debt of non-financial corporates has also increased rapidly in recent years.

The supervisor’s stress testing models include assessments of credit, interest rate, and exchange rate risk. The
upcoming FSAP will discuss these models and provide detailed assessments of capital adequacy and liquidity under
stress.

Box 8. Turkey: Environmental Taxes
Turkey is ahead of other emerging markets in addressing the challenge of pricing energy consumption
at a level that reflects its true costs, including environmental and health costs (carbon emissions and hence
global warming, the impact of air pollution on health, and the bearing on traffic congestion, accidents and
road damage.) Faced with the need for fiscal consolidation after the 2001 crisis, the authorities raised excises
on fuels and reformed the energy sector, which not only strengthened public finances but also helped the
environment and reduced negative externalities.

Nonetheless, there is still ample room to further reduce post-tax subsidies, particularly for coal, which has
a significant impact on local air quality. Moreover, the specific excise taxes on gasoline and diesel have not
changed for the last three years, which implies a decline in the real value of the tax.

46.
Macroprudential measures and low growth have curbed credit growth and slowed the
pace at which leverage is increasing (Appendix E). FX-adjusted credit growth has decreased to
14 percent on an annual basis. FX deposits have increased in reaction to the Lira depreciation,
generating lower demand for FX wholesale funding. Although growth in FX deposits stopped in
2015H2, the switch from non-core to core FX liabilities continues as overall credit growth is lower. In
addition, recent macro prudential measures discouraging short term wholesale FX funding are
starting to have an effect, lengthening the maturity of FX funding.4 However, macroprudential
measures have yet to meaningfully reduce (indirectly, by containing systemic risk) external

4

Since October 2015, reserve requirement ratios for short-term FX liabilities were further increased, but only for new
liabilities emerging after August 2015. Remuneration of TL reserves has increased by 200 bps. The full impact of
these measures is expected to be felt only in 2018.

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TURKEY

imbalances: credit growth (while decreasing) continues to be high and banks continue to
intermediate a large share of Turkey’s external debt.
47.
Still, banks’ wholesale external foreign exchange funding has risen rapidly. The sector’s
loan-to-deposit (LtD) ratio stands at 119 percent, with the ratio at 89 and 142 percent for foreign
(FX) and local currency respectively. Wholesale external funding in FX is, on the margin, financing
the expansion of local currency lending. Driven by the interest rate differential, this exposure has
risen from US$61 billion in 2009 to US$135 billion in October 2015. The exposure at short maturity
has decreased marginally over the last two years, to US$78 billion (Figure 4a). Banks hedge the FX
risk associated with this funding, mainly off-balance sheet, and hence the net open FX position of
the sector is small at 1 percent of regulatory capital.
48.
Rollover risk and indirect credit risk associated with FX lending have increased. The
rollover risk and hence FX liquidity risk associated with the gross exposure is significant. Should
these risks materialize, banks’ deposits with the CBRT under the reserve option mechanism (ROM),
and possibly FX reserve requirement deposits could be used to partially cover the FX liquidity needs.
In addition, banks face indirect credit risk stemming from their FX and FX-indexed loans to NFCs.
The NFC sector’s net open foreign exchange position has increased from US$67 billion at end-2009
to US$174 billion at end-October 2015. Anecdotal evidence suggests part of this net open position
is hedged or covered by FX collateral, but data gaps prevent quantification.

49.
In addition, the gradual introduction of Basel III may increase the need for banks to
raise capital. New risk weights and countercyclical and systemic capital buffers will be phased in,
starting this year. First, risk weights on banks’ FX-denominated required reserves and ROM deposits
at the CBRT will increase in April 2016. At the same time, risk weights on consumer and mortgage
lending will be lowered, in anticipation of introducing debt-to-income ratios. Second, certain
subordinated loans will no longer be counted as Tier 2 capital. Taken together, these measures are
expected to lower the average CAR in the banking system by about 0.6 percentage points. The BRSA
has also announced the detailed schedule of the introduction of additional capital buffers. While the
schedule foresees a gradual phase in of these buffers over the period 2016–19, the required
minimum CAR will increase by a total of 4.5–7 percentage points. Taken together, these
developments may put many banks CAR close to or even below the required minimum, thus

necessitating capital increases. Without such increases banks’ capacity to lend may be curtailed.
Over the medium term, the move toward IRB risk weighting may increase the capital ratio, providing
some relief. The upcoming FSAP will review these issues in detail.

Staff position

Macroprudential policies should be strengthened, targeting banks’ wholesale FX
external financing. Specifically, current reserve requirement measures aimed at lengthening the
maturity of banks’ external financing as well as the net stable funding ratio could be phased in more
quickly, while increasing the remuneration differential between FX and Lira reserves could slow
overall FX wholesale borrowing. To increase buffers and incorporate the increased indirect credit risk
associated with FX lending, higher capital charges should be considered and provisioning on FX
loans increased as a prudential measures. Related to this, the prudential treatment of FX-indexed
lending should be brought into line with that of FX lending, as it materially pertains to the same risk.
Data gaps needs to be closed to better assess risks from FX exposures by NFCs. Finally, the
relaxation of risk weights on consumer lending should have awaited the introduction of debt-toincome ratios.

Authorities’ position
51.
The BRSA felt that the sharp slowdown in consumer credit growth allowed for a
relaxation of macroprudential measures. Thus, they announced a decrease of risk weights on
consumer loans from April. The resulting increase in the banks’ capital ratio is seen as supporting
banks at the time they will see pressure on capital adequacy from an increased risk weight on FX
deposits at the CBRT. BRSA management explained that they will maintain the maximum maturity
restriction on consumer loans, which they see as the more binding constraint.
52.
The regulator does not see a need for new measures targeting FX risk. Banks have a
negligible net open FX position, and their stock of wholesale external financing has decreased over
the last year. In addition, the BRSA feels that FX risk is better managed through the supervisory
review process. In the longer term, once income data are available, the regulator plans to move to a

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TURKEY

regulatory regime for consumer lending based on debt-to-income ratios. Finally, while the overall
foreign exchange risk in the economy remains substantial, the BRSA remains confident that its
vigilant supervision and broad powers to address problems in banks as they occur suffice. In this
regard, they see no need to accelerate the schedule for the introduction of the net stable funding
ratio.

F. Contingency Planning
Background
53.
A sudden capital flow reversal remains
the main risk in the short term. Shocks in
international capital markets could result in
accelerated capital outflows or, in extremis, a
sudden stop. In such an environment, banks and
corporates will find it difficult to roll over their
external debt, and banks may also find it
prohibitively expensive to renew their FX hedges. Banks will likely react by not rolling over
corporates’ domestic FX loans, precisely at the time when corporates will be strained to repay them.
Staff estimates that a 20 percent depreciation shock would lead NFCs’ leverage to worsen by about
45 percentage points (Box 9). Hence the banks would see a large credit risk materializing. The
economy would likely enter a recession.

Staff position
54.
In such disorderly market conditions, the authorities should react by employing both
monetary and fiscal policies. While a modest nominal depreciation is warranted, a sharp
depreciation may become a shock amplifier and hence increase financial and macroeconomic
disruption. A sharp increase in the policy rate will be needed to support the exchange rate and
facilitate an orderly deleveraging process. Direct FX intervention may be warranted, but reserves are
low, and thus the scope for any credible intervention is limited. In the likely event of a recession (and
only in such a case), the authorities should consider loosening fiscal policy to support the real
economy. Preemptively publishing an explicit fiscal risk statement may facilitate such a fiscal
reaction. Still, corporate liquidity or solvency problems may occur, requiring swift and appropriate
action.

Authorities’ position
55.
The authorities do not assess the risk of sudden capital flow reversal as high. In the
current juncture, Turkey is faring much better than its emerging market peers. In addition, the
current asynchronous monetary policy of major central banks does not raise concerns about major
liquidity gluts. Finally, the strong trade and financial linkages with a recovering EU suggest that even
in moment of crisis, rollover ratios will not decrease drastically.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

27

TURKEY

56.
In addition, the economy has sufficient buffers to withstand severe shocks. Policy
buffers are high as the fiscal stance is prudent and the public debt to GDP ratio is low and continues
to decrease. In addition, the private sector has shown its resilience. Households cannot borrow in FX,
are not highly indebted, and have plenty of cash buffers. Banks have no open FX position, are well
managed, and have high loss-absorbing levels of capital. The industrial structure of the economy is
flexible enough to withstand external shocks and Turkey has proven to be able to diversify its
exports. Non-bank corporates have a sizeable net open FX position, but no signs of distress have
been observed after the recent large depreciation. This suggests that corporates are largely hedged.
57.
Finally, the authorities argue they have a wide set of instruments to manage any
pressures that might occur. For mild shocks, the CBRT can influence the cost of lira, as well as
on-shore euro and dollar funding separately, through its remuneration regime of required reserves
and its liquidity provision framework. This has been made even more flexible with the recent
inclusion of FX assets in the basket of eligible collateral for CBRT Lira liquidity, which would provide
support should the FX swap market temporarily close. Should a more severe shock occur, they
would first let the automatic stabilizers work. Fiscal policy would be used in case of a recession. In
case banks need to draw down the ROM, they have sufficient Lira assets that the CBRT could accept
as collateral under the emergency liquidity assistance framework to provide Lira liquidity. In
addition, unrecorded Turkish assets abroad would come back as necessary. In this respect, the
authorities mentioned that net errors and omissions in the BOP are countercyclical (see paragraph 8
above.)

Box 9. Turkey: Balance Sheet Effects
Following the financial crisis, banks have become the main channel through which external funding is
intermediated. Banks’ total external debt has increased from about 8 percent of GDP in 2008 to about
29 percent in September 2015. These external liabilities are mainly in FX and are mostly matched by FX
denominated loans to the non-financial corporate and FX deposits with the central bank. In addition,
household deposits are another important source of FX funding to the banks.
Non-financial corporates have large FX exposures owing to borrowing from the domestic banking
system and directly from abroad. While external borrowing has declined, there has been an increase in the
overall FX exposure of the sector as the increase in FX borrowing from the domestic banking system is larger
than the decline in external borrowing. The result is an overall net FX open position in the sector of about
27 percent of GDP by September 2015. This consists of 17 percent of GDP in external borrowing, 25 percent in
domestic FX borrowing, 2 percent of GDP in other FX liabilities, and 17 percent of GDP in FX assets.
Households have significant FX deposits and limited external liabilities as FX borrowing is restricted.
While some households continue to have some outstanding FX indexed debt, the amount is a small in
comparison to their FX deposits, which amounted to about 14 percent of GDP in September 2015.
Reflecting the FX open positions, a scenario involving depreciation of the lira would significantly
worsen the NFCs balance sheet yet improve households’ net wealth. A 20 percent depreciation would
result in an increase in the NFCs leverage (debt-to-equity ratio) by about 44 percentage points, to about
205 percent. This reflects the large FX liabilities in the corporate sector—which account for about 50 percent of
total NFCs liabilities—amplified by the depreciation shock. Households’ assets would improve (in lira terms)
from their holding of FX deposits. Other sectors in the economy tend to be less affected, with banks’ capital
ratios (measured by equity-to-total assets) deteriorating by about 2 percentage points.

Strong growth is set to continue in 2016, but with higher inflation. The 30 percent
increase in the minimum wage, a planned relaxation in macro prudential regulation, a moderate

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

29

TURKEY

loosening of fiscal policy, and the insufficiently tight monetary stance will support domestic demand
and GDP growth. Inflation is well above the authorities’ 5 percent target and on the rise.
59.
Underlying external imbalances persist. The improvement in the current account is due to
lower oil prices, and the non-energy balance has barely changed. The economy’s external position
remains moderately weaker than the level consistent with medium-term fundamentals. The current
domestic demand-based growth does not help rebalancing and the low private saving rate, if
unaddressed, will perpetuate accumulation of external imbalances. Moreover, financing of the deficit
remains a concern, with some of it coming from reserves.
60.
The economy has shown resilience in the face of external shocks but buffers have
decreased. The large foreign currency debt of the nonfinancial corporate sector and the
dependence of banks on foreign financing expose Turkey to the risk of accelerating capital outflows.
International reserves have declined and the international investment position remains highly
negative. The fiscal stance has been loosened.
61.
The main challenges are to reduce external imbalances and to boost the potential
growth rate of the economy. In the short run, a reduction of external imbalances can be achieved
through tighter fiscal and monetary stances. Macroprudential policies may also have a further role
to play, but are not a substitute for these macroeconomic policies. If such policies are implemented,
slower domestic demand growth and increased savings would lower external imbalances. This would
provide a window of opportunity to implement far-reaching structural reforms to raise the private
sector saving rate and potential output, delivering stronger and more sustainable long-term growth.
62.
A tighter fiscal stance would contribute to reducing external imbalances and lowering
inflation, creating additional space to react to shocks. With public debt at 32 percent of GDP,
debt sustainability is not a concern. Yet, fiscal policy consolidation could be more ambitious than
envisaged in the MTP. A stronger public sector budget position would create additional policy space
to react to shocks. The increasing use of guarantees and PPPs to finance investment entails
contingent liabilities that could materialize during a downturn.
63.
A tighter monetary policy stance is needed to bring inflation back to the 5-percent
target in the medium term. Inflation remains well-above target and has increased recently.
Inflation expectations have remained unanchored. The real policy rate should be increased into
decisively positive territory. This would also alleviate depreciation pressure on the lira.
64.
The framework for monetary policy needs to be improved to strengthen its
effectiveness. Narrowing the interest rate band and providing all liquidity demanded by the market
at a single policy rate will provide a clear signal on the policy stance and strengthen the monetary
transmission mechanism.
65.
Reserves should also be boosted. Given the improvement in the current account balance,
the CBRT should increase its net reserves. Interventions should be restricted to periods of disorderly

30

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TURKEY

market conditions. Tighter monetary policy would help to support, market conditions permitting, FX
purchases.
66.
Buffers in the banks should be maintained as risks persist. The external macro
imbalances bring risks that are reflected in the banks’ balance sheets. As intermediaries of foreign
savings, banks remain reliant on external wholesale funding and have large FX exposures to the
domestic corporate sector. Banks have been resilient so far. Capital adequacy ratios remain above
regulatory minima and are mostly based on high-quality capital. Nonperforming loans are low and
well provisioned. Macroprudential policies have lengthened the maturities of banks’ wholesale FX
external financing, adding some resilience. Looking forward, prudential policies should be adjusted
to reflect increased risks associated with FX lending. The recent adjustment of consumer loan risk
weights that will take effect in April should be reviewed if consumer credit growth rebounds too
sharply. Other macroprudential measures focused on overall indebtedness would also be useful.
67.
The authorities’ appropriately ambitious structural reform agenda is central to the
goal of successful economic rebalancing. Specifically, reforms aimed at increasing funding of the
private pension and the severance pay systems could significantly raise the private saving rate.
Addressing the lack of flexibility in the labor market and further developing local capital markets
would boost growth and improve competitiveness. The authorities’ reform plans should be
implemented swiftly and fully.
68.
The increase in the minimum wage will pose challenges to the labor market,
competitiveness and fiscal balance, although higher wage may improve income distribution and
provide a short-term economic boost. In the context of rigid labor markets, efforts to improve labor
market flexibility would help avoid a surge in informal sector employment, and would diminish the
negative consequences of higher wages for competitiveness.
69.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held again on the usual
12-month cycle.

Likelihood

Impact

Tighter or more volatile global financial conditions:



Sharp asset price decline and decompression
of credit spreads sharply deteriorating Turkey’s
external financing outlook, as investors reassess
underlying risk and respond to unanticipated
changes in growth and financial fundamentals in
large economies, the Fed policy rate path, and
increases in U.S. term premia, with poor market
liquidity amplifying volatility



Surge in the US dollar exchange rate: a further
dollar surge creates balance sheet strain for
Turkey, where many corporates are dollar debtors,
but dollar exports are limited.
Structurally weak growth in Europe:



Weak demand and persistently low inflation from
a failure to fully address crisis legacies and
undertake structural reforms, leading to low
medium-term growth and persisting financial
imbalances in the Euro area, hurting demand for
Turkish exports.
Loose domestic policies leading to:



High inflation and a deteriorating fiscal position,
eroding confidence and leading to
re-dollarization. This could occur if the
government tries to spur growth through demand
management, rather than long-term structural
reform.

Medium



Russia: the conflict between Turkey and Russia
escalates, leading to further trade sanctions,
possibly including energy supplies.



In case a recession ensues,
consider loosening the fiscal



Medium term: Diversify export
destinations, increase high
value-added exports, and
improve competitiveness, thus
boosting exports.



Short-run: Tighten monetary
policy and normalize the

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of
IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a
probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM
reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks
may interact and materialize jointly.

Annex II. External Debt Sustainability
Turkey’s external debt continued to increase and is estimated to exceed 50 percent of GDP in 2015.1
The debt path is sustainable and robust to most stress tests. Under the baseline debt is forecast to
increase slightly over the medium term. However, it is susceptible to a large Lira depreciation. In
addition, annual external financing needs in excess of 25 of GDP expose the economy to high liquidity
and rollover risks.

Background and assumptions
1.
Turkey has relied on debt-creating flows, mainly short term, to finance its large and
persistent current account deficit. As a result, Turkey’s external debt exceeded 50 percent of GDP
in 2014. Private creditors, including bondholders, hold close to 90 percent of debt. Most of external
debt resides with banks that intermediate capital inflows into domestic loans, mostly in Lira but also
in FX. About one third of the total external debt stock, or about 16 percent of GDP, was short term in

Under the baseline, the current account deficit would continue to add to the debt
stock over the medium term, while the structure of external financing would slightly improve.
Staff forecast the current account deficit to increase to about 4.5 percent of GDP over the medium
term. This in part reflects slow recovery of the oil price and a gradual increase in global interest rates
leading to a deterioration of the investment income balance. Amid a low global interest rate
environment, the effective interest rate paid by Turkey on its external debt fell to 1.5 percent in
2014–15, this rate is projected to increase to 4.3 percent over the medium term. Debt-creating flows
would remain the main source of financing, despite some increase in the share of foreign direct
investments. Assuming that the recent trend in lengthening of new debt maturities would continue,
1

The debt sustainability analysis is based on the definition of external debt used by Undersecretary of Treasury,
covering liabilities arising from loans obtained from the residents abroad and liabilities arising out of bonds issued in
international capital markets. Government securities issued in Turkish lira are excluded.

This includes ‘nonresidents’ deposits in Turkish banks and trade credits with the original maturity of less than
12 month.

the share of short-term external debt (by original maturity) in the total debt stock would decline
slightly over the medium term and would stay at about 30 percent of the total debt stock.

Assessment
3.
High level of Turkey’s external debt, while sustainable, is vulnerable to valuation
shocks. The debt path stabilizes at just above 56 percent of GDP by 2020 under the baseline
scenario. A steeper recovery of fuel prices, leading to current account of about 5 percent would
push the debt ratio above 60 percent over the medium term. The debt path remains robust to
standardized growth and current account shocks. However, more than 90 percent of Turkish external
debt is denominated in foreign currency. Hence, the debt path is susceptible to exchange rate
movements. A permanent Lira depreciation by 30 percent would push the external debt stock to
83 percent of GDP by 2020.3 This analysis however does not take into account the potential
contraction of the current account deficit associated with such a sharp currency movements.

4.
External financing requirements in excess of 25 percent of GDP and a large share of
debt with adjustable rates make the economy vulnerable to shifts in global liquidity and
international investor’s appetite. In 2016 Turkey is expected to repay over US$170 billion of debt
to external investors. Combined with the interest rate bill and trade deficits this adds up to total
gross financing needs of over 26 percent of GDP. A relatively smooth quarterly debt repayment
profile over the next 12 months is a mitigating factor, and cheaper energy imports will compensate
for increased debt service. However, about

The baseline projections already take into account a combined negative valuation effect coming from lira and euro
depreciation vis-à–vis dollar in 2015. For the projections, the valuation effect is assumed to be zero.

The stress test was modified to account for potential increase in Turkey’s risk premium.

Annex III. Public Debt Sustainability
At about 32 percent of GDP (measured as general government gross debt according to Maastricht
criteria), Turkey’s public debt ratio is well below its historical ten-year average. Gross public sector
financing needs have decline significantly and will remain low over the medium term. The DSA
suggests that Turkey’s government debt is sustainable even under different shock scenarios. Given the
debt structure (average maturity of 6.4 years, 67percent of total debt at fixed interest rates, and only
35 percent of the debt in foreign exchange) the direct interest and exchange rate pass-through to the
budget is relatively slow. Only the impact of lower GDP growth rates represents a significant threat to
debt dynamic. While all public debt profile indicators are below early warning benchmarks, the high
external financing requirements point to risks arising from the external debt position.

Baseline and Realism of Projections1
1.
Debt-levels. Turkey’s favorable debt dynamics are underpinned by a primary surplus and
trend GDP growth above the real interest rate. Despite the impact of a weaker currency, debt to GDP
ratio continues to gradually decline. Staff forecast that the ratio will continue its declining path from
already moderate levels reaching 26 percent in 2020—down by 7.4 pp since end-2014. At 5.1 percent
of GDP in 2015, gross public financing needs have decline from 15 percent on average for 2005–13—
a significant accomplishment.
2.
Growth. Past projections of growth outcomes show high forecast errors, possibly due to
high volatility of GDP in Turkey, but don’t seem to have a systematic bias that undermine the
assessment of sustainability. The current growth projections are similar to the levels for 2014–15,
which lessens their positive impact in reducing the level of debt. The output gap is roughly closed in
2015, and is projected to remain closed over the medium term. Turkey’s debt is highly sensitive to
big swings in GDP growth, highlighting the relevance of growth shocks in the stress tests.
3.
Sovereign yields. Turkey’s yields remain quite volatile, albeit they remain below the levels in
the first quarter of 2014. The spreads against the US bonds in the last three months remained on
average at 283 bps, higher than its lowest value of 118 bps observed in May 2013. The effective
interest rate is forecast to decline from 9.1 percent in 2015 to 8.2 percent in 2016. However, in the
medium term—despite lower inflation—the effective rates are expected to increase due to the push
from international rates.
4.
Fiscal adjustment. In the baseline the structural primary balance improves slightly, albeit the
change in the headline number is smaller as it compensates some one-off social security revenues.
The maximum projected 3-year adjustment of the cyclically-adjusted primary balance is slightly
positive.

5.
Maturity and rollover. Given current debt structure (average maturity of 6.4 years,
67 percent share of fixed interest debt to total debt, and only 35 percent denominated in foreign
currency), the direct interest and exchange rate pass-through to the budget are small.

Shocks and Stress Tests
6.
Primary balance shock. A deterioration of 1.0pp of GDP in the primary balance for 2 years
slows down the downward trend of debt-to-GDP ratio relative to the baseline. Sovereign borrowing
costs are pushed up (25 bps for each 1 percent of GDP worsening in the primary balance). The
impact on the debt-to-GDP ratio and gross financing needs levels by 2021 is modest.
7.
Growth shock. Real output growth rates are lowered by 1 standard deviation, or
4.2 percentage points, for 2 years starting in 2017. The decline in growth leads to lower inflation
(0.25 percentage points per 1 percentage point decrease in GDP growth). The nominal primary
balance deteriorates significantly compared to the baseline as nominal revenues fall against
unchanged expenditure plans, reaching -2.6 percent of GDP by 2016. The deterioration in primary
balance leads to higher sovereign borrowing costs. The debt-to-GDP ratio increases to about
37 percent during the growth shock and then gradually trends down. By the end of the period, gross
public financing needs climb toward 8.5 percent of GDP.
8.
Interest rate shock. The real effective rate reaches similar levels as in 2009, which implies a
permanent increase in spreads by about 400bps. The government’s interest bill climbs reaching an
implicit average interest rate of 14.1 percent by 2021. The debt-to-GDP ratio remains at low levels
below 30 percent, and while gross public financing needs increase, they remain below 8 percent of
GDP by 2021.
9.
Contingent liability shock. A one-time bail out of the financial sector is assumed to increase
non-interest expenditures by 10 percent of banking sector assets.2 This is combined with real GDP
growth shock (1 standard deviation for 2 years). Sovereign borrowing costs are pushed up (25 bps
for each 1 percent of GDP worsening in the primary balance) while inflation declines
(0.25 percentage points per 1 percentage point decrease in GDP growth). Debt rises to 36 percent of
GDP in 2018 and then gradually declines. Gross public financing needs increase to about 8 percent of
GDP in the medium term.
10.
Combined shock. A combined shock incorporates the largest effect of individual shocks on
all relevant variables (real GDP growth, inflation, primary balance, exchange rate and interest rate). In
the case of Turkey, a combined shock would increase debt to around 41 percent of GDP, still below
the average debt level between 2004 and 2012.

2

This shock is equivalent to 4.8 percent of GDP. The shock could also be seen to cover (a combination of) other
contingencies, part of which could be a bailout of PPP projects or loan guarantees. PPP projects with treasury
investment guarantees amount to 0.9 percent of GDP, treasury guaranteed loans (outside the general government)
amount to 1.4 percent of GDP, and loan subject to debt assumption amount to 1.1 percent of GDP.

Annex IV. 2015 External Sector Assessment
Turkey
Foreign asset and
liability position
and trajectory

Background. Despite a modest improvement in 2015, at -51 percent of GDP Turkey’s net international investment
position (NIIP) remains somewhat weaker than those of peers. Foreign liabilities are in excess of 80 percent of GDP, with
short-term debt and portfolio investments in debt securities accounting for about 30 percent of GDP and about half of
long-term debt have floating interest rates.
Assessment. A significant share of foreign liabilities in Turkish lira has provided a buffer during currency depreciation.
However, large favorable valuation effects cannot be sustained in the medium term. Moreover, the currency composition
of foreign liabilities exposes Turkey to liquidity shocks and increases in global interest rates. Unless the current account
(CA) deficit improves substantially in the years ahead, Turkey’s NIIP would continue to deteriorate by some
10 percentage points of GDP in the medium term.

Current account

Background. The CAD is estimated to have narrowed to 4.4 percent of GDP in 2015 mainly due to lower fuel prices. The
trade balance excluding gold and fuel also deteriorated. The CA deficit is expected to narrow further in 2016 as the
effect of lower energy import costs is likely to outweigh weak performance of selected trading partners and strong
domestic consumption. However, the CAD is forecast to widen to 4.5 percent of GDP in the medium term as the oil price
recovers. The EBA model estimates that in 2015 the cyclically-adjusted CA was some 3.7 percent of GDP weaker than the
level implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. According to the external sustainability (ES)
approach, CA deficit was 1-2 percentage points above the level consistent with stabilizing NIIP at the current level.
Assessment. Staff assesses that the CA gap in 2015 was in the range of -1 to -3 percent of GDP. This is consistent with a
CA norm in the range of -2 to -3.5 percent of GDP, reflecting large investment needs of a fuel importing emerging
economy. While lower oil prices are expected to reduce the CA deficit and gap for 2016, tighter monetary and fiscal
policies are still necessary to reduce the CA remaining gap.

Real exchange
rate

Background. The real effective exchange rate (REER) registered a 12 year minimum in 3Q 2015, the trend reversed in
4Q as the monetary stance remained too loose and inflation increased. On an annual average basis, however, it
depreciated by only 2.5 percent from 2014. The EBA REER index approach estimates a 5.9 percent overvaluation in 2015;
the REER level regression suggests a 19.5 percent overvaluation. Based on the ES approach, a 5-8 percent REER
adjustment is required to stabilize NIIP. As of January 2016 the REER stood close to its 2015 average level.
Assessment. Consistent with the assessment of the CA gap, staff assesses that the REER was overvalued by about 510 percent in 2015. As of early 2016, the improved terms of trade, combined with a broadly unchanged REER, would
suggest some reduction in the REER gap.

Capital and
financial
accounts:
flows and policy
measures

58

Background. Turkey experienced a major fall in net capital inflows in 2015. In 2015 net inflows (excluding US$9.6 billion
in net errors and omissions and a US$11.8 billion fall in reserves) shrank to some 1.5 percent of GDP. On the other hand,
targeted macro prudential measures forced banks to lengthen maturity of external financing. Turkey has not made use
of capital controls on inflows or outflows.
Assessment. A large share of short-term debt exposes Turkey to significant rollover risks. Gross external financing needs
are estimated at over 26 percent of GDP in 2016, making Turkey vulnerable to changes in global market conditions.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Overall Assessment
Overall Assessment:
In 2015, Turkey’s external position was
weaker than the level consistent with
medium-term fundamentals and
desirable policy settings.
The external position could strengthen
in 2016 due to terms of trade gain
from lower oil import prices.
However, net international reserves
are still low, and the NIIP will
continue to deteriorate until the CA
deficit is reduced. Moreover, given
large financing needs and a high
share of short-term capital inflows,
Turkey remains vulnerable to capital
flow reversal.
Potential policy responses:
Reducing the CA deficit further is
necessary to diminish vulnerabilities.
Monetary policy should keep real
interest rates solidly in positive
territory. The CBRT should increase
net international reserves, limiting
foreign exchange intervention to
smoothing periods of excessive
volatility.
Structural reforms aimed at
increasing private sector savings,
including pension reform, are needed
to enhance private savings and allow
high growth with a sustainable
current account deficit. These reforms
should be supported by fiscal policy
tightening over the medium term to

Turkey
FX intervention
and reserves level

Background. The exchange rate is floating. The central bank sells foreign exchange to commercial banks through
regular auctions (since June 2013) and to energy importing SOEs via direct sales (since December 2014). The cumulative
total amount of these sales was about US$23 billion in 2015 increasing from about US$12 billion in 2014. Turkey’s gross
reserves fell to 86 percent of the IMF composite adequacy metric at end-2015 (from 95 percent at end-2014). Adjusting
the level of reserves for ROM-related reserve holdings in foreign currency reduced it to 82 percent of the composite
adequacy metric in the end of 2015. Reserve cover of short-term debt declined to 64 percent at end-2015. 4 At
US$29 billion at end 2015, net reserves available for intervention are significantly lower than gross reserves.

Overall Assessment
increase public saving.

Assessment. Given Turkey’s low net international reserves, reserve accumulation is warranted.

Technical
Background
Notes

1/ NIIP narrowed from -55 percent of GDP in 2014 to -51 percent in 2015, despite of a CA deficit in excess of 4 percent of GDP. Large net errors and omission
(about 1.3 percent of GDP) could explain part of the discrepancy; The remaining improvement is to a large extent driven by favorable valuation effects, which
reflect significant share of FDI and debt in Turkish lira in foreign liabilities.
2/ The windfall of lower energy prices are estimated at about 1.6 percent of GDP in 2015. Fuel trade balance was -5.8 percent of GDP on average in 2010-2014.
3/ The simulations under the ES approach included an assumption of a positive annual average capital gain of 0.5 percent of GDP.
4/ ROM (Reserve Option Mechanism) allows commercial banks to meet their reserve requirements on lira-denominated liabilities by using foreign exchange and
gold.

Increased provisions for
consumer loans

For new (performing) general purpose loans, general
provisions were increased from 1 percent to 4 percent.
General provisions for (pre-nonperforming) loans
increased from 2 percent to 8 percent. The higher
provisioning requirements are conditional on banks
having a consumer loan portfolio exceeding 20 percent
of total loans or having a general purpose loan NPL
greater than 8 percent.

Remuneration of TRL
required reserves

The CBRT starts paying an interest rate on banks and
financing companies’ required reserves (RR) in TRL. The
interest rate on RR will be the weighted average cost of
the CBRT’s funding rate minus 700bps for all banks for
2014. Starting with 2015, the interest rate on RR will be
the weighted average cost of the CBRT’s funding rate
minus 500bps for banks and financing companies that
have a core funding (i.e., (deposit + shareholder’s
equity)/credit) ratio higher than the sector average and
that maintain or increase their own core funding ratios
with regard to the reference period, and minus 700bps
for the remaining banks and financing companies.

Annex VI. Authorities’ Response to Past Policy Recommendations
1.
Traction of past Fund advice. The authorities and staff agree that the external imbalance
should be reduced, and that this should be done while preserving investment. They also concur that
lowering inflation is a key objective. Moreover, to preserve financial stability, the authorities
introduced well-targeted macroprudential measures to slow the rise in household leverage and
encourage banks to increase core funding. They plan to tackle structural issues through the 10th
Development Plan. However, the authorities believe risks are lower than what Staff believes and that
the economy has enough buffers to withstand reasonable shocks. Thus, fiscal and monetary policies
would remain more accommodative than recommended by staff.

TURKEY

WORLD BANK RELATIONS
1.

Turkey and the World Bank Group have a strong partnership, which has continuously

deepened. Turkey’s National Development Plans form the basis of the partnership between Turkey and
the World Bank Group. The Ninth (2007–13) and the new Tenth Development Plan (2014–18) overlap the
CPS period. The main pillars of both Development Plans are fully consistent with the CPS and the
alignment has been further fine-tuned through the CPS Progress Report (PR) of September 2014 which
extended the CPS by one year to include FY16. The three main strategic objectives and CPS pillars;
namely (i) enhanced competitiveness and employment; (ii) improved equity and social services; and
(iii) deepened sustainable development remain highly relevant. The CPS PR reflects less than anticipated
demand for lending in support of education and increased emphasis on governance and transparency as
critical elements of Turkey’s competitiveness. The CPS PR also aligns the WBG’s engagement with the
new WBG Strategy and its twin goals of boosting shared prosperity and eradicating poverty.
2.

The current CPS has so far delivered financing of over US$9.3 billion during FY12–16. This

includes US$4.3billion through the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD),
US$4.0 billion through the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and US$982 million through the
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA).
3.

Turkey’s development priorities provide ample opportunities for unlocking value from

closer cooperation across the WBG and other partners. The energy sector is an example where IBRD
work on the regulatory framework has helped unlock significant IFC supported private investment to
expand renewable energy and energy efficiency. The same opportunity presents itself in the health
sector, the railway sector, the municipal sector and in PPPs more generally, with the health sector most
advanced. In the financial sector, the combined balance sheet and product range of the WBG will be
mobilized to increase the domestic funding pool and attract longer term financing, particularly to benefit
Turkish exporters and SMEs and infrastructure financing. The World Bank Group engages with civil
society in the preparation and implementation of projects and collaborates closely with other
development partners such as the IMF, the EU, UN organizations, and other key bilateral partners

A. International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
4.

Turkey is the IBRD’s sixth largest borrower in terms of debt outstanding. Turkey’s active

portfolio of investment operations with the World Bank’s IBRD financing includes 10 projects with total
net commitments of US$3.92 billion (as of February 2016). The investment portfolio and pipeline support
the energy sector, financial and private sector development, urban development, water, transport, and
health.
5.

Turkey greatly values the WB’s knowledge work. A growing area of common interest is

sharing Turkey’s experiences with other developing countries. In December 2014, the Bank launched the
report, “Turkey’s Transitions: Integration, Inclusion, Institutions,” which looks at the lessons Turkey has
learned over the past 30 years. The extensive range of knowledge products has started to shift to a more
programmatic approach that will include multiyear and multiple output delivery activities. Knowledge

services inform policy in various reform areas (education, health, labor, energy) and are the Bank’s
primary instrument for engaging and broadening ownership through joint preparation and close
cooperation with all stakeholders (human development, investment climate, gender certification in
employment, sustainable urban development). Critical parts of the Bank’s technical support are aligned
with the EU accession process (e.g., energy, customs union, environment, competition and business
regulation). Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS) are also expected to develop strongly in the coming
years from their currently low levels.
6.

The Turkey program is supported by selected Trust Funds. The Turkey trust fund portfolio

currently consists of 39 (13 Recipient and 26 Bank-executed) trust funds. They amount to US$256 million,
with the bulk of funding (US$190 million) accounted for by the Clean Technology Fund (CTF).

B. International Finance Corporation
7.

With a portfolio of around US$3.43 billion, Turkey represents the second largest country

exposure for IFC globally. In FY15, IFC had a third consecutive record year in Turkey, investing
US$1.8 billion in projects to support sustainable energy and infrastructure development, improve
municipal services, develop public-private partnerships (PPPs), promote local capital markets, and help
Turkish companies increase competitiveness and impact. IFC also advised businesses and government
bodies on initiatives to encourage private sector growth.
8.

IFC is investing more than foreseen in the FY12–16 Country Partnership Strategy. In FY15,

IFC committed US$1.3 billion in equity and long-term loans across 28 projects, more than doubling the
previous year total. Of this amount, close to US$500 million included financing mobilized from third party
investors. IFC also provided US$530 million in short-term loans to support trade finance.

C. Multilateral Guarantee Agency
9.

Turkey is MIGA’s second largest country by gross exposure representing about 7.0 percent

of MIGA’s gross portfolio. In the first half of FY16, MIGA’s portfolio in the country was 8 projects with a
gross exposure of US$918 million or US$425 million net of reinsurance. Four projects are in the
infrastructure sector, two in the financial sector and two in the services sector.
10.

MIGA support to the Turkish economy has been growing over the past couple of years.

Under the current CPS program, MIGA has delivered financing of approximately US$982 million to
Turkey, and the outstanding guarantee portfolio has reached US$918 million. Turkey is the subject of
targeted MIGA business development efforts to unlock opportunities for credit enhancement as well as
political risk insurance (PRI) coverage. The most promising opportunities for MIGA lie in the financial
sector (supporting on-lending to SMEs and exporters), urban transport, and PPPs in the health care
sector.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of February 22, 2016)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision to the Fund is broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, despite certain

shortcomings especially in national accounts and government finance statistics.
National Accounts: Quarterly national accounts are published with a 2–3 month lag. The Turkish
Statistical Institute (TURKSTAT) compiles and disseminates quarterly GDP by production and
expenditure approaches, in current prices and in volume terms. The annual GDP is a sum of the four
quarters. The GDP by income approach was estimated for 2002–2012, but the results are not yet
published. The main weaknesses of the system for compiling quarterly GDP at current prices are the
lack of annual benchmarks and the reliance of fixed ratios that are outdated (ratios from the 2002
Supply and Use Tables (SUTs) are used). TURKSTAT is now putting in place a regular compilation
system for independent annual estimates of GDP and for quarterly GDP benchmarked to annual
data. By June 2016, TURKSTAT will disseminate new series of national accounts—both annual and
quarterly data, covering the period 2009–14—based on the System of National Accounts 2008
(2008 SNA)/The European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010). Sectoral financial balance sheets are
compiled for financial corporations on a quarterly basis, and for the general government and
nonfinancial corporations on an annual basis. The financial accounts for the remaining sectors
(households and rest of the world) are not yet disseminated.
Price Statistics: The consumer price index (CPI) and the producer price index (PPI) generally
conform to international standards. The CPI does not cover owner-occupied dwellings, commodities
produced by households for own consumption, and expenditures on commodities obtained through
in-kind payments.
The PPI is compiled only by product (and not by economic activity).
Government Finance Statistics: Coverage of the budget is largely complete. Data for some fiscal
operations conducted through extra budgetary funds are available only with long lags. Fiscal
analysis is further complicated by some quasi-fiscal operations carried out by state banks, state
owned enterprises (SOEs), and other public entities; and technical problems associated with
consolidating the cash-based accounts of governmental entities with the accrual-based accounting
of SEEs. It is difficult to reconcile fiscal data with monetary and BOP data, especially in the
accounting of external debt flows and central government deposits.
The latest data available for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook are for 2012
and cover the general government sector and its subsectors with coverage of both stocks and flows,
including a full general government balance sheet. Monthly budgetary data on a cash basis and
quarterly general government data on an accrual basis are reported on an irregular basis for

publication in International Financial Statistics (IFS), starting from September 2009.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: The Central Bank of Turkey (CBRT) reports monetary statistics
using the standardized report forms (SRFs), which accord with the concepts and definitions set out
in the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual.
Financial sector surveillance: The Banking Regulatory and Supervision Agency (BRSA) reports all 12
core FSIs and nearly all the encouraged FSIs
External sector statistics: External sector statistics are compiled in broad conformity with the
conceptual framework of the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and International Investment
Position Manual (BPM6).

Statement by Mr. İbrahim Çanakçı, Executive Director for Turkey and
Mr. Cem Gökçen, Advisor to Executive Director
March 25, 2016
We thank staff for the productive and candid dialogue with the authorities, and the
comprehensive Article IV report and accompanying papers.
Recent Macroeconomic Developments
Growth remained resilient and was job-rich. The Turkish economy is on a solid
footing despite the weak recovery in its main trading partners, elevated geopolitical
tensions, and a number of external shocks. The economy expanded by 4 percent in the
third quarter of 2015, buoyed by industrial value added and a recovery in the agricultural
output. Fourth quarter data is not yet available, but leading indicators suggest that the
2015 growth figure will be around 4 percent, placing Turkey among the good performers
in the emerging markets.
Job creation has remained robust in 2015, buoyed by solid growth and active labor market
policies. 0.8 million new jobs were added in the last 12 months, while the total increase in
employment has reached 6.9 million since its trough in 2009, which could have been
elaborated more in the Staff Report.
The headline inflation rate has remained elevated, but recent inflation readings
show signs of moderation. Consumer prices edged up by 8.8 percent (year-on-year) at
2015 year-end, despite the tight monetary policy stance and plunging global commodity
prices. The exchange rate pass-through and elevated food price inflation have been the
underlying factors fueling inflationary pressures. In particular, the exchange rate
depreciation drove up prices of core goods (first round effects), and passed through to the
food and services inflation (second round effects). Driven by large increases in fresh fruit
and vegetable prices, unprocessed food price inflation posted a 13.9 percent annual
increase; another year of a double-digit rise which has kept food price inflation above
expected levels. Headline inflation recently lost momentum, falling by 0.02 percent
(month-on-month) in February 2016, supported by a moderation in unprocessed food and
energy prices. A number of measures were introduced to curtail food prices. The Food
and Agricultural Products Markets Monitoring and Evaluation Committee was founded in
December 2014 with a view to monitor food prices and curb undue price changes. The
Ministry of Food, Agriculture, and Livestock recently reached an agreement with
producers and set a ceiling on red meat prices, while leaving the door open to meat
imports.
The current account deficit has been narrowing and is financed mostly by long-term
resources. The current account deficit narrowed to US$ 32.1 billion in 2015, from
US$43.6 billion in 2014. Exports declined by 8.7 percent last year, driven largely by
geopolitical developments and the EUR/USD parity change in favor of the US dollar.
Turkish exporters have switched to traditional markets to compensate for the export
contraction to Russia and the Middle East and North Africa region, which have been on a
downward trend in the last two years. The slowdown in consumer loan growth and the
shift in the total loan composition from consumer to commercial loans in response to two
rounds of macroprudential measures (MPMs) contributed to an import contraction of

2
14.4 percent. Plunging global commodity prices were also supportive of the external
rebalancing.
As evidenced by the favorable rollover ratios, Turkey has continued to attract
sizable resources to fund its external financing needs, even during times of stress.
Net FDI remained robust and covered around 36 percent of the current account deficit in
2015. At the same time, external financing tilted towards longer-term resources with the
help of MPMs, whereas portfolio and short-term fund flows have weakened.
Macroeconomic Outlook and Policies
The revised Medium-Term Program 2016-2018 (MTP), announced in January 2016, is
geared towards promoting strong and inclusive growth while ensuring macroeconomic
stability, taming the inflation rate, and reducing external imbalances.
Macroeconomic Outlook
The authorities are more sanguine on the growth outlook. GDP growth is expected to
accelerate to 4.5 percent in 2016 – slightly higher than staff’s forecast – on the back of an
expected increase in investment demand and domestic consumption supported by the
income policy, low global commodity prices, and improvements in confidence aided by
diminished political uncertainties. With the expected recovery in Europe, net exports will
also make a slightly positive contribution to growth in 2016. Growth is estimated to gain
further momentum and gradually rise to 5 percent in 2017-18, surpassing staff’s
estimates. The divergence between the authorities’ and staff’s growth projections is due
to the different assumptions on the effectiveness of structural reforms. While the MTP’s
growth forecasts are based on the assumption that a number of reforms will be effectively
boosting labor force participation and total factor productivity and yield higher growth in
the medium to long term, staff’s expectations are more modest.
Staff assumes a constant labor force participation rate for projecting medium-term
growth, which is not consistent with recent trends. The staff model for projecting the
labor force participation rate also does not take into account the education variable. With
the increase in education levels, labor force participation rates also edge up, which has
been the case for Turkey in recent years. Another important factor to consider is the
positive effects of active labor market policies on female labor participation. Taking these
factors into consideration, the increase in the labor force participation rate and the
contribution of employment growth to potential growth may exceed staff’s estimates.
Staff’s growth projections also imply that the elasticity of Turkey’s growth rate with
respect to global growth will decline to 0.9 percent during 2016-2020, from 1.2 during
1980-2014, which is difficult to justify in an environment of low energy prices.
Inflation is projected to moderate. Weaker global commodity prices and the subsiding
exchange rate pass-through are expected to offset the impacts of the minimum wage
increase and administrative price adjustments made at the beginning of the year.
Therefore, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) expects the inflation rate
to register a slight decline to 7.5 percent in 2016, gradually converging to the target in
2018. The relatively more stable long-term inflation expectations (compared to short-term
expectations) can also be considered a supportive factor for the benign medium-term

3
inflation outlook going forward. The authorities are well aware of the pressures and risks
on the inflation outlook and remain ready to take measures if needed.
External rebalancing will continue. The current account deficit will shrink to
3.9 percent of GDP this year, on the back of the positive trend in the terms of trade and
the more robust external demand, particularly from the EU. The removal of sanctions on
Iran may also positively impact exports. The deficit will steadily decline to 3.5 percent of
GDP by 2018, while the total domestic savings rate will reach 17.8 percent, a
3-percentage point increase compared to the 2015 level.
Gross international reserves are expected to stabilize. The CBRT provided off-market
foreign exchange to energy-importing state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in order to stem
undue market movements, as foreign exchange (FX) volatility spiked during instances
when SOEs purchased sizable FX from the market directly. FX sales to SOEs reached
US$ 11 billion in 2015. The CBRT also injects foreign exchange liquidity through daily
auctions in a bid to provide signals, especially in the low liquidity environment, whereas
direct FX market interventions – in line with the Fund’s institutional view – have been
limited to disorderly market conditions. Total liquidity provided through FX auctions was
around US$ 12 billion in 2015. The FX demand of energy-importing SOEs and private
companies is expected to decline in the coming months, driven by favorable energy
prices. Export rediscount credits, which helped propel reserve accumulation by
US$15 billion in 2015, will continue to support reserve buffers.
The Turkish economy has strong buffers including low public debt and budget
deficit as well as strong capital and liquidity position of the banking sector and the
authorities can deploy a wide set of instruments to manage downside pressures. We
believe that staff could have made it clear that scenario depicted in the contingency
planning section of the report is a tail risk not the baseline and the sudden capital reversal
is not a risk specific to Turkey but pertains to the most emerging market economies.
Taking into account the existing buffers and the fact that Turkish economy has proven its
resilience several times against such scenarios in the recent past, staff should have been
more balanced in their assessment.
Policies and Structural Reforms
Fiscal Policy
The fiscal policy stance will be growth-friendly, and fiscal prudence, the linchpin of
the Turkish economy’s resilience, will be maintained. The central government budget
deficit fell to 1.2 percent of GDP in 2015, while the general government budget remained
balanced. The 2016 central government budget, recently adopted by the Parliament, is
geared towards bolstering growth potential, raising domestic savings, and curtailing
inflation. Around 19 percent of the budget (or 24 percent of tax revenues) will be
allocated to improve the quality and competitiveness of education, which is essential to
labor productivity. The fiscal policy will also help enhance the labor force skills and
address the skills mismatch. The increase in capital spending, SME incentive schemes,
and R&D expenditures will be growth-supporting elements of the fiscal policy. The
central government budget deficit will widen slightly to 1.3 percent of GDP in 2016 in

4
order to accommodate the rising public spending associated with the minimum wage hike
and electoral promises. Even though debt sustainability is not a source of concern, fiscal
discipline will remain intact to complement the monetary policy’s efforts to tame
inflation. In this regard, the central government budget deficit will fall to 1.0 percent of
GDP in 2017 and to 0.8 percent in 2018. With the help of Turkey’s solid growth
performance, fiscal discipline, and effective debt management policies, the EU-defined
general government debt stock will further drop to 29.5 percent of GDP in 2018. In view
of the aforementioned figures, it is difficult to concur with staff’s assessment that fiscal
targets do not support rebalancing. Contingent liabilities remain limited and the risks
associated with the realization of all contingent liabilities under a stress scenario would be
manageable.
The authorities are determined to adopt the new income tax law, which was not legislated
during the recent election cycle. With the new law, both the income tax base for salary
earners and the property tax base will be broadened, and the implementation of the tax
code will be simplified.
Monetary Policy
The CBRT maintained a tight monetary and liquidity stance in 2015. As we have
indicated in previous Article IV discussions, judgments based merely on the level of
policy rates may not give an accurate impression about Turkey’s monetary policy stance.
The liquidity policy and the effective cost of funding from the CBRT should also be taken
into account in order to get a clear and complete picture of the monetary policy. The
interest rate corridor remained asymmetric with the O/N lending rate standing at
10.75 percent, the one week repo rate (policy rate) at 7.5 percent, and O/N borrowing rate
at 7.25 percent. By providing liquidity mostly at the O/N lending rate, the CBRT has
delivered additional tightening without changing the policy rate. The average funding
rate, which was at around 7.8 percent in March 2015, rose gradually and peaked at
9.1 percent in early February 2016, well above the one week repo rate. Taking all tools in
place into consideration, the CBRT considers the financial conditions as tight.
In August 2015, the CBRT unveiled a roadmap outlining its three-pronged strategy
to simplify the monetary policy framework and strengthen financial stability amid the
normalization of monetary policies in advanced economies. Before the normalization
started, a number of changes were made to the Turkish lira (TL) and in foreign exchange
liquidity management, along with measures introduced to support financial stability. On
the TL liquidity side, the lower interest rate on borrowing facilities provided to the
primary dealers through repo transactions was terminated and collateral conditions were
simplified. On the FX liquidity side, the CBRT raised the transaction limits for individual
banks at the CBRT foreign exchange and banknote markets, and provided additional
flexibility to foreign exchange sale auctions by raising the daily limit to US$ 70 million.
At the same time, FX deposits were accepted as collateral against TL transactions. With
these recent changes, FX assets and gold under the Reserve Option Mechanism, together
with FX deposit limits, are strong enough to cover the banking sector’s short-term
external debt. In order to shore up the banking sector’s core liabilities and lower
intermediation costs, remuneration rates on TL required reserves were hiked by 150 basis

5
points (cumulative) between September-December 2015. The width of the interest rate
corridor would be narrowed and made more symmetric around the one week repo rate,
with the start of the monetary policy normalization. However, in the face of heightened
global financial market volatility and rising uncertainty, the CBRT opted to postpone the
simplification process, as the wide interest rate corridor has been instrumental in
managing FX volatility and, supported by MPMs, has helped contain loan growth. The
CBRT sees strong merit in maintaining a flexible approach in the monetary policy and is
determined to maintain its tight policy stance in order to keep the inflation rate in check.
Simplification will resume once global volatility subsides.
Financial Sector Policies
The Turkish banking system is well-capitalized with strong liquidity buffers and
asset quality. The capital adequacy ratio of around 15.6 percent remained well above the
regulatory minimum. The total non-performing loan ratio was stable, while there was a
slight uptick in consumer loan credit cards and SME loans. Risk weights on consumer
loans have remained well over the Basel III norms and, together with other MPMs, have
significantly helped contain consumer loan growth. The 13-week annualized rate of
growth has slowed down to 3.6 percent in 2015; the lowest reading since 2010. In
contrast, commercial loans posted higher growth rates, which will support the external
rebalancing. A number of measures were adopted to strengthen FX risk management and
support FX liquidity. The required reserve ratios on banks’ non-core FX short-term
liabilities were raised to promote the maturity extension and the use of core liabilities.
The CBRT also lowered its FX lending rate to commercial banks by cutting the foreign
exchange deposit interest rates by 475 basis points to 2.75 percent in US dollars, and 525
basis points to 1.25 percent in euro. The Turkish banking sector’s average FX liquidity
coverage ratio currently stands at around 145 percent and banks can tap into their deposits
with the CBRT under the reserve option mechanism and FX reserve requirements, should
an adverse scenario unfold.
The authorities view the revision in risk weights as a transition to a more effective
macroprudential measure rather than a relaxation of MPMs. As consumer credit
growth decelerated far below expectations, the Banking Regulation and Supervision
Agency brought the risk weights in line with Basel III standards, with changes effective
as of the end of March 2016. These adjustments will support the banking sector’s capital
adequacy ratio and stimulate consumer loan growth, though a significant recovery is not
anticipated in view of the tight financial conditions. At the same time, the authorities have
considered introducing a “debt-to-income ratio” as a new MPM to replace the more costly
and second best measures imposed on consumer credits. With the improvements in
consumer debt and income data collection, the debt-to-income ratio will be adopted.
Hence, in our view, depiction of revision in MPPs as “relaxation” is not well-grounded
and mischaracterizes the authorities’ intention.
The corporate sector has weathered the impacts of the strong US dollar well. There
are a number of factors mitigating the FX risk of the corporate sector:

6
i.

ii.
iii.
iv.
v.
vi.

Most firms with FX liabilities are either hedged or have a natural hedge in the
form of FX revenues or FX receipts from other group of firms in a holding
company.
FX loans are concentrated in large companies with the capacity to absorb the
impacts of large FX depreciation.
The corporate sector has its net FX long position in the short term.
The maturity of FX loans has lengthened and around 75 percent of FX borrowing
is long-term.
Offshore FX assets held by firms act as a buffer in times of stress.
The share of FX loans in corporate loan volume is falling as companies shift to TL
financing in the face of FX depreciation.

Nearly two-thirds of the non-financial corporate sector’s FX liabilities have been
provided by the domestic banking sector. Hence, measures to strengthen FX risk
management in the banking sector will eventually help contain the non-financial
corporate sector’s FX vulnerabilities. At the same time, in order to promote equity-based
financing, the authorities amended the Turkish Corporation Tax Code. With this recent
change, companies can deduct 50 percent of the interest amount calculated over the cash
capital increases of the paid-in capital from the corporate tax base. While the authorities
appreciate the work on non-financial corporate sector debt in Turkey and will use the
policy options suggested in the Selected Issues paper as a valuable input into their
assessments, we would like to highlight two points regarding the balance sheet effects
examined in Box 9. First, staff could have made it clear that this analysis is a hypothetical
scenario and not the baseline projection for Turkey. Second, the box could have also
explicitly stated that the implications of such scenario analysis should be interpreted with
caution in view of data gaps especially pertaining to the assets of NFCs, which limits the
accuracy of mechanical analysis depicted in the box. Indeed, Turkey’s experience is
another evidence of such limitations as, contrary to the previous estimates by staff,
depreciation pressures on currency in the last few years did not translate into the
envisaged strains on the NFCs’ balance sheets.
Structural Reforms
There is strong political ownership and resolve to implement comprehensive
structural reforms in an effort to improve the Turkish economy’s competitiveness,
strengthen its resilience to external shocks, and address impediments to job creation and
investments. The building blocks of the comprehensive structural reform agenda are:
i.
ii.
iii.

Sectoral and micro-reforms unveiled in the 25 transformation programs in the
context of 10th Five-Year Development Plan,
Structural reforms in the areas of the labor market, business environment, public
administration and finance, and judicial and education systems
The EU accession process.

The authorities strongly disagree with staff’s assessment that the reform program
lacks prioritization and that implementation thus far has been poor. Structural reform
efforts are already prioritized and, in an effort to ensure the reform agenda’s timely
implementation, the Reform Coordination and Monitoring Council was established in

7
December 2015, and has met 9 times so far. Actions on reforms that will be completed in
3 months, 6 months, and a year were identified and announced. Among the actions with a
3-month deadline, 10 out of 20 reform actions have already been completed in the first
two months of 2016, which include the following:







Financing of machinery and equipment investments in the manufacturing industry
will be exempt from the Banking and Insurance Transactions Tax.
The Istanbul Arbitration Center was established.
Parliament adopted the trade facilitation agreement.
The regulations on broadening the activities of private employment agencies along
with temporary employment, in line with EU norms and standards, were finalized.
Secondary legislations for dowry and housing accounts were adopted.
The impediments to part-time employment of university students were eliminated.

To bolster labor productivity and promote inclusive growth, the authorities continue to
invest in education and skills improvement policies, and formulate active labor market
policies to shore up youth and female employment. In this context, the following actions
have been taken:






The draft law, introducing flexible modes of employment (i.e. temporary
employment, remote working) was accepted by the relevant Committee of the
Parliament.
The maternity leave and other benefits of women were further improved.
Parents with children under the school age were given the option to work at parttime jobs, earning half of their salaries until their children start elementary school.
Young entrepreneurs starting their own businesses will be exempt from income
tax for three years (up to TL 75,000 annual income).
The salaries of young workers entering the job market for the first time following
the completion of “on-the-job training programs” will be financed from the budget
up to one year, which was previously capped at 6 months.

The authorities are considering two main avenues for boosting savings: introducing
automatic enrollment in the second pillar and a severance pay reform. A draft scheme has
been prepared on the automatic enrollment and is expected to be introduced after the
completion of the mechanism’s thorough analysis. A severance pay reform can provide a
major boon to savings and also foster labor market flexibility. There are different
modalities, which will be discussed with social partners.
Syrian Refugees in Turkey
From the very beginning, Turkey has adopted an open-door policy for Syrian refugees.
As of now, Turkey hosts around 2.7 million Syrian refugees, making it the largest
refugee-hosting country. Significant efforts and funding were mobilized to establish
high-standard refugee camps along with essential public services, including education and
health. Turkey has spent over US$ 10 billion on refugees since 2011. The authorities
recently granted work permits to refugees under temporary protection in an effort to
integrate them into the labor market. Turkey and the EU have intensified their
cooperation to effectively manage the refugee crisis.

8
Conclusion
The Turkish economy continues to grow at relatively robust rates, with the external
deficit shrinking. Fiscal prudence and sustainable debt prospects, which have been major
factors behind the recent confirmation of Turkey’s investment grade rating, remain in
place. The CBRT plans to simplify its monetary policy framework once there is a visible
drop in global volatility. The government is committed to pursuing a comprehensive
structural reform agenda and adopting the relevant measures within the established
timelines. At the same time, the mechanisms to ensure an effective macro-policy
coordination and timely implementation of structural reforms are well-established. The
authorities have a wide range of instruments that can be deployed, when needed, to
manage risks. Taking all these factors into consideration, the Turkish economy’s proven
resilience to shocks in recent years is prone to continue. In this regard, the Staff Report
could have put more emphasis on these pockets of strength and the mitigating factors.
