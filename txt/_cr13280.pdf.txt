STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
August 16, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context: Austria remains an area of relative economic strength in the European
landscape. However, the financial sector faces challenges, in particular legacy issues from
its expansion to Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe (CESEE), and a group of
intervened medium-sized banks poses fiscal risks. In addition, there is scope to improve
the structure of public finances.
Growth outlook and risks: Growth has slowed, reflecting weakness in all demand
components, and expectations are for only a lackluster recovery. The main risks stem
from a re-intensification of the euro area crisis and its ramifications in CESEE.
Fiscal policy: Full implementation of medium-term fiscal adjustment plans still requires
specifying several measures, and plans will need gradual strengthening to take expected
further bank restructuring cost into account. Faster winding down of non-viable
intervened banks would help reduce ultimate fiscal costs.
Structure of public finances: The savings potential in major spending areas (pensions,
health care, and subsidies) will remain considerable even after current adjustment plans
are fully implemented, and meaningful fiscal federalism reforms would help realize this
potential. Savings could partly be used to lower labor taxation, thus boosting labor
supply and potential growth.
Financial Stability: Strong early bank intervention and resolution tools, a better
designed deposit insurance system, and a bank-financed resolution fund would help
reduce the need for budgetary support to any troubled banks in the future. Crisis
prevention could be enhanced by better macroprudential tools.

INTRODUCTION
1.
Austria remains an area of relative strength in the European landscape. The economy is
affected by the regional slowdown but less so than elsewhere, and growth and employment have
held up comparatively well (Figure 1). Unemployment, though on the increase, is the lowest in the
EU. The 2012 fiscal outturn was favorable, and the medium-term fiscal adjustment plan
accommodates currently weak economic conditions. The easing of tail risks in the euro area has
sharply reduced Austrian sovereign spreads (Figure 2).
2.
Financial stability and related policies were recently evaluated under the IMF’s
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP). The FSAP noted that Austria’s large banking
system, which plays a dominant role in CESEE, appears resilient to adverse scenarios on the whole.
Aggregate bank capitalization, funding and liquidity conditions have improved, and Austrian banks’
foreign subsidiaries have reduced their reliance on parent bank funding. Nevertheless, bank asset
quality is still deteriorating in several CESEE countries, while depressed credit demand is hurting
profitability. A group of intervened medium-sized banks face uncertain prospects and pose fiscal
risks.
3.
With elections to be held in September 2013, discussions focused on the policy
priorities for the next government. The current medium-term fiscal adjustment plan needs to be
fully implemented in structural terms and strengthened to compensate for additional costs from
intervened banks. Public spending can be made more effective, with additional expenditure savings
used for reducing the high and distortionary tax burden on labor. As to financial stability, as
recommended by the FSAP a comprehensive framework for early bank intervention and resolution
would help reduce the need for state support in the future, as would a reform of the existing system
of five private deposit insurance schemes and the creation of a separate bank resolution fund.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND
RISKS
Background
4.
Growth has stalled since early 2012, which is increasingly reflected in the labor market.
Real GDP has been flat since the second quarter of 2012, resulting in an annual growth rate of
0.9 percent for 2012, down from 2.8 percent in the year before. Both external and domestic demand
components have been weak and reflected developments in main trading partners, in particular
Germany and CESEE, investment uncertainty, an unwillingness of households to further reduce their
savings rate from already low post-2009 crisis levels, and fiscal consolidation. While employment
growth remained relatively strong in 2012, labor market conditions are now weakening in line with
economic developments. As a consequence, unemployment has been gradually increasing but

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

AUSTRIA

remains low. Credit growth also mirrors economic activity and has decelerated since mid-2012,
mainly driven by weak credit demand while tightening in credit conditions has been limited.
5.
Inflation has remained above 2 percent. Inflation fell from its 2011 peak of 3.6 percent to
2.6 percent in 2012, with a pick-up in the second half of the year. It dropped again to 2.2 percent in
June 2013. Nevertheless, both headline and core inflation remain above the level in Germany, to a
large extent reflecting higher services inflation. In spite of backward-looking wage setting, gross
nominal wage increases in 2012 exceeded inflation only slightly due to some negative wage drift,
leading to very modest real wage growth.
6.
The current account is in a modest surplus. The surplus has fallen considerably from its
pre-crisis level of almost 5 percent of GDP in 2008 and amounted to 1.8 percent of GDP in 2012,
with a deficit in goods more than offset by a surplus in services (Figure 3). The REER has appreciated
somewhat in 2012 reflecting the positive inflation differential with major trading partners.
Outlook and risks
7.
Staff projects gradually accelerating economic activity. A gradual recovery for the
remainder of 2013 and 2014 would be consistent with the modest pick-up in external demand
suggested by some high frequency indicators and a related recovery in investment activity, some
catch-up in private consumption on the back of modest growth in real wages and disposable
income, and fiscal expansion in 2013. This would lead to growth rates of 0.4 and 1.6 percent
for 2013 and 2014, with the output gap bottoming out at around -1½ percent in 2013.
Unemployment will rise to almost 5 percent in 2013/2014 and recede thereafter.
8.
The current account is somewhat stronger than predicted by fundamentals, but the
gap has shrunk and recent trends support euro area rebalancing. According to the IMF’s
external balance assessment (EBA), the current account is somewhat above the norm suggested by
fundamentals, while the real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals. The current
account divergence does not reflect policy gaps included in the EBA exercise, i.e. it is an unexplained
regression residual.1 The surplus in the current account is evident since the early 2000s and reflects
both a decline in the investment rate and an increase in the savings rate. Importantly, the current
account regression residual has shrunk over time and unit labor costs relative to euro area partners
are on the rise, which should contribute to rebalancing within the monetary union.
9.
The most acute risks stem from a re-intensification of the euro area crisis. Overall, risks
are tilted to the downside. They are summarized in the Risk Assessment Matrix (see text table). The
main risk is that stalled or incomplete delivery of euro area policy commitments or policy slippages
1

A fiscal policy “gap” in Austria’s trading partners helps explain some of the Austrian current account surplus, but
this is offset by a negative policy “gap” in social spending (social spending above the norm in Austria would result in
a lower current account balance). A policy "gap" is the difference between the actual and desired value for the policy,
normalized by the world average.

in key countries under market pressure could deal a new blow to fragile market confidence, leading
to adverse aggregate demand shocks and/or a prolonged period of weak growth. Direct trade ties
remain dominated by relatively stable Germany, and cyclical developments follow closely the
German ones despite Austria’s increased eastward integration.2 Nonetheless, while direct exposures
to euro area program countries are small, Austria’s ties with Italy are relatively strong, as Italy is a
sizable trading partner, the second largest bank in Austria is a subsidiary of an Italian bank, and
cross-border exposures, at about 3 percent of GDP, are non-negligible. If a euro area recession
spilled over to CESEE, this would further delay the recovery of real estate and credit markets and
may result in further currency depreciation in that region, leading to higher NPLs and lower
profitability for Austrian banks already burdened by the crisis legacy.3
The authorities’ view
10.
Authorities’ and staff forecasts and risk assessment are broadly in line. The latest
forecasts for 2013 and 2014 by the Austrian Central Bank (OeNB) and the leading Austrian research
institute WIFO deviate only marginally from staff projections, while the Institute for Advanced
Studies is a bit more optimistic and forecasts growth of 0.6 and 1.8 percent for 2013 and 2014. The
authorities agreed on the main downside risks to recovery, but also stressed upside risks and
explained that fundamentals were in place for a vigorous output response if a stronger-thanexpected external demand impulse materialized.
11.
The authorities argued that the current account surplus since the early 2000s is mainly
the lagged result of structural changes in the 1990s. In the OeNB’s view, the Austrian external
position benefited in particular from a gradual rise in trade and FDI with CESEE, with rising exports
and lagged profits from FDI being the main drivers.

this would also delay the recovery of
real estate and credit markets there,
leading to higher NPLs and lower
profitability for Austrian banks.

Growth in Austria would be reduced

This might lead to higher NPLs and
lower profitability for Austrian bank
subsidiaries in these countries.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The discussions focused on enhancing financial stability, more effective intervened bank
restructuring, and prospects for public debt reduction, as well as a post-election agenda
for more efficient public spending and stronger work incentives in particular for lowskilled workers and women.

A. Financial Stability
Background
12.
The three largest Austria-based banks have improved their capitalization, and funding
and liquidity conditions are comfortable. The banks reported Core Tier 1 ratios above 10 percent
at end-2012, slightly below international peers (Figure 5) but improved relative to end-2011,
reflecting a combination of earnings retention and reductions in risk-weighted assets. For two of the
banks, these ratios include hybrid (participation) capital, most of it provided by the government
during the crisis, which is being phased out under Basel III. At the same time, internal capital
generation has been reduced by the still sizable NPL provisioning needs and falling net interest
margins, while equity valuations are low even in comparison with other European banks.
Nonetheless, one large bank has issued new equity and repaid all participation capital in
August 2013. On the funding and liquidity side, conditions have improved markedly since last year.
Deposits have been growing in Austria and in CESEE, and banks have largely repaid LTROs and are
able to tap markets for term funding at favorable rates.
13.
Adverse spillovers from Austria to CESEE through deleveraging have been contained
thus far. Austrian banks continue to regard CESEE as a core market and key source of future
profitability, despite rising NPLs in some countries and higher capital requirements at the group

level and locally in recent years. For the banking system as a whole, CESEE exposure has grown by
3.5 percent over 2008–12, though recently there has been a reallocation across markets, with
reductions in Ukraine, Hungary, and Romania and increases in Czech Republic, Poland, Turkey, and
Croatia. In general, cross-border lending and parent funding of subsidiaries have declined, and
subsidiaries have become more reliant on local funding, reflecting a move away from foreign
currency lending, guidance by Austrian supervisors, and strong growth in local deposits.4
14.
A group of medium-sized banks has been fully or partly nationalized and is under
restructuring. At end-2012, these banks represented about 8 percent of the banking sector and
28 percent of GDP. These banks had refocused their business models away from their traditional
core (and low-profitability) domestic activities, including through a number of ill-advised
acquisitions, expansion into CESEE, and exposure to euro area periphery sovereigns (Box 1).
Box 1. Austria’s Mid-Sized Intervened Banks
Hypo Alpe Adria (HAA) was initially a regional mortgage bank based in the state of Carinthia. It
aggressively expanded into SEE in the first half of the last decade, equipped with a state guarantee. After
years of weak performance, HAA received its first government support in 2008 and was nationalized in 2009,
with assets of EUR 41.1 billion. Total assets at end-2012 were EUR 33.8 billion (some 3 percent of total
banking sector assets or 11 percent of GDP), of which about one third had been placed in an internal winddown portfolio, and about another third were in the SEE subsidiary network to be re-privatized. Some of the
banks in this network have a sizable presence in the local market (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia, Croatia).
Kommunalkredit (“new”) had a balance sheet size of EUR 15.9 billion at end-2012. It is the “good
bank” part of Kommunalkredit (“old”) —a bank nationalized in 2008, after deviating from its low-profitability
core business of public investment financing by taking on considerable bond and CDS exposure (primarily to
the euro area periphery). Efforts to re-privatize this bank failed, and as of May this year, the bank does not
engage in any new banking business activity. Assets of the “good bank” are mainly loans, of which nearly
70 percent were advanced in Austria, mainly to municipalities.
KA Finanz is the “bad bank” part of Kommunalkredit (“old”) and it operates in a wind down mode,
while still holding a banking license. At end-2012, assets on its balance sheet amounted to
EUR 10.9 billion, while its off-balance sheet exposure was EUR 6.2 billion. While assets on balance sheet are
mainly comprised of sovereign bonds, the off-balance sheet assets are CDS positions.
Austrian Volksbanken AG is the apex institution of one of Austria’s cooperative banking groups. Over
the two last decades, it had embarked on an ill-fated acquisition and expansion strategy, including into
CESEE. After a first public capital injection of EUR 1 billion in 2009, it had to be (partly) nationalized in 2012.
The EC has approved a restructuring plan that envisages a reduction of the bank’s balance sheet to a size
commensurate with its core function as apex institution—from currently EUR 27.7 billion (end-2012) to some
EUR 19 billion by 2017.

of the sustainability of the business models of large internationally active Austrian banks.

15.
Negative feedback loops between the sovereign and the banking sector remain a risk,
with potential adverse spillovers to CESEE. The Austrian banking sector is large (with assets of
over 3½ times GDP) and internationally exposed (with exposure to CESEE and CIS countries at
105 percent of GDP). At the height of the last financial crisis, the government provided capital and
funding guarantees to the banking sector, and sovereign spreads became elevated for a short
period of time as fears about CESEE exposures mounted. On the banks’ side, while banks’ holding of
sovereign debt is limited, funding conditions for the larger banks benefit from market perceptions
that the fiscally sound sovereign will step in, as reflected in the considerable support credit rating
uplift. If sovereign creditworthiness was called into question, the resulting worsened bank funding
conditions might cause negative spillovers to CESEE through reduced supply of credit by Austrian
banks in the region.
Policy issues
16.
Large, internationally active banks should continue to strengthen their capital
position. With market expectations of capital levels well ahead of current regulatory minimum
requirements, still volatile global financial markets, and uncertainty about asset quality in CESEE,
focus on strengthening capital buffers should continue, as emphasized by the FSAP. Against this
background, supervisors should continue to monitor the size and quality of capital buffers at large
banks closely, and stand ready to take action if needed (e.g. by restricting dividend payouts),
including with a view to the forthcoming balance sheet assessment exercise in the context of the
transition to the new single supervisory mechanism in the euro area.
17.
Faster medium-sized bank restructuring will assist in containing final fiscal cost.
Restructuring strategies should focus on minimizing the ultimate fiscal cost regardless of any shortterm effects on fiscal headline figures. While the downsizing of Austrian Volksbanken AG (OeVAG)
appears on track and the approach to operate Kommunalkredit in a “no-new-business” mode until
assets run off seems workable, the strategy to sell off the SEE operations of nationalized bank Hypo
Alpe Adria (HAA) as a going-concern to private investors en bloc has not succeeded so far. To speed
up disposal, a further bad asset carve-out is necessary. The carved-out assets, together with HAA’s
already existing internal wind-down portfolio, should be transferred to a defeasance structure
without banking license and disposed of within a clearly limited timeframe. In addition, a rapid sale
of remaining viable units individually or even in parts should follow to limit further asset
deterioration.5 An asset quality review conducted by external experts may facilitate this process. As
the bank is restructured, efforts should be made to minimize adverse spillovers to HAA’s SEE
markets and the broader CESEE region. In a similar vein, it would be useful to withdraw the banking
license from “bad bank” KA Finanz to prevent asset disposal from being held back by lack of loss-

The authorities might also consider further “market tests” to determine the interest of potential buyers for the
viable entities before carrying out the restructuring.

10

absorbing capital. The restructuring of intervened banks should be used as an opportunity to reduce
capacity and improve cost efficiency in the Austrian market.6
18.
Stronger financial oversight to promote better risk management and governance
practices in the small and medium-sized bank segment would help prevent a recurrence of
past problems. According to the FSAP, the Financial Market Authority (FMA) and Austrian National
Bank (OeNB) collaborate effectively in performing banking supervision, including on a cross-border
basis. Nonetheless, they could usefully step up the use of supervisory tools and powers for
corrective action and the promotion of stronger risk management and governance standards,
especially among small and medium-sized banks.
19.
As recommended by the FSAP, early intervention and resolution powers and the
deposit insurance system should be bolstered to reduce the likelihood of future government
bailouts. A recent amendment to the Banking Act covers early intervention, but falls short of FSAP
recommendations in some areas, while no initiative is in the works for resolution yet.7 In addition,
given the significant size of Austrian banks’ cross border operations, it would be important to better
define cross-border resolution arrangements with host country supervisors, for instance by
expanding cross-border stability groups. As to deposit insurance, among the reasons why the
authorities supported some banks in recent years might have been concerns about depositor panic
and possible domino effects from the activation of sectoral deposit guarantees. To reduce the need
for future bailouts, allow for different modes of bank resolution, and ensure rapid payouts, the FSAP
recommends the unification of the five existing private deposit insurance schemes to a publiclyadministered pre-funded scheme.
20.
Future crisis management would benefit from the creation of a bank resolution fund.
Such a fund, which would be used to facilitate resolution rather than finance bailouts, could be
financed through the existing financial stability tax currently levied on banks and could be rapidly
deployed to support bank intervention in a crisis situation. Austrian banks are broadly supportive of
the financial stability tax being allocated to a resolution fund rather than to the general budget. The
existing tax, which yields about 0.2 percent of GDP per year, could, in 3-4 years time, grow large
enough to provide temporary capital support to a large institution in case of difficulties.
Authorities’ view
21.
The authorities highlighted progress in a number of areas aimed at enhancing
financial stability. They welcomed the FSAP’s findings about the resilience of the overall banking
system to various solvency shocks, while emphasizing the need for some individual banks to
6

Consultation.

The areas are: specific triggers for intervention, broader powers to appoint a special administrator, replace
management, and impose restriction on dividends; issuance of convertible bonds or unsecured long-term debt that
can be bailed-in, and ring-fencing of subsidiaries or related entities.

continue strengthening capital buffers. They also noted that policy measures taken to reduce CESEErelated spillovers, including encouragement of greater reliance of Austrian banks’ subsidiaries on
local funding, have helped reduce systemic vulnerability, and have not resulted in large-scale
deleveraging in the CESEE region. They indicated that developments with regards to bank resolution
frameworks and deposit guarantee schemes would have to wait until decisions are finalized at the
EU level, while at the national level, discussion of early intervention triggers on capital and liquidity
has been initiated. On intervened bank restructuring, the authorities emphasized concerns about the
immediate debt implications of creating defeasance structures located within general government,
and informed that external consultants had been hired to explore alternative design options.

B. Balance Sheets and Housing Market Developments
Background
22.
Households have relatively low debt, but carry a sizable share of Swiss franc
denominated debt and are exposed to a rising interest rate environment. Households have
assets of nearly 3 times net disposable income while gross liabilities are less than one-third of
assets. Only about 36 percent of households have any debt, more than half of it mortgage credit
mainly at variable interest rate. While total mortgage indebtedness is low, the high share of Swissfranc denominated debt (23 percent of the total)—much of it mortgages with bullet maturity and
tied to an investment vehicle—presents some risk. The overall funding gap of repayment vehicle
loans, the difference between the loan principal and the amount accumulated in an investment
vehicle, was assessed by the FSAP at EUR 5.5 billion, 18 percent of loan principal, in September 2012.
23.
The housing market has experienced strong price growth but from low levels. In
nominal terms at end-2012, house prices rose 14.9 percent y-o-y in Vienna compared with
11.5 percent y-o-y for Austria overall. In real terms and from a medium-term perspective, the price
increase appears more modest: a cumulative 40 percent over 10 years in Vienna and about
5 percent in the rest of Austria. Housing market activity seems to be driven largely by non-resident
buyers and domestic investors seeking an alternative to low fixed-income returns, though continued
immigration also likely supported demand for housing in urban areas. Mortgage credit has exhibited
slow growth, suggesting the prevalence of equity buyers.
24.
Aggregate corporate debt is around the euro area median. Over the past two decades,
corporates have increasingly substituted bank loans with debt issued in the markets, which has risen
to 19 percent of total corporate debt at Q2 2012 compared with just 7 percent in 1995. This longterm trend accelerated in recent months reflecting rising risk appetite among global investors and
falling yields. Only 8 percent of corporate debt is in foreign currency, ¾ of which in Swiss francs.
Thus, vulnerability to adverse exchange rate movements appears limited in the aggregate. After
falling for two years, bankruptcies in the corporate sector picked up in 2012 as macro-economic
conditions slowed. The recent high profile failure of one large construction company has raised
some concerns about the operating environment for the construction sector.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

AUSTRIA

Policy issues
25.
Risks from Swiss franc-denominated mortgages are manageable. The FSAP stress test
suggests that the funding gap would increase substantially in the face of a 200 bp interest rate
shock and 5 percent Swiss franc appreciation shock at maturity. However, given the long residual
maturity of these loans, the impact of such a shock could be absorbed with a relatively modest
increase in provisioning. Furthermore, banks no longer offer foreign-currency loans domestically
(with very limited exceptions).
26.
While there are no major immediate domestic imbalances, the work to put in place a
full-fledged macroprudential policy framework should start now. As recommended by the
FSAP, the authorities should consider strengthening the macroprudential framework with the OeNB
in a leading role in the envisaged committee. This would ensure that decisions are based primarily
on its economic and risk expertise, as recommended by the European Systemic Risk Board. Going
forward the committee should consider a broad set of macroprudential tools, including for instance
maximum loan-to-value and debt-service-to-income ratios, and should promote the construction of
the statistical database needed to use these tools.8
Authorities’ view
27.
The authorities agree with the need to strengthen the macroprudential framework and
have already taken steps in this direction. A Financial Market Stability Committee will be
instituted at the beginning of 2014. It would be comprised of senior officials from the MoF, the
Fiscal Council, the FMA and the OeNB and chaired by a MoF representative, and it would be tasked
with making recommendations to the FMA on the activation of macroprudential policies. At present,
it would have the ability to implement changes in the macroprudential tools proposed under CRD /
CRR IV, namely the countercyclical buffer and the systemic risk surcharge, but other tools could be
considered at a later date.

C. Reducing Public Debt While Absorbing Further Bank Restructuring
Costs
Background
28.
The authorities’ consolidation plans remain largely unchanged. On the back of broadbased underspending (including on interest cost) and overperforming labor taxes, the headline and
structural deficit in 2012 amounted to respectively 2.5 and 1.3 percent of GDP, about ½ percentage
point better than targeted a year ago (Figure 5). The 2014–17 update of the authorities’ budgetary
framework broadly confirms earlier deficit targets. Given last year’s favorable outcome, the 2013

budget now implies a structural expansion, notched up by a recently-approved stimulus package
with minor deficit effects in 2013 and 2014.9 10 Gradual adjustment is resumed in 2014, and a
structural deficit of 0.45 percent is targeted by 2016, in compliance with Austria’s new fiscal rule
framework.
29.

However, implementation gaps and uncertainties remain. As regards health care expenditure,

although stakeholders have agreed to reduce its growth rate from 4.3 percent in 2013 to the projected
medium-term nominal GDP rate of 3.6 percent by 2016, the underlying measures still need to be further

specified, and the new decision-making framework created for this purpose is complex. In a similar
vein, the planned savings volume on subsidies has not yet been underpinned by specific cuts.
Furthermore, there are uncertainties on the revenue side, mainly from the envisaged EU financial
transaction tax (FTT, budgeted as of 2014), and proceeds from the treaties with Switzerland and
Liechtenstein on the taxation of interest earned by Austrian residents on assets held in the two countries

The authorities’ and staff’s structural balance calculations exclude revenue from a tax treaty with Switzerland
(estimated at 0.3 percent of GDP in 2013) and the following capital transfers to restructuring banks (in percent of
GDP): 0.6 in 2010; 0.2 in 2011; 0.9 in 2012; and an already budgeted 0.4 in 2013.
10

The announced size of the package is EUR 1.6 billion (0.5 percent of GDP), with the main spending occurring in
2014. Over ¼ of it consists of loans and loan guarantees for enterprises hit by the recent floods, while the remaining
measures focus on residential and non-residential construction and provision of child and elderly care facilities. To a
large extent, spending is advanced from later years and/or by public enterprises outside general government.

In addition, further costs from the restructuring of nationalized mid-sized banks are
imminent. Until 2012, these banks have received about 1.7 percent of GDP in capital transfers, in
addition to government guarantees. An additional capital transfer of 0.4 percent of GDP is already
budgeted for 2013. However, further significant bank restructuring costs will emerge as these banks
are downsized more decisively than in the past and medium-term fiscal planning does not yet cater
for these costs.

Policy issues
32.
The authorities’ adjustment plans already accommodate currently weak economic
conditions. In particular, the structural expansion implied by the 2013 budget is appropriate, given
currently sub-par growth.13 On the other hand, additional discretionary fiscal stimulus would not
seem to be warranted under current growth projections, given the moderate output gap and low
unemployment and medium-term consolidation needs. From this perspective, the recently passed
stimulus package or other new spending initiatives should be financed within the existing budgetary

If the authorities’ plans are fully implemented, their fiscal deficit targets would be achieved under staff’s baseline
macroeconomic scenario.

and subsidies should gain center stage.

moderate temporary overperformance on
Austria’s fiscal rule in the outer years. Bringing debt back to pre-crisis levels around the end of the
decade is advisable in light of contingent and implicit public liabilities, including from population
aging, and tail risks from the continued foreign activities of large banks.
Authorities’ view
34.
The authorities stressed that planned consolidation measures are on track. Newly
created coordination bodies had been tasked to map health care expenditure ceilings into multiannual agreements among stakeholders, first at the federal level and then in each individual state.
Subsequently, these agreements were to be further broken down into annual implementation plans.
Similarly, although specific measures to save on subsidies had not been decided yet, efforts to
create a subsidy “transparency database” as decision-making tool were progressing as planned. The
authorities were confident in their revenue estimates, and informed that the recent “stimulus
package” would only have marginal effects on the deficit, which could indeed potentially be
compensated within the existing budgetary envelope. The authorities acknowledged that significant
further costs from bank restructuring were to be expected and were open to the idea of building
buffers for bank restructuring costs into the next vintage of their medium-term fiscal framework.

income tax rates range from 36.5 to 50 percent.19 Negative work incentives from such high labor
taxes in Austria seem to be particularly sharp for low-skilled workers and secondary earners, as
evidenced by a relatively low employment rate in the former case and the high share of part-time
work among women in the latter. Negative incentive effects may be aggravated by interactions with
the benefit system, i.e. too rapid social benefit withdrawals as work income increases, and the
additional childcare cost incurred by mothers working full-time.
Policy issues
37.
A bolder approach to expenditure and fiscal federalism reform should be a priority.
Specific decisions on further expenditure reforms should be embedded into the next medium-term
fiscal framework for 2015–18. In the context of the renewal of the financial equalization law expiring
at end-2014, this should be combined with a reform of inter-governmental fiscal relations to
streamline and connect more closely spending powers and financing responsibilities across
government levels. Furthermore, efforts to strengthen the fiscal governance toolkit of states in areas
such as budgeting, medium-term fiscal planning, accounting and financial management should
continue. At the federal level, the full independence of the fiscal council, which is being created in
the context of the fiscal governance reforms in the euro area, should be ensured to maximize its
effectiveness.
38.
Expenditure savings could assist in financing a comprehensive reform of the taxbenefit-system, including family benefits, in a

redesign of the complex and relatively costly family
benefit system to strengthen work incentives for women (text chart). The current system is tilted
heavily toward monetary transfers that are neither conditional on the working status of the parents
nor means-tested. A reallocation of funds from monetary transfers to the provision of high-quality
and affordable childcare facilities and after-school programs would offer more women the choice to
work longer hours. Monetary transfers could also be subjected to some means-testing to save
budgetary resources or to in-work conditionality for both parents to further leverage work
incentives.
19

The effective rates are somewhat lower due to standard tax relief, in particular a lower taxation of leave and
Christmas bonuses customary in Austria.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

AUSTRIA

Authorities’ view
39.
There are currently no agreed plans for additional expenditure reforms or a
reconfiguration of the tax-benefit system. As regards expenditures, the current focus is on the
implementation of the already agreed reforms also after the elections. In the pension area, efforts
are concentrated on aligning actual and statutory retirement ages, while changes in statutory
parameters are not under consideration. While there was general agreement that a reduction of the
high tax burden on labor would be desirable, views among the two coalition partners differed on the
specific parameters to be changed, and there had still not been any consensus on how to finance
such changes.
40.
The authorities were also not prepared for a more fundamental redesign of family
benefits. The authorities generally agreed that Austria’s family benefit system was too complex as
regards the number and features of programs and would benefit from simplification. They had taken
small steps to simplify child allowances, but there were no plans at the moment for a more
comprehensive reallocation and reform of monetary benefits. In contrast, the authorities favored
very much the provision of additional childcare facilities and had just agreed on more federal
transfers to states for this purpose.

STAFF APPRAISAL
41.
While Austria’s macroeconomic fundamentals are relatively healthy, growth has
stalled and the forecast is for a slow recovery. After a swift post-crisis rebound, real GDP has
been flat since early 2012 with weakness in both domestic and foreign demand. Economic activity
should start to recover in the second part of this year, mainly driven by an expected gradual
strengthening in the international environment. Risks from the still difficult situation in the euro
area, an emerging market slowdown, and volatile global financial markets could delay the recovery.
42.
The medium-term fiscal plan’s accommodation of currently weak economic conditions
is welcome. The 2013 budget envisages a structural expansion, which is appropriate given the
current sub-par growth performance. Going forward, it will be essential to focus on the further
specification of measures necessary to implement the already envisaged fiscal adjustment,
particularly related to health care and subsidies. Efforts should be made to finance the recentlyannounced new stimulus measures within the existing budgetary envelope.
43.
Further significant but manageable fiscal costs from medium-sized banks under
restructuring should be compensated with additional gradual fiscal adjustment. To contain
these costs, faster disposal of troubled assets and downsizing of non-viable entities than in the past
is necessary, and the authorities are moving in this direction. Correspondingly, structural fiscal
adjustment should be strengthened gradually in the fiscal planning for 2014–18 to absorb bank
restructuring costs in the medium term, with a view to bringing public debt down to its pre-crisis
level in the first years of the next decade.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

AUSTRIA

44.
While measures are being implemented to rein in early retirement, further reforms to
make public spending more efficient would be desirable. As noted in earlier consultations, there
is considerable scope for reducing spending in pensions, health care, and subsidies. An earlier
equalization of male and female statutory retirement ages and automatic longevity adjustors would
be welcome. A better targeting of subsidies towards more clearly defined long-term objectives is
desirable. Further efficiency improvements in the health care area should be encouraged, even if the
currently envisaged expenditure containment path is fully implemented. As pointed out in previous
IMF staff reports, better aligning spending powers and financing responsibilities in the federal
system, and strengthening the latter by introducing meaningful tax autonomy for states, would
facilitate expenditure rationalization.
45.
Expenditure savings could be used to finance a comprehensive reform of labor
taxation and social and family benefits to foster labor supply and potential growth. Austria has
a relatively high tax burden on labor which hampers work incentives in particular for the low-skilled
and women. As pointed out in previous IMF staff reports, an income tax reform and the selective
lowering of social security contributions, taking interactions with social benefits into account, could
help to remedy the situation. In addition, a simplification and redesign of the complex and costly
family benefit system could strengthen work incentives for women. In particular, a reallocation of
funds from unconditional monetary transfers to the provision of high-quality and affordable
childcare facilities would offer more women the choice to work longer hours.
46.
A comprehensive framework for bank resolution would help reduce the need for state
intervention in the future. While a common EU framework is the ultimate goal, in the interim the
Austrian authorities should put in place a bank resolution regime consistent with international best
practices and already-agreed elements of the forthcoming EU directive. This would complement the
current legislative package, which covers early intervention tools and the preparation of recovery
and resolution plans by banks.
47.
As part of this new framework, the deposit insurance system should be unified and a
bank resolution fund created. A unified and privately pre-funded scheme administered by the
government would make it easier to close down failing banks without incurring excessive public
liabilities. The forthcoming EU DGS Directive is an opportunity to move along this path. Future crisis
management would also benefit from the creation of a bank resolution fund, which could eventually
be integrated into a newly-created EU resolution fund. Proceeds from the existing bank financial
stability contributions could be used for this fund.
48.
Recent progress in strengthening the macroprudential framework is welcome and the
OeNB should be given a leading role. The OeNB should be given a decisive role in the new
macroprudential committee, in line with recommendations by the European Systemic Risk Board.
Going forward the committee should consider a broad set of macroprudential tools, including for
instance maximum loan-to-value and debt-service-to-income ratios, and the availability of related
statistical information to diagnose emerging imbalances should be improved.

Table 7. Austria: Authorities’ Response to Past IMF Policy Recommendations
(Scale―fully consistent, broadly consistent, or marginally consistent)
IMF 2012 Article IV Recommendations
Fiscal policy I
Strictly implement fiscal consolidation plan in
structural terms by further specifying measures for
savings in health care and subsidies; and develop
contingency plans for revenue risks and potential
new outlays, in particular from bank restructuring.
Fiscal policy II
Decide on further expenditure reforms to anchor
sustainability in the medium and long run.
Fiscal policy III
Streamline intergovernmental fiscal relations and
create stronger nexus between spending and
financing responsibilities at the subnational level.
Financial sector policy I
Dispose more efficiently of legacy assets in
restructuring banks to minimize final fiscal cost.

Financial sector policy II
Implement macroprudential measures to address
risks posed by systemically important banks.
Financial sector policy III
Put a new early intervention and bank resolution
framework in place.

Structural reforms I
Increase the employment of older worker through
robust implementation of already decided reforms
and further reform steps.
Structural reforms II
Reduce tax burden on labor in a budget-neutral way.

Authorities’ Response
Broadly consistent
Favorable budgetary outcome in 2012, but
specification of some medium-term savings still
work in progress. Expected further bank
restructuring cost not yet taken into account in
medium-term budgetary planning.
Marginally consistent
No further reform plans at the moment.
Marginally consistent
No substantial progress.

Marginally consistent
Pertinent strategy still outstanding for main problem
bank; one bad bank still has banking license; some
progress in the troubled apex institution of one
banking group.
Fully consistent
New macroprudential guidelines for internationally
active banks are being implemented, and capital
strengthening is actively encouraged.
Broadly consistent
Recent legislation covers early intervention, but falls
short of FSAP recommendations in a number of
areas, while no initiative is in the works for resolution
yet.
Broadly consistent
Already decided reforms are gradually being
implemented but there are no new reform plans,
such as for an advanced increase of the female
retirement age.
Marginally consistent
Tax and social security contribution wedges still to
be addressed.

Annex I. Austria and Germany: Have the Linkages
Weakened?1
The Austrian economy has traditionally had close ties with Germany, fostered by geographical
proximity and a common language. After the fall of the Berlin wall both countries have increasingly
looked east for economic growth opportunities through trade and foreign investment. Austria, in
particular, was especially well positioned to take advantage of these new opportunities because of
its location at the center of Europe, its historic connections to Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), and
its commercial ties with neighboring Eastern countries during the Cold War.
In this paper, we examine whether closer integration with CEE has weakened the connection
between the Austrian and German economies as measured by business cycle co-movement.2 This
may not necessarily be the case, as the growth of the CEE as a trading partner may have occurred at
the expense of trading partners other than Germany, CEE countries themselves may have become
more integrated with Germany, or global shocks may have become more dominant and thus
economies have become more synchronized in general.
Germany is by far Austria’s largest trading
partner, accounting for more than 30 percent
of Austria’s exports and over 40 percent of
Austria’s imports. To better gauge how
Germany-specific shocks may affect Austrian
GDP it is preferable to consider exports by
final consumption rather than total exports.
This measures the share of Austrian exports
that go to satisfy German demand rather than
demand in third countries through further
processing and re-export. This share has
actually decreased somewhat over time, and
stood below 20 percent in 2009. On the other
hand, the share of exports by final
consumption to CEE countries has increased
over time, reaching around 10 percent in 2009.

Countries included in the CEE sample in the Annex are the following: Bulgaria, Czech Repoblic, Estonia, Hungary,
Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia. Lack of quarterly GDP data precludes the inclusion of
additional Southeastern European countries.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Turning to business cycle synchronization, the
degree of co-movement between Austria and
Germany is high and has increased
significantly over time, from 60 percent in
the 1990s to 80 percent in the following
decade.3 Therefore, even though exports by
final demand to Germany have become
somewhat less important, business cycle
synchronization has increased substantially.
Several explanations may be considered to
reconcile the two seemingly contradictory
facts above. One possibility is that higher
synchronization was the result of the introduction of the euro in 1999. However, the Austrian
currency was pegged to the German one for many years before the euro was introduced, so this
explanation is not convincing. Another possibility is the increased importance of regional or global
shocks in driving the Austrian business cycle. If this is the case, then we would expect to see a similar
increase in correlation between Austria’s GDP and that of other large advanced European countries,
which are also presumably affected by regional or global shocks. However, this is not evident from
the data.

Another possibility is that the change reflects a German idiosyncratic element, for instance the
economic effects of German reunification in the early 1990s, which might have temporarily moved
Germany “off cycle” in the 1990s. If this was the case, then we would expect to see an increase in
business cycle synchronization between Germany and other advanced European countries, not just
between Germany and Austria. Again, this is not evident from the data.

3

The correlation is measured using HP-filtered quarterly GDP data. Results are the same if we extend the period to
include the crisis years of 2008-2013. In fact the correlations appear stronger in the crisis time due to strong global
shocks.

Yet another possibility is that German cyclical movements are transmitted to Austria through third
countries such as the CEE. In fact, the business
cycle correlation of Germany and CEE countries
has increased significantly after 2000, though it
remains much lower than with Austria.
More generally, it may also be that being part
of the same supply chain results in higher
business cycle synchronization between the two
countries, despite the falling share of exports by
final consumption. In fact, the recent IMF study
of the German supply chain finds that business
cycle synchronization with Germany is an
increasing function of the share of German
value added in total exports, a measure of
supply chain integration.4 This share for Austria was 8.6 percent in 2009, the second highest after the
Czech Republic.
In conclusion, the evidence suggests that Austria’s ties with Germany have strengthened over time.
This has happened despite the growing linkages between Austria and CEE countries. As the German
economy has been relatively stable during the recent crisis years, this close connection has likely
been a stabilizing factor for Austria.

accordance with decision No.144-(52/51) resulting from UN Security Council Resolutions and EU
Council Regulations.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Macroeconomic statistics are adequate for surveillance. Austria subscribed to the Fund’s
Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) in 1996, and its metadata are available on the Fund’s
electronic Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. Austria is availing itself of the SDDS flexibility
option on the timeliness of the industrial production index and the merchandise trade data.
2.
The ECB reporting framework is used for monetary statistics and data are reported to
the IMF through a “gateway” arrangement with the ECB. The arrangement provides an efficient
transmission of monetary statistics to the IMF and for publication in the IFS and IFS Supplement.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Austria
On September 4, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Austria.1
Austria remains an area of relative strength in the European landscape, but the economy is
being affected by the regional slowdown, with growth in 2012 falling to 0.9 percent, from
2.8 percent in 2011. Both external and domestic demand components have been weak,
reflecting developments in main trading partners, investment uncertainty, an unwillingness of
households to further reduce their savings rate, and fiscal consolidation. While employment
growth remained relatively strong in 2012, labor market conditions are now weakening. As a
consequence, unemployment has gradually increased, but remains low. Inflation fell from
its 2011 peak of 3.6 percent to 2.6 percent in 2012 and stood at 2.2 percent in June 2013,
with comparatively high price growth in the services sector. Wage increases in 2012
exceeded inflation only slightly, leading to modest real wage growth.
The current account is showing a modest surplus, which has fallen considerably from its precrisis level of almost 5 percent of GDP in 2008 and amounted to 1.8 percent of GDP in 2012,
with a deficit in goods more than offset by a surplus in services. The real effective exchange
rate has appreciated somewhat in 2012, reflecting the positive inflation differential with
major trading partners.
Prospects are for a gradual recovery for the remainder of 2013 and 2014, consistent with the
modest pick-up in external demand suggested by some high frequency indicators, a
subsequent recovery in investment activity, some catching-up of private consumption on the
back of modest growth in real wages and disposable income, and fiscal expansion in 2013.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

On the back of broad-based underspending (including on interest cost) and overperforming
labor taxes, the headline and structural deficit amounted to respectively 2.5 and 1.3 percent
of GDP in 2012. Given last year’s favorable outcome, the 2013 budget now implies a
structural expansion. Gradual adjustment is planned to resume in 2014, and a structural
deficit of 0.45 percent is targeted for 2016, in compliance with Austria’s new fiscal rule
framework. Gaps in expenditure efficiency remain considerable, and the fiscal burden on
labor is heavy.
Financial stability and related policies were recently evaluated under the IMF’s Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP). The FSAP noted that Austria’s large banking system,
which plays a dominant role in Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe (CESEE), appears
resilient to adverse scenarios on the whole. Aggregate bank capitalization, funding and
liquidity conditions have improved, and Austrian banks’ foreign subsidiaries have reduced
their reliance on parent bank funding. Nevertheless, bank asset quality is still deteriorating in
several CESEE countries, while depressed credit demand is hurting profitability. Adverse
spillovers from Austria to the CESEE through deleveraging have been contained thus far. A
group of intervened medium-sized banks face uncertain prospects and pose significant but
manageable fiscal risks.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their prudent macroeconomic
management, which has helped maintain healthy macroeconomic fundamentals in a
challenging global environment, and welcomed prospects of a gradual economic recovery.
Directors noted the risks arising from volatile global financial markets, lingering
uncertainties in the euro area, and vulnerabilities in CESEE countries where Austrian banks
have large exposures. Against this background, Directors concurred that the post-election
agenda should focus on further enhancing financial sector resilience, strengthening public
finances, and boosting potential growth.
Directors welcomed the strong fiscal performance in 2012 and considered the mildly
expansionary stance envisaged in the 2013 budget as appropriate. They stressed, however,
that the recently-announced stimulus package should be financed within the existing
envelope and encouraged the authorities to identify specific measures needed to achieve the
consolidation planned for the medium term.
Directors noted that bank restructuring will have further significant, though manageable,
fiscal costs. They recommended compensating for these costs by gradually strengthening

medium-term fiscal adjustment. Directors agreed that a faster downsizing of non-viable
entities and disposal of troubled assets would help contain bank restructuring costs.
Directors underscored that further reforms remain necessary to make public spending more
efficient, especially in the areas of pensions, health care, and subsidies. In addition, they
emphasized that better aligned spending powers and financing responsibilities in the federal
system would facilitate expenditure rationalization. Directors noted that expenditure savings
could be used to address low work incentives, particularly for women and low-skilled
workers, which are hampered by high labor taxes and social security contributions as well as
a complex and costly family benefit system. Some Directors stressed the need for a
comprehensive approach to this issue.
Directors welcomed the overall results of the FSAP. Notwithstanding the overall system
resilience to shocks, they recommended that large internationally active banks be encouraged
to strengthen their capital buffers. Directors stressed the need to reinforce financial oversight
and promote better risk management and governance practices, especially in the small- and
medium-sized bank segment, to prevent a recurrence of past problems.
To further reduce the potential for adverse feedbacks between bank and sovereign risk and
possible associated spillovers, Directors advised comprehensive reforms, including a
strengthened framework for early intervention and resolution, a bank resolution fund, and a
unified, publicly administered, and pre-funded deposit insurance scheme. While many
Directors underscored the urgency of new legislation on these topics, a number drew
attention to the need for consistency with the forthcoming EU directives. Directors welcomed
recent progress in strengthening the macroprudential framework.

Statement by Johann Prader, Executive Director for Austria and
Christian Just, Advisor to the Executive Director
September 4, 2013

The Austrian authorities welcome the consultations with the Fund and thank staff for the highquality report. They broadly agree with the assessment of Austria's economic and financial situation
and the recommendations on economic and financial policies. As this consultation took place before
the upcoming general elections (end of September), it provides timely input for the next legislative
term.
The staff report gives credit to the relative strength of the Austrian economy in Europe. Most recent
indicators seem to confirm that the phase of modest growth since mid-2012 might soon come to an
end. Austria now ranks second in terms of GDP per capita in the EU. At 4.6 percent in June 2013,
Austria’s unemployment rate is the lowest in the EU. But keeping Austria among the best
performers in the EU will require additional efforts. Austria’s fiscal position so far has been rather
good. This will allow Austria to cope with potential costs of the financial sector. The Austrian
authorities broadly agree with the challenges ahead as regards strengthening the long-term growth
potential and improving the resilience of the financial sector.
Macroeconomic outlook
We concur with staff’s forecast of a moderate upswing in the coming months. Exports and
investment of enterprises will be driven by external demand, while domestic demand shows little
room for a strengthening and the housing cycle is coming to an end. The recent stimulus package
will show its effect later next year. Employment growth will continue to be driven by the increase in
labor supply due to the opening of the labor market to new EU member states. Supply pressures
also explain why the unemployment rate will remain relatively high by Austrian standards.
The authorities concur with staff that the main risks to the outlook are external and are related to a
further intensification of the debt crisis in the euro area and possible spillovers to important trade
and financial partners in CESEE. They see, however, no risk that a period of slow growth would
delay or reduce the planned fiscal consolidation. Actually, past experience shows that fiscal
consolidation in Austria weakens in upswings, rather than in downswings. They also point to the
new EU fiscal framework, which should anchor expectations and ensure effective action.
The staff report points to the need to strengthen work incentives, especially for women. Indeed, this
has been one of the political priorities in the last decade and the female employment rate at 70.3
percent in 2012 is 8 percentage points higher than the EU average and has risen 6.9 percentage
points since 2001. As the report rightly points out, there are many factors driving the female
participation rate. Thus, a comprehensive approach is needed. As the concept of marginal tax wedge
does not include benefits in kind (such as available or free kindergartens), it might not be the
appropriate comprehensive indicator to track work incentives. The authorities continue to monitor
developments very closely and will continue to give priority to the issue in the formulation of
medium-term economic and fiscal policies.

2

Fiscal policy
The government has put in place a “debt brake” similar to the German model, restricting the general
government structural deficit to 0.45 percent of GDP from 2017. Its implementation was
accompanied by a comprehensive consolidation package, aimed at reducing the structural deficit to
0.4 percent of GDP by 2016 and putting the debt ratio on a strictly downward path from 2013
onwards. The package was implemented on top of the measures already implemented in early 2011.
Traditionally, Austrian budgeting is based on conservative and reliable revenue estimates and the
execution of the budget is strict. Still, budget execution in 2012 surprised positively, with the
general government deficit at 2.5 percent of GDP being 0.5 percentage point lower than targeted. As
regards public expenditure savings from 2014, the authorities remain fully committed to implement
the necessary reforms in the areas of health care and subsidies, as planned in cooperation with subnational governments.
While the cost of restructuring of nationalised banks has offset part of the fiscal consolidation
efforts, it should also be pointed out that the recent repayment of state aid by one of the three major
banks reduces the debt ratio by about 0.4 percent of GDP.
Recently, parliament adopted a law on the establishment of an independent fiscal council. It will
start its operation in November this year. Its members are fully independent with terms beyond the
legislative period. The council has a broad mandate, including monitoring budget compliance with
EU fiscal rules. This should contribute to a further strengthening of fiscal discipline in Austria.
FSAP
The FSSA provides a balanced view of the state of the Austrian financial system. It rightly points at
some key challenges and risk factors such as the restructuring of problem banks, foreign currency
loans, and asset quality in the CESEE region, but also highlights the strengths of Austrian banks
such as the stable macroeconomic environment in Austria or the strong local funding base.
Even though the Austrian financial system has weathered the European crisis relatively well thus
far, there is no room for complacency, as the FSSA rightly notes. While capital ratios have already
been increased significantly in recent years, they continue to be lower than those of peer groups.
Leverage indicators, however, are more favorable than in many European peers and the FSAP stress
tests have shown the Austrian banking system to be overall resilient to adverse shocks. The pressure
on Austrian banks to further strengthen their loss absorption capacity in the years ahead should be
maintained. From a broader perspective, the greatest impact on fostering financial stability would be
associated with higher capital ratios of large, internationally active Austrian banks with significant
CESEE activities. The authorities concur with the staff’s view in this respect and welcome the
recent capital increase and repayment of government participation capital by the largest Austrian
banks as a first important step in that direction.
As in many other European countries, asset quality is an important risk factor for Austrian banks.
This is particularly the case for Austrian banks with significant international activities in the CESEE

3
region, as domestic credit quality has remained fairly stable in recent years. However, as regards
data shortcomings on asset quality on CESEE exposures, which are pointed out in the FSSA, it
should be mentioned that this is a relevant caveat for all internationally active banks, in particular in
Europe, and Austrian banks should not be singled out in this respect.
In view of the difficult economic environment and new regulatory measures, there have been
concerns that banks might restrict lending to the real economy, in the case of Austrian banks most
prominently with regard to the CESEE region. However, concerns about a widespread deleveraging
did not materialize, as stated in the FSSA. On the contrary, local funding has improved in line with
supervisory expectations, and with the exception of a few countries, total credit to the real economy
has increased. Moreover, a gradual reduction in leverage is a welcome development from the
perspective of financial stability. This ongoing process is an important component of adapting
banks’ balance sheets to a post-crisis environment and – if implemented carefully – should result in
positive externalities. Clearly, both its scale and pace require close monitoring, particularly given its
potential impact on the supply of credit to the real economy.
