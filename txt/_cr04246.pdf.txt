Executive Summary
1. The Royal Government of Bhutan (RGoB) has initiated a Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP) process as a part of the broader ongoing efforts to combat
poverty. The main objective of the PRSP process is to strengthen the strategic
framework for poverty reduction, improve donor coordination, and build support
for new initiatives in public expenditure management and poverty monitoring and
evaluation. The envisaged process builds directly on the Ninth Five-Year Plan
(Ninth Plan), and this Cover Note together with the Ninth Plan document will
comprise the PRSP.
2. As an extension of the Ninth Plan, this Cover Note elaborates on several key areas
and has 9 parts. Part I introduces the PRSP process envisaged in Bhutan. Part II
briefly presents the country background, Bhutan 2020 – Vision for Peace,
Prosperity and Happiness, and the main objectives and strategies of the Ninth
Plan. Part III discusses recent economic and policy developments and the
outlook. Part IV presents a medium term expenditure framework (MTEF). Part V
discusses the sectoral strategies. Part VI highlights the profiling of poor such as
who are the poor, where are they located and causes of poverty. Part VII
enumerates on poverty reduction challenges and strategies. Part VIII describes
ongoing efforts to strengthen the poverty monitoring and evaluation system as
laid out in the proposed Bhutan Poverty Monitoring and Assessment System
(PMAS) report. Part IX elaborates on the consultative process that underpinned
the preparation of the Ninth Plan and that is envisaged for the PRSP. More details
on the macroeconomic, structural and social policies, and the sectoral objectives,
strategies and programs are discussed in the main document of the Ninth Plan.
3. Bhutan’s development is guided by the philosophy of Gross National Happiness
emphasizing a balance between material well-being and the spiritual, emotional
and cultural well-being of an individual and the society. The long-term vision of
where Bhutan wants to be in the next two decades is laid down in the Bhutan
2020 document. These long-term visions are translated into concrete sectoral
policies, strategies and programs in the five-year development plans. The current
Ninth Plan, which runs from July 2002 to June 2007, accords high priority to
infrastructure development and improving the quality of social services.
4. With strong levels of growth and record low inflation, Bhutan continues to enjoy
a stable macroeconomic environment conducive to sustained growth. As of
December 2003, growth was about 6.5 percent with the major impetus coming
from the construction, manufacturing and transportation sectors. The consumer
price index recorded further decrease in inflation to a historical low of 1.3% as of
December 2003. With inflows of foreign aid, concessional loans and some
foreign investment offsetting the persistent trade deficit, Bhutan has accumulated
foreign reserves amounting to the equivalent of USD 366.71 million by December
2003, which is an increase of around 16 percent over the reserves of USD 316.9

3/4

million in June 20021. This reserve is sufficient to cover around 22 months of
imports. These trends are expected to continue in the coming years. Government
expenditure in 2002/2003 is estimated to have been only slightly larger than
budgeted, but the overall fiscal deficit rose to about 9 percent of GDP, mainly
because external grants received were smaller than anticipated. With an increase
in grants, the approved budget for 2003/2004 projects narrowing of the overall
fiscal balance to about 4 percent of GDP.
5. In an effort to strengthen the budget process and the management of public
expenditures, the RGoB has initiated a two-year rolling budget mechanism. As a
part of these endeavors, some of the key features of an MTEF are developed in
this cover note. Based on estimates of recent economic developments and the
outlook, the MTEF covering the next three years anticipates budget deficits
between 3 and 4 percent of GDP, and overall spending between 35 and 40 percent
of GDP. Public spending continues to focus on poverty reduction and economic
growth, emphasizing infrastructure (11 percent of the budget for roads) and social
services (about 24 percent for health and education).
6. In order to facilitate focusing of policies and adopting of appropriate strategies in
addressing poverty, the analyzing of poverty incidences through, such as,
profiling of poor would give a meaningful input. With this objective in mind, the
Royal Government attempted carrying out some poverty studies such as
Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2000 (HIES 2000) and Poverty
Assessment and Analysis 2000 (PAA 2000) on pilot basis. While the HIES 2000
findings focused on the household level, the PAA 2000 results dealt with the
situation at the block (Gewog) and district (Dzongkhag) levels. They complement
each other. However, as is often the case with any surveys of this nature, the
results should be taken as indicative until they are confirmed through more
systematic surveys.
7. Monitoring and evaluation have always been a high priority, and efforts to
streamline and institutionalize the system are underway. A draft Poverty
Monitoring and Assessment System (PMAS), which aims to facilitate the
coordinated and systematic use of data for impact assessment, is being worked out
internally and is likely to be finalized as soon as the list of poverty indicators is
finalized.
8. The consultative process for the Ninth Plan brought together various stakeholders
including the central ministries and agencies, Dzongkhag and Gewogs, and
donors. It was carried out over a 2 year time period, and also underpins the PRSP
process. Several key sectoral ministries are involved in the drafting of this Cover
Note, in the sense that concerned sectors were consulted while preparing it with
technical assistance from the World Bank.

Introduction – Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper

1.1

The Royal Government of Bhutan (RGoB) has initiated a Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP) process as a part of the broader ongoing efforts to combat
poverty. The main objective of the PRSP is to strengthen the strategic framework
for poverty reduction, improve donor coordination, and build support for new
initiatives in public expenditure management (annual plans and two year rolling
budget introduced from financial year 2003-04) and poverty monitoring and
assessment system (PMAS).

1.2

The PRSP seeks to complement the Ninth Plan main document by:
a)
b)
c)
d)
e)
f)

Presenting a brief update on recent economic developments over the first
year of the plan;
Elaborating an MTEF;
Highlighting on profiling of the poor and causes of poverty;
Enumerating on poverty reduction challenges and strategies;
Describing the proposed poverty monitoring and assessment system,
Discussing the consultative process of both the Ninth Plan and that
envisaged for the PRSP.

Institutional Arrangements
1.3

The Department of Planning (DoP), under the Ministry of Finance, is the lead
agency in preparing the PRSP. The DoP was identified as the lead PRSP agency
in view of its role in coordinating, formulating, implementing and monitoring
poverty related programs. The DoP also facilitates consultation and consensus
building regarding pro-poor policy across a broad range of stakeholders.

1.4

To improve information flow and coordinate existing monitoring systems, the
DoP works closely with National Statistical Bureau (NSB), Planning & Policy
Division (PPD) in the ministries, and the Dzongkhag technical units, especially
Planning Unit. In view of the high priority being accorded to the poverty issues,
the Department of Planning is in the process of considering the establishment of a
Poverty Monitoring Unit (PMU) within the DoP to assess Poverty Vulnerability
Indicators (PVI), outcome monitoring, impact assessment and to perform the
crucial function of communication and advocacy on poverty. In case the PMU is
established, it will be responsible for key aspects of the PRSP, including the
submission of poverty progress reports to the concerned authorities for review.

1.5

The PRSP has been prepared in consultation with all concerned sectors and
agencies.

Bhutan 2020 & Ninth Plan

2.1

Bhutan is a small land locked country in Eastern Himalayas bordered by India in
the south and China in the north. It has one of the most formidable mountainous
terrains in the world, ranging from 100 meters to 7,500 meters in height. Bhutan
has a land area of 38,394 square kilometers with about 72 percent forest coverage.
The estimated population is 734,340 (2003)1 with 79 percent rural population and
about 42 percent of the population below the age of 15.

2.2

Administratively, the country is divided into 20 Dzongkhags (districts), which are
further sub-divided into 201 Gewogs (Blocks). The Dzongkhag Yargye Tshogdue
(DYT) or the District Development Committee, and the Gewog Yargye
Tshogchungs (GYT) or the Block Development Committee, are the two main
institutions for local decision-making and plan implementation. The members of
these committees are the elected representatives of the people.

Bhutan 2020: A Vision for Peace, Prosperity and Happiness
2.3

Gross National Happiness is the overarching development philosophy of Bhutan.
It recognizes the need to balance material well-being with spiritual, emotional and
cultural well-being of the individual and the society for a holistic development.
Accordingly, four major areas have been identified as pillars of Gross National
Happiness and these are a) economic growth and development; b) preservation
and promotion of cultural heritage; c) preservation and sustainable use of the
environment; and d) good governance.

2.4

Gross National Happiness has been the guiding principle for socio economic
development of Bhutan in the last two decades and will continue to be so in the
future as envisaged in the document “Bhutan 2020: A Vision for Peace,
Prosperity and Happiness”.

2.5

Bhutan 2020: A Vision for Peace, Prosperity and Happiness is a twenty year
perspective strategy which sets the preferred direction for where Bhutan wants to
be in the next two decades. It highlights the national goals, broad targets and
overall policy principles for the next twenty years. It is based on the six main
principles of a) maintaining a distinct identity; b) strengthening unity and
harmony; c) guaranteeing a nationwide stability for peace and prosperity; d)
promoting self-reliance; e) pursuing sustainable development and f)
demonstrating capacity to effectively respond to challenges and possibilities.

2.6

Human Development as capacity for individuals to make choices within a traditional ethos
fundamental to Bhutan’s development approach that seeks to improve overall quality of life and
respect for human rights such that rights to education, health, and livelihoods complement abstract
rights of equality before law.
Culture & Heritage to ensure relevance for a society in transition by becoming an integrating
factor of harmony and social cohesiveness based on acquisition of knowledge for communal
enrichment and well being, while remaining a source of enabling inspiration for Bhutanese to
adjust and cope with the rapid pace of modernization and social transformation.
Balanced Equitable Development to ensure equitable development benefits among varying
income groups and regions, and drawing into development mainstream marginalized and
vulnerable groups with all efforts to strengthen grass roots organization such that people make
well-informed decisions on their roles in development.
Governance to create effective community participation in making informed decisions through
governance architecture that emphasizes "golden yoke of governance” such that closer decisionmaking process reaches communities through institutions and procedures that pursue and manage
rule of law, human rights, transparency, accountability, participatory development, and
decentralization, as preconditions of human happiness the more operational becomes GNH.
Environmental Conservation to embody environmental sustainability such that Bhutan’s natural
heritage remains a development asset with global significance. Bhutan is internationally
acknowledged for contributing to a global environmental agenda by preserving 72% of land under
forest cover strengthened by a policy to refrain from appropriating short-term economic gains at
the expense of its pristine environment.

Bhutan 2020 serves as a milestone for planning and guidance, setting targets such
as a) providing electricity to 50 % of the rural population by 2012; b) achieving a
three fold increase in real income of farmers by 2012; c) ensuring that 75 % of the
rural population live within half a day’s walk from nearest road; and d)
maintaining 60 % of Bhutan’s land area under forest coverage in perpetuity. The
vision set out in Bhutan 2020 is translated into sectoral policies, strategies and
programs through five-year development plans. The key social targets for the
Ninth Plan, which are consistent with the Bhutan 2020 and the MDGs, are listed
in Table 1.

Ninth Plan
2.7

The main document of the Ninth Plan should be referred to for more detail. The
cover note only reviews the broad themes and the highlights.

2.8

The Ninth Plan covers the period July 2002 to June 2007. It is different from the
past plans in the sense that for the first time it includes individual plans for 201
Gewogs, prepared by the communities and their elected representatives. The
communities will be responsible for the implementation and monitoring of the
Gewog plans with technical backstopping support from the Dzongkhag and the
central agencies.

2.9

The Ninth Plan consists of a) Ninth Plan Main Document; b) Sectoral Plans; c) 20
separate Dzongkhag Plans and d) 201 individual Gewog Plans. The main
document pulls these different components together and outlines the broad
national policy aims, objectives and strategies over the next five-year period.
These broad policies and objectives are translated into detailed strategies and
programs in the sectoral, Dzongkhag and Gewog plan documents. The central
plan consists of programs that require inter-Dzongkhag coordination, substantial
resources and technical expertise. Dzongkhag plans include programs that require
inter-Gewog coordination, institutional strengthening and capacity development
of their sectoral human resources. Gewogs plans consist mainly of social and rural
infrastructure development programs such as construction of farm roads, outreach clinics, community schools, irrigation facilities, suspension bridges, mule
tracks, and rural water supply schemes which are within the scope of the technical
competency of communities for implementation.

Main objectives
2.10

The Ninth Plan has five overall objectives namely a) Improving the quality of life
and income, especially of the poor; b) Ensuring good governance; c) Promoting
private sector growth and employment generation; d) Preserving and promoting
cultural heritage and environment conservations; and e) Achieving rapid
economic growth and transformation. The objectives are consistent with making
progress towards realizing the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015,
or even earlier.

2.11

The strategies to achieve the above objectives include a) infrastructure expansion;
b) sound macro-economic policy; c) ensuring good governance; and d) improving
access and enhancing social services.
8/9

Key Strategies
Strategy I: Infrastructure expansion
2.12

The Plan accords high priority to infrastructure expansion such as expansion of
road network particularly feeder roads to improve rural access, provision of
electricity to at least 15,000 rural households, provision of rural
telecommunications and urban infrastructure.

Strategy II: Sound Macro-economic policy
2.13

Appropriate macroeconomic and fiscal policies will be formulated to ensure
stable economic growth of 7-9 percent and private sector participation. Continued
efforts will be made to increase domestic resources through improved tax
administration and the introduction of new taxes to broaden the revenue base.

Strategy III: Ensuring Good Governance
2.14

Efforts to strengthen good governance would continue through administrative and
political reforms and creation of new structures and processes. Most significant
will be the adoption of a written national constitution.

Strategy IV: Improving Access and Enhancing Social Services
2.15

It is observed that communities that are closer to roads are better off in terms of
economic and social well being than those further away. Therefore, improving
access through infrastructure expansion is a key strategy for poverty reduction,
enhancing the quality of social services and increasing economic opportunities.

Financial Framework
2.16

The total outlay for the Ninth Plan is Nu. 70,000 million, of which Nu. 31,682
million is for current expenditures, Nu. 34,869 million for capital investments and
Nu. 3,449 million is for debt servicing. Current expenditure is to be covered by
domestic revenue of Nu. 32,000 million, while external assistance amounting to
over Nu. 28,000 (earlier estimate was Nu. 35,000 million comprising grant of Nu.
30,000 and loan of Nu. 5,000), out of which approximately Nu. 21,000 million in
the form of grant assistance and Nu. 7,000 million in concessionary loans is
expected to finance capital investments. A budgetary gap of over Nu. 5,000
million is to be covered by domestic borrowing.

Recent Economic & Policy Developments and the Outlook

Growth
3.1

As per the provisional national accounts data, real GDP grew by 6.5% in 2003,
slightly lower than the Eighth Plan average of 6.7 percent (Table 2). The major
impetus of growth came from construction, manufacturing and transportation
sectors each registering growth of 16.4 percent, 14.3 percent and 11.8 percent
respectively. Agriculture grew more slowly, but it continues to be the largest
sector of the economy, contributing 30 percent of GDP in the first year of the
Ninth plan. Construction has been a dynamic source of growth mainly as a result
of activities associated with the Kurichhu, Basochhu and Tala hydropower
projects.

3.2

Growth during the next three years (2004-05 to 2006-07) is expected to average
around 8 percent per annum. The construction, manufacturing, transportation and
electricity sectors are expected to be the key sectors spurring growth.Table 2:

Balance of Payments
3.3

The most recent available data, provisional, covering period up to June 2003,
indicate favorable balance of payments with continued inflow of foreign aid,
concessional loans and some foreign investment offsetting the persistent trade
deficit. Bhutan has accumulated gross foreign reserves amounting to the
equivalent of USD 366.71 million by December 2003, sufficient to cover around
22 months of imports. Convertible currency reserves account for USD 288.28
million and balance in Indian rupees. Imports grew at annual average of 20
percent over the last decade compared to 14.5 percent for exports, with total

11/12

imports valued at Nu. 9042.1 million (27% of GDP, 2003), and total exports value
at Nu.5405.9 million (17% of GDP, 2003). Trade deficit, narrowed slightly to Nu.
3636.2 million in 2002-03. However, strong inflows of aid were more than
sufficient to offset this deficit, and a current account surplus of Nu. 2937.1 million
(9% of GDP) is estimated for 2002/03.
3.4

The trade deficits is expected to continue during the Ninth Plan, financed by
positive inflows of external assistance and growth in foreign direct investment.
The commissioning of Tala in 2005/06 will boost electricity exports to India and
help to narrow the trade deficit in the later years of the Ninth Plan. India remains
the dominant trading partner, but attempts are being made to diversify trade in
terms of products and trading partners. The foreign reserves are projected to grow
in the coming years.

Debt Outstanding
3.5

As of December 2003, the stock of external debt outstanding was USD 472.193
million or around 67 percent of GDP. Out of this, convertible currency debt stock
accounted for around 41 percent. The entire convertible currency debt stock is
concessional in nature with the most favorable terms and conditions. The debt
service ratio for the same period was 3.5 percent, reflecting the highly
concessional nature of Bhutan’s debt portfolio.

3.6

In the coming year, external borrowings are expected to fund 15% of total
government capital outlay. As in the past, concessional loans will be availed for
priority investment projects with high economic returns and for which grant
financing is not forthcoming.

Monetary policy and Inflation
3.7

Monetary policy will continue to be aimed at maintaining the Ngultrum-Rupee
parity. Though this limits the scope for an independent monetary policy, it
contributes to macro economic stability, and facilitates trade with India which
accounts for 80 % of Bhutan’s external trade. Among others, the Royal Monetary
Authority plans to foster competition in the financial sector. The excess liquidity
problem has also been reduced considerably over the last year.

3.8

The rate of inflation, as recorded by the consumer price index, decreased further
from 2.7 percent at the end of the Eighth Plan to a historical low of 1.3 percent in
December 2003 The inflation in India has been relatively low in recent years and
since inflation in Bhutan closely tracks the inflation in India, Bhutan’s rate of
inflation is projected to remain below 4 percent in the coming years.

12/13

Fiscal Policy
3.9

The RGoB will continue to pursue the policy of financing the recurrent
expenditures from domestic revenue and capital investments through external
assistance, largely in the form of grant financing. The overall fiscal deficit in
2002-03 reached 11 percent of GDP but the RGoB seeks to limit the overall
budgetary deficit to about 4-5 percent of the GDP in the coming years, but will
depend largely on the external funding availability. A more detailed discussions
on the fiscal performance and the outlook is presented as part of the MTEF below.

Other Developments
3.10

Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) can be a driving force for rapid economic
growth. Foreign investment provides access to capital, markets and new
technologies as well as transfer of managerial skills. In addition, FDI is a more
stable source of foreign capital. Therefore, even though Bhutan is not an attractive
FDI destination given the numerous disadvantages of being a small, landlocked,
mountainous country, Bhutan must try to attract as much foreign investment in
the areas where we have some advantage. To provide the framework for such
investments, the RGoB approved the FDI Policy in December 2002.

3.11

Bhutan acceded to the World Customs Organization (WCO) in February 2003.
The WCO is a UN agency dedicated to dealing with customs administration and
related matters. As Bhutan’s economy modernizes and its trading activities
expand, the WCO will facilitate trans-border trade and improve surveillance.
Bhutan will also benefit from various technical assistance, personnel training and
establishment of working relations with customs agencies in other member
countries.

3.12

The Royal Government acceded to the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in
December 2003. The IFC is a member of the World Bank Group that serves as a
multilateral source of loan and equity financing for private sector projects in
developing countries. Membership in the IFC will benefit our private sector
immensely through access to large international financing as well as technical
assistance. The ability of the private sector to access such foreign capital will be
based solely on the economic viability of the project and not be dependent on any
government intervention or guarantees.

3.13

BIMST-EC (Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand-Economic
Cooperation)
With an objective to expand our economic relations with the SAARC and South
East Asian countries, Bhutan joined the BIMST-EC in 2004. During the Sixth
BIMST-EC Ministerial Meeting in Phuket, Thailand, in 2004, Bhutan and Nepal
were formally admitted as new members. Bhutan also became a signatory to the
BIMST-EC Free Trade Area. Membership in this regional grouping will enable

13/14

Bhutan to diversify its export markets and link transport infrastructure while
harnessing other potential benefits of expanding economic relation beyond
SAARC region.
3.14

Asian Highway Network
During the Sixtieth Session of UNESCAP at Shanghai, China in April 2004,
Bhutan along with 22 other countries signed the Intergovernmental Agreement on
the Asian Highway Network. With 140,000 kms in span, the Asian highway
Network will extend to 32 Asian countries, linking the capital cities and other
major commercial centers. It is expected to open opportunities, especially for
landlocked central Asian countries, to reach the European markets.

3.15

SAFTA (South Asia Free Trade Area)
The Framework Agreement on South Asia Free Trade Area (SAFTA), which was
signed by Bhutan during the XII SAARC Summit in Islamabad, Pakistan, is
expected to open up new market for Bhutanese products as well as help in deeper
economic integration with the countries in the region.

Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF)

4.1

In an effort to strengthen the budget process and the management of public
expenditures, the RGoB had conducted its annual plan discussions for 2003-04
and introduced a two-year rolling budget from that fiscal year onwards. As a part
of these endeavors, some of the key features of an MTEF have been developed
here. Based on estimates of recent economic developments and the outlook
described in the above sections, a provisional MTEF, covering the preceding two
financial years and next three financial years, is presented in Table 3.

4.2

The MTEF is based on the Ninth Plan financial projections. The total Ninth Plan
outlay is Nu. 70,000 million, of which Nu. 31,682 million is for current
expenditures, Nu. 34,869 million for capital investments and Nu. 3,449 million is
for debt servicing. Current expenditure is to be covered by domestic revenue of
Nu. 32,000 million, while external resources amounting to Nu. 28,000 million
(earlier estimate was Nu. 35,000 million comprising grant of Nu. 30,000 and loan
of Nu. 5,000) is expected to cover capital investments. Out of the total external
resources, approximately Nu. 21,000 million is grant assistance and over Nu.
7,000 million is concessionary loans. The RGoB may have to meet the budgetary
gap of over Nu. 5,000 million by domestic borrowings.

4.3

Public spending continues to focus on poverty reduction and economic growth,
emphasizing infrastructure development and social services. Greater detail on the
sectoral priorities as outlined in the Ninth Plan is presented in the section below
on Sectoral Strategies.

estimates. However, External Borrowings has been scaled up to Nu. 7,135.08m from Nu. 5,081.203 m. Because of these factors, the overall budget gap is estimated to increase to

Review of Actual Expenditure for 2002-03
4.4

Like earlier Plans, the first year of the 9th Plan was a preparatory phase of the
Plan. Being the first experimental year for implementation of Gewog-based
plans, it faced numerous constraints. Firstly, all 2001 Gups had to be elected as
per the universal adult franchise, which was carried out nationwide during the
year 2002. Given the absence of any particular agency and/or Election
Commission, the task was entrusted to the respective Dzongkhags. This event
necessitated the engagement of most of the field officials during the election thus
leaving the Dzongkhags with limited time and manpower to implement the plan
activities as scheduled. Secondly, the provision of training and orientation to the
newly elected Gups took away much of their initial time and this caused delay in
the overall supervision of plan activities particularly at the Gewog level. Thirdly,
most of the capital activities had to be kept in abeyance because of the non-receipt
of external funds as the negotiations were still under progress.

4.5

However, as far as the overall expenditure is concerned, the 9th Plan targets have
not been severely affected as the 2002-03 expenditure accounted for nearly 15%
of the total plan outlay against the government’s target of 16%. The total
expenditure was Nu. 10,211.146 million of which Nu. 4580.908 million (45%)
was current expenditure and Nu. 5630.238 million (55%) was capital expenditure.
In line with the pro-poor policy of the government, most of the expenditure was
geared towards infrastructure development, and expenditure for social sectors was
22% followed by RNR sector with 12%. Although there were numerous
enhancement of remuneration especially for Chimi, Mangmi, Gup, Gewog clerks
and enhanced travel benefits for support staff in government offices, besides other
hosts of recurrent costs, the current expenditures in 2002-03 were lower from that
of 2001-02 by about 2%. This was possible due to stringent fiscal management
by the Royal Government.

4.6

The overall fiscal deficit is estimated to have widened to 11 percent of GDP in
2002-03 from 6.7 percent in 2001-02 mainly due to resource uncertainties on
account of issues related to project readiness and finalization of negotiations with
donors.

4.7

On the resource side, domestic revenue and other receipts were on target.
Domestic revenue was able to cover the current expenditure once again. The first
year of the implementation of the Personal Income Tax resulted in total collection
of Nu. 91 millions. With regard to external assistance, grants from donors other
than India increased by over 13 percent but grants from the Government of India
(GoI) were significantly lower than projected. As a consequence, the resource gap
increased substantially to around 14 percent of the actual expenditure.

Review of Revised Budget for 2003-04
4.8

The Royal Government was able to narrow down the overall fiscal deficit to about
6 percent of GDP. This improvement in the fiscal position was largely due to
sustained economic growth and receipt of projected external grants, especially
grants from India. One of the most important developments that had an impact on
the national budget was the creation of three new ministries: Ministry of Labour
and Human Resources, bifurcations of the Ministry of Health & Education and
the Ministry of Communications. The objective of creating these new institutions
was to further strengthen and enhance the performance of the RGoB in its various
functions.

4.9

The revised budget for the fiscal year 2003-2004 had exceeded the actual
expenditure of the past year by about 22 percent or Nu.2268.492 million. The
capital and current expenditures had increased by around 23 percent and 22
percent respectively over the past financial year. The revised budget had increased
by around 8% from the original estimates of Nu. 11,537.737 million.

4.10

On the expenditure side, most of the increase was on account of current
expenditures, in particular, the interest subsidy to the DrukAir Corporation, the
membership fees for acceding to the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and
new appointments in the civil service. As a result, current expenditure coverage
by domestic revenues would be around 94%. However, every effort is made to
keep the expenditures within the original budget, especially the current
expenditures within the domestic resources envelope. Regarding the capital
expenditures, there was a relatively small increase, and one of the major factors,
besides others, contributing to the increase was the provision for the restoration of
roads damaged by monsoon.

4.11

On the resources side, there was a shortfall in program grants of around Nu. 176
million. This was mainly because at the time of budget preparation, negotiations
with some large donors had not been completed. This shortfall together with
increase in expenditures would lead to an additional deficit of around Nu. 352
million over what was projected. Further, expected receipts of substantial
amounts of grants for various projects did not materialize as the projects took time
to be finalized with the development partners. Consequently, any shortfall arising
out of it has to be met from domestic borrowings in order to maintain the level of
expenditures. However, the revised resource gap is still lower than the past years
level.

4.12

A significant feature of the 2003-2004 budget was decentralization and the
increasing role played by the peoples’ representatives, especially GYTs and
DYTs, in the management and use of government funds. There were a number of
implications from this change. Firstly, unlike the past, it provided peoples’
representatives greater control over resources. Secondly, their accountability to
the government, and more importantly to their constituents, on the management

18/19

and use of public funds has been increased. To facilitate decentralization, the
Ministry of Finance had initiated the Gewog based budgeting system. Additional
finance personnel have been trained and posted to the Dzongkhag to cater to the
needs of Gewogs.
4.13

In line with the GYT Chathrim 2002, the Gewogs were allowed to retain rural
taxes. It was expected that with time and the experience gained in the
management and use of these funds, the process of decentralization would be
further strengthened. A common feature of all the Gewog budgets was the request
for funds for the construction of Gups’ offices. Unlike the past, with expanded
roles and responsibilities of the Gup, as well as to ensure continuity and
convenience for the people, there was a need for a more permanent office
establishment to support this important institution. Thus RGoB would support
construction of Gups offices but in a phased manner. Also, there were numerous
other Gewog infrastructure needs such as Renewable Natural Resource (RNR)
Centres being planned by the government. To ensure maximum benefit and
convenience to the people, the Royal Government would coordinate the
construction of these facilities to create an Integrated Gewog Development Centre
(basically a Gewog Headquarter). Over time, this is expected to become a growth
centre that would create economic opportunities including employment for the
Gewogs in addition to cost and convenience benefits. It should also create an
additional market for village produce and bring in other benefits in much the same
manner as the Dzongkhag towns.

Review of Approved Budget for 2004-05
4.14

While preparing the annual budget for the financial year 2004-05, several factors
have been taken into consideration, amongst others the policy of fiscal
sustainability including resource availability, backlog activities of the preceding
years which could not be implemented due to various reasons and focus on the
Gewog-based programmes. Accordingly, the expenditure budget for the year has
been drawn up at Nu. 13,621.739 million, out of which Nu. 5,968.657 million
(44%) is for recurrent expenditure and Nu. 7,158.342 million (56%) is for capital
expenditure.

4.15

The focus of the financial year 2004-05 continues to be on rural development
which includes large outlays on rural electrification, feeder and farm roads, health
and education infrastructure in the Dzongkhags. Other capital activities include
low-income housing, the construction of the hangar for the new airplanes,
construction of roads and population census programmes. These make up the
bulk of the capital expenditure budget. The outlay for infrastructure, including
buildings and roads, accounted for around 64% of capital expenditure. About 8%
of the capital expenditure outlay is allocated for human resource development.

4.16

With respect to current expenditure, it is 7% higher than the revised budget
estimates of 2003-04. As in the past year, the wage bill is the single largest item,

19/20

accounting for around 38%. Interest payments constitute around 6% of the
current expenditure, subsidies to corporations around 4% and about 8% for
maintenance of infrastructure.
4.17

On the resource side, domestic revenues are expected to finance around 42% of
the total expenditures, grants around 32% and concessional borrowings about
10%. The balance has to be financed through domestic borrowings. Total
revenue is projected to increase by about 11% over the past year and most of the
growth is projected to accrue from Non-tax revenue. Unlike preceding years, the
government’s fiscal objective of current expenditure coverage by domestic
revenues is expected to fall short in the financial year 2004-05. This is mainly
because of the increasing current expenditures such as on the maintenance of
growing infrastructure and public services, while the growth in revenue is not
keeping pace due to the narrow tax base.

4.18

The external assistance, including grants and borrowings, is expected to fund
around 80% of the capital expenditure or around 42% of the total budget outlay.
While the Royal Government would like to finance all the capital expenditures of
the 9th Plan through grant financing, the overall grants available are likely to be
significantly below the requirement. Further, while concessional borrowings are
expected to offset some of the projected shortfall, the balance will have to be
made up by increase in domestic borrowing which is expected to finance around
7% of the budget of the financial year 2004-05, as against about 6% in the revised
budget of 2003-04.

4.19

One of the significant characters of the 2004-05 financial year is the dramatic
increase in the budget for activities to be executed by the Gewogs in line with the
decentralization policy. A sum of Nu. 452 million has been budgeted for the
Gewog activities which represent 62% increase over the revised estimates for the
past year. The total budget provision for Dzongkhags and Gewogs is 31% higher
than the previous year’s revised budget. While the budget for Dzongkhags and
Gewogs account for around 22% of the total budget outlay, it does not include
budget for activities such as rural electrification, rural telecommunication and
rural feeder roads which are implemented by central agencies although they are
the direct beneficiaries of these programmes.

4.20

In terms of sectoral allocation of budget, as in the past financial years, as well as
in line with the priority setting of the 9th plan, social sectors, including health and
education, have been allocated around 28% while the RNR and road sectors have
been allocated around 11% each.

20/21

Outlook for 2005-06 to 2006-07
4.21

This provisional MTEF is based on the economic outlook discussed above and the
overall Ninth Plan priorities. Given the actual expenditure of 2002-03, revised
estimate budget of 2003-04 and approved estimated budget for 2004-05, the pace
of implementation will need to accelerate sharply in the remaining two years,
especially in the second last year of the Ninth Plan if the overall goals are going to
be met.

4.22

The overall fiscal deficit is to remain at or below 4-5 percent of GDP. This will
depend on a substantial increase in external grants to finance capital investment
projects as implementation advances and gains momentum.

4.23

The expenditures are expected to increase in nominal terms but remain below 40
percent of the GDP, with capital expenditure accounting for approximately 55
percent of the total budget. The annual projections are based on what remains
from the Ninth Plan overall outlay after taking into account the expenditures of
2002-03, revised budget of 2003-04 and the approved budget for 2004-05
(covering the first three years of the Ninth Plan). In addition, the path of
expenditure to GDP ratio was also considered in making the projections.

4.24

On the resource side, the estimated domestic revenue is expected to continue
covering the current expenditure with domestic revenue remaining at around 1718 percent of the GDP. The external grants are expected to increase in the coming
years such that the overall plan targets will be met. The projections are again
based on what remains from the Ninth Plan overall resources anticipated after
taking into account the revenues of the past three financial years. The projected
resource gap of about 4-5 percent is planned to be covered through concessionary
loans of about 3-4 percent of GDP and the balance through domestic borrowings
of about 2-3 percent of GDP.

Special Considerations
4.25

2

One of the significant changes during the Ninth Plan has been the introduction of
Gewog2 (Block) Plans, whereby individual developmental plan and costing were
performed for each Gewog. Accordingly, the budgetary allocations have been
divided into central, Dzongkhag (District) and Gewog budgets. From the total
budgetary outlay of Nu. 70,000 million, about 75 percent is allocated to the
center, 21 % to the Dzongkhag and 4 % to the Gewogs. While the percentage of
budget allocated to the Dzongkhag and Gewogs appears small in comparison to
the allocations made to the Centre, the programs proposed for implementation by
the Centre are all for the benefit of the Dzongkhag and Gewogs, and therefore the
actual expenditures would be much more than indicated.

There are 201 Gewogs in 20 Dzongkhags

21/22

4.26

The Central programs include those that require large investments, a high level of
technical expertise, and inter-Dzongkhag coordination Therefore, programs such
as rural electrification, rural access roads, rural telecommunications, purchase of
farm machineries and equipment, and the human resource development of the
Dzongkhag and Gewogs are budgeted in the center.

4.27

The Dzongkhags will be responsible for implementation of programs that require
inter-Gewog coordination, institutional strengthening and capacity development
of their sectoral human resources. While Gewog programs will be implemented
by the Gewogs themselves, the Dzongkhag will be responsible for the
coordination, supervision, quality control and providing technical backstopping to
the Gewogs. The largest portion of the Dzongkhag budget is allocated to the
Education sector as the responsibility of establishing and maintaining the
educational infrastructure at the lower secondary, middle secondary and higher
secondary levels have been devolved to the Dzongkhag from the center. The
construction of district hospitals, Basic Health Units and development of satellite
townships in the Dzongkhag are some of the other major programs included in the
Dzongkhag budget.

4.28

Gewog programs consist mainly of social and rural infrastructure development
such as construction of farm roads, out reach clinics, primary and community
schools, irrigation facilities, suspension bridges and mule tracks and rural water
supply schemes. These programs were prioritized by the Gewogs based on
potential, needs and their ability to participate in terms of labour contribution,
land acquisition, etc. The agriculture sector receives the highest budgetary
allocation, as the Gewogs would implement most of the activities in this sector
with technical support from the Dzongkhag.

5.

Sectoral Strategies

5.1

The MTEF presented in the previous section and the Ninth Plan places strong
emphasis on poverty reduction and this is reflected in the sectoral strategies
described below. As shown on Table 4, the Ninth Plan focuses on enhanced
access to health and education facilities, and infrastructure development such as
roads, electricity and rural telecommunications. Thus, 24 percent of the total
budget is allocated to the social sectors (health and education) followed by roads,
agriculture and electricity, each receiving an allocation of 10 percent of the total.
These strategies are consistent with the MDGs.

Education Sector:
5.2

Current situation: The high priority given to the education sector has resulted in
an increase in the gross primary enrolment ratio from 55 percent in 1991 to 81
percent in 2003, an annual increase of about 6-7 percent. The girl’s enrolment
ratio has also risen significantly, from 39 percent in 1990 to 47 percent in 2003.
There has also been a substantial rise in the share of school children completing
seven years of primary school (grades 1 through 7), doubling in the 1990s to
reach 69 percent in 2001. Adult literacy increased from 48 percent in 1994 to 54
percent in 2000. This progress suggests that Bhutan is on track to achieve the
MDGs related to education.

5.3

While significant progress has been made, the education sector is still confronted
with several challenges. The difficult terrain and widely scattered population
makes provision of educational services very costly and does not allow economies
of scale. The education system as a whole suffers from a critical shortage of
educational facilities and an inadequate number of qualified and competent
teachers. The retention rate, while it has improved over the years, still remains
high. Of the 100 children enrolling in primary schools, only 69 complete seven
years of primary education, 54 complete Class VIII and 39 reach class X. The
repetition rate remains high at an annual average of 14 percent.

23/24

5.4

Objectives: The main goals set out for the Ninth Plan include:
• Providing support mechanisms for early childhood care and development for
children between 0-6 years on a pilot basis;
• Enhancing enrolment of children between 6-12 years of age in primary
schools to 90-95 percent by 2007;
• Enhancing the quality of education comparable to international standards;
• Improving and expanding youth guidance and career counseling and value
education for wholesome development of the youth;
• Increasing the basic level from class VIII to X;
• Increasing promotion proportion from class X to XI from 38 percent to 56
percent by 2007;
• Developing a higher education system under the umbrella of a National
University;
• Enhancing the literacy rate from 54 percent to 80 percent and establish a
system of continuing and life long education opportunities;
• Establishing a program of inclusive education for children who are physically
and mentally challenged;
• Strengthening and improving the education management system with
particular emphasis on the school level management; and
• Developing a more sustainable education system through the introduction of
private participation and cost sharing measures.

5.5

Strategies: The main thrust of the Education sector strategy in the Ninth Plan is to
increase access and reach the un-reached, further develop the curriculum, improve
the teacher pupil ratio, and expand educational facilities. The major programs
proposed to improve the quality of education include: a) constructing 120
community schools, 26 lower secondary and 23 middle and higher secondary
schools, b) expanding the facilities at Sherubtse College to increase enrollment
from 600 to 1000 students, c) increasing facilities at the two in-country teachers
training institutes to increase the intake of trainee teachers from 900 to 1,470, d)
providing special education for the disabled, e) continuing adult literacy
programs, and e) establishing the national university of Bhutan.

5.6

Financing: The continued high priority given to the education sector has been
translated into a spending allocation of 15 percent of the total budget (Table 5).

Health Sector:
5.7

Current situation: The results of the National Health Survey conducted in 2000
(Table 6) shows that substantial progress has been made since 1994. About 78.2
percent of Bhutanese villages have access to health facilities within two hours
walking distance, and about 89 percent have such services within three hours
walking distance. On current trends, Bhutan is likely to reach the MDGs related
to health.

5.8

The rugged terrain and sparse population continue to pose major obstacles to the
delivery of health services. Efficient and effective delivery of these services to
the remotest areas will depend in part on using modern technologies such as
telemedicine and alternative methods.

Objectives: The RGoB seeks to further improve the health status of Bhutan by: a)
improving the quality of health services, b) expanding access to reach the unreached, c) enhancing the sustainability of health services, d) strengthening the
health management information system and research, e) intensifying reproductive
health services and family planning, f) addressing and controlling existing and
emerging health problems, and g) strengthening the traditional medicine system
and integrating it with general health services. The RGoB expects several health
related targets to be met by the end of the Ninth Plan, and seeks to facilitate 100
percent access to clean water and safe sanitation, slow the population growth rate
to 2.3 percent, halve infant mortality per 1000 live births to 30, reduce the under-5
mortality rate per 1000 live births from 84 to 50, and lower the maternal mortality
rate from 2.6 to 1.5.

5.10

Strategies: The major goals of the Health Sector include a) improving the doctor
patient ratio through human resource development, b) monitoring and preventing
STD/HIV/AIDS through information, education and communication programs,
and c) enhancing the financial sustainability of health services, particularly for
ensuring the availability of essential drugs and vaccines.

5.11

Financing: The health sector is budgeted to receive Nu. 6,418 million or about 10
% of the total Ninth Plan outlay (Table 7). Although spending during the first
year of the Ninth Plan has been slower than anticipated, activity will increase in
the coming years.

Agricultural Sector (Renewable Natural Resources):
5.12

Current Situation: The most recent Poverty Assessment Report conducted in 2000
shows that there is a grain deficit in 63 out of 201 Gewogs, such that a substantial
portion of poor household income is spent on buying food grains. This is mainly
due to poor productivity and shortage of cultivable land. Average land holding per
rural household consisting of family of six members was 3.4 acres, and
fragmentation is a major concern. About 79 percent of the population lives in
rural areas and 75 percent of the workforce is engaged in RNR.

5.13

The major challenges for the sector in the Ninth Plan will be to increase
productivity and ensuring equitable distribution of land. The balancing of existing
strong environmental conservation policies with the emerging socio-economic
needs would be an important challenge to be addressed. Shortages of farm labour
due to increasing rural-urban migration is becoming a major problem

5.14

Objectives: The objectives of the agriculture sector set out for the Ninth Plan
are:
• Enhancing rural income;
• Achieving national food security;
• Conserving and managing natural resources; and
• Generating employment opportunities.

5.15

Strategies: The major strategies include a) creation enabling policy and legal
framework; b) farm mechanization and use of appropriate technology; c)
increasing access through creation of new infrastructure; d) diversifications and
encouraging “high value and low volume” products; and e) research and
development.

5.16

Financing: Given that agriculture sector plays a crucial role in rural development,
the Ninth Plan allocates close to 10 percent of the total budget to fund
improvements in the sector.

Road Sector:
5.17

Current Situation: For a landlocked country with no navigable rivers, an efficient
and reliable road network plays an important role in socio-economic development
of a country. The various poverty surveys carried out in the past reveal that those
communities further from the road network are worse off than those near the
roads. In view of its importance, the Royal Government has accorded a high
priority to infrastructure expansion and building, including roads, during the
9FYP. At present, Bhutan is internally connected with a road network of 4020
kilometers 3, including 1,558 kilometers of national highway.

5.18

The fragile terrain, scattered population and strong environmental policy make
development and maintenance of road network a major challenge in Bhutan.

5.19

Objectives: The main objectives of the road sector in the Ninth Plan are:
• Improving accessibility to social and economic activities by building more
roads; and
• Enhancing the existing network with a view to reduce travel time, road user
costs and transportation cost for goods and services.

5.20

Strategy: The major strategies include a) the promotion of private sector
participation, b) the automation of road works, c) the adoption of environmentally
friendly road construction techniques, and d) the construction of 77 kilometers of
national highway, 123 kilometers of feeder roads connecting farms roads to the

3

main road networks, and the replacement and the construction of about eight
bridges.
5.21

Financing: With an allocation of 10 percent of the total outlay, the road sector
will play an important role in improving the socio-economic conditions
particularly of the rural farmers.

Energy Sector:
5.22

Current situation: By the end of the Eighth Plan (2002), the country had
harnessed a total of 444 MW, equivalent to about 1.4 percent of the total
estimated potential of over 30,000 MW. Annual domestic consumption has
grown at an average rate of 9.53 percent in the last five years from about 70 MW
in 1995 to about 90 MW in 2000. Electricity exports to India increased from
1,354 million units in 1997 to 1,495 millions unit in 2000. Its contribution to the
national exchequer was 45 percent of the total revenue generated. The
construction of 1020 MW Tala Hydroelectric project and 38.6 MW Basochhu
Hydroelectric Project (Lower Stage) is under implementation and expected to be
commissioned during the Ninth Plan.

5.23

The main challenge is to continue to harness hydroelectric potential. While
Bhutan has an abundant supply of relatively cheap hydroelectric power, there is
still about 65 percent of the population without electricity. Bringing electricity to
these communities is difficult given the country’s topography and low economies
of scale for extension of the grid to supply scattered settlements.

29/30

5.24

Objectives: The goals of the hydropower sector set out for the Ninth Plan are:
•
•
•

Strengthening the economic self-reliance of the nation by realizing the
electricity generation capacity;
Providing adequate, safe and reliable electricity through sustainable and
environmentally friendly development of hydroelectric potential; and
100 percent rural electrification by 2020.

5.25

Strategies: The energy sector strategies include a) conducting feasibility studies
for micro-hydroelectricity sites where extension of grid supply is not possible, b)
expanding rural electrification programs to improve the quality of life and well
being of the people living in rural areas, c) studying the feasibility of harnessing
2,000 MW of hydroelectric power, and d) implementing two new hydroelectric
power projects namely the 360 MW Mangdechhu Hydroelectric Power Plant and
the 870 MW Punatsangchhu Hydroelectric Power Plan during the Ninth Plan. The
major activities proposed are a) rural electrification targeting 15,000 households,
three-fold increase over the Eighth Plan target of 5,000 household; b) construction
of transmission grid from Tingtibi to Trongsa/Bumthang and Wangdue to
Tsirang/Dagana and to Gelephu; c) preparation of energy and water resource
master plan including feasibility studies of new hydroelectricity projects; and d)
institutional strengthening and capacity building of energy sector.

5.26

Financing: The allocation of the energy sector does not include provision for
mega hydroelectric projects such as the 360 MW Mangdechhu Hydroelectric
Power Plant and the 870 MW Punatsangchhu Hydroelectric Power.

Profiling the Poor

6.1

In order to facilitate focusing of policies and adopting of appropriate strategies in
addressing the poverty, the analyzing of poverty incidences through, such as,
profiling of poor would give a meaningful input. With this objective in mind, the
Royal Government attempted carrying out some poverty studies such as HIES
2000 and PAA 2000.

6.2

While the HIES 2000 findings focused on the household level, the PAA 2000
results dealt with the situation at the block (Gewog) and district (Dzongkhag)
levels. They complement each other. However, as is often the case with any
surveys of this nature, the results should be taken as indicative until they are
confirmed through more systematic surveys.

Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2000 (Pilot)
6.3

While the main objective of the HIES 2000 was to generate information for the
compilation of national accounts for the household sector and the weights to be
used in the consumer price index, the data were also used to make a preliminary
analysis of the poverty situation in Bhutan. The HIES 2000 collected information
on household income, expenditure, demographics and employment. Fieldwork for
the HIES 2000 was conducted in only one round during April – June 2000, which
partly overlapped with the lean months of May, June and July when food grain
deficits are most severe in some parts of the country. As a result, the survey
results may suffer from seasonal bias.

6.4

The information generated from the HIES 2000 show the average monthly per
capita expenditure to be Nu 1,945 in urban areas, Nu 928 in rural areas and Nu
1,075 for the nation. Although Bhutan does not yet have an official national
poverty line, the HIES 2000 defined lower and upper poverty lines. The lower
poverty line is defined based on the expenditure of households whose total
expenditure is adequate to meet the minimum food requirements and is estimated
to be Nu 612.10 per capita per month. It may be viewed as the food poverty line.
The upper poverty line is defined based on the expenditure of households whose
food expenditure is adequate to meet the minimum food requirements and is
estimated to be Nu 748.10 per capita per month. It may be considered as the
income (absolute) poverty line.

6.5

The incidence of poverty was estimated using the two poverty lines (see Table
10). As the data in Table 10 shows, about one in four persons may suffer from
food poverty while more than one in three suffer from income poverty. A poverty
gap measure (the ratio or percentage of the amount required to bring the
expenditures of the poor to the poverty line, relative to the total expenditures of
the poor at the poverty line) is used to measure the intensity of poverty. The

31/32

poverty gap is estimated to be 6.6% using the food poverty line and 11.1% based
on the income poverty line.

Bhutan Poverty Assessment and Analysis (Pilot)
6.6

The main objective of the PAA 2000 was to assess the impact of Government
policies and programs in improving the quality of life of the people. It was an
attempt to construct a qualitative and quantitative database on selected living
standard indicators covering both income and non-income dimensions at the
Gewog (block) and Dzongkhag (district) levels. Ten living standard aspects were
covered: household income, education, health, economic activities, non-material
needs, physical facilities, environment, transport, communication and position of
women. It was a nationwide survey covering all 201 Gewogs and 22 townships.
The information was collected through questionnaire completed by the 20
Dzongdags (District Administrators) drawing upon existing information on
facilities in the Dzongkhags and their perceptions on the living standards in their
respective townships and Gewogs.

6.7

The results of the PAA 2000 indicated the priority needs of all Dzongkhags in
descending order as follows: education, economic activities, household income,
health, communication, physical facilities, transport, environment, women’s
position and non-material needs. It is important to keep in mind that the ranking
of priority needs is relative within the ten indicators. For example, the nonmaterial needs and health are better served than those in education. Also, there are
significant differences in the priority needs between Dzongkhags. For example,
Pemagatshel and Samdrup Jongkhar districts (located in east southern) ranked
transport and communication as the highest priorities (ranks 1 and 2) while
Thimphu and Paro (located in western) ranked them at the lower end (ranks 8 and
9). Based on the PAA 2000 results, the Dzongkhags were ranked on the ten quality

32/33

of life indicators and composite indices of these. The results show that the
Dzongkhag of Gasa (west northern) was most vulnerable overall (at the bottom or
1 among the 20 Dzongkhags), followed by Pemagatshel (2), Lhuentse (located in
the east) (3), Zhemgang (located in the central south) (4), with Trongsa (located in
the Central) and Samdrup Jongkhar alternating in fifth and sixth places (see Table
11).

6.8

The PAA 2000 also ranked the 50 vulnerable Gewogs, accounting for about 20%
of the total number of households, from most vulnerable to least vulnerable. The
results show that some of the most vulnerable Gewogs were to be found in some
of the relatively well off Dzongkhags. For example, the second and third (or
fourth) most vulnerable Gewogs of Naro and Soe were in Thimphu, which was
the top ranked Dzongkhag. About 28 Gewogs comprising about 10% of the total
number of households were ranked to be the most vulnerable. The study also tried
to ascertain the geographic concentrations of the poor. About 75% of the
households of the poorest (most vulnerable) Gewogs were to be found in
Pemagatshel, Zhemgang, Mongar and Trashigang and Samdrup Jongkhar
Dzongkhags.

6.9

Further, 63 of the 201 Gewogs and 22 townships report food insecurity; 65% of
the Gewogs have no access to electricity; one-third of the Gewogs are not
connected to feeder roads; and 45 Gewogs are below the national average for
primary enrolment rate of 72%. Two Dzongkhags account for the lowest level of
modern sector economic activities.

33/34

Who are the poor
6.10

The HIES 2000 generated information that helped to identify the poor. A large
majority of the poor were employed in occupations that did not generate adequate
income to fulfill their basic needs. Thus, the poor were engaged in subsistence
production in farming and animal husbandry, petty trading, day labour and other
vocations. Some of them were engaged in more than one occupation/job that did
not generate adequate income to bring them over the poverty threshold. A small
minority of the poor may be unemployed or cannot work due to age (very young
and very old), disability or other constraints. The poor were more likely to be
rural residents; many of them located in remote areas.

6.11

The characteristics of poor households are summarized in the following:

Rural areas:
•
•
•
•
•

Subsistence farmers relying largely on crops,
Larger families with a higher proportion of children and older people who cannot
work (high dependency ratio),
No or very few livestock,
No or very little off-farm income including remittances, and
Limited schooling.

Urban areas:
•
•
•
•

Migrant household, living in hutments or shanties,
Larger families with a higher proportion of children and older people who cannot
work (high dependency ratio),
Petty trader,
Casual or day labourer.

Where are they located
6.12

About 79% of the population is located in rural areas and the bulk of them depend
on agriculture, including livestock and forestry, for their livelihood. The incidence
of poverty in rural areas is more than five times than in urban areas – 41.3% vs.
6.4% (see Table 9). Extrapolation of the results from the HIES 2000 show that a
large majority of the Bhutanese poor (about 96%) live in rural areas. Thus, it may
be fair to conclude that poverty in Bhutan is essentially a rural phenomenon. At
the same time, the transmission of poverty in rural areas to urban centres through
rural-urban migration is recognized. Spatially, the PAA 2000 findings show that
the poor seem to be concentrated in the most vulnerable Gewogs spread all over
the country.

34/35

Inequality and Poverty
6.13

Data on inequality in expenditure distribution are presented in the HIES 2000.
The Gini coefficient measuring the inequality in distribution of expenditure was
estimated to be 0.36 for the nation.4 The inequality is higher in urban areas (Gini
ratio of about 0.36 to 0.42) as compared to that in rural areas (about 0.35). This is
considered moderate by both regional and global standards.

6.14

Factors contributing to the inequality in expenditure (income) in the rural areas
include unequal ownership of or access to productive assets including land,
irrigation, livestock, improved technology, human skills, and transfer payments
(including remittances). Many of these factors are heavily influenced by the
access to roads and transport, markets, communications and technology. In urban
areas, the factors include unequal ownership of land and housing, economic
enterprises and skills.

Gender and Poverty
6.15

There are no significant differences between women and men in the incidence of
poverty. The ranking of Dzongkhags on their vulnerabilities on the position of
women is largely the same as that on other dimensions, whilst some differences
are evident. The exceptions are the rankings on the position of women for
Trashiyangtse (rank 3 from the bottom), Trashigang (5) and Wangdue Phodrang
(6), which are generally lower than their overall rankings on other dimensions,
whereas that for Lhuentse (10) is significantly higher (PAA 2000).

Causes of poverty
6.16

The more apparent causes of poverty include the following:

• Remote location and difficult terrain that make access to outside world difficult.
Lack of roads and transport networks, electricity and communications aggravate the
situation. People in many poor communities may have to walk for 3 hours to a few
days to reach the nearest highway;
• Limited ownership or access to productive assets including land. According to the
1988 National Agronomic Survey, 9% of the farm households in the country owned
less than half a hectare, 27% less than one hectare and 58% less than two hectares
of land. Thus, many poor households may not own adequate land and/or a
significant number of livestock;
• Lack of remunerative employment. Many poor households in rural and semi-urban
areas have very few opportunities for off-farm employment;
• Large families and rapid population growth. For example, in rural areas where
poverty is more severe, almost half (49%) the households had an average of six or

4

The inequality in income distribution is often larger than that in the distribution of expenditure.

more members (HIES 2000). The rate of growth of the population was estimated to
be about 3.1% in 1994 and it was projected to have declined to 2.5% in 2000;5
Lack of productive skills. According to the HIES 2000, the adult literacy rate in
rural areas, where the majority of poor are located, was 41.5% as compared to
75.9% in urban areas;
Shortage of labour in some rural households due to migration of youth and working
adults to urban centers leaving behind the very young and the very old;
Lack of or limited access to social and economic services (including credit). A
sizeable proportion of the rural communities lack easy access to schools and
markets. In some communities, students have to walk for two to three hours each
way to reach the nearest primary school;
Natural calamities including floods, hailstorms, landslides, fires and wild animals;
Social breakdown, including breakdown of marriage, family and social support
systems;
Increases in prices of basic goods and services; and
Illnesses including diseases like Malaria, TB, and other ailments and deaths.

6.17

Some of the causes may be accentuated by poverty thereby creating a vicious
circle. The symptoms of poverty include inability to own a decent house,
vulnerability to food shortages, and lack of sufficient funds to send children to
school.

7.

Poverty Reduction Challenges and Strategies

7.1

The challenges for poverty reduction include the lack of or limited opportunities
to increase incomes, limited access to basic services like marketing, vulnerability
to natural and man-made shocks including food insecurity, limited access to
information and civic education, and lack of well defined poverty indicators and
monitoring mechanisms.

7.2

The development plans and strategies in Bhutan have always recognized the need
to address the needs of the poor and other vulnerable groups. The development
philosophy of enhancing Gross National Happiness provides a sound overall
framework for poverty reduction. Given that poverty in Bhutan is predominantly a
rural phenomenon, comprehensive rural development programs supported by
adequate infrastructure (including social infrastructure), private sector-led income
and employment generation and good governance will remain integral parts of the
overall strategy for reducing poverty in the Ninth Plan. The Government
visualizes sustainable poverty reduction to be achieved through rapid and
equitable economic growth with balanced regional development. Macroeconomic
management including the pattern of public expenditures will continue with a
clear pro-poor orientation. Many essential elements of poverty reduction are

population growth rate seemed to have moderated to 2.5% by 2001.

36/37

incorporated in the sector strategies. An attempt is made in the following to link
the various sector strategy elements to tackling the poverty reduction challenges.
Opportunities to Increase Incomes
Challenges
7.3

The challenges include increasing the incomes of the people in general and the
poor in particular, through remunerative jobs and sustainable livelihoods. As a
large majority of the poor live in rural areas and most of them depend on
agriculture, improving their productivity will be an important means to increasing
their incomes. However, they face several constraints, including (i) small size of
land holding and few livestock per household, (ii) lack of irrigation, (iii) limited
or lack of access to modern technologies and inputs, (iv) lack of or limited offfarm employment opportunities, and (v) limited access to markets and high
transport costs.

7.4

The extension of irrigation requires substantial investments as well as new skills
to practice irrigated agriculture. Also, the small size of holdings makes the
feasibility of mechanization difficult. The lack of adequate farm and feeder roads
contribute to the limited access to modern technologies and inputs as well as
markets. In fact, inadequate physical access is perhaps the single most important
challenge facing the poor in many Gewogs with concentrations of the poor. This
is also a serious impediment to not only increasing productivity in agriculture but
also the development of off-farm enterprises and jobs. Thus, a number of off-farm
enterprises and employment creation initiatives promoted by the Government in
cooperation with civil society organizations have not generated the expected
benefits due to the high costs of production and marketing resulting from poor
physical access.

Strategies
7.5

Some of the salient strategies and interventions proposed under the Ninth Plan
include the following:
•

•

Considering that a large majority of the poor are dependent on agriculture, the
sector strategy focuses on improving productivity through land reforms,
introduction and adoption of modern farming and animal husbandry practices,
expansion of irrigation, facilitating diversification into high value, low-bulk crops
and products, increasing access to credit, promotion of cooperatives, constructing
and improving farm and feeder roads and market infrastructure, enhancing the
flow of information and communications, promoting sound and sustainable
management of the natural resources, and providing an enabling policy and legal
framework;
Promotion of off-farm enterprises and opportunities to reduce the pressure on the
limited arable land and generate employment and sustainable livelihoods in the

37/38

•

•

•

rural areas through access to training, technical assistance, productivity enhancing
technologies, credit, and markets for inputs supply and sale of outputs, which
again hinge critically on easy physical (road) access and rural electrification;
Creating an enabling environment for the private sector including more
transparent industrial and investment policies and supporting laws, as well as
development of industrial estates and service centers. In the medium and longterm, private sector is expected to be the engine of economic growth and
employment generation to cater to the burgeoning labour force including the
youth. Improvements in infrastructure including roads and transport, electricity
and communications are equally important for encouraging private investments,
enhancing the competitiveness of Bhutanese products in regional and global
markets, and creating remunerative jobs;
Enhancing the skills of the workforce including the youth through technical and
vocational training, in partnership with potential employers, as well as adjusting
the school curricula to impart more life skills for the graduates to be entrepreneurs
in different sectors; and
Improvements in and expansion of infrastructure including roads (in particular,
construction of more than 500 kms of new farm roads, 123 kms of feeder roads
and completion of 46 kms of feeder roads), electricity including rural
electrification, and communications including telecommunications, radio and
television services, especially to the hitherto un-served and underserved areas,
which are critical for encouraging private entrepreneurship and investments, and
promoting equity and balanced regional development.

Access to Basic Social Services
Challenges
7.6

The access to health services and education, especially in rural areas, improved
considerably during the past 15 years. Thus, the coverage of immunization of
children has reached above 90%. In general, access to health services improved
more rapidly. Notwithstanding, trained health personnel attended less than one-infour births. Low birth weight continues to be a problem in about one-in-four
newborns. Access to hospitals continues to be difficult in some Dzongkhags that
lack adequate road and transport infrastructure.

7.7

While access to primary schooling has also increased, with the primary gross
enrolment rate exceeding 81% in 2003, the net enrolment rate is lower and there
is still considerable room for improvement. Some children may still need to walk
between two to three hours each way to the nearest school, often through rugged
terrain including forests. As a result, parents tend to defer enrolment of youngsters
at the primary entry age of 6 years and do so at 7, 8 or 9 years after the children
have gained adequate physical stamina to keep up with the long and arduous daily
commute. Again, physical access (feeder roads and tracks) seems to be the main
constraint. Further, many poor families cannot afford the costs of school
uniforms, supplies and transport costs.

38/39

7.8

Access to safe water has increased considerably over the years, with about 78% of
the population having safe drinking water close to their communities. In the
remaining communities, women and children have to walk long distances to fetch
water from streams and springs. The coverage of basic latrines or sanitation
facilities is much higher at about 88% of the total population. Most urban poor
seem to be found in hutments in informal settlements or squatter areas. Access to
basic services (e.g. water and sanitation) for many of these households is difficult.
As in the generation of opportunities for increased income, the efficient delivery
of basic social services to the hitherto unreached and underserved depend
critically on significant improvements in road and transport networks, rural
electrification and communications.

Vulnerability Including Food Insecurity
Challenges
7.9

Vulnerability may be due to unforeseen calamities including diseases/illnesses,
death, floods, landslides, hailstorms, fires and droughts. One of the major risks
faced by a significant proportion of Bhutanese families relates to seasonal
shortages of food or food insecurity. Thus, according to a Food Security Survey,
about 39% of households in Pemagatshel District suffered chronic food
insecurity, while the proportion was 19% in Lhuentse district.6 Results from the
1999 Nutrition Survey indicate that on average, children from some pockets of
Eastern Bhutan were nutritionally worse off than those from other regions.

7.10

Food insecurity results from low land holdings, low productivity, localized
disasters such as hailstorms, strong winds, fungal diseases, damage by wild
animals including mammalian pests and birds. Usually, food grain deficits are
seasonal (mainly from May to July) with a significant number of households in
the community facing the same burden. To make matters worse, the food deficit
months coincide with the periods of intensive agricultural operations including
tilling and planting when the food needs of the workers are higher than normal.
The effect on children is partly alleviated through school feeding projects
supported by the World Food Programme.

Strategies

6

•

The close kinship and traditional social support systems based on Buddhism,
which emphasizes the interdependence of all members of society while promoting
individual development, have helped families and communities to cope with
vulnerabilities.

•

Food insecurity is largely related to deficits in rice and edible oils and fats. It has
been identified as one of the major problems facing a significant proportion of the

Cited in UNICEF Bhutan, A Situation Analysis of Children and Women in Bhutan, 2000,Thimphu.

39/40

people. The country is self sufficient in rice to the tune of 60% of its
requirements. Those with adequate incomes (e.g. from sale of cash crops, wage
labour and remittances) fill their food deficits through purchases from the Bhutan
Food Corporation. The poor and low-income households cope with rice/food
shortages through a shift to other cereals like maize, roots and forest products,
and/or a reduction in consumption. The national policy objective is to attain food
security through a two-pronged strategy: (i) increase production of cereals to
achieve at least 70% self-sufficiency, (ii) promote expansion of agricultural
production including cash crops for export to finance the additional food imports.
Self-reliance is the ultimate goal.

8.

Poverty Monitoring and Assessment

8.1

Poverty monitoring and assessment at present is carried out by a range of actors at
different administrative levels using different systems and on an ad hoc basis.
This has created problems of coordination, systematic use of data and impact
assessment. The government recognizes the need to streamline the system and to
institutionalize Poverty Monitoring and Assessment System (PMAS) and has
identified the Department of Planning as the focal agency responsible for poverty
monitoring and assessment. The proposed PMAS will be integrated and built-in
within the overall Planning and Information Network (PIN) system being
developed in the Department of Planning.
Box 2: List of Surveys Completed

The National Labour Force Survey (NLFS) 1998 & 1999, 2001, 2003 & 2004 and which provides
data on unemployment, underemployment and participation rates;
The National Nutrition Survey (NNS) 1999, which collected anthropometrics data, used to
calculate malnutrition levels;
The National Health Survey (NHS) 2000, which provides data on health;
The Renewable Natural Resources Census (RNRC) 2000, which provides data on landholdings
and rural assets;
The Pilot Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) 2000 which contained detailed
income and consumption modules allowed for the determination of poverty correlates, including
dependency ratios, employment patterns, and educational achievements;
The Poverty Assessment and Analysis Report (PAAR) 2000 which presented community level
data on a number of dimensions of well-being including education, health, environment,
communications etc.;
The Bhutan Urban Poverty Study (BUPS) 2001, which presents information on urban poverty in
Thimphu and Phuentsholing (yet to be endorsed by the government).
The Bhutan Living Standards Survey (BLSS) 2003 completed recently and expected to provide
information on health and education as well as a detailed consumption module which will
facilitate the determination of poverty and inequality indicators and poverty proxies.

8.2

The core problem is not a lack of data (though there are existing data gaps) as it is
a lack of coordination of the many data collection exercises undertaken. Three
types of coordination failure have been identified:

40/41

•

Lack of Coordination of Surveys and Censuses: There is no national
statistics plan which identifies and sequences the major surveys to be
conducted over the medium term. Most recent household surveys have been
ad hoc and dependent on the availability of donor financing. As a result,
sequencing has been less than optimal. For example, in 2000 alone
approximately four significant surveys were conducted (see Box 2).
Moreover, the Bhutan Living Standards Survey was conducted in 2003, prior
to a proposed population census (it would obviously be preferable to reverse
this order of events). A national statistical plan which identifies and sequences
surveys would be one way of addressing these problems.

•

Lack of Coordination between M&E Systems across Ministries: A number
of line Ministries have established, or are in the process of establishing, M&E
systems. Good examples include the M&E framework for the RNR sector as
well as the Health Sector Management Information System. While there are
obvious sector-specific issues to address, it would be optimal for national
planning and monitoring purposes to standardize a number of categories of
indicators across sectors (e.g., using an input/output/outcome schema). This
would facilitate more direct performance monitoring across ministries and
direct incorporation of line ministry data into a 'poverty program' monitoring
database. However, the DoP is working on a national level Monitoring and
Evaluation System that will also have a link with the M&E systems developed
in various government agencies.

•

Lack of Coordination of Reporting Frameworks at Dzongkhag Level: At
the Dzongkhag level, there is a bewildering array of reporting frameworks
used by different agencies. Different reporting formats are required for
individual donor agencies, line Ministries, the Ministry of Finance and the
Department of Planning. The result is reporting fatigue whereby valuable
resources are devoted to completing forms rather than to operational activities.
It would be optimal to agree upon a standardized reporting framework for
completion at the Dzongkhag level which contains the requisite data to satisfy
all the requirement of the different actors. However, the proposed M&E
system in DoP is expected to address this problem once it is completed.

•

Lack of Systematic Use: There appears to be a lack of systematic use of
monitoring-related data for policy purposes. Monitoring data on outputs or
outcomes does not appear to influence budgetary allocations from year to
year, which depend mainly on the ability to implement (i.e. to disburse
committed funds). In the context of decentralized planning, it will be even
more critical to put in place systems whereby resource allocation decisions
reflect plan objectives as well as systematic assessment of program
performance. These considerations suggest an extremely important role for the
communication/advocacy component of the system as well as an appropriate

41/42

institutional framework which ensure that information reaches policy makers,
planners and implementers.
•

Lack of Impact Assessment: Impact assessment differs from standard project
monitoring and evaluation in that it is concerned with outcome or impacts
which it attempts to link to program outputs. In this sense of the term, there
does not appear to be any systematic process of impact assessment of
programs or policies. However, the DoP has initiated the process and has
already done an impact assessment of rural roads on rural poverty on a pilot
basis in 2003. The process will continue on a regular basis for selective
development programmes.

Proposed Poverty Monitoring and Assessment System (PMAS)
8.3

With a primary objective to coordinate, consolidate and harmonize data from
existing poverty monitoring systems to produce concrete, timely and useful
information and analysis for decision-makers, and to communicate results in ways
which feedback into the policy process, the DoP proposes to set up a Poverty
Monitoring and Assessment System (PMAS) within the department. However,
for the time being, the system will be built within the Planning Information
Network (PIN) system that is being established in the DoP.

Principles of PMAS:
8.4

National Ownership/Appropriation: System of poverty monitoring and analysis
do not work in the absence of 'buy-in' from data users within and outside
government. The process of data collection, analysis and use is likely to be as, or
more, important than the physical outputs generated (indicators, data, etc.). This
calls for concerted attempts to actively involve stakeholders in processes of data
collection, analysis, dissemination and review. Therefore, the PMAS is proposed
to be institutionalized within national structures to ensure its appropriation and
usefulness. .

8.5

Participation: There are a number of reasons why widespread participation of a
range of stakeholders in the operation of the PMAS is likely to be instrumental to
its success. Specifically:
•
•
•
•

it builds and strengthens capacities for analysis, discussion, and linking data
generation to
analysis and policy formulation, policy outcome monitoring and evaluation;
it allows for genuine monitoring of development policies, strategies and
programs on the basis of views of people affected by them;
Above all, genuine participation helps build broad-based national ownership,
a key ingredient in sustainable poverty eradication and human development
strategies.

42/43

8.6

Harmonization/Consolidation: As discussed, there is a significant amount of
data on poverty in Bhutan as well as a wide range of policies and programs whose
central objective is to reduce it. A core function of the unit will be to synthesis
existing studies on poverty and store/consolidate the many types of data which
bear on it. This provides the rationale for developing poverty-related databases
linked to the Planning Information Network (PIN) system. Part of the work of the
unit will consist of coordinating and harmonizing the many different systems of
relevance to poverty monitoring in the country.

8.7

Collaborative Engagement: The PMAS will seek to form partnerships with
persons and organizations engaged in poverty monitoring or other analytical work
related to poverty. This pertains to governmental agencies, civil society
organization and the international community. A major rationale of this policy
framework document is to provide a mechanism to build partnerships with a view
to improve coordination in poverty monitoring.

8.8

The PMAS has five key components:
•
•
•
•
•

Component I - Poverty, Vulnerability and Inequality (PVI) outcome
monitoring;
Component II - Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) implementation
monitoring;
Component III - Impact Assessment and Policy Analysis;
Component IV - Poverty Information Management;
Component V - Communication/Dissemination.

Component I – Poverty, Vulnerability and Inequality (PVI) Outcome Monitoring
8.9

An important element of the Poverty Monitoring System is a comprehensive set
of national poverty indicators. This component will comprise systems to track
changes in poverty and well being at the outcome level. To this end, the DoP is in
the process of finalizing a list of PVI indicators which is attached as Table 12.
This list of indicators, which was prepared in consultation with concerned sectors
and Dzongkhags in national workshops, will be reviewed periodically and revise,
if necessary, with change in situation and requirement. Further, the first Bhutan
Living Standards Survey (BLSS) 2003 has been recently completed which is an
integrated household survey and complements the Participatory Poverty
Assessment (PPA) conducted in 2000 on the population’s perceptions of poverty
and well-being and falls within component I.

8.10

The PRS Implementation Monitoring system will track inputs and outputs of
poverty reduction programs and thus draw heavily on routine administrative
monitoring data. To facilitate this, efforts will be made to harmonize the existing
monitoring and evaluation systems including those already developed in other line
ministries.

Component III – Poverty Impact Assessment & Policy Analysis
8.11

Impact assessments establish a link between the outcomes/impacts analyzed in the
PVI Monitoring System and the programs in the PRS Implementation Monitoring
System. As a beginning of the process, a pilot Policy Impact Analysis of rural
roads on rural poverty by the Department of Planning, using qualitative rapid
assessment methods, has already been conducted in 2003.

Component IV - Poverty Management Information System
8.12

This component consists of the IT-backbone of the Poverty Monitoring System,
which will be, used a tool for PMAS. The system will be built within the overall
system of PIN system which is tailor-made to meet the specific needs of key
decision-makers at central and local levels in Bhutan

Component V - Communication/Advocacy
8.13

The proposed communication/advocacy function of the PMS entails the
dissemination of poverty-related information through some means of advocacy
like National Poverty Profile Report, workshops, seminars, etc.

Looking ahead
8.14

The strengthening of the poverty monitoring and assessment system is a longterm process but is central to the effective implementation of poverty reducing
programs.

8.15

The improvements of statistical capacity in the years ahead will provide a sound
underpinning for future PRSP activities.

Consultative Process

Ninth Plan
9.1

The preparation for the Ninth Plan started with a brainstorming session in August
2000 with participants from the sectoral ministries, Dzongkhag, Planning
Commission and the Core Group.

9.2

This was followed by visits to the Dzongkhag by officials from the then Planning
Commission Secretariat and the Core Group to discuss and explain the main
elements of the Ninth Plan.

9.3

Based on the feedback from the mid-term review of the Eighth Plan, the
brainstorming session and the visits to the Dzongkhag, the then Planning
Commission Secretariat issued the guidelines for the preparation of the Ninth Plan
in early 2001. These guidelines provided the broad national policy aims and
objectives and set the general direction for the Ninth Plan based on which the
sectors, Dzongkhags and the Gewogs formulated their plans. It provided clear
definition and guidance on what constitutes a central plan, Dzongkhag plan and
Gewog plans.

9.4

The Dzongkhag and Gewog plans were prepared after detailed discussion in the
DYTs and GYTs. The DYT/GYT comprises of elected representatives of people
from the Gewogs, National Assembly members representing the Dzongkhag and a
member from each municipality in that Dzongkhag. The priorities and the needs
are decided by DYT and GYT for Dzongkhag and Gewogs plans, respectively.
The central agencies and the sectoral representatives in the Dzongkhags provided
technical support and guidance to the DYT/GYT while formulating their plans.

9.5

The draft plans from the sectoral agencies, Dzongkhags and Gewogs were
forwarded to the Planning Commission for review in terms of resource
availability, the national aims and objectives, and the implementing capacity.
While the Gewog plans were kept unchanged, the sectoral and Dzongkhag plans
were sent back to the respective Dzongkhags and sectors for reprioritization and
adjustments. The reprioritization exercise involved a series of consultations
between the Dzongkhags and the DYT/people, the sectoral ministries, and the
Planning Commission.

9.6

The final plans were endorsed by the Cabinet and approved by the National
Assembly.

55/56

PRSP Process
9.7

Since the preparation of the Ninth Plan involved an extensive consultative process
with all the stakeholders, including the donor agencies during the 7th and 8th
Round Table Meetings held in November 2000 in Thimphu and February 2003 in
Geneva, respectively, the PRSP process will not be based on a separate
consultation process of a similar extent.

9.8

The main agencies involved in the PRSP preparation include the then Planning
Commission Secretariat (focal agency), Ministry of Finance and the key sectoral
ministries. The Planning Commission Secretariat focused on the overall
coordination and the crosscutting issues, Ministry of Finance was involved in the
Medium Term Expenditure Framework and the sectors provided inputs on the
sectoral strategies.
