Executive Summary
A mild cyclical recovery is underway, but medium-term prospects are troubling. Potential
growth is estimated at just 1¼ percent annually, amid a steady deterioration in external
competitiveness. The fiscal deficit exceeded 4 percent of GDP in 2005 and the public debt
ratio—already among the highest in the world—is on the rise again. Significant expenditurebased fiscal adjustment and broad-based structural reforms to eliminate rigidities that raise
domestic costs and discourage innovation and entry are essential to ensure the sustainability
of the fiscal accounts and enhance competitiveness and potential growth.
A cyclical recovery is expected to continue in 2006. Owing to the recession at the turn of
2004, growth is estimated to have been just above zero in 2005, but a consolidation of
current trends is projected to result in growth of about 1½ percent in 2006. Sluggish demand
should keep inflationary pressures in check.
The authorities will need to ensure Italy lives up to its commitment under the Excessive
Deficit Procedure (EDP) to achieve a deficit of 3.8 percent of GDP in 2006. The authorities
have introduced a number of measures that they believe are sufficient to ensure an
appreciable overperformance. However, there is a significant risk that the envisaged deep
expenditure cuts will be difficult to sustain, and the staff’s central projection envisages some
slippage from the EDP target.
A more ambitious medium-term path of fiscal adjustment is critical for debt sustainability.
Staff simulations show that reducing non-age related spending to a level consistent with
achieving overall budgetary balance by 2010 is necessary for stable debt dynamics. Realizing
the required spending cuts—about ¾ percentage point of GDP annually in structural terms—
will demand targeted expenditure reduction within a medium-term budget framework.
A bold structural reform agenda to create a more competitive Italy is paramount to
boosting long-term performance. A number of recently-approved reforms—including to the
codes for bankruptcy and civil procedures and a “savings law” that enhances corporate
governance, disclosure and coordination among regulators—have set the stage for further
progress. Next steps should include measures to promote competition in product, service and
labor markets, including through deregulation, liberalization, and an improved business
environment.
The Financial Sector Assessment Program found that Italy’s financial system is generally
sound. The banking sector has proven resilient to slow growth, and stress tests revealed little
vulnerability going forward. However, the FSAP identified issues related to loan
classification standards and regulation of lending to related parties, and to relatively high
operating costs. The mission also raised concerns about the Bank of Italy’s governance
structure and about potential conflicts of interest arising from the Bank’s joint mandates for
banking sector stability and competition, but these have substantially been addressed by
amendments to the savings law approved in late-December.

I. OVERVIEW AND KEY ISSUES
1.
Italy’s medium-term prospects remain
shackled by slow output and productivity growth,
along with high debt and deficits. Potential growth
is estimated at only 1¼ percent annually, amid a
steady deterioration in productivity and external
competitiveness. The fiscal deficit exceeded 4
percent of GDP in 2005 and the public debt-to-GDP
ratio—still among the highest in the world even after
a decade of declines—is on the rise again, falling
prey to high deficits and slow growth.

2.
Solving Italy’s economic problems will
demand determined policy implementation over a
number of years. With the primary surplus having
fallen steadily since the late 1990s, significant fiscal
consolidation will now be needed to ensure
sustainability of the public debt, and the restoration
of external competitiveness will also likely be a
lengthy process. While the staff’s message about the
essential need for fiscal consolidation and broadbased structural reform is not new, the critical nature
of these policies is accentuated by the heightened
fiscal and competitiveness concerns (Box 1).

Box 1. Implementation of Fund Policy Advice
Fiscal consolidation: Fund calls for significant fiscal consolidation have generally not
been heeded. Between 2000 and 2003, the structural primary surplus net of one-off
measures fell by about 2½ percent of GDP, with only a small part of this deterioration
recovered in 2004–05.
Pension reform: The need for reforms to address the looming fiscal impact of
population aging has been a long-standing theme of Article IV consultations. Important
reforms have been implemented, most recently in August 2004, when Parliament
approved the “framework law” on pension reform. The Fund had supported the reform,
which is expected to have a significant impact on pension expenditure from 2008
onwards. A measure establishing a second pillar pension scheme for private sector
workers was approved in November 2005, but its implementation has been delayed
until 2008. The Fund has supported measures to promote private savings in the past.
Competition, product market reform, and the business environment: Successive
Article IV consultations have repeatedly stressed the need for reforms in these areas. A
“competitiveness decree” approved by Parliament in 2005 offers some enhancements
along the encouraged lines, but progress has generally been slow. A long-pending
reform of the bankruptcy law was approved by Parliament in December 2005, along
with a reform of civil procedures.
Labor market reforms: Cross-country indicators of employment protection have
registered marked improvement in recent years, as has labor market performance more
broadly. In June 2003, the government approved a draft decree enacting the first part of
a framework law on employment and the labor market, which the Fund had supported.
The Fund has called for timely implementation of the second half of the law, but this
remains to go forward.
Corporate governance: Legislation that would strengthen corporate governance, the
marketing and issuance of corporate bonds, and coordination among regulatory
agencies—all of which have been supported by the Fund in previous consultations—
was passed by Parliament in December 2005.

II. BACKGROUND
3.
Despite the somber medium-term outlook,
short-term prospects have brightened modestly,
though uncertainties remain. A strong and broadlybased rebound in 2005:Q2 (quarterly growth of 0.7
percent, seasonally-adjusted) had raised hopes that,
following the technical recession at the turn of 2004–
05, the long-awaited cyclical recovery was
underway. A weaker-than-expected third quarter (0.3
percent, seasonally-adjusted), however, raised
questions about the strength and durability of the
recovery going forward. Nevertheless, the
composition of demand—with consumption and
exports performing relatively well, and most of the
slowdown arising from a run-down of inventories—
was more positive than the headline number.1
4.
Inflation has typically exceeded that of the
euro area. Sluggish domestic demand has helped
contain inflationary pressures arising from high
international oil prices, and core inflation has
dropped below 2 percent, though it has consistently
exceeded the euro-area average. The depreciating
euro has led to some relaxation of monetary
conditions since mid-year, although they remain very
tight relative to the average since monetary union.

The authorities have committed to reduce
the fiscal deficit to below 3 percent of GDP by
2007 under the Excessive Deficit Procedure
(EDP). A combination of weaker-than-forecasted
growth, disappointing asset sales, and Eurostatmandated reclassifications put the original 2005
target of a 2.7 percent of GDP deficit out of reach.2 A
revised deficit target of 4.3 percent of GDP was

The significant volatility of recent quarterly GDP data was difficult to explain, but the
greater stability of 12-month growth rates led the authorities to suspect that it could in part be
arising from problems with seasonal adjustment, particularly for exports.

The reclassification of items also affected the deficits in earlier years: according to the
revised accounts, the deficit exceeded the 3 percent of GDP ceiling in 2001, 2003 and 2004.

agreed under the EDP, but the achievement of even
this less ambitious objective had proven challenging.
Reflecting the high deficit and sizable shortfall in
privatization receipts, the debt ratio increased in
2005, to over 108 percent of GDP. The deterioration
in fiscal prospects led some agencies to downgrade
the outlook for Italy’s sovereign debt rating.3 Spreads
relative to German benchmarks have doubled since
Fall 2004, but remain very small in absolute terms.

6.
Rigidities and inefficiencies throughout the
economic structure are at the heart of Italy’s
difficulties. Despite some progress in recent years, measured product market regulation in
Italy remains the strongest in the EU-15, distorting incentives and discouraging market entry
and innovation (Figure 1). These rigidities have inhibited adjustment to the structural shifts
that Italy has confronted due to increased competition from emerging market exports,
perpetuating an economic structure dominated by a large number of small firms employing
relatively low-tech, low value-added production techniques. Knowledge creation and
dissemination (as measured for example by the European Commission’s Summary
Innovation Index) and private R&D investment are among the lowest in the EU-15, and rates
of firm creation and destruction do not suggest an extensive transformation of the economy is
underway.
7.
The advent of the common currency has brought these structural rigidities into
sharper relief. Normal adjustment mechanisms under monetary union have thus far failed to
lead to an improvement in Italy’s growth performance. In fact, since 2001 the external sector
has sapped a cumulative 2 percentage points from output growth even as domestic demand
weakened and foreign demand expanded sizably (Figure 2). The textbook gain in external
competitiveness that should have resulted from Italy’s relatively weak cyclical position has
not materialized, and the loss in market share since the start of monetary union has persisted.
The widening output gap—estimated by the staff at 2½ percent of GDP in 2005—has failed
to exercise the necessary dampening effect on prices. In addition, although wage growth has
slowed, it has significantly exceeded growth of labor productivity, which actually fell over
2001–04. Real unit labor cost growth has been markedly greater than that of France and
especially Germany: since 1998 Italy’s ULC-based REER has appreciated by a cumulative
18 percent, compared to depreciations in Germany and France. Consistent with the divergent
experiences of the three largest euro area economies, staff analysis finds that slow
productivity growth and domestic rigidities—and not euro strength—were the predominant

Both Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings revised Italy’s credit rating outlook from
“stable” to “negative” in the summer of 2005.

factors accounting for Italy’s loss of competitiveness.4 The fact that employment growth has
been concentrated in sectors less exposed to external competition provides further evidence
of competitive weaknesses.
III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
8.
Discussions were marked by general agreement on the main requirements to
raise potential growth, but emphases differed on the proximate causes of Italy’s
problems, and a broad reform consensus has yet to emerge. Staff and the authorities
concurred on the need for durable expenditure-based fiscal adjustment and structural reforms
in product, services, and labor markets. At the same time, however, there exists a widespread
tendency to attribute Italy’s problems to outside forces, be they euro strength or the pressures
of globalization, or to an historical legacy, such as the small, family-owned firm structure
and the traditional product specialization of Italian exports (centered on low-tech, low-value
added sectors), along with a geographical orientation of exports toward slower-growing
regions of the world. While staff did not dispute the importance of these factors, it stressed
that Italy’s economic problems were fundamentally homegrown, the consequence of
rigidities and inefficiencies whose resolution demanded an integrated package of liberalizing
reforms. The electoral calendar provided an opportunity to focus the national debate on the
medium-term policies required to secure a more competitive Italy and, in meetings with the
authorities and the economic representatives of the opposition, staff encouraged the main
political coalitions to spell out the details of their economic programs. Some greater
definition of electoral commitments has since emerged, but both coalitions are deeply
fractured on key reform aspects, and may therefore be ill-equipped to overcome vested
interests opposed to change.
A. Economic Outlook: A Timid Recovery Among Risks
9.
A mild cyclical recovery appears at hand. The strength—and breadth across
demand components—of the 2005:Q2 outturn had surprised most analysts, and was taken as
evidence that cyclical conditions had turned the corner after four years of disappointing
economic performance. At the time of the mission, most forecasters were therefore
projecting annual output growth of about ¼ percent for 2005, although the weaker-thanexpected third quarter outcome has since led most of them—and the staff—to reduce their
estimates to barely above zero.

4

A Selected Issues Paper examines factors accounting for Italy’s trade performance, building
on a cross-country study entitled “Explaining Differences in External Performance Among
Large Euro Area Countries” (IMF Country Report 05/401), which serves as background to
this consultation as well.

- 11 -

10.
For 2006, the staff forecasts growth of about
1½ percent, in line with the budget projection and
slightly above the consensus forecast of 1.3 percent.
This would imply average quarterly growth of about 0.3
percent, equal to the 2005:Q3 outturn.

Strong global demand is projected to lead to an
improved contribution from net exports, although
gains in external competitiveness are not
expected, as firms are likely to take advantage of
somewhat slower ULC growth to restore
margins. Indeed, Italy is projected to continue to
lose market share.
With indicators of business confidence rising and
corporate balance sheets remaining healthy, the
improved external contribution is forecast to
encourage a recovery of productive investment,
which has been languishing.

could have a negative impact on confidence and on
ratings agencies’ evaluations, and the continued benign
behavior of spreads cannot be assumed indefinitely in the absence of adjustment and reform.

12.
Inflation is expected to remain moderate. As elsewhere in the euro area, there is
little evidence that high oil prices have generated significant second-round effects on prices.
The large flow of low-priced imports from emerging markets has helped contain inflation,
even against the background of some euro weakness, but the already-noted positive inflation
differential relative to the euro area despite Italy’s sizable output gap raises concerns about
possible underlying inflationary pressures.

B. Fiscal Policy in 2005–06: Living Up to EDP Commitments
13.
The 2005 deficit target of 4.3 percent of GDP is likely to have been achieved, but
margins were expected to be tight. Despite unfavorable economic conditions, tax revenues
had performed relatively well. There were, however, some indications that spending
discipline had weakened later in the year. This, and the sizable shortfall in real estate sales
(which are recorded as a deficit-reducing item under ESA95), had prompted a budget
amendment in October that introduced additional spending cuts and revenue measures
amounting to just over 0.1 percent of GDP. The authorities stressed that this underscored
their commitment to achieving the target. Though not planned, the budget deficit would also
be contained by delays in renewing some public sector wage contracts, which would push
their fiscal impact into 2006. Achievement of the deficit target would entail a small
improvement in the underlying fiscal position (about ¼ percent of GDP as measured by the
change in the cyclically-adjusted primary balance net of one-off measures). Nevertheless,
current primary spending was projected to rise by about 0.7 percent of GDP in 2005,
testimony to the considerable spending momentum in the public finances.
14.
The authorities have repeatedly strengthened the 2006 budget with a view to
securing the EDP deficit target of 3.8 percent of GDP. The package of measures included
in the original draft 2006 budget, discussed early in the mission, fell far short of what was
needed to achieve the EDP target, due also to inflated assumptions about likely real estate
asset sales. The authorities agreed that the budget needed to be strengthened and—in a series
of amendments during October-December—have done so in various ways (new measures,
tighter expenditure control mechanisms, and the channeling of all asset sale proceeds to
deficit reduction). The final 2006 budget contains measures that are officially estimated to
yield about 1.9 percent of GDP, more than would be needed to compensate for the expiration
of one-off measures and for some new spending initiatives, and to achieve the EDP deficit
target. Indeed, the authorities now project the 2006 deficit at 3.5 percent of GDP. Such an
outturn would also be consistent with the scale of improvement in the structural balance net
of one-offs committed to under the EDP.
15.
Underlying expenditure dynamics underpin staff concerns about achievement of
the 3.8 percent of GDP deficit target in 2006. In particular, with no fundamental spending
reforms, staff is less sanguine about the following items:
•

The budget envisions deep cuts in central government current spending, but without
changes in underlying determinants these will be difficult to enforce and sustain,
especially on the heels of the within-year spending cuts already implemented in 2004
and 2005. Such mid-year cuts have typically resulted in spending rebounds in
subsequent years.

•

The budget assumes rigorous expenditure control at the local level, in particular for
health care. Success in curbing health care costs was elusive in previous years, and
according to available data only mixed progress was made in 2005.

- 13 -

•

The budget calls for deep cuts in current and capital transfers to some state
enterprises, notably the state highway agency (ANAS) and the railways, but without
meaningful corporate restructuring these could prove unrealistic and generate offbudget liabilities for the government.

•

In addition, the final budget raised revenue estimates—in some cases excessively, in
the staff’s view.5

In light of these factors, the staff’s current central forecast is of a deficit of 4.0 percent of
GDP in 2006. However, fiscal uncertainties are such as to readily encompass a range of
deficit outcomes between

The authorities believed the risks highlighted by staff were contained and
manageable. First, they noted that revenue forecasts in the original budget were
conservative. More fundamentally, they believed the expenditure risks highlighted by the
mission were overstated. The authorities pointed to refinements they were introducing to the
2005 nominal cap on spending growth, allowing for greater differentiation across spending
categories to enhance expenditure control. They also stressed that a number of initiatives had
been implemented that would help contain the growth of health care costs, including the
introduction of a national health card (tessera sanitaria) to improve controls and reduce
fraud, and new mechanisms that would increase accountability among local governments for
health spending overruns; since then, sanctions for such overruns have been strengthened, as
well. They likewise felt there was limited risk associated with the cut in transfers to state
enterprises, as these enterprises would have no option but to adjust their spending
accordingly. Furthermore, there was some upside to the cuts in transfers, as they could
provide impetus to a number of potential asset sales that were not incorporated in budget
projections. In reiterating their commitment to the EDP target, the authorities noted that, as
in the past, corrective measures could be introduced over the course of 2006, should they
prove necessary.6 Finally, the authorities were also investigating more effective ways to

In particular, staff expects a shortfall in the yield of the so-called concordato, a tax
assessment and settlement procedure covering both pending tax liabilities (2003-04) and
those for future years (2006-08), which is partly one-off in nature. Yields from past similar
schemes fell short of expectations.

mobilize the state’s considerable asset holdings to reduce the public debt, although details
were not available at the time of writing.
C. The Agenda for a More Competitive Italy
Fiscal Policy
17.
It was recognized that Italy’s large public debt was an important constraint on
potential growth, generating uncertainty about the future course of fiscal policy and
diverting resources from more productive uses. Thus, while reducing the deficit to below
3 percent of GDP by 2007 would be difficult, it was acknowledged that this was only the first
step in the process of fiscal consolidation. The mission noted in particular that despite a
series of important pension reforms over the last decade, bringing the deficit down to the
Maastricht ceiling—or even the 1.5 percent of GDP envisioned for 2009 in the latest
Stability Program update (December 2005)—would be insufficient to ensure the
sustainability of the fiscal accounts, in light of pressures that will arise from population aging
(Box 2). Staff simulations show that even assuming some improvement in labor productivity
growth and the employment ratio in the coming years, rising aging-related expenditure
would lead to explosive debt dynamics in the longer term. By contrast, under an adjustment
scenario that envisages declines in the structural deficit of ¾ percent of GDP annually to
achieve overall balance by the end of the next legislature in 2010 (with constant non-agingrelated spending thereafter), the debt ratio would

balance. The authorities assured the mission they
would implement the once-every-decade adjustment
in pension replacement rates in response to changes in life expectancy by end-2005, as
mandated under the 1995 pension reform, but this has not yet occurred.

- 15 -

Box 2. Fiscal Sustainability
The staff’s baseline scenario assumes current policies are maintained through 2010.
Thereafter, revenue and non age-related spending remain constant as percentages of
GDP. Age-related (health and pension) expenditure reflects recent demographic
projections and the pension reforms introduced since the mid-1990s. The baseline also
assumes increases in labor productivity growth (to 1¼ percent annually, above the rate
achieved over the last few years) and in the employment ratio (by 5 percentage points).
Together, these result in long-run annual real GDP growth of ¾ percent. These
assumptions are less optimistic than those underlying official projections, which
assume annual productivity growth of 1¾ percent and a cumulative increase in the
employment ratio of more than 10 percentage points. The baseline assumption on health
care spending (as per the authorities’ “national scenario”) links age-adjusted per capita
consumption of health services to growth of GDP per capita. Given recent health care
spending trends, this may be optimistic. In the 2005 update of their Stability Program,
the authorities used alternative methodologies (death-related costs, etc.) that yield more
favorable estimates for Italy. The EC’s Ageing Working Group recommends using a
variety of scenarios to project health care costs, including one that links health spending
to the growth of GDP per worker, which is more pessimistic than the staff’s scenario.
Under the baseline, the fiscal deficit would decline marginally over the next few years,
but would rise thereafter, due to increased aging-related spending and, later, interest
payments. The debt ratio would exceed 300 percent of GDP in 2050 (see Table 5).
The staff’s adjustment scenario features annual structural adjustment of 0.7 percent of
GDP in 2007–10 through spending cuts, leading to overall structural balance by the end
of the decade. In addition, assuming current and future reforms, productivity growth
rises by ¼ percentage point relative to the baseline, starting from 2011. Under this
scenario, savings on the interest bill finance the increases in aging-related spending,
with the debt-to-GDP ratio falling to around 50 percent by 2030 and then stabilizing.
Stress test scenarios, relative to the baseline, include: (i) implementation of the
adjustment strategy detailed in the authorities’ Stability Program update, whereby the
overall fiscal deficit is reduced to 1½ percent of GDP by 2009; (ii) that same fiscal
adjustment path, but with higher productivity growth than in the baseline (matching that
in the staff’s adjustment scenario); (iii) a more optimistic productivity growth scenario
based on the authorities’ assumptions, but with current fiscal policies; and (iv) failure to
implement scheduled adjustments in pension replacement rates in line with life
expectancy developments. Each of these scenarios yields a sizable increase in the debt
ratio in the long run.
These results underscore the dual importance of reforms to increase potential growth
and early action to address fiscal problems.

18.
The authorities agreed that budget consolidation needed to be based on
expenditure containment, particularly given the trend growth of spending since the late
1990s. Over the last several years, primary current spending had risen at an average annual
rate of 2 percent in real terms, and Italy had largely squandered the fiscal dividend associated
with euro participation. While the nominal cap on expenditure growth was seen to have
played a useful restraining role in 2005, staff argued that achieving the required declines in
spending would demand a better-targeted approach, focused on expenditure reduction within
a medium-term budget framework. Cuts in subsidies to firms, rationalization of public
employment, further steps to control health care costs, and reforms to enhance the efficiency
of public procurement were likely sources of savings. The authorities noted that the planned
nationwide implementation of SIOPE—an integrated data management system to track cash
outlays at various levels of government—would provide a powerful tool for monitoring
spending and facilitating budgeting.7
19.
The ongoing devolution of functions from the central government will remain a
source of risk in the absence of a properly-designed system of fiscal federalism.
Although a High Commission on fiscal federalism had completed its mandate and issued a
report containing options for tax assignments, tax sharing and equalization mechanisms, no
major changes were planned ahead of the elections.8 Meanwhile, the internal stability pact
governing local government fiscal policies was again changed in the 2006 budget, negatively
affecting the predictability of the framework and its ownership by local authorities. Staff
observed that fiscal federalism arrangements will remain incomplete until increased spending
responsibilities are paired with mechanisms allowing local governments to raise their own
taxes and creating incentives for them to be fiscally responsible.
Structural Reforms
20.
The mission and its interlocutors agreed on both the nature of Italy’s economic
malaise and the broad outlines of the reform agenda. Clearly, protracted slow
productivity growth was at the heart of Italy’s poor economic performance, and sustained
implementation of a suite of reforms to stimulate greater competition and facilitate entry
across domestic markets was essential to accelerate potential growth. While the electoral
climate was not conducive to making substantial progress on these fronts in the coming
months, the authorities concurred that a number of reforms then before Parliament needed to
be approved to set the stage for further progress, and this goal was subsequently achieved.

At the same time, a constitutional reform assigning exclusive jurisdiction over health,
education, and local police to the regions secured parliamentary approval in early November.

21.
In line with commitments under the reformed Lisbon agenda, a medium-term
national action plan had been submitted that touched on many of these topics. 9 The
plan groups priority initiatives into five broad areas: (i) liberalization of individual and
enterprise activity; (ii) research and development; (iii) human capital; (iv) infrastructure; and
(v) environment. The mission welcomed the report as a useful contribution to the debate, and
suggested that the authorities emphasize the low-cost, high-benefit initiatives in the
document—such as liberalization and the implementation of the EU services directive—
ahead of other items (e.g., in research and infrastructure) that would involve high budgetary
costs and more limited returns.

A host of rules inhibit competition in the professional services, including by barring
nonprofessionals from performing nontechnical services, establishing minimum
tariffs for certain activities, and prohibiting advertising. Closed associations (ordini)
constitute formidable barriers to entry to professions that remain largely impregnable,
as most professional services fall outside antitrust jurisdiction. There was some
sympathy for the staff’s call to eliminate these restrictions, though associations and
minimum fees were still viewed as necessary to ensure quality and protect consumers.
No major initiatives were afoot; indeed, earlier planned reforms to the role of notaries
had been scrapped. The issue is nevertheless present in the electoral debate.

•

In retail trade, too, competition-inhibiting restrictions abound, with particular
protection afforded to certain sectors (e.g., pharmacies). Competencies for retail trade
have largely been devolved to lower levels of government, but staff called for the
central government to proactively use its remaining responsibilities to promote
competition.

•

Despite considerable divestment, the state still holds controlling shares in many
enterprises, some of which play a dominant role in key Italian markets (notably
energy and transport), and most local utilities remain public. In this regard, while the
authorities plan to abandon their “golden shares” in some of these enterprises (which
have come under increasing scrutiny from the EU), they intend to replace them with
“poison pill” arrangements that are also aimed at discouraging take-over bids. Staff
noted that the continued public presence in some key sectors of the economy reduced

incentives to resist cost pressures and innovate, as pointed out by the OECD.10 The
authorities asserted the importance of keeping strategic industries in national hands,
and noted that similar defensive instruments are used in other industrial countries.
They nevertheless planned to continue divestment efforts.
•

While the Antitrust Authority is proactive and well-regarded, regulatory authorities
in certain key sectors play an insufficient role in promoting competition. Staff
advocated enhanced powers for such authorities, and expressed concern about
political influence in nomination procedures, as well as the possible impact of plans
to terminate their financing from the budget. Government officials noted, however,
that the latter initiative would be phased in gradually, and sought merely to reduce
reliance on budgetary resources—to be offset by greater contributions from regulated
industries—rather than weaken the capacity of the supervisory entities.

•

In the financial system, as revealed also by the FSAP, greater market
contestability—including importantly by foreign contenders—would make the sector
more dynamic, yielding significant efficiency gains. Along with measures to increase
the size and role of capital markets, it would also likely help reorient a predominantly
relationship-based system that tended to favor incumbents over new entrants. On the
whole, the authorities thought staff overstated the benefits of a foreign presence
which in any case already existed (see ¶27), though they agreed on the desirability of
increased competition and efficiency.

23.
Cross-country indicators point to a need to improve the business environment,
and the authorities were confident that progress was in the offing. Data collected by the
World Bank and other international bodies suggest significant problems in this area,
including slow legal processes and substantial bureaucratic requirements, though the
authorities expressed reservations

25.
The authorities observed that new forms of contracting had contributed to
employment growth. They pointed in particular to the beneficial impact of recent reforms to
promote the use of part-time contracts and temporary agencies (“staff leasing”). They
recognized, however, that recent work by the statistical agency suggested that as much as
three quarters of the rise in employment registered since the start of 2003 had come from
increases in the working age population—likely arising from the regularization of
immigrants already in Italy—rather than from growth in the employment rate, a point

stressed by the trade unions.12 The authorities noted that steps had been taken to link regional
databases of job openings, helping to create a more transparent and efficient national labor
market. They saw this as an important step to reduce the substantial regional disparities in
unemployment rates. Staff’s long-standing call for greater regional wage variation in line
with productivity differences—which would address the same end—continued to meet with
resistance, however.
D. Financial Sector
26.
The 2005 Financial Sector Assessment Program found that Italy’s financial
system was generally sound. The banking sector has proven resilient to slow growth, and
stress tests indicate little vulnerability to unfavorable macroeconomic shocks (Box 3).
Nevertheless, the FSAP found a number of specific issues within the banking system that
merited attention, including relatively lenient loan classification standards that complicated
the assessment of banks’ financial health, and insufficient regulation of lending to related
parties. On the former issue, the Bank of Italy is undertaking measures to align the definition
of impaired loans with the standard 90-day past due criterion. On the second issue, broad
guidelines on connected lending have recently been approved by an interministerial
committee, paving the way for the Bank of Italy to issue more detailed regulations on the
matter. Stress tests results suggested some vulnerability to liquidity risk, but the authorities
noted that liquidity indicators were broadly in line with those of other European countries.
Finally, the revelations concerning financial improprieties in the context of recent takeover
attempts, which came after the bulk of the FSAP work was conducted, indicate a need for
greater vigilance in enforcing the overall strong supervisory framework.
27.
Turning to efficiency considerations, views
differed on the extent to which market contestability
was a concern. A number of indicators suggest that
overall competition in the banking sector is similar to that
in other large European economies. However, the price of
core banking services remains high and efficiency gains
from the common currency have been small (Box 4).13 In
addition, European Commission surveys reveal a higher
level of dissatisfaction with the quality of banking services
than elsewhere in Europe.14 The Bank of Italy cautioned

To the extent these immigrants were already employed in Italy, their regularization would
lead to some understatement of productivity growth since 2003, although the underlying
analysis of productivity developments would not be affected.

that attention needed to be paid to individual country
circumstances when evaluating cross-country
indicators. For example, high fees and commissions
should be weighed against the relatively large
number of interest-bearing and joint accounts in
Italy. It also noted that the share of the system
owned by foreign entities was already comparatively
high (albeit consisting only of minority positions).

Box 3. FSAP: Specific Issues
While the financial system is generally sound, a number of specific issues emerged
from the FSAP that deserve attention:
•

Market contestability in banking is limited and foreign entry has proven
difficult. Further consolidation, including with the participation of strong
foreign partners, would help enhance competition and efficiency; this would
facilitate lower pricing of banking services.

•

Italian banks exhibit structurally higher nonperforming loans compared to other
leading European countries, despite more lenient loan classification standards.
The authorities should accelerate the convergence to the standard 90-day past
due criterion, which would provide more meaningful information on banks'
financial health. The Bank of Italy is undertaking measures to move to a 180day (and ultimately to the more standard 90-day) past due criterion.

•

The limited regulation of lending to related parties creates uncertainty about the
extent of connected lending in the banking sector. The staff supports current
plans for enhancing regulation to permit a careful monitoring of this issue.

•

Liquidity buffers in the banking sector have decreased and stress tests revealed
some vulnerability to liquidity risk.

The FSAP also identified several issues related to the Bank of Italy’s governance that
are addressed in the main text.

- 23 -

Box 4. Competition in the Banking Sector
In addition to more traditional indicators of market structure, four main approaches can
be used to assess the degree of competition in the banking industry (see the Selected
Issues paper for details): (i) indicators of competition based on profitability, including
measures of the differential between price and marginal cost (Lerner indices);
(ii) measures of banks’ revenue elasticity to input prices (Panzer-Rosse indices);
(iii) price (net interest margin) indicators; and (iv) indicators based on costs of services
and estimates of switching costs.
Using these four approaches, the selected issues paper finds that:
•

Competition in the Italian banking sector has intensified in loan and
deposit markets in recent years, and banks do not seem to face markedly
less competition than in other large European countries. Although
concentration at the national level has increased with the presence of 83 bank
groups, the sharp rise in the number of branches since 1990 has contributed to
greater competition in provincial and regional markets. The recent evolution
and composition of bank profits also suggest some intensification of
competition in the banking industry in the 1980s and 1990s, with some
leveling-off in more recent years. Cross-country indicators─based on interest
and profit margins as well as on indicators of revenue elasticity─suggest the
existence of monopolistic competition in Italy, and find the degree of
competition among banks is not dissimilar to that in comparable euro area
countries.

•

Competition is not yet reflected in the pricing of core services. According to
one international survey, the average price of basic banking services (adjusted
for local consumption patterns) appears to be among the highest in Europe.15
Adjusting for joint-ownership of current accounts and the higher implied
average balances, another study16 found that the average price of holding a
current account in Italy is still some 23 percent higher than the unweighted
average for the EU countries surveyed. In addition, the authorities are
concerned that high switching costs hamper competition and an investigation is
being conducted by the Bank of Italy in cooperation with the anti-trust
authority.

28.
There was also a divergence of views on the extent to which institutional
arrangements were a barrier to greater banking competition. Controversy over the
conduct of the Bank of Italy in responding to two cross-border bank takeover bids—
culminating in the resignation of the Bank’s governor—had revived public debate on
potential conflicts among the central bank’s mandates to maintain financial system stability,
enforce antitrust laws, and promote efficiency and competitiveness (though the cases in
question did not themselves raise antitrust issues).17 Representatives of the Bank argued that
there was no inherent conflict among its mandates, noting that other central banks—notably,
the US Federal Reserve—were also jointly entrusted with responsibility for competition and
stability (although in the US oversight of competition was shared with the Department of
Justice and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, with the Fed’s role limited to
mergers and acquisitions and activities of bank holding companies). With recent
controversies so eroding confidence in institutional arrangements and affecting perceptions
of the contestability of the banking system, staff argued that consideration could usefully be
given to shifting responsibility for competition to another authority. In mid-December the
government amended the savings law in this direction, giving the Bank of Italy and the
antitrust authority joint responsibility for bank mergers and acquisitions and transferring
responsibility for other anticompetitive behavior fully to the antitrust authority.
29.
The savings law includes several essential changes to the Bank of Italy’s
governance. The law caps the governor’s lifetime mandate and seeks to increase
transparency in the Bank’s decision-making process, such as through the submission of
semiannual reports to Parliament and the Government. The Governing Council of the ECB
issued a favorable review of the reforms, but recommended additional enhancements,
including extending the fixed term of office to all members of the Bank of Italy’s directorate
and increasing collegiality in its decision-making. It also stressed that central bank
independence should be fully safeguarded in the planned transfer of the Bank’s ownership to
the public sector (it is currently majority-owned by private sector banks). The government
subsequently introduced amendments to the law to reflect the ECB recommendations,
limiting a governor’s tenure to a maximum of two six-year terms, changing procedures for
his nomination and dismissal, and instituting collegiality in decision-making.18 It also
shelved the planned ownership transfer for three years.
17

In early December, the EU Commission initiated proceedings against Italy for possible
infringement of single market provisions on the free flow of capital and the right of
establishment.

18

On December 23, the ECB issued a favorable opinion on these amendments, as well as on
the transfer of responsibility for banking competition oversight to the antitrust authority. The
ECB noted the need for clear rules to resolve cases where proposed mergers are supported by
the central bank on stability grounds but are opposed by the antitrust authority because of
their effect on competition.

30.
The savings law also contains provisions that could enhance the role of non-bank
financing in Italy, helping to increase financial sector efficiency and reorient the
relationship-based system. The law—a long-pending response to earlier corporate
scandals—includes advances in corporate governance, in the marketing and issuance of
corporate bonds, and in coordination among regulatory agencies.
31.
Amid conflicting pressures, a major reform to encourage private pension
savings has been effectively delayed until 2008. The reform, which allows workers to
redirect their firm-based severance payment fund contributions toward privately-managed
retirement schemes, had long been delayed by concerns over both its fiscal costs (as the
government was expected to compensate firms for the loss of low-cost financing they would
suffer from the diversion of severance fund contributions) and the extent to which the
provisions established a level playing field among prospective private pension plan
providers. The measure was passed in late November, but will take effect only in 2008, and
further modifications are possible before then. The Italian household sector is marked by
both high housing wealth and low debt, and the creation of more flexible financial
instruments and products to help them meet their savings and investment needs, including for
retirement, could bring significant benefits. It was also recognized that increased private
pension saving was essential over the medium term in light of the impact that recent public
pension reforms would have on benefits going forward. Staff analysis of fiscal multipliers in
an intertemporal setting suggests that the household sector is in fact likely to smooth the
future impact of pension reforms through greater asset accumulation.19 A large number of
self-employed workers remain without private pension coverage, and the authorities noted
that future reforms would be needed to encourage retirement savings among this population.
E. Fiscal Transparency Issues: Despite Progress, Far to Go
32.
Staff has repeatedly pointed to the opacity of Italy’s budget presentation.
Problems were particularly acute in 2005, when some “non-current policy” items (notably,
real estate sales) were initially included in the trend deficit (tendenziale), necessitating a
subsequent amendment to make the tendenziale conform to its definition, and the adoption of
complementary measures to substitute for the asset sales. In addition, key budget documents
are available only with a considerable delay, and up-to-date financial data on some important
state enterprises are not widely disseminated. The authorities recognized the shortcomings of
the present system, but argued that in many cases problems had more to do with the timely
availability of data than with transparency per se. They noted, as well, that joint work by the
Ministry of Economy, the Bank of Italy, and the statistical authority had narrowed the
historically large unexplained gaps between the cash and accrual deficits, reducing one longstanding transparency concern. Against this background, and in light of repeated fiscal
slippages, staff saw a need for improved fiscal governance mechanisms, including by
establishing an entity to provide an independent analysis of fiscal developments, building on
19

See the Selected Issues paper.

- 26 -

the work performed by the Court of Auditors (Corte dei Conti) and other bodies. The
authorities were reluctant to create yet another independent authority, noting also issues of
democratic accountability, but saw scope for enhancing the powers of the Corte dei Conti.
Staff considered this a potentially promising avenue, provided the Court’s mandate was
explicitly extended to include regular ex ante scrutiny of the budget process and
developments (and not solely ex post auditing of outturns) and its staffing strengthened in
line with its new duties.
33.
Recent initiatives to promote the use of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) in
infrastructure investment could increase the efficiency of public spending. The mission
emphasized, however, that care needs to be taken to ensure transparency in the recording of
these operations and associated contingent liabilities, including in budget documents. PPPs—
which are still relatively underdeveloped in Italy—should be implemented only when they
would result in higher spending efficiency and a balanced allocation of risks, and not to
evade budgetary restrictions.20
F. Other Issues
34.
The authorities expressed their commitment to reducing barriers to
international trade through a multilateral approach. Italian textile firms had been
severely affected by the elimination of export quotas under the Multi-Fiber Agreement, and
the authorities welcomed accords that would provide additional breathing space for domestic
firms to adjust to the new rules. They noted that losses to Italian firms from counterfeiting
were sizable.
35.
Official development assistance remains low, but was projected to rise in 2005.
The authorities estimated that ODA could reach 0.3 percent of GNI in 2005, about double the
2004 ratio. Italy has committed to “make every effort” to reach a level of 0.5 percent of GNI
for ODA in 2010, as an intermediate objective toward the medium- to long-term goal of
0.7 percent of GNI.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
Past policy failings have left Italy in a difficult position. Repeated fiscal slippages,
and the practice of allowing one-off measures to substitute for fundamental reforms, have
produced a deficit now appreciably above the 3 percent of GDP ceiling under the SGP,
inhibiting a rapid reduction in the massive public debt, which is in fact on the rise again. In
addition, while important labor market reforms have facilitated a significant increase in
employment in recent years, a failure to liberalize product and services markets with the
same vigor has contributed to economic stagnation and perpetuated a rigid productive
structure. As a result, Italy is increasingly unable to compete in a world where its long20

These points are further developed in a Selected Issues paper prepared for the consultation.

- 27 -

standing advantage in relatively low-tech products has been eroded both by the rise of
emerging market economies and by steady increases in domestic costs. The improving shortterm outlook, with growth expected to rise to about 1½ percent in 2006, cannot obscure the
serious medium-term challenges Italy faces. Early, decisive progress toward the resolution of
these challenges must be the key economic priority of the next government.
37.
There is no alternative to reform. Italy may continue to resist change, with insiders
defending the dwindling economic rents they accrue from current levels of protection, while
excessive deficits and spending overruns continue to perpetuate policy uncertainty. The
likely impact of such policies—until they eventually prove unsustainable—is a continuation
of the recent period of slow growth, fading competitiveness, and growing debt. The only
economically viable option is to embark on broad-based structural reforms and medium-term
fiscal consolidation aimed at creating a more robust, flexible, and dynamic economy. Such a
transformation will be neither easy nor rapid, but holds out the prospect of faster potential
growth and an economy better able to prosper in a globalized world. Reforms must start from
a recognition that Italy’s economic problems are fundamentally “made in Italy,” and that
their resolution can only be found there as well.
38.
Having succeeded in passing various long-pending structural reforms before the
end of the legislative session, the government will now need to ensure observance of its
fiscal commitments. The measures approved in December are an important “down
payment” on needed further reforms. The overhaul of the bankruptcy code will bring
welcome improvements to the present antiquated law. New and accelerated civil procedures
should also promote efficiency and entrepreneurial activity. The savings law—a longoverdue response to corporate scandals—contains advances in corporate governance, in the
marketing and issuance of corporate bonds, and in coordination among regulatory agencies,
and introduces changes in their respective responsibilities. It also contains important
initiatives to improve the Bank of Italy’s governance and increase its accountability, which
was not commensurate with its appropriately high degree of autonomy (which must, of
course, continue to be fully safeguarded). In the period leading up to the election, the
authorities now need to ensure that the fiscal targets agreed under the Excessive Deficit
Procedure are secured, without recourse to one-off measures.
39.
Recent initiatives by the government have demonstrated its commitment to the
agreed fiscal targets. The package of expenditure cuts and revenue measures for 2005 gives
reasonable confidence that the deficit target of 4.3 percent of GDP was achieved, although
with tight margins. The 2006 budget has also been appreciably strengthened since its initial
presentation. More generally, the fact that the 2006 budget is based on a realistic
macroeconomic scenario and calls for adjustment mainly via expenditure containment rather
than tax increases or significant one-off measures is welcome.
40.
Nevertheless, underlying expenditure dynamics stand to compromise
achievement of this year’s EDP deficit target of 3.8 percent of GDP. Deep cuts in
spending at the central and local government levels could prove difficult to implement,
especially for health care. Reductions in transfers to state enterprises will be unsustainable

- 28 -

absent credible corporate restructuring. Against this background, firm execution of spending
and careful monitoring of outcomes will be of the essence, and recent steps to strengthen
expenditure control are welcome. The nationwide rollout of SIOPE should also contribute
meaningfully to expenditure monitoring, and should continue to be fully supported. Finally,
if developments were to indicate slippages from the target, corrective measures should be
taken in a timely manner, notwithstanding the electoral calendar.
41.
Looking beyond the elections, the next government must make an unequivocal
commitment to reforms that enhance competition, reduce price mark-ups, and promote
freedom of choice for consumers. The main focus should be on product and services
markets, complementing existing labor market reforms. In the professions, the array of rules
that inhibit competition should be eliminated. Rapid implementation of the EU services
directive, when finalized, would also stimulate competition and efficiency. In retail trade,
while competencies have been devolved to lower levels of government, the state should use
its remaining responsibilities to promote consumer welfare through greater competition.
Further deregulation in network sectors, a move away from instruments such as “golden
shares” and “poison pills,” and enhanced powers for the antitrust and sectoral authorities are
also called for. Reforms to improve the business environment would contribute to faster
growth, as well. Many of these reforms have low budgetary costs, and can be pursued
regardless of the tight fiscal position. Product market reforms that increase domestic
competition can also help shield the impact of continued wage moderation—which will be
essential to restore competitiveness—on workers’ real incomes.
42.
Despite commendable progress in labor markets, there is scope for further
reforms to raise Italy’s very low employment rate. Past reforms to reduce employment
protection and introduce new, more flexible forms of contracting have supported
employment growth. Recent initiatives to improve the unemployment compensation system
are a positive development. These should be seen as the first step toward a more thorough
overhaul of the system, offering better and properly conditional unemployment support in
concert with a further relaxation of employment protection legislation. Such reforms can
facilitate the movement of labor to more productive uses, allowing the economy to respond
more fluidly to the structural shifts it confronts. Furthermore, greater variation of wages in
line with productivity differences remains critical to redress competitiveness losses in the
short term, while more fundamental reforms take hold. Progress in enhancing human capital
is needed, as well.
43.
Restoring the sustainability of the fiscal accounts is also necessary. The targeted
reduction of the deficit to below 3 percent of GDP by 2007 is insufficient to ensure
sustainability of the public debt, especially in light of pressures that will arise from
population aging. Repeated fiscal slippages over the last several years have led to the
abandonment of the commitment to achieve overall fiscal balance within the period covered
by Stability Program updates. This objective should be reasserted through the establishment
of a path of medium-term deficit reduction sufficient to achieve overall balance by 2010,
before the end of the next legislature. To be credible, such an adjustment should be centered

- 29 -

on expenditure containment, especially since the steady rise of primary current spending lies
at the heart of Italy’s current fiscal fragility. Reversing this trend will require an ambitious
and targeted approach to expenditure rationalization within a medium-term budget
framework. It will also require the adjustment of pension replacement rates every decade in
line with developments in life expectancy, as mandated under the 1995 reform. Current
delays in doing so are therefore of concern.
44.
Italy’s budget presentation falls well short of international best practices for
transparency and is in urgent need of improvement. Recent work by the statistical
authority, the Bank of Italy, and the Ministry of Economy to narrow the gap between the
cash and accrual deficits has reduced an important element of uncertainty, and reconciliation
efforts should continue. However, the use of a non-transparent tendenziale as the budget
baseline means that fiscal planning gets off to a murky start. Moreover, the timeliness of
information is unsatisfactory, with key details of underlying budgetary plans available only
with a lag and up-to-date information on the financial position of some important state
enterprises unavailable. Given the depth of the country’s fiscal challenges, the authorities
should seek an institutional mechanism able to provide regular, independent evaluations of
budget proposals and trends at the behest of Parliament, whether via a new entity or a
reinforcement of existing institutions.
45.
A competitive financial sector is also critical to support a more vibrant economy.
The FSAP reports Italy’s financial system to be generally sound, although it also points to
some structural weaknesses that constrain the system’s role in promoting growth, including
limited market contestability (notably for foreign contenders); high operational costs, fees
and commissions; undersized corporate bond and equity markets; and a relationship-based
orientation that favors incumbents. The authorities have taken steps to address some of the
specific issues that emerged from the FSAP, and should move promptly on the others.
46.
Institutional reforms to assign banking competition issues to the antitrust
authority address concerns about the potential conflict between stability and
competition in the previous arrangement. Preparatory efforts to transfer expertise and
resources to the antitrust authority will be essential, however. It will also be important that its
high level of independence be maintained, and that the division of responsibility between it
and the Bank of Italy be established along clear lines with distinct accountability. The
envisaged changes to the Bank of Italy’s governance structure, in line with the
recommendations of the ECB, are welcome.
47.
The authorities should resist pressures for increased trade protection,
particularly for textiles, apparel and footwear. Italy’s commitment to raise its relatively
low ODA is welcome.
48.
Economic statistics have remained broadly adequate for surveillance. As noted
above, however, there is a glaring need to improve the transparency and timeliness of fiscal
data and documentation.

APPENDIX II

Italy: Statistical Information
Italy’s economic database is comprehensive and of generally high quality. Italy has subscribed to
the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and has posted the metadata on the
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB). Data are provided to the Fund in a
comprehensive manner (see attached table). The authorities regularly publish a full range of
economic and financial data, as well as a calendar of dates for the main statistical releases. Italy
is also subject to the statistical requirements and timeliness and reporting standards of Eurostat
and the European Central Bank (ECB), and has adopted the European System of Accounts 1995
(ESA95).
A Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC)—Data Module (Country Report
No. 02/234, 10/18/02) found Italy’s macroeconomic statistics to be of generally high quality, but
also identified some shortcomings that hindered an accurate and timely analysis of economic and
financial developments: (i) no statistical agency had the responsibility to compile and
disseminate a comprehensive statement of government finances, and a persistent difference had
emerged between the SGP-monitored fiscal deficit and the PSBR net of privatization receipts
(discussed in detail in the 2004 Staff Report); (ii) source data and/or statistical techniques could
be strengthened in several areas, most importantly, by raising response rates on the enterprise
surveys used in the national accounts and producer price index, making price collection for the
consumer price index more efficient, and improving the coverage of cross-border financial
transactions; (iii) balance of payments and government finance statistics could be closer aligned
with the internationally accepted methodological guidelines on concepts and definitions, scope,
classification and sectorization, and/or valuation; and (iv) resources were under pressure in some
parts of the National Institute of Statistics in the face of the statistical requirements of the
European Union and the Euro area.
Recent steps to improve economic data include: the introduction in 2005 of the regional price
indices by the National Institute of Statistics (Istat); the publication of quarterly data for the
general government balance, expenditure, and revenue on an accruals basis (in line with ESA95)
starting in October 2003; and more detailed labor survey, conducted by professional staff.
Progress has also been made in reconciling the discrepancy between the cash-based net
borrowing requirement and the accrual budget deficit, and working groups— consisting of
representatives of the Bank of Italy, Ministry of Economy and Finance, and Istat—meet
regularly to look at different aspects of the reconciliation. While some differences still exist
between the two measures, these are now accounted for more comprehensively and speedily (see
the 2005 Fiscal ROSC Update Report for details).
Notwithstanding these improvements, weaknesses remain in some areas. In the national
accounts, inventory accumulation is derived as a residual and lumped together with the statistical
discrepancy thus hampering the business cycle analysis. Furthermore, as highlighted by the fiscal
transparency ROSC and the two follow-ups, the quality and timeliness of some fiscal data,
particularly on expenditure by local governments, is still in need of improvement. Finally, the
shift to chain-weighted indices for national accounts, initially scheduled for March 2005, was
postponed until December.

This Supplement provides information that has become available since the issuance of
the Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation. The new information does not alter the
thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Recent short-term macroeconomic indicators have been, on balance, disappointing.
Notably, industrial production rose by a much less-than-expected 0.1 percent in November (monthon-month), and the October outturn was revised
downward. As a result, a number of forecasters have
Index of Industrial Production
(three-month moving average)
downgraded their growth estimates for 2005, and
Germany
downside risks to the staff’s 2005-06 forecast have
risen. More positively, notwithstanding the weak
industrial production data, the index of business
France
confidence experienced its eighth consecutive
monthly increase in January, reaching its highest
Italy
level in nearly four years, and harmonized consumer
price inflation declined further to 2.0 percent (yearon-year) in December, despite the rebound in oil
prices.

The authorities have introduced a number of steps to strengthen execution of the 2006
budget. In particular, monitoring systems, enforcement mechanisms, and sanctions have been
enhanced—including for health spending—and the role of the Court of Auditors in evaluating
subnational governments’ budget preparation and execution has been increased. These measures—
reviewed in detail by staff with the authorities in meetings in January—go some way to addressing
the staff’s concerns about the risks posed by underlying expenditure dynamics to the 2006 EDP
deficit target (3.8 percent of GDP). However, their effectiveness—in the absence of measures to
address structural spending determinants and given a history of leniency vis-à-vis past non-

-2-

compliance with spending norms1—will depend on the willingness of the authorities to enforce
them rigorously. The authorities have again emphasized such readiness to staff. In addition,
preliminary data suggest a slightly stronger-than-expected revenue performance in 2005. On this
basis, and assuming the downside risks to the growth forecast do not materialize, the staff has
revised its central 2006 deficit forecast down marginally, to 3.9 percent of GDP, while maintaining
the range of uncertainty (+/- ¼ percent of GDP) noted in the Staff Report (¶15).
4.
A first test of the new procedures will come at end-March 2006. At that time, regions
that have exceeded their health spending limits in 2005 are to be issued a formal Prime Ministerial
warning requiring them to undertake corrective measures. Failure to comply would lead the region’s
healthcare administration to be put into a form of central government receivership
(commissariamento). In addition, rates on some regional taxes would increase automatically with
effect from end-May 2006. It will be of the essence that such steps—should they prove necessary—
be undertaken in a timely and resolute manner.
5.
Implementation of the new savings law is progressing. The anti-trust authority has moved
quickly to exercise its mandate in the banking sector. Shortly after the new law came into effect, the
authority opened an investigation into the costs of banking services. As noted in the Staff Report
(¶27), fees and commissions are typically higher in Italy than in other large European countries. A
revision of the Bank of Italy’s statute is also underway to ensure its compliance with the provisions
of the savings law.

1

Exemplified as well by the inclusion in the 2006 budget of a limited pardon for past breaches of
budgetary procedures and norms. This pardon has come under strong criticism from the President of
the Court of Auditors.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with Italy
On February 6, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Italy.1
Background
A consolidation of the cyclical recovery that began in mid-2005 is expected this year, with
growth rising from close to zero last year to about 1½ percent in 2006. Net exports and
investment should benefit from sustained demand in partner countries, while consumption
growth is forecast to remain within the narrow range witnessed in recent years. Despite high
international energy prices, inflationary pressures should remain modest, at just over 2 percent
in 2006. Despite the better cyclical outlook, medium-term trends remain troubling: potential
growth is estimated at just 1¼ percent, as low productivity growth and high domestic costs
have led to a steady erosion of competitiveness and export market share.
The 2005 fiscal deficit target of 4.3 percent of GDP is estimated to have been met, thanks in
part to measures introduced by the authorities late last year, though current expenditure
dynamics remained strong. For 2006, the authorities have committed to a deficit target of
3.5 percent of GDP. To this end, they strengthened the budget substantially in various steps.
Sustaining the envisaged deep expenditure cuts will require strict implementation of the
budget’s enhanced control and sanction mechanisms.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2Labor market reforms and wage moderation have led to a substantial increase in employment
in recent years, although the employment ratio remains very low. In other areas, some key
structural measures were approved in late 2005, including a long-overdue reform of the
bankruptcy code, an updating of civil procedures, and a “savings law” that enhances corporate
governance, disclosure, and coordination among regulators. Nevertheless, a number of crosscountry indicators point to the presence of rigidities and inefficiencies in the economic
environment that constrain Italy’s growth potential.
The 2005 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) found that Italy’s financial system is
generally sound and well regulated. The banking sector has proven resilient to slow growth,
and stress tests revealed little vulnerability going forward. However, the FSAP identified issues
related to market contestability, loan classification standards, and lending to related parties,
and noted that the cost of core bank services was relatively high. The mission also raised
concerns about the Bank of Italy’s governance structure and about potential conflicts of
interest arising from the Bank’s joint mandates for banking sector stability and competition, but
these have substantially been addressed by reforms approved in late-December 2005.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the expected consolidation of the recovery of the Italian
economy that began in mid-2005 following several years of slow growth. Against this
backdrop, Directors commended the authorities’ commitment to the agreed fiscal targets, as
reflected in the additional measures taken to strengthen the 2006 budget. They also welcomed
the recent progress in passing some long-standing structural reforms, including an overhaul of
the bankruptcy code, new and accelerated civil procedures, and a savings law that
strengthens corporate governance and coordination among regulatory agencies—all of which
constitute important steps forward on needed reforms.
At the same time, Directors stressed that Italy faces difficult policy challenges going forward.
Italy’s medium-term prospects are troubling, as slow productivity growth has significantly
eroded its competitive position and export market share. In addition, pervasive rigidities and
inefficiencies in the domestic economy are restraining growth more generally, with potential
growth now estimated at just 1¼ percent annually. The large public debt also remains a drag
on the economy. Against this background, Directors considered that Italy must undertake
significant fiscal consolidation over the medium term to reduce the high public debt and fiscal
deficit, while widening and deepening structural reforms. Directors believed that progress on
both fronts will help the Italian economy adapt better to external challenges, and more
generally, to better compete in an increasingly globalized world and in the context of the single
currency.
Directors stressed that, in the present pre-electoral period, the economic policy priority is to
ensure the credibility of the fiscal adjustment targets agreed to under the Excessive Deficit
Procedure (EDP). In view of Italy’s recent history of missed fiscal targets, they viewed the
recent steps taken to strengthen the 2006 budget as a welcome sign of the authorities’
commitment both to consolidation and to the EDP fiscal targets. While endorsing the budget’s
reliance mainly on expenditure restraint, Directors emphasized the importance of cautious
execution of spending plans, together with timely monitoring and strict implementation of the

-3strengthened control and sanction mechanisms. They welcomed the authorities’ assurance
that corrective measures will be implemented promptly if slippages emerge. Several Directors
also emphasized that recourse to amnesties and one-off measures should be discontinued, in
order to enhance the durability of fiscal adjustment. Directors noted that in the medium term—
and in the absence of a reform of the fundamental determinants of spending—the underlying
expenditure dynamics could put significant pressure on the budget.
Directors stressed the need for a strong commitment to a program of liberalization and
deregulation going forward, based on reforms that will enhance competition, eliminate
economic rents, and promote freedom of choice for consumers. With past reforms having
prioritized labor markets, the main focus should be on liberalizing product and services
markets. Directors recommended several measures: freeing professional services of the array
of rules that inhibit competition, including via rapid implementation of the EU services directive,
when finalized; using the central government’s responsibilities over retail trade to promote
consumer welfare through greater competition; further deregulating network sectors, with a
reduction in the government’s predominant interest in privatized firms; and enhancing the
powers of the antitrust and sectoral authorities. Another key priority is to improve Italy’s
business environment, including by reducing bureaucratic burdens and accelerating legal
processes. Directors welcomed the National Action Plan for Innovation, Growth, and
Employment, and urged the authorities to implement it in a comprehensive and timely manner
to make progress toward the Lisbon Agenda targets. Early implementation of a broad package
of such reforms will be essential to create a more competitive Italy and boost medium-term
performance.
Directors welcomed the strong growth of employment of recent years, which is largely
attributable to past reforms that reduced employment protection and introduced new, flexible
forms of contracting. Nonetheless, the employment rate remains very low, indicating a need for
further action. While the recent initiatives to improve the unemployment compensation system
are a positive development, Directors suggested that these be seen as the first steps toward a
more thorough overhaul of the system that should aim to offer better and properly-conditional
unemployment support along with more flexible labor legislation. Furthermore, greater
variation of wages in line with productivity differences is critical to redress competitiveness
losses in the short term, while more fundamental reforms take hold. Greater wage flexibility
across regions could also help improve the high regional disparity in employment rates.
Directors also encouraged the authorities to strengthen education and training.
Restoring the sustainability of the fiscal accounts will also be essential for stronger mediumterm growth. While welcoming the authorities’ commitment to reduce the fiscal deficit to below
3 percent of GDP in 2007, Directors cautioned that this will be insufficient to ensure the
sustainability of the public debt, especially in light of the pressures that will arise from
population aging. They therefore called on the authorities to commit to a path of medium-term
deficit reduction sufficient to achieve overall balance by 2010, before the end of the next
legislature. Directors stressed that, to be credible, such an adjustment will need an ambitious
and targeted approach to expenditure containment, relating in particular to subsidies, public
employment, and health care. As the steady rise of primary current spending underlies the
country’s fiscal fragility, several Directors underscored the importance of strengthening the
primary balance. Directors also noted the contribution that sales of public assets could make to

-4reducing the public debt and enhancing economic efficiency. Directors urged that the
adjustment of pension replacement rates—mandated to take place every decade in line with
developments in life expectancy but delayed—now be effected promptly. Directors also
stressed the importance of a properly designed system of fiscal federalism to maintain budget
discipline in the presence of ongoing devolution.
Directors stressed the need to enhance the transparency of Italy’s budget presentation, which
falls short of international best practices. Directors commended the work that has helped to
narrow the gap between the cash and accrual deficits. They called for following this up with
efforts to increase the transparency of budget preparation; ensure the timely availability of key
budget documents; and disseminate up-to-date financial data on key state enterprises.
Directors supported the authorities’ intention to strengthen the role of the Court of Auditors
(Corte dei Conti) in budget monitoring and in providing independent evaluations of fiscal
proposals and trends.
Directors welcomed the opportunity to consider the key findings of the Financial System
Stability Assessment (FSSA) in the context of this discussion, and expressed their broad
agreement with them. They welcomed the finding that Italy’s financial system appears to be
generally sound and well regulated, and encouraged the authorities to deal expeditiously with
the issues identified in the FSSA. These include limited market contestability, high fees and
commissions, and regulations covering loan classification and lending to related parties.
Directors welcomed the steps underway to deal with some of these matters. A number of
Directors noted the need for further improvement in efficiency and competition in the financial
sector, including that which would result from increased participation by foreign banks. This
would contribute to raising Italy’s growth potential. Several Directors also encouraged Italy to
move to a 90-day classification rule for non-performing loans.
Directors supported recent changes in the Bank of Italy’s governance structure and the
institutional arrangements for the oversight of banking competition. They welcomed the
transfer of responsibility for anticompetitive behavior to the antitrust authority, which will help
address the potential conflict between stability and competition in previous arrangements.
Directors stressed the importance of ensuring that the new arrangements safeguard fully both
the Bank of Italy’s and the antitrust authority’s high levels of independence, and establish the
division of responsibilities between the two institutions along clear lines with distinct
accountability.
Directors welcomed Italy’s commitment to raise its relatively low level of development
assistance. They also welcomed the authorities’ commitment to continue to promote trade
liberalization through a multilateral approach.
Directors noted that Italy’s statistics are adequate for surveillance, and welcomed recent steps
to address weaknesses identified in the 2002 Report on the Observance of Standards and
Codes. They underscored the need to address remaining issues regarding the transparency
and timeliness of some fiscal data and documentation.

Statement by Arrigo Sadun, Executive Director for Italy
February 6, 2006

1. Introduction
We wish to thank the staff for producing a very comprehensive report and for their successful
mission. Following the Art. IV consultation and the extensive discussions with the European
Commission (EC), the Italian authorities have introduced additional measures to strengthen
the 2006 Budget. Accordingly, the deficit target for this year has been reduced to 3.5 percent
of GDP, which will facilitate the authorities’ efforts to bring it well below the 3 percent
reference value by 2007.
2. Economic Outlook
The slow growth of the past few years has hampered fiscal adjustment. The authorities are
committed to pursue a strategy based on fiscal consolidation and the completion of the
structural reforms agenda. A gradual recovery is under way, and it is expected to strengthen
in 2006. The main stimulus to growth will come from private consumption, fuelled by rising
employment and gains in disposable income. Investment is expected to rebound, particularly
spending on machinery and equipment, and the foreign sector is also forecast to improve.
Inflation appears firmly under control at about 2 percent, and the differential relative to the
euro area average has been narrowing. This macroeconomic scenario is broadly in line with
staff projections.
3. The reform strategy
Faster economic growth will facilitate fiscal consolidation. However, a cyclical upturn will
not resolve the fundamental problems of the Italian economy. These include low productivity
and a substantial loss of competitiveness. The solution to these problems hinges on the
successful implementation of the reform agenda along the lines of the Lisbon Strategy.
Building on the measures already implemented in the labor market, the pension system, and
education, the agenda aims at fostering greater competition and productivity in the services
and product markets.
4. Fiscal Policy
Italy is firmly committed to respect the July 2005 EU Council recommendations, which call
for a reduction of the deficit below 3 percent of GDP by 2007. This should be achieved
through a correction of 1.6 percentage points in the cyclically-adjusted deficit (net of oneoffs) over the 2006-2007 period, with at least half of the correction to be achieved in 2006.
For 2005, the authorities are confident that the deficit target of 4.3 percent of GDP will be
achieved, as preliminary data indicate that the central government cash deficit was EUR 60
billion, 5 billion below the original projections.

-2-

As mentioned above, the 2006 Budget aims at reducing the deficit to 3.5 percent of GDP,
which is 0.3 percentage points below the figure discussed with the staff at the time of the
mission. The fiscal adjustment amounts to 1.4 percent of GDP, two-thirds of which are
expenditure cuts and one-third additional revenues. These measures represent a correction of
the cyclically-adjusted deficit, net of one-offs, of 0.9 percent of GDP. Although a formal
assessment of the EU authorities will be approved in a few weeks, preliminary reactions are
positive.
The Stability Program for 2006-09 confirms the target of reducing the deficit to 2.8 percent
of GDP in 2007. This implies a further correction of 0.8 percent in the cyclically-adjusted
deficit, net of one-offs. The Stability Program envisages also the reduction of the cyclicallyadjusted deficit of 1.1 percent of GDP by the end of this decade. This target is lower than the
so called "minimum benchmark," i.e. the deficit-to-GDP ratio necessary to respect the 3
percent reference value during normal cyclical fluctuations. The debt-to-GDP ratio is
expected to decline to 101.7 in 2009.
5. Strengthening the expenditure controls
To address the concerns expressed by staff during the Article IV mission and those of the
EC, the final version of the 2006 Budget includes several measures that tighten the
administrative controls on the expenditures of the central administrations, local governments,
and the healthcare agencies. These include:
Central Government
• Spending by each administration will be monitored on a monthly basis. In the event
of spending overruns, the head of the agency will be personally responsible for taking
immediate corrective actions.
•

•

•

Procurement of goods and services for all administrations will be channeled through a
central agency, CONSIP, the power of which has been strengthened to evaluate
competitive bids and the merit of the requests.
Local Government
The Internal Stability Pact, which aims at ensuring that local-government
expenditures are in line with the budget, has been further reinforced by imposing
strict ceilings for spending other than personnel costs and social outlays.
Compliance with budgetary guidelines by the regional authorities will be monitored
on a quarterly basis. In the event of healthcare expenditure overruns, the President of
the Region has thirty days to take corrective measures. Failing this, there will be a
mandatory increase in regional taxation.

Health Care Agencies
• The Ministry of Health has launched a new system to closely track healthcare
expenditures. An electronic “health card” has been introduced with the intent of

-3-

monitoring individuals' expenditures and preventing fraud and waste. The role of the
Pharmaceutical Agency has been expanded to monitor spending on drugs and to
contain related prices.
•

Court of Auditors
In line with staff recommendations, the role and capabilities of the Court of Auditors
(Corte dei Conti) has been strengthened. Moreover, its mandate has been extended to
monitor the finances of local governments and healthcare agencies.

6. Ageing-related costs and fiscal sustainability
As was the case last year, the authorities believe that the macroeconomic assumptions used
by the staff in their long-term fiscal sustainability exercise are overly pessimistic.
Specifically, the staff assumes that for the entire period 2005-2050 real GDP growth will
average just 0.75 percent (less than half the EU average), while productivity is expected to
average just above one percent. Thus, the increase of the public debt reflects these
pessimistic macroeconomic assumptions, rather than the growth in age-related expenditures.
By contrast, the Italian authorities in their most recent Stability Program use different
assumptions that are also shared by the EC. Specifically, they project: a) an average real
GDP growth of 1.3 percent; b) a productivity rate that increases gradually from the current
0.7 percent to 1.7 percent in 2030 and thereafter; c) a participation rate that raises by 8
percentage points by 2050 (largely due the contribution of women; c) an unemployment rate
that declines from the current 8 percent to 6.4 percent by the end of the period. According to
the recent EC report Age-related public expenditure for the EU25 Member States up to
2050,1 public pension spending in Italy is expected to increase by 0.3-0.4 percent of GDP
from 2005 to 2050. This is one of the smaller increases in the EU and reflects the cumulative
impact of the reforms introduced in the past several years to modify the pension system.
During the same period, healthcare expenditures are expected to increase by 1.4 percent, less
than the EU average.
7. Structural Reforms
The surprisingly good performance of the labor market during this prolonged period of slow
growth confirms the effectiveness of the reforms introduced in the past years. Although some
of the improvement reflects the regularization of illegal immigrants, past reforms have
increased the flexibility of the labor market and facilitated women's participation.
The authorities concur with the staff on the need to shift the balance from employment
protection to enhancing the social safety net. Pending the approval by Parliament of the
second wave of labor market reforms, several measures were adopted in 2005, including an
increase in unemployment benefits and the introduction of active labor market policies.

The Renewed Lisbon Agenda
The authorities agree with the staff on the need to pursue an ambitious agenda of structural
reforms in order to address the underlying problems of the Italian economy. The first national
Plan for Innovation, Growth, and Employment (PICO) is a comprehensive blue-print
developed in accordance with the Renewed Lisbon Agenda. The Plan addresses the main
weaknesses of the economy. In particular, it aims at streamlining administrative procedures,
liberalizing the services markets, and stimulating the accumulation of human capital.
Privatization
As announced in last year's Buff statement, the 2005 privatization measures included an
additional 10 percent sale of the capital stock of the power utility ENEL, reducing the
government holdings to 31 percent. Further asset sales, amounting to 0.7 percent of GDP, are
planned in 2006.
The ‘Poison pill’ provision, introduced in the Italian legal system with the 2006 Budget Law,
is not meant as a substitute for golden shares, having a different content and rationale.2
Law Reforming Bankruptcy Procedures
Last December, the Parliament approved a series of reforms long advocated by staff. They
include revamped legislation concerning bankruptcy and civil procedures. The new Law on
Bankruptcy streamlines procedures, favors an early access to the procedures by reducing the
sanctions for the bankrupt debtor, reinforces the role of reorganization procedures and
introduces the possibility for debtors to negotiate, out of court, restructuring agreements to be
submitted to the bankruptcy judge.
Law on Savings
The Law on Savings, recently approved, addresses several issues including: corporate
governance; the role and capabilities of Supervisory Authorities; the governance of the Bank
of Italy, including the ownership structure, the role of the Board of Directors, and the
Governor’s term of office. The Law's main objectives are to improve corporate governance
of listed companies, increase transparency, and enhance consumer protection. To these aims,
Consob’s resources and sanctioning powers have been increased; minority shareholders'
rights have been enhanced; more stringent rules on external auditors have been introduced;
the compliance with the Corporate Governance Codes has been reinforced. In addition, the
Law subjected banks to the obligation of publishing a full prospectus for unlisted bonds also,
which is approved by Consob. It is worth noting that Consob has been very active in
imposing sanctions on banks whenever they misbehave with respect to the provision of
investment services to retail investors.

Italy has recently responded to the remarks on the golden share put forward by the
Commission in the context of the infringement proceedings initiated against several
European countries.

Finally, the Law transferred the antitrust functions in the banking sector from the Bank of
Italy to the Antitrust Authority and introduced tighter rules as regards the prevention of
conflicts of interest in connected lending.
8. The Financial Sector
Both the Article IV staff paper and the FSSA agree that the Italian banking and financial
sector is generally sound and well regulated. However, this positive assessment is
overshadowed by the characterization of the banking system as fragmented, with a very small
presence of foreign banks in retail markets, with a weaker degree of competition vis-à-vis
other countries, and with relatively high operating expenses and costs of services. This
representation is not borne out by the empirical results presented by staff’s paper and by
available evidence.
Consolidation
In the last decade mergers and acquisitions (M&A) involved target banks accounting for half
of the system’s total assets. The value of the banks’ M&A in the period 1996-2005 was
higher in Italy than in other large continental countries. The Herfindahl-Hirschman
concentration index increased by 40 percent between 1998 and 2004 instead of by 11 percent
as reported in the IMF selected issues paper. The consolidated market share of the top five
banking groups is now about 50 percent, in line with the European average.
Foreign banks
The role of foreign intermediaries has significantly increased. Foreign branches and
subsidiaries account for 8 percent of the banking system’s total assets, which, as staff
acknowledges, is "similar to the share in other western European countries." Moreover,
foreign banks and other foreign investors are important members of the shareholders'
agreements controlling the main Italian banking groups. Foreigners hold an average of 16
percent of the capital of the four largest banking groups, a share higher than in other large
continental countries.
Contestability and Competition
The privatization process in the financial sector, which began in the early 1990s, is almost
completed. All large and almost all medium-sized banks are listed. A large number of
indicators - such as the number of banks in local markets, the turnover in market shares, and
interest rate spreads - show that competition in the banking sector has greatly increased and
is comparable to that of other large European banking systems. This is confirmed by the
IMF's empirical evidence and by the literature quoted in the staff paper. Thus, the final staff
appraisal seems to diverge from the results of their own analysis.
Bank performance
Operating costs as a ratio to bank assets are indeed relatively high in Italy but, in the
international comparison, this indicator is biased as Italian banks offer labor intensive retail
asset management services that in other countries are largely provided by non-bank financial

-6-

intermediaries. Moreover, interbank claims are relatively low due to the efficiency of the
screen-based markets (interbank and Government bond markets).
Comparisons based on the cost-income ratio, which is less biased by differences in the
composition of output, show a different picture. According to official ECB data, in 2004 the
Italian banks’ cost-income ratio was almost 6 percentage points lower than the average for
the euro-area. Asset quality has significantly improved as far as the flow of new bad debts is
concerned. On average, between 2001 and 2004 new bad debts were equal to 1 percent of
loans outstanding at the beginning of each year. The ratio was about 4 percent in the
recession of the early 1990s and remained above 2 percent until 1996. The relatively high
stock of non-performing loans is partly due to the length of bankruptcy procedures. The
authorities are committed to implement the standard 90-day past-due classification before the
transitory period allowed by the Basel committee (i.e. 2012).
9. ODA
Italy fully shares the EU commitment to reach an ODA-to-GDP ratio of 0.56 percent by
2010. The authorities will make all efforts to meet, by the end of 2006, the target of 0.33
percent; this doubles the 2004 results and serves as an intermediate goal to achieving the
target of 0.5 percent in 2010, as agreed in Barcelona and Monterrey.
