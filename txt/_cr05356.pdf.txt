The 2005 Article IV discussions were held in Damascus during
April 18–May 2, 2005. The mission met with Minister Al-Hussein (Minister of
Finance), Governor Mayaleh (Governor of the Central Bank of Syria), Minister Lotfi
(Minister of Economy and Trade), Minister Dardari (Head of the State Planning
Commission), Minister Hadad (Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources),
Minister Al-Kalaa (Minister of Tourism), and Minister Alhaj Aref (Minister of Labor
and Social Affairs). The staff team comprised Mrs. Moalla-Fetini (head),
Messrs. Mikhael, Pani, and Singh (all MCD), Mr. Kisinbay (MFD), Mr. Soueid (ICM),
and Ms. Dakanay (staff assistant). Mr. Kanaan (Alternate Executive Director) joined
the policy discussions.

•

At the conclusion of the 2004 Article IV consultation on April 30, 2004, Executive
Directors commended the authorities for maintaining a stable macroeconomic
framework with external account surpluses and a comfortable international reserve
position in a difficult security environment. They noted that progress had been made
on structural reforms, including a simplification of the exchange rate system, the
adoption of a new income tax law, the introduction of some interest rate flexibility, and
the licensing of private banks. Directors noted, however, that growth remained
moderate and unemployment high, while the fiscal position was weakening and
vulnerable to oil price fluctuations. They agreed that Syria needed to accelerate the
pace of reforms, reduce its dependency on depleting oil reserves, and raise private
investment and growth to reduce unemployment.

•

Significant data weaknesses in terms of coverage, consistency, periodicity, and
timeliness remain. Preliminary balance of payments and monetary statistics are
available up to 2004, while national income and fiscal accounts are available only up to
2003. These weaknesses continue to hamper the staff’s ability to conduct economic
analysis and effective surveillance.

•

Syria continues to avail itself of the transitional provisions of Article XIV, and
maintains exchange measures that are subject to Fund’s approval under
Article VIII.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Recent developments and medium-term prospects
•

Following a significant growth slowdown in 2003 owing to the regional conflict, a
mild recovery—driven by a surge in investment and an upturn in exports—seems to
have started since early 2004. In spite of the troubled international environment, the
recovery is poised to continue in 2005, supported by further strengthening of private
investment and exports. Inflation remained subdued, while the external position
weakened, reflecting a decline in oil exports and unidentified inflows. Nonetheless,
public and external debt remains manageable, and official foreign assets cover more
than 2½ years of imports.

•

Over the medium term, Syria faces a major fiscal and balance of payment shock from
the decline in oil production and the dwindling of oil reserves. In the absence of new
discoveries, Syria is likely to become a net oil importer within a few years and will
exhaust its oil reserves in the late 2020s. This would halve government oil revenues
to about 7½ percent of GDP by 2010, while net foreign exchange receipts from oil
would decline from 14 percent of GDP (US$3 billion) in 2003 to nearly zero by 2010.

Policy discussions
Against this background, discussions focused on two inter-related medium-term challenges
posed by the prospective depletion of oil reserves:
•

The first challenge is to maintain fiscal sustainability and financial stability: staff
welcomed the recent tax and expenditure measures, but recommended that these steps
be developed into a credible fiscal consolidation strategy within a transparent
medium-term fiscal framework, which should target a steady improvement in the
non-oil budget balance. This calls for comprehensive tax and expenditure reforms,
including adopting a broad-based VAT, overhauling the price subsidy system,
downsizing an overstuffed and ill-paid civil service, and restructuring/privatizing
public enterprises. Maintaining financial stability would also require strengthening
the role of the central bank in formulating and implementing monetary and foreign
exchange policies, with a primary focus on price stability, and re-orienting the
activities of the commercial bank of Syria toward traditional commercial banking.

•

The second challenge is to boost growth in order to expand and diversify the
production and export base of the economy before oil resources are exhausted, and
face the high demographic pressures on the labor market. This calls for accelerating
structural reforms to enhance the incentives for the private sector (both domestic and
foreign) to invest, and the capability of the financial sector to intermediate. Priority
areas are further trade liberalization, foreign exchange unification and current account
convertibility, the nurturing of an open, competitive and resilient financial sector, and
institutional reforms aimed at strengthening competition, good governance, property
rights, and the rule of law.

-5-

I. OVERVIEW AND KEY ISSUES
1.
Following a decade of high growth in the 1990s, economic performance has
weakened significantly in recent years, and the medium-term outlook is clouded by the
prospect of declining oil production. The growth acceleration in the early 1990s had
reflected rising oil production and an upsurge in private sector investment prompted by fiscal
incentives and reforms to start the transition to a market economy. In addition, higher oil
revenues allowed the financing of a number of large-scale power projects and infrastructure
development. The leveling off and subsequent decline of oil production, and a sharp
contraction of private investment—as the reforms ebbed and the external environment
became less hospitable—led to a significant growth slowdown (Figures 1 and 2). Real
economic growth averaged only 1¼ percent a year in 1999–2003, lagging population growth
and leading to a decline in living standards and an increase in unemployment. The mediumterm prospects are worrisome given that oil, which presently contributes 20 percent of GDP,
two-thirds of exports, and half of government revenues (about 15 percent of GDP), is likely
to be exhausted in the late 2020s and Syria may become a net oil importer within a few years.
2.
Rising international oil prices starting in mid-1999 helped maintain financial
stability in the face of declining oil production. Buoyant oil revenues contributed to low
inflation, stable exchange rates, and strong external balances. As a result, public debt was
kept at relatively moderate levels, while official foreign assets were built up to over 2¾ years
of imports.
3.
Against this background, government policies and Fund advice since the early
2000s have focused primarily on structural reforms to boost growth and also on
strengthening the medium-term budgetary outlook, given the prospective decline in oil
revenues. While there has been agreement on the overall strategy, differences have mainly
been related to the pace of reform.
4.

Therefore, two key issues are at the heart of the policy agenda in Syria:

•

Fiscal sustainability: Syria’s budget has been relying increasingly on oil revenues
and the trend increase in international oil prices has led to a creeping increase in
public spending. By 2003,

spending rose to an amount

Box 1. Fund Policy Recommendation and Implementation
Fund policy recommendations were supportive of the authorities’ reform agenda aimed at furthering the
transition to a market economy, strengthening the incentive system, improving price signals, promoting
private sector activity, and strengthening the medium-term fiscal outlook.
Although the pace of reforms has fallen short of Fund advice, progress has been made in a number of
areas over the past few years,¹ but the reform agenda remains substantial.
Price, trade, and foreign exchange liberalization: The number of official exchange rates has been
reduced and their level adjusted. The surrender requirement has been fully phased out. With the gradual
move towards unified exchange rates, implicit price subsidies have been largely eliminated. Prices have
been liberalized, except those of a few subsidized commodities and of a few goods, which are still
predominantly produced by public enterprises. In foreign trade, positive lists of importable goods have
been replaced with a negative list, customs procedures have been streamlined, import duties have been
simplified and tariffs lowered, and free trade agreements have been signed with several countries.
Notwithstanding this progress, Syria has yet to unify its exchange rate market and adopt current account
convertibility, while its foreign trade regime remains one of the most restrictive in the world.
Financial sector reform: Banking and insurance have been opened to the private sector. With Fund
assistance, a comprehensive banking regulatory framework has been set up and supervision capacity
built up. A credit and monetary council has been reactivated as a step toward a more active monetary
policy, and some flexibility in interest rates has been introduced. Nonetheless, 98 percent of financial
assets are still held by state banks, the level of financial intermediation is very low, and the government
has yet to launch a T-bill market as a pre-requisite for the development of financial markets and the
proper pricing of financial assets.
In the tax field: The income tax has been simplified and marginal rates lowered substantially, various
specific taxes were consolidated into a single ad valorum consumption tax, and much of the remaining
tax legislation has been reviewed and streamlined. Nonetheless, the tax regime is still complex, with
widespread exemptions and tax liabilities which are subject to negotiations between tax collectors and
taxpayers.
Public administration and PEs: Limited progress has been achieved in this area. An overstuffed and
ill-paid civil service is still a major impediment to effective economic management and reform
implementation, while PEs—operating under a soft budget constraint—continues to drain resources and
hinder the growth of the private sector (see Box 2).

Box 2. The Size of PEs and Their Contribution to the Public Accounts’ Deficit
PEs continues to play an important role in the economy, in particular in the energy and utilities’ sectors, and in
financial services. Overall, PEs account for about 30–35 percent of GDP. They are dominant in the energy sector,
where the share of international companies in total production is limited to about 25 percent. They are also dominant in
the financial sector, where the share of private banks’ assets is less than 2 percent of total financial assets, and they enjoy
a monopoly in all utilities. However, all agriculture (about 35 percent of non-oil GDP) and over 75 percent of
non-government-non-financial services (about 45 percent of non-oil GDP) are in private hands. The role of the public sector
in manufacturing—which represents only about 8 percent of non-oil GDP—is unclear, although it may be high, as PEs
continue to enjoy a monopoly in cement, oil and sugar refining, fertilizers, and mineral water (see Table 13 of the Statistical
Appendix). Through their monopoly privileges or privileged role in key supply chains such as in cotton and cereals, PEs
limit private investment both directly, through prohibition, and indirectly, through unfair competition and crowding out.
However, the share of PEs in total employment is relatively small, as they are mainly concentrated in capital
intensive sectors. In 2002, PEs employed 296 thousand people, out of a total estimated employment of 4.8 million people,¹
a relatively small share compared to other countries, which suggests that addressing redundant labor in PEs in the context of
a PE reform would be relatively less challenging than in other countries (Statistical Appendix Table 12).

PEs operates under a soft budget constraint, with their operational deficits covered by the budget and most of their
investment needs met by on-lending by the budget. This, at times, has contributed as much as 35 percent of total non-oil
budget deficits. On-lending by the budget has seldom been repaid and has been frequently written-off and converted into
government participation in PEs’ capital. Large deficits in PEs reflect low investment, poor management skills, and
quasi-fiscal activities.

Budgetary financing of PEs has avoided the typical source of risk to the soundness of state banks from exposure to
loss making PEs. Except the relatively large stock of loans to the general organizations for cereals and cotton, which
administer two of the main government price support policies, the stock of bank loans to other PEs is less that 2 percent of
GDP (Statistical Appendix Table 40).

5.
This year’s Article IV consultation discussions took place against the backdrop
of difficult political circumstances. Following economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. in
May 2004 and a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for the withdrawal of Syrian troops
from Lebanon, regional tensions have escalated in recent months. The Ba’ath Party Congress
held in June 2005 renewed commitment to reforms and called on the government to establish
a timetable to push reforms forward.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. Developments in 2003–04
6.
Following a slowdown in 2003, a mild recovery seems to have started in 2004.
The slowdown in 2003 reflected declining oil production, a poor harvest, and the impact of
the conflict in Iraq on exports and investment. An expansionary fiscal stance (see below)
cushioned the impact of these shocks and helped limit the slowdown in economic activity to
1¼ percent. A recovery in private sector exports and a surge in the volume of investment
approvals and in imports together with the continued expansion of credit to the private sector

1

This would result from the projected natural growth rate of working age population (3 percent annual average)
and a modest education-driven increase in labor force participation rates.

2

The rate of job creation has declined from 4.8 percent in the 1990s to about 2.9 percent a year since 2000,
while unemployment is estimated to have risen from 9½ percent in 2000 to 14 percent in 2004.

suggest that the economy recovered somewhat in 2004, growing at 2½–3 percent.3 A boost in

Inflation picked up in 2003 but decelerated somewhat in 2004. The pick up
of inflation in 2003 reflected mainly a nominal effective depreciation of the Syrian pound—
driven by the appreciation of the
Consumer Price Inflation, 1990-2004
20
euro—and the impact of the drought.
Inflation started to decelerate in early

somewhat previous concerns about a
monetary overhang. The introduction

Fiscal policies have remained expansionary in 2003 and 2004. In 2003, the non-oil
budget deficit widened by 2½ percentage points of GDP to 18 percent, reflecting a
combination of lower non-oil revenues—largely due to the economic slowdown—and higher
spending on investment, defense, and wages (Tables 3 and 4). The increase in the wage bill
reflected the carry forward from the 20 percent wage increase in mid-2002 and additional
hiring to support employment (see Box 3). No data on the fiscal out-turn in 2004 are yet

available. However, the cost of an additional 20 percent wage increase in mid-year may have
been offset by an increase in trade taxes owing to the surge in imports and some decline in
development expenditures, leaving the non-oil balance unchanged. In September 2004, and
as a step toward implementing a VAT, a new consumption tax5 was introduced—which is
estimated to yield some 0.7 percent of GDP on an annual basis—and diesel prices were
raised closer to international levels.6 The overall budget deficit was about 2¾ percent of
GDP in 2003, but with the decline in oil revenues in 2004, the deficit is estimated at close to
5 percent of GDP.

Box 3. Government Employment and Wage Policies
Government’s wage and employment policies in recent years have been aimed at
correcting the erosion in wages during the early 1990s and at supporting the sluggish
labor demand. As a result, the wage bill has increased steadily from 3½ percent of
GDP in 1997 to 5.6 percent in 2003, a level which is comparable to other countries.
However, salaries are still 40 to 45 percent lower than those in the private sector, while
government employment is already close to 20 percent of total employment, a level
which is high compared to the experience in other countries.

In response to the slack in the economy and consistent with the policy to support
private sector growth, credit policy was eased in 2003–04. State banks were encouraged to
expand their credit facilities by raising the ceiling on single loans and relaxing the collateral
requirements somewhat,

Following the restructuring of the old
Soviet-era government debt to Poland, the Czech republic, Russia and the Slovak Republic in
late 2004 and early 2005, Syria’s external debt stands at US$6.5 billion (equivalent to about
25 percent of GDP),12 while total public debt stands at 39 percent of GDP.
12.
Reflecting the generally strong external position, the Syrian pound has remained
stable in relation to the U.S. dollar in the parallel market since the early 1990s.13 A
stable exchange rate, in turn, helped maintain low inflation by stabilizing the price of imports
and anchoring inflation expectations. The depreciation of the U.S. dollar since mid-2001
helped correct the real appreciation that had built through 2001 and the real effective
exchange rate in the parallel market is back at its 1995 level. Consequently, Syria’s price
competitiveness vis-à-vis neighboring countries such as Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan has
improved, while it has deteriorated vis-à-vis Egypt and Tunisia, and remained the same
vis-à-vis Morocco (Figure 4).

10

Unidentified inflows cover a range of activities including shuttle trade with neighboring countries, valuation
gains on official foreign assets, unrecorded workers’ remittances and deposits of Syrian expatriates in domestic
banks.
11

BIS data suggest that the Syrian banking system’s assets may be higher (US$24 billion). The reason for the
inconsistency is still unclear. Staff will pursue this issue including through TA.
12

Restructuring led to a reduction of the stock of debt to US$2.6 billion—with the debt relief obtained on the
debt to Russia close to 90 percent.

13

The exchange system in Syria is characterized by multiple exchange rates and a foreign exchange market
segmented into a public and private sector pools. The parallel market rate, which applies to most private sector
exports and imports, has been hovering around SL47-54 per U.S. dollar since the early 1990s. Official rates,
which apply to public sector transactions, have been gradually unified and depreciated in steps (Annex II).

B. Prospects for 2005
13.
In spite of the troubled international environment, moderate growth is likely to
continue in 2005. The surge in investment approvals in 2004 and strong tourist arrivals14
indicate further strengthening of private investment and exports. These factors are expected
to fully offset the impact of further decline in oil production and a likely contractionary fiscal
impulse (see below). The recent political events in Lebanon seem to have had only a limited
impact on domestic investors and consumers’ confidence, and on workers’ remittances from
Lebanon.15 Notwithstanding the increase in oil prices, the current account would weaken
further reflecting the decline in the volume of oil exports, with partial offset from buoyant
tourism. Tighter fiscal policies are likely to keep inflation low, with staff projecting a rate of
4 percent (December on December).16
14.
Fiscal policies promise to be somewhat tighter in 2005. With the 2004 tax
measures and a planned tightening of investment spending, the 2005 budget aims to lower
the budget deficit significantly and staff is projecting a 1 percentage point improvement in
the non-oil budget deficit to 17 percent of GDP. The impact on the overall budget deficit
would be partly offset by further decline in oil revenues, limiting the improvement in the
overall budget balance to some ½ percentage point of GDP.
C. Medium-Term Outlook and Risks
15.
The medium-term outlook is adversely affected by the prospect of declining oil
production. Under WEO-based oil export price assumptions, and based on available
information on Syria’s proven energy reserves in oil and in natural gas and on the authorities’
projections of the profile of extraction activities in both sectors, staff projects that in the
absence of new discoveries, Syria is likely to become a net oil importer in 4–6 years and will
exhaust its oil reserves towards the late 2020s.17 This, in turn, would lower government oil
revenues from 15¼ percent of GDP in 2003 to 7½ percent by 2010, and to 3 percent by
2020.18 Meanwhile, net foreign exchange receipts from the oil sector would decline from

14

Preliminary first-quarter data show a 25 percent increase in arrivals over the same period of 2004.

15

With total workers’ remittances estimated at 2½ percent of GDP, Syria relies much less on remittances than
neighbors such as Jordan and Lebanon.

16

Staff projects an average inflation of 10 percent in 2005, reflecting the carry forward from the one-off taxinduced adjustment in prices in late 2004.
17

In the coming five years oil production is expected to decline at an average annual rate of 5½ percent,
exerting a contractionary impact on overall GDP of about 1 percent.
18

Assuming average real economic growth of 4 percent and constant domestic prices in real terms.

14 percent of GDP (US$3.0 billion) in 2003 to nearly zero in 2011 and the energy import bill
could reach 8 percent of GDP in 2020 (Figure 5, Annex III).19
16.
This outlook underscores the need to accelerate structural reforms to create new
sources of growth and foreign exchange earnings and to implement a medium-term
fiscal consolidation strategy to preserve fiscal solvency. Without stepped up structural and
fiscal reforms, growth is unlikely to exceed 4–4½ percent—short of what is needed to
contain the trend increase in unemployment—while financial stability could only be
maintained for few more years by drawing down international reserves. Staff presented the
authorities with illustrative scenarios highlighting the risks and the critical trade-offs (see
Annex IV).
III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
17.
The authorities agreed broadly that the key challenges facing the Syrian
economy were low growth and adverse prospects for the energy sector. They stressed
their commitment to continuing to push ahead with the reform agenda, while
maintaining financial stability. They emphasized that key measures are being implemented
aimed at modernizing the economy, completing the transition to a market economy, and
increasing Syria’s integration with the rest of the world. The discussions focused on the
challenges ahead and how best to address them, in particular on polices to preserve financial
stability and promote growth.
A. Policies to Maintain Financial Stability
Fiscal consolidation
18.
Staff supported the recent tax and expenditure measures but suggested that
these measures should be part of a comprehensive fiscal consolidation strategy within a
medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF). For the reasons explained in Box 4, staff
suggested that the MTFF should target a steady improvement in the non-oil balance. Building
on the adjustment during 2005, additional yearly adjustments of about 1¼ percentage points
of GDP of the non-oil budget deficit would need to be sustained over the next five years to
contain the rise in public debt, contributes to the external accounts’ adjustment, and
strengthen the long-term fiscal outlook. The authorities agreed with the need for further fiscal
consolidation, although they did not commit to a specific pace and magnitude of such
adjustment or indicate its composition.

19

In 2003, non-oil exports, which were equivalent to 15 percent of GDP, barely covered 50 percent of total
imports.

Box 4. What Should Be the Main Objective of a
Medium-Term Fiscal Framework in Syria?
There are two possible fiscal objectives for a medium-term framework in Syria: (i) maintaining a
budget balance, which is roughly the existent framework, or (ii) achieving a steady improvement in the
non-oil budget balance. Fiscal performance under both rules will depend on the exogenous path of oil
revenues:
•

If oil revenues decline smoothly, the two rules would deliver broadly similar outcomes: a
balanced budget would force a steady improvement in the non-oil budget balance as oil
revenues decline, and conversely a steady adjustment in the non-oil budget balance will ensure
a balanced budget to adjust for the decline in oil revenues.

•

If oil revenues are to level off before declining abruptly, then a balanced budget rule will be an
inferior anchor as it would postpone adjustment. Targeting a steady improvement in the non-oil
budget balance would ensure that some of the oil revenues, while they last, are saved and used
as a buffer to smooth the adjustment later.

Given the inherent uncertainty about the expected profile of extraction and international oil prices, a
steady improvement in the non-oil budget balance as the objective of the medium-term fiscal framework
would stem time-inconsistent and short-sighted policies. It will have the added benefit of preventing
volatility in oil prices from contributing to output volatility.

2003, the introduction of the new consumption tax and recent broadening of its base, as well
as the recent measure to reduce stamp duties on financial transactions. Preparatory work is
underway to create a large taxpayer unit, a system of a single taxpayer identification number,
and procedures for self-assessment in preparation for launching the VAT within 2–3 years.
20.
Regarding public expenditure reform, the authorities noted the recent
strengthening of the budgetary procedures to improve the efficiency of investment spending.
The next possible step was a comprehensive review of public expenditure to help identify
additional measures, which could contribute durable savings while enhancing the supply side
of the economy. The review could focus in particular on: (i) overhauling the existing subsidy
system, whose excessive costs suggest the potential for large efficiency gains and fiscal
savings (see Annex V); and (ii) reforming the civil service to address overstaffing, low pay,
and lack of skills and performance. The authorities stressed that the pace of reform should
avoid the disruption and dislocations associated with too rapid changes, and an appropriate
level of social protection needs to be maintained to preserve social peace. They are in
particular concerned about any layoffs before a pick up in private sector activity improves
labor market prospects.
21.
The authorities agreed that PE reform was a critical component of the reform
program given the drain PEs exert on public finances. To this effect a new PE law has
been passed in late 2004 granting PEs greater autonomy—including freedom to borrow,
contract private management teams, and engage in joint venture with the private sector. In
addition, the authorities are aiming to restructure enterprises than can be restructured and
develop case-by-case solutions, including liquidation, to deal with the rest, while avoiding
adding pressures on the labor market. Staff welcomed this approach and encouraged the
authorities to deepen reform in this area, including privatizing selected enterprises, and
allowing PEs full flexibility in employment decisions, and in wage and pricing policies.
Monetary policy and a more efficient monetary framework
22.
Regarding credit policy, the authorities noted that the current stance of monetary
policy will be maintained for the time being and state banks encouraged to expand their loans
to the private sector further. Staff agreed that the present level of interest rates seems
appropriate, as inflation remains subdued and there are no indication of weakening private
savings. Staff also agreed that given the low level of private sector credit, the continuation of
the current pace of credit expansion would not carry significant inflationary risks. However,
staff warned that care should be taken to strengthen risk management capacity at state banks,
as a too rapid expansion of credit might lead to an accumulation of bad debts and
unprofitable projects being financed by politically-motivated loans.

- 22 -

23.
Regarding the monetary framework, the authorities indicated that the fact that the
Commercial Bank of Syria (CboS)20 is acting de facto as the banker and the fiscal agent of
the government complicated the task of policy coordination. To this effect, they plan to
reorient the activities of the CBoS towards commercial banking, make the CB act as the
fiscal agent, and improve coordination of liquidity and public debt management. In this
connection, they planned to move the bulk of foreign assets of the CBoS to the CB. Staff
agreed and underscored the importance of moving swiftly on the much delayed agenda of
launching a government’s securities market, which would be critical for financial sector
development and moving towards market-determined interest rates. Dealing with the foreign
assets held at the CBoS and the “nonperforming” old “treasuries” currently held by the CB21
offered an excellent opportunity to introduce tradable government securities—a step that
could be followed by regular auctions of new securities. Staff also suggested that to improve
liquidity management, the CB could consider introducing new instruments such as short-term
certificates of deposits or deposit facilities, and to enforce more strictly and use more actively
reserve requirements. The staff offered technical assistance in this area.
B. Accelerating Structural Reforms
24.
The authorities and staff agreed that the sharp decline in private investment was
the most immediate cause for the low growth in recent years and that persistent
weaknesses in the business climate are the main factors holding up investment. Indeed,
the abundance of domestic savings—as evidenced by significant current account surpluses
and large reported holdings of Syrian private assets abroad—suggests that the main
constraint to private investment is not the availability of investible funds. Rather, weaknesses
in the regulatory environment, in the tax, trade and exchange regimes, in the financial sector,
and in public administration, as well as government monopolies and poor governance weigh
negatively on returns to private investment, and hence appear to be the main constraints to
growth. Accordingly, all agreed that reforms should remain focused on strengthening the
incentives of the private sector (both domestic and foreign) to invest—including by moving
further on trade and foreign exchange liberalization and on strengthening market
institutions—and enhancing the ability of the financial sector to intermediate.
Foreign exchange and trade liberalization
25.
The authorities remain committed to unifying the exchange rate system. To this
end, they have recently taken an important step toward unification by allowing banks to

21

Staff suggested a swap operation by which the government would replace the old treasuries held by the
central bank with marketable securities, which the central bank could then use to buy the bulk of the CboS’s net
foreign assets.

finance private sector imports of raw materials and intermediate goods.22 Subsequently, the
CBoS stopped quoting the so called “private sector rate” and the central bank started to quote
a band within which the newly allowed transactions will take place. Furthermore, starting in
January 2005, the use of the most appreciated official rate has been limited to debt service
payments under certain bilateral payments agreements, and the remaining most appreciated
rate has been adjusted to within 3–4 percent of the parallel market rate.

1/ Starting May 6, the CBoS stopped quoting a rate for the private sector transactions and the central bank started quoting an
exchange rate band with which banks would finance all private sector imports of raw materials and intermediate goods

26.
The staff welcomed the recent steps and encouraged the authorities to move
swiftly toward full unification and current account convertibility. Given the narrow
spread between the official rate and the free market rate, the attendant risks appear limited.
The authorities agreed on the need to accelerate the process of unification, but felt that the
present climate of political uncertainty prevents a bolder move at the moment.
27.
The authorities announced that after unification a managed float will be
adopted. They agreed with staff that flexibility within a relatively narrow band would be
desirable initially, to allow the exchange rate to continue to serve as a nominal anchor.
Progress in developing a deep and liquid foreign exchange market, in firming up an
intervention policy, in developing an alternative nominal anchor and in setting the proper
regulation to supervise banks’ exposure to exchange rate risk could pave the way toward
greater flexibility, at a later stage. Meanwhile, staff suggested that the CB should define and

market.

clarify the modalities of its intervention in the foreign exchange market in support of the
exchange rate band it has started to quote.
28.
Trade liberalization remains a key element of the authorities’ reform agenda. To
this effect further progress has been made in the past year in reducing tariff rates,
compressing the negative list, and streamlining customs procedures.23 A breakthrough has
been achieved in September 2004 with the initialization of the Syria/EU Association
Agreement. A free-trade agreement has been signed with Turkey, while the provisions of the
trade agreement under the Greater Arab Free Trade Area have been fully phased in as
scheduled in early 2005. The authorities also indicated that a new Customs Law and a new
tariff structure, which envisages a reduction of the maximum tariff rate from 230 percent to
50 percent and the number of tariff bands from 10 to 5, will be adopted shortly. Staff
suggested that the tariff reduction in the context of recent bilateral and regional trade
agreements may have limited growth benefits and a limited impact on growth, unless it is
accompanied by other measures aimed at reducing non-tariff barriers (NTBs), which remain
widespread.24
Financial sector development
29.
Nurturing further development of the financial sector remains a key component
of the authorities’ reform program. Following a successful first year, the three private
banks that started operations in 2004 are planning further expansion. Three additional private
banks have been licensed and will start operations before the end of this year. A law has been
passed opening the insurance industry to the private sector and a private insurance
company—the first since 1960—has already started operation. Other legislative decrees were
issued allowing Islamic banking and greater flexibility in the operations of state banks.
Regulations on bank accounting, liquidity management, and internal audits were adopted,
and CB’s supervision capacity strengthened, although poor accounting standards for banks
continue to impair the ability of proper supervision.
30.
Staff encouraged the authorities to develop a more comprehensive state-bank
restructuring strategy. The restructuring of the loans of the agricultural bank raised
concerns about the health of all state banks and underscores the need to develop individual
strategies to improve the structure, operations, and performance of each bank and to
strengthen their credit-risk assessment capacity. Staff also suggested that plans to encourage
the Savings Bank to step-up its lending activities be reconsidered, as this institution has
traditionally focused on deposit mobilization to finance the government and does not have
expertise in commercial banking.
23

24

Thirteen separate documents were merged into a single declaration form.

According to a recent trade study by the World Bank, NTBs raise the price of imported goods by 19 percent
on average, against only 8 percent for tariffs, while other trade-related barriers add 15 percent to the cost of both
exports and imports.

- 25 -

Institutional reforms
31.
Beyond these traditional areas, the authorities outlined the main components of
a broader agenda of institutional reforms aimed at strengthening competition, good
governance, property rights, and the rule of law. Judiciary reform would aim at
strengthening the independence of the judiciary branch and at updating legislation and
improving the process and effectiveness of business-related penal cases. Laws are being
prepared on trade, corporate code, commercial arbitration, protection of commercial and
industrial ownership rights, competition and anti-monopoly, and foreign direct investment. In
addition, the 10th congress of the Ba’ath party gave particular prominence to a resolution to
fight corruption, marking the first official recognition of this problem.
32.
Staff noted the recent passage of the amended AML/CFT law and encouraged the
authorities to review the recent LEG/MFD technical assistance report on “Measures to
Combat Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism” (April 2005) as a useful
mechanism to guide future efforts on AML/CFT.
Statistical issues
33.
While acknowledging some progress in improving economic statistics, staff
encouraged the authorities to give high priority to addressing remaining serious
deficiencies in the quality, coverage, and timeliness of NIA, prices, and fiscal data. In
this context, the staff welcomed the authorities’ plan to expand the coverage of the CPI to
3,000 items and to launch a new survey of economic activity to improve the quality of the
NIA statistics. Staff encouraged the authorities to subscribe to the Generalized Data
Dissemination System (GDDS), which would provide an excellent supporting environment
for Syria to continue to develop its statistical infrastructure, and to nominate a national
coordinator to develop a metadata. Fund technical assistance have been provided in the
statistical and other areas, including through METAC.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
The authorities have continued to make progress in addressing key structural
rigidities and in strengthening the medium-term budgetary outlook. The main policies—
liberalizing prices, trade and foreign exchange, reforming the financial sector including a
more active monetary framework, enhancing tax revenues, improving public administration
and public enterprises, and promoting a greater role for the private sector—have long been at
the core of Article IV recommendations. The progress achieved so far has made a difference
in Syria’s economic landscape: prices have been largely liberalized, the trade and foreign
exchange regimes have been simplified and liberalized, the tax system has been streamlined,
and the private sector’s field of activity has been broadened to virtually all sectors of the
economy, including banking and insurance.

- 26 -

35.
Notwithstanding this progress, the supply response, so far, and the fiscal outlook
suggest that the pace and the scope of reforms have been insufficient compared to
Syria’s medium-term challenges. Pulled down by a shrinking oil sector, the economy’s
growth potential has contracted sharply in the past few years, and financial stability
challenges have been masked by the increase in international oil prices. If structural reforms
and fiscal consolidation are not accelerated, there is a risk that oil reserves will be exhausted
before the ongoing reforms have had time to generate new sources of growth and income.
If this risk were to materialize, Syria might get locked in a cycle of financial volatility, fiscal
deterioration, low growth, rising unemployment, and social unrest.
36.
Therefore, a comprehensive program of fiscal consolidation and accelerated
structural reforms is urgently needed. A strong and credible fiscal consolidation strategy
within a transparent MTFF will be key in maintaining financial stability and instilling
confidence about Syria’s fiscal solvency. Given the high uncertainty about international oil
prices, the level of oil reserves, and the extraction path, the MTFF should target a steady
improvement in the non-oil budget balance with the government’s inter-temporal budget
constraint in clear perspective. By strengthening the supply-side of the economy and placing
the non-oil budget deficit on a firm, declining path, such a comprehensive program could
unleash synergies between confidence, growth and fiscal consolidation. Moreover, the
dwindling of the oil rent also calls for a paradigm shift in the use of macroeconomic policies
from instruments to redistribute the oil rent to instruments for short-term macroeconomic
stabilization and financial stability.
37.
The recent measures taken to start addressing the fiscal challenge are welcome
but need to be developed into a more comprehensive fiscal reform package. Work on
revamping tax administration needs to be sustained to prepare for a successful launch of the
VAT. Greater efforts at simplifying tax provisions and removing tax exemptions are needed
to increase efficiency, lower the compliance costs to taxpayers, and nurture trust in the tax
system. Overhauling the price subsidy system could be a major source of efficiency gains
and fiscal savings. Regarding wage policy, while it is important to align civil service wages
to those in the market to attract the required skills to run a modern public administration, this
objective needs to be pursued hand in hand with accelerated reforms to create employment
opportunities outside of government to allow redeployment.
38.
The recent law giving PEs greater autonomy is welcome, but a more
comprehensive strategy is needed. The reform should entail anti-trust legislation, equal
access to goods markets, including government contracts, removing monopolies, and giving
PEs’ management the necessary leeway to make independent employment and pricing
decisions. While the comprehensive coverage of the operations of PEs in the budgetary
accounts is welcome, PEs should be subjected to the discipline of the market and their links
to the budget should be severed, once reform of the state banks is firmly underway.
Consideration should also be given to privatizing/liquidating selected PEs.

- 27 -

39.
The authorities should monitor credit developments and watch for possible
inflationary risks associated with the fast-paced credit expansion. Credit risk could be
high given state-banks’ limited lending experience and weak risk management capacity, the
lack of a national credit scoring system or other historical tools to assess risk, and the still
fragile regulatory and supervision capacity of the CB. While the low stock of outstanding
credit limits inflationary risks, those risks would be higher than otherwise if credits mainly
finance domestic consumer goods—while enterprises continue to be credit constrained.
40.
The authorities’ intention to strengthen the role of the CB in formulating and
implementing monetary and foreign exchange policies and to reorient the activities of
the CBoS toward traditional commercial banking is welcome. The authorities are
encouraged to implement the decision to move the bulk of foreign assets of the CBoS to the
CB and should provide the CBoS with remunerated financial instruments in return. In this
context also, the CB and the ministry of finance should work together for a better
coordination of liquidity and public debt management. The monetization of government debt
raises risks to the medium-term inflation outlook, in view of the limited instruments the CB
can use. Launching a government’s securities market would be critical for providing an
efficient yield curve and a risk-free rate of return, which are essential for the proper pricing
of financial assets.
41.
The steady progress toward exchange rate unification is welcome. However,
Syria should move more quickly to adopt current account convertibility and full
unification. Full unification would simplify the exchange regime significantly, bring to the
official channels a large share of financial transactions, reduce transaction costs for the
private sector, and send a strong signal to the markets.
42.
Despite significant steps taken recently, the trade system remains complex and
quite restrictive. Staff encourages the authorities to introduce promptly the new tariff
structure, which envisages a reduction of the maximum tariff rate from 235 percent to
50 percent and the number of tariff lines from 10 to 5–6. Staff also encourages the authorities
to compress the negative list of importable goods, and tackle trade-related barriers, which
hamper the competitiveness of Syrian exports.
43.
Staff welcomes the recent measures to promote an open and competitive
financial sector capable of meeting the growing needs of a market economy. In
particular, opening the insurance sector for private initiative is an important sign of the
commitment of the authorities to promoting the role of the private sector in the economy,
while cuts in taxes on financial intermediation will provide a useful boost to this nascent
sector. The introduction of Islamic banking will meet a need among large segments of the
population and would bring back to the formal channels a significant share of financial
intermediation, which had been diverted into informal, inefficient, and potential unsafe cash
credit market. Looking forward, staff encourages the authorities to give top priority to
restructuring state-owned banks to stem losses and promote competition, and to continue to
work on strengthening bank regulation and supervision and banks’ accounting standards and
carefully screen entry of new banks.

- 28 -

44.
Staff welcomes the broader agenda of institutional reforms. In particular, the
recent resolution of the governing party to fight corruption and strengthen governance is
welcome and should be followed up actively. Work on strengthening the legal framework for
a market economy should be stepped up. The authorities are also encouraged to continue
their efforts to refine and upgrade their legislative and regulatory framework for AML/CFT
to bring it in line with international standards.
45.
There are still important shortcomings in the coverage, timeliness, and
consistency of economic data in most sectors, including financial soundness indicators,
which hinder monitoring of economic developments, in-depth economic analysis, and the
staff’s ability to conduct effective surveillance. In this context, staff is encouraged by the
greater willingness of the authorities to share available data on a regular basis and encourages
the authorities to participate in the GDDS and to continue to work on addressing the
remaining serious data deficiencies.
46.
Syria continues to maintain exchange restrictions under Article XIV, Section 2
(Appendix I). The staff urges the authorities to eliminate these restrictions as soon as its
balance of payments permits. Syria also maintains exchange measures subject to approval
under Article VIII (Appendix I). Absent specific measures to eliminate these exchange
restrictions and multiple currency practices in a timely manner, the staff does not recommend
that the Executive Board grant approval of their retention. The staff urges the authorities to
eliminate these restrictions and multiple currency practices without delay.
47.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

ANNEX III

Medium- to Long-Term Prospects for the Energy Sector and
Their Fiscal and Balance of Payments Implications
Projections about energy production in the medium term are fraught with uncertainty
stemming from whether ongoing investments in exploration will lead to new discoveries.
Given this high uncertainty, policies should be based on the level of proven reserves, treating
as an upside risk the possibility of new discoveries.
According to the latest information, Syria’s proven oil reserves vary between 2.3–2.5 billion
barrels, while its proven natural gas reserves vary between 240 to 500 billion cubic meters of
natural gas.25 Regarding oil, production reached 600 thousands barrel per day in 1996, and
had declined since then to about 460 thousand barrel per day in 2004. According to the
ministry of petroleum and mineral resources, oil production is expected to continue to decline
until 2016 (at an average annual rate of 5 percent) as some of the mature oil fields reach
exhaustion. From 2012 on, oil production would level off at about 275 thousands per day
until exhaustion around 2025. Regarding natural gas, Syria has started to invest in the natural
gas sector since the late eighties and the level of production has increased steadily to
4.8 billion of cubic meters in 2004. This level is projected to continue to rise to some
10.5 billion cubic meters by 2010 and to 11.8 billions by 2015. If it were to stabilize at that
level, reserves will last another 10 to 15 years, depending on the level of reserves.
One of the strategies pursued in the past few years to face the challenge from rapidly
declining oil reserves has been to substitute natural gas to oil. The greatest potential for that
is in electricity generation but some potential is also being exploited in public transportation.
In electricity generation, the share of natural gas has increased from 40 percent in 2002 to
55 percent now. The aim is to increase this share to 75 percent by 2011.
Given the ongoing substitution from oil to natural gas, projections about the future path of
net oil exports and growth of value added in mining were based on a consolidated picture of
the energy sector. The baseline scenario is based on the following assumptions: (i) an income
elasticity of energy demand of 1.2, comparable to the average in developing countries, (ii) an
average growth rate of non-oil GDP, as a proxy for incomes, of 5 percent, and (iii) a rate of
extraction of natural gas equal to the growth rate of domestic demand (for final use and for
electricity generation), as prospects for natural gas exports are still uncertain.

Data compiled by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) as of November 2004,
based on the BP Statistical Review, the Oil & Gas Journal, and the World Oil, and the
International Association for Natural Gas (CEDIGAS). According to the EIA, there is a
90 percent probability that additional oil reserves, amounting to about ½ billion barrels, could
be discovered in the near future.
25

- 40 -

ANNEX III

Implication for the balance of payments
Based on the above assumptions, net exports of oil (including profit repatriation of
international oil companies) would decline from US$3 billions in 2003 (equivalent to
14 percent of GDP) to zero by 2011. Syria would then become a net oil importer and by
2020, imports would need to cover 35 percent of domestic consumption. The corresponding
energy bill would amount to about 3.5 percent of GDP (Figure 4).
Implication for government revenues from oil
Government revenues from the oil sector are a function of the domestic and international
sales of oil and of their respective prices.26 Up until 1999, the domestic sales prices of
petroleum products were on average higher than international prices and hence net revenues
accruing to the government were equal to the revenues that would have accrued to the
government if all production had been sold at international prices, plus net taxes.27 Starting in
2000, as a result of the surge in international oil prices that was not fully passed through to
domestic prices, the domestic consumption of petroleum products has become increasingly
subsidized. Net subsidies are estimated at 3.7 percent of GDP in 2004.
Assuming constant domestic prices in real terms, a constant real exchange rate, and the WEO
assumptions about the international oil prices, staff projections show that (Figure 5):
•

Oil price subsidies would decline from a projected 6½ percent of GDP in 2005 to
1¾ percent in 2010 and to less than ½ percent in 2015, driven by the decline in the
spread between international and domestic prices as a result of the projected decline
in international oil price over this period.

•

The cost of the price subsidy combined with the decline in oil production and the
projected decline in international oil prices would drive net government revenues
from an estimated 15 percent of GDP in 2003 to 8 percent by 2010 and to less than
5 percent by 2020.

So far the government has not derived any revenues from its natural gas resources. Gas is
sold to the final consumers as well as to power plants at cost, i.e., about US$65 per metric
ton. Only a very limited export infrastructure has been developed so far to export natural gas
to Lebanon, hence the opportunity costs is hard to assess. Nonetheless the export weighted
average price of European, Japanese and U.S. natural gas reported in the World Economic
Outlook provide, which is currently equal to US$170 per metric ton, provides an order of
magnitude.
26

These revenues are net of production costs and the share that accrues to international oil
companies operating some of Syria’s oil fields.

ANNEX IV

Illustrative Medium-Term Scenarios
The impact of the prospective balance of payments and fiscal shock on growth and
macroeconomic stability in the medium-term will depend on government’s policy response.
If the actual pace and depth of reforms is maintained, non-oil exports are likely to expand
only moderately, while foreign direct investment and other capital flows are likely to remain
modest. In this case, policymakers will be confronted with one main policy issue, namely the
extent to which foreign reserves are used to contain the impact of the decline in oil exports.
Two polar options highlight the critical trade-offs:
•

At one extreme the authorities might target constant foreign assets. In this case: (i) the
decline in oil exports will constrain the volume of imports, and hence growth, and put
pressures on the real exchange rate, and (ii) the decline in budgetary oil revenues will
force greater monetary financing of the widening budget deficit. The confluence of
both factors will lead to an inflation-cum-currency depreciation spiral in a
low-growth environment. Government debt would rise rapidly, driven by the
widening budget deficit and the impact of the real depreciation on the stock of
external debt (Figure 6, Table 8).

•

At the other extreme, the authorities might target stable nominal exchange rate. In this
case, the demand for imports would increase to support an overall GDP growth of
4-4½ percent. Together with the decline in oil exports, this would widen the current
account deficit and lead to accelerating foreign assets losses. By 2010, the cumulative
loss could reach nearly US$10 billion, and it would take only another 3–4 years
before all foreign assets are exhausted (Figure 7).28 Once foreign assets are depleted,
the inflation-cum-depreciation spiral would become the only option.

If, on the other hand, structural reforms are accelerated and fiscal adjustment stepped up,
investment prospects would improve, which would unleash robust capital accumulation and
productivity gains. Higher productivity would boost non-oil exports, and an enhanced
business climate would attract foreign direct investment. Together with some support from
the comfortable cushion of international reserves, these would allow the expansion of
imports that would be needed to sustain higher growth. Fiscal consolidation will keep the
borrowing needs of the budget within reasonable limits, preventing undue pressure on
interest rates and keeping inflation at bay (Figure 8).

Tables 9 and 10 present sensitivity analysis on the debt dynamics around this medium-term scenario. In
particular, sensitivity analysis, presented in Table 8, shows relatively small sensitivity of the debt dynamics to
international oil prices, as more than 65 percent of oil production is now consumed domestically.

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
8/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
9/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
10/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
11/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Real interest rate is at historical average plus two standard deviations in 2005 and 2006
Real GDP growth is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2005 and 2006
Primary balance is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2005 and 2006
Combination of B1-B3 using one standard deviation shocks
One time 30 percent real depreciation in 2005 10/

ANNEX V

The Fiscal Cost of Price Subsidies
Despite attempts at simplification and reform, the price subsidy system remains
complex and costly. The web of price subsidies comprises explicit subsidies on cereals,
electricity, water, cotton, rice and sugar, implicit subsidies on energy products, and additional
implicit subsides for cereals and cotton. The exchange-rate related implicit subsidies have
been largely phased out with the narrowing of the spreads between official rate and parallel
market rates.
The cost of explicit subsidies amounted to 4 percent of GDP in 2003, i.e., one-fifth of the
current budget. The price subsidy for cereals—which is the largest item—provides support
to consumers, producers, and exports. The subsidy on electricity, sugar, and rice is a subsidy
to consumers. The bulk of subsidy on water is for irrigation and therefore provides an
indirect subsidy to consumers in the form of cheap prices for foodstuffs. Price subsidy on
cotton—which is small—covers subsidy to exports of surplus production. Most of the cost of
the producer price support policy for cotton is born by local consumers and garment exports–
whose competitiveness is hurt by the high domestic cost of cotton. For all six commodities,
budgetary costs also cover the cost of redundant labor in the public enterprises producing and
marketing these commodities.
The cost of the implicit subsidies on energy products is estimated at 5.8 percent in 2003.
These subsidies stem from domestic prices set at levels below opportunity costs and are born
by the budget in the form of lost revenues. In 2003, implicit subsidies on diesel and gas oil
are estimated at 2.8 percent of GDP (including the implicit subsidy for electricity
generation), with domestic prices equal to 20 and 75 percent of international prices
respectively. The implicit subsidy on natural gas is estimated at 3 percent of GDP (including
the implicit subsidy for electricity generation), with domestic sales prices equal to some
40 percent of average international prices.1/ While the recent increase in the price of diesel
has brought it at a level close to 90 percent of international price in 2004, lack of adjustment
in the price of gas oil together with the increase in international oil price is projected to
widen the wedge between the two from 25 percent in 2003 to 60 percent in 2005. All in all,
subsidies on gas and diesel oil could reach 5 percent of GDP, in 2005, in the absence of
further adjustment in domestic prices.
The cost of additional implicit subsidies for cotton and cereals is born by state banks.
The two main public institutions in charge of marketing these commodities have been relying
on borrowing from state banks to cover any remaining losses which are not covered by
budgetary transfers. The cost has varied depending on surplus production, accumulation and
drawdown on stocks.

Average international prices do not reflect true opportunity costs to the extent that export
infrastructure is very limited.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

The exchange system in Syria is characterized by multiple exchange rates and a foreign
exchange market segmented into public and private sector pools. The private sector has
almost no access to the official pool, sourced by public sector foreign exchange revenues
channeled through the Commercial Bank of Syria, and conducts its transactions on an
unofficial parallel market located in Syria and offshore, sourced by foreign exchange from
tourism, workers’ remittances, proceeds from unrecorded exports, and private capital
inflows. Under the multiple rate structure, there are two official rates pegged to the dollar and
one unofficial (market determined) rate. The parallel market rate for the Syrian pound in

Article XIV Restrictions:

Syria continues to maintain, under Article XIV, restrictions on payments and transfers for
current international transactions, including administrative allocation of foreign exchange.
Syria also maintains exchange measures that are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII:
(i) prohibition against purchases by private parties of foreign exchange from the banking
system for some current international transactions; (ii) a multiple currency practice resulting
from divergences of more than 2 percent between the official exchange rate and officially
recognized exchange rates; (iii) a non-interest-bearing advance import deposit requirement of
75–100 percent for public sector imports as well as private sector imports which are not
financed from abroad; and (iv) an exchange restriction arising from the net debt under
inoperative bilateral payments arrangements with the Islamic Republic of Iran, and
Sri Lanka.
The Executive Board adopted on a lapse-of-time basis the decision No. 13241on
April 30, 2004.
1. The Fund takes this decision relating to the Syrian Arab Republic’s exchange
measures subject to Article VIII, Section 2(a) and 3, and in concluding the 2004
Article XIV consultation with the Syrian Arab Republic, in the light of the 2004
Article IV consultations with the Syrian Arab Republic concluded under Decision
No. 5392- (77/63) adopted on April 29, 1977, as amended (surveillance over
Exchange Rate Policies).
2. The Syrian Arab Republic maintains restrictions on the making of payments
and transfers for current international transactions in accordance with Article XIV,
Section 2. In addition, the Syrian Arab Republic maintains measures subject to
approval under Article VIII. The Fund encourages the authorities to eliminate the
restrictions maintained under Article XIV, Section 2 as soon as its balance of
payments permits, and to eliminate the measures that are subject to approval under
Article VIII as soon as possible.

APPENDIX II

Syrian Arab Republic: Relations with the World Bank Group
(end June, 2005)
1.
In June 2002, Syria settled its overdue service payments to IBRD and IDA, which had
risen to the equivalent of $526 million as of mid-1997, and all loans and credits were restored to
accrual status. Consequently, the country’s eligibility for disbursements was reinstated as of
July 1, 2002.
2.
Subsequent to the agreement on arrears in July 1997, the World Bank began to provide
non-lending services to Syria. Initial activities included support for the Ministry of Finance and the
Central Bank of Syria in accounting and the establishment of an external debt management system in
the form of grants from the Institutional Development Fund; planning and implementation grants
supporting Year 2000 remediation efforts; the Global Environment Fund biodiversity project; and
reviews of the trade regime (including export promotion), health, roads, urban water and sanitation,
and agricultural irrigation sectors.
3.
In the last two years, the authorities have continued to request only non-lending support from
the Bank. Analytical services have focused mainly on the trade and investment agenda. A trade
policy report entitled “Harnessing Trade for Growth” was submitted to the Authorities in December
2004. A Trade Logistics study was completed in 2003, and discussed in a large workshop with the
private sector in December 2003. An Investment Climate Assessment survey was carried out in 2003
and 2004, and its result have been finalized in a report dated June, 2005. The World Bank has also
initiated a grant activity (from April 2005) in collaboration with the Fund and the UNDP to establish
a National Statistical Capacity Strategy.
4.
The Bank program over the next 3 years will be based mainly on knowledge transfer and
analytical services focusing on two pillars: (i) economic reform and transition; and (ii) human
development and social protection.
On the first pillar, the program will build on the substantial analytical and survey work done
in the last year that resulted in two trade reports and in the forthcoming Investment Climate
Assessment report that will be presented to the authorities. The Bank will provide both analytical
advice and technical assistance to the Authorities in their search for a solid and global strategy of
economic growth and transition to private sector-led economy. This would imply integrating within
the existing trade and investment agenda issues linked to fiscal and monetary policy, financial sector
reform, and public enterprise reforms.
On the second pillar, the Bank will be focusing on assisting the Authorities in (i) developing
a comprehensive education sector strategy as agreed with the Minster of Education;
(ii) understanding the labor market and designing appropriate policies and programs, and (iii)
assessing their social assistance programs and policies and providing recommendations on reforming
the system.
5.
IFC has been active in Syria since 1999 when the Board approved the corporation’s first
investment in the country–a $1 million equity stake in a manufacturer of drip irrigation systems.
Since that time, IFC has made two other investments, including an equity position in the first private
sector bank in Syria and a loan to a chemicals company. The total held portfolio is $20.2 million. IFC
has also conducted technical assistance work, including studies of aspects of the financial sector.

APPENDIX III

Syrian Arab Republic: Statistical Issues
1.
Significant weaknesses exist in Syria’s statistical base in terms of coverage, consistency,
periodicity, and timeliness, which have hampered the staff’s ability to conduct economic analysis
and effective surveillance. Efforts to address the weaknesses in the statistical base should cover a
wide range of sectors, including national accounts, government finance, monetary accounts, and
balance of payments.
2.
Statistical issues have been discussed with the Syrian representatives during Article IV
consultations. They have acknowledged data deficiencies and indicated that efforts will be made
to address them. In this respect Syria’s participation in the General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS) is strongly recommended. Four compilers of statistics from the Ministry of Finance,
Central Bank of Syria, Central Bureau of Statistics, and a manager from the Central Bureau of
Statistics have recently participated in the GDDS Workshop in Abu Dhabi (February 27–March
9, 2005) organized by the IMF Statistics Department. Brief metadata for all macroeconomic
sectors were prepared during the workshop. To become a GDDS participant the authorities will
need to appoint a GDDS coordinator, express their commitment to the GDDS framework, and
finalize GDDS metadata.
3.

Statistical issues in various sectors of the economy are discussed below.

a.

Real sector

4.
The Central Bureau of Statistics has made steady progress in implementing the
recommendations of the last national accounts statistics mission (December 1995). However the
following weaknesses still exist:
•

GDP estimates by the production approach suffer from under-coverage of activities,
particularly in trade and private services. The base year has been updated to 2000.

•

Syria has a multiple exchange rate system. This imposes implicit indirect taxes and
subsidies that can affect GDP and other national accounts aggregates. Currently, no
adjustments are made to these aggregates.

•

The estimates of final expenditures on GDP are incomplete, as household final
consumption expenditures are calculated as a residual and include changes in inventories
(since the latter is not estimated separately). The authorities have begun to collect data on
inventory changes in the public sector.

•

Consumption of fixed capital is estimated as a constant ratio of output.

•

Net income flows between residents and nonresidents derived from the balance of
payments are unsatisfactory. As a result, the estimates of saving, investment, and net
borrowing from abroad are unreliable.

- 55 -

APPENDIX III

•

National accounts figures for 2001 show a surprising boom in investment, which
increases by 25 percent in real terms, entirely due to a doubling in private investment in
the agricultural sector. Such an increase remains puzzling.

•

Consumer price index calculations are fairly unusual. Prices for each month are
compared to the same month of the base year; and there are four weighing schemes, one
for each quarter. Consequently, no month-on-month inflation can be derived, and the
annual average inflation is not equal to the sum of the monthly indices.

•

The wholesale price index is compiled and reported annually but is not representative, as
most prices are those of public sector enterprises.

5.
As of June 2005, the latest national accounts figures reported in the International Finance
Statistics (IFS) were for 2002, although the Central Bureau of Statistics published provisional
2003 accounts in its 2004 Statistical Abstract.
b.

Government finance

•

Syria’s fiscal accounts suffer from major deficiencies with respect to definitions,
coverage, classification, methodology, accuracy, reliability, and timeliness that generate
severe inconsistencies with monetary and balance of payments statistics. The multisector
mission of June 2004 found that compilation of GFS by the MOF is adversely affected by
cumbersome institutional arrangements, inadequate resource availability and unresolved
methodological problems. However, investment expenditure of public enterprises is
included in government’s capital expenditure. The methodology used for compilation
does not follow GFSM 2001 or even GFSM 1986. While budget data are available with
very long lags (two years for final budget accounts), financing data are not available.
There is no dissemination of GFS data, and even access to key data sources by GFS
compilers within the MOF, such as the breakdown of debt service into interest and
amortization, is problematic. This contributes to discrepancies in external financing as
reported by the budget and the balance of payment accounts.

•

However, the largest, most persistent and volatile discrepancies are between the financing
requirements of the budget, as reported by the MoF, and government financing as
reported by the CBS. The lack of a common and regularly updated coverage of the
government sector between the MoF and the CBS, misclassification of public enterprises
investment expenditure, as well as timing and valuation issues, are mainly responsible for
those discrepancies.

•

Other discrepancies between fiscal and monetary accounts relate to the unorthodox
treatment by the CBS of some transactions with government, such as the parallel rise of
government deposits and claims on government in the CBS balance sheet, which is likely
due to government withdrawals being counted as credit and never netted out against
deposits, and profits transferred to government treated as permanent claim on the
government.

To address the methodological issues, the June 2005 TA mission developed a preliminary
bridge table that maps the budgetary source data codes to the GFSM 2001 classification
codes, and conducted a seminar to clarify various aspects of the GFSM 2001
methodology to the MOF officials. To help the Directorate of Planning and Statistics
(DPS) implement a proper sectorization scheme, the mission provided its staff with an
updated institutional table showing the current coverage of government and public
enterprises, for circulation to all relevant agencies. Moreover, the mission formulated a
detailed work plan centered around the provision of adequate resources and training for
the DPS to fulfill its tasks. The work plan calls for the DPS to access core source data
necessary for compilation, initially on a cash basis, of annual GFS data according to the
GFSM 2001, and for the resumption of data reporting to STA for publication in GFSY
and IFS, together with improved reporting, in terms of coverage and classification, to the
IMF’s Middle East and Central Asia Department (MCD). The mission also recommended
improvement in the timeliness of annual data, including data on financing, and a start on
the compilation of sub-annual data.

•

Syria stopped reporting annual fiscal data for publication in the Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook. The latest data reported are for 1999. Moreover, the reported data are
partial, too aggregated, in part misclassified, and do not include extra-budgetary and
social security accounts. No data on financing and debt are provided.

c.

Monetary accounts

Monetary statistics suffer from major deficiencies which hamper the staff’s ability to conduct
meaningful analysis of monetary developments: The multisector statistics mission in June 2004
found that while the format of monetary statistics is largely consistent with the structure of the
MFSM sectoral surveys, the institutional coverage of monetary statistics is incomplete, and there
are deficiencies in the source data arising from, inter alia, (i) the use of different exchange rates
at the CBS and at the other banks for valuing their foreign positions; (ii) financial positions are
not valued at market prices or market-price equivalents; (iii) a number of accounting procedures
for the maintenance of public sector accounts cause distortions in the measurement of gross
positions; and (iv) there are disparities between the institutional coverage of public sector in
monetary statistics and the government finance statistics.
To address the source data deficiencies, the June 2004 STA mission recommended: (a) the use of
a market exchange rate for valuing all foreign currency denominated positions at all banks,
including the CB, or as an intermediate step, the use of a single rate closest to the market rate for
valuing all foreign currency positions at the CB and at the other banks, (b) valuation of financial
positions based on market prices or market price equivalents; and (c) full adoption of the
residency principle based on the center of economic interest. Further, the accounting procedures
for the maintenance of public administrative sector’s current accounts and the classification of
the CBS’ profit advances to the government should be revised to an outstanding stock basis (for
example, by ensuring that the deposit accounts are debited for any checks presented instead of
the check amount treated as an advance and credited to a claim on the check issuer). The
institutional lists for public administrative and economic sectors should be updated for

- 57 -

consistency with the recommendations for the government finance statistics made by the
mission, and these lists should be used as the basis for collecting data and compiling monetary
accounts.
6.
Monthly monetary data for the IFS are reported with a variable lag, which currently
(end-June 2005) stands at 14 months.
d.

Balance of payments

7.
The balance of payments (BOP) is compiled annually by the CBS on a provisional basis
with about an eight-month lag. As of June 2005, the latest BOP figures reported in the IFS refer
to 2003. Trade data are compiled monthly by the Customs Department and reported quarterly by
the Central Bureau of Statistics in LS with a six-month lag. The BOP is presented in BPM5
format, but its compilation method is not entirely consistent with the BPM5 methodology. The
June 2004 STA mission observed the following weaknesses:
•

Private transfers do not fully reflect remittances by Syrians working abroad. The statistics
in the BOP for official transfers differ significantly from figures provided from other
sources, such as donors.

•

Data on long-term official capital inflows and amortization are not consistent with the
data provided by the MoF on the external financing of the budget deficit. Data on private
capital movements are incomplete.

•

Data on external debt continue to be incomplete, and external debt service obligations
and arrears are not recorded in the BOP.

•

Military imports are excluded from BOP and external debt data.

•

There is a large discrepancy between reserve flows reported in the BOP and the reserve
flows implied by the MS. In particular, the Net Foreign Assets (NFA) of the banking
system are much higher in the monetary survey (MS) than in the international liquidity
table derived from the balance of payments.

•

The mission recommended the adoption of a new foreign exchange form (developed by
the mission) to improve source data—and the establishment of an enterprise register to
estimate foreign direct investment—for the balance of payments statistics. Also, it
recommended the dissemination of international reserves and external debt data—neither
of which is currently disseminated for reasons of confidentiality.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation
with the Syrian Arab Republic
The
On August 31, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Syrian Arab Republic.1
Background
Following a slowdown in 2003, a mild recovery seems to have started since early 2004.
The slowdown in 2003 reflected declining oil production and the impact of the conflict in Iraq
on exports and investment. An expansionary fiscal stance cushioned the impact of these
shocks and helped limit the slowdown in economic activity to 1¼ percent. The recovery in
2004 has been aided by a strong rebound in exports, especially tourism, and by a surge in
private investment—reflecting the ongoing reforms. A 20 percent increase in public sector
wages together with a good harvest contributed to the upturn. Inflation remains subdued for
the moment, despite expansionary fiscal policies and the easing of credit. The external
position is weakening as a result of a downward trend in oil exports and in unidentified inflows.
The recovery is likely to continue in 2005 supported by a further strengthening of private
investment and exports. Notwithstanding the increase in oil prices, the current account is
expected to weaken further, reflecting a decline in the volume of oil exports with a partial offset
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.

-2from tourism. Fiscal policies promise to be somewhat tighter in 2005, reflecting the introduction
of the consumption tax, some adjustment in petroleum prices, and a planned curb on
inefficient public investment. This, together with moderate credit expansion, would help keep
inflation in check.
The medium-term prospects are worrisome given that oil, which presently contributes
20 percent of GDP, two-thirds of exports (about 14 percent of GDP), and half of government
revenues (about 15 percent of GDP), is likely to be exhausted in the late 2020s and Syria may
become a net oil importer within a few years.
The authorities have continued to make progress in addressing key structural rigidities to boost
growth, and in strengthening the medium-term budgetary outlook to face the prospective
decline in oil revenues. However, the supply response, so far, and the fiscal prospects suggest
that the pace and the scope of reforms have fallen short of Syria’s medium-term growth and
employment challenges. If structural reforms and fiscal consolidation are not accelerated,
there is a risk that oil reserves will be exhausted before the ongoing reforms have had time to
generate new sources of growth and income. If this risk were to materialize, Syria may get
locked in a cycle of financial volatility, fiscal deterioration, low growth, and rising
unemployment.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors were encouraged by Syria’s favorable performance in 2004 as reflected by the
strong non-oil growth and the stable macroeconomic environment. They commended the
Syrian authorities for the steady progress in pushing forward the structural reform agenda,
notably the steps taken to further liberalize the trade and foreign exchange regimes, simplify
and broaden the base of the tax system, strengthen budgetary procedures to improve the
efficiency of public spending, grant greater autonomy and flexibility to public enterprises
including public banks, and open the insurance industry to the private sector. However, noting
the worrisome medium-term prospects for the oil sector, Directors expressed concern that the
pace and the scope of reforms may be falling short of the daunting challenges posed by the
prospective depletion of oil reserves and the high demographic pressures on the labor market.
Against this background, Directors agreed that structural reforms aimed at furthering the
transition to a market economy, strengthening the incentive system for domestic and foreign
investors, and improving price signals need to be further accelerated and broadened to create
new sources of growth and foreign exchange earnings to replace the dwindling oil resources.
They welcomed the authorities’ intention to implement institutional reforms to strengthen
competition, governance, property rights, and the rule of law.
Directors considered that a strong and credible fiscal consolidation strategy within a
transparent medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF) will be key to maintaining financial stability
and instilling confidence in Syria’s fiscal solvency. Given the high uncertainty surrounding oil
prices, reserves, and extraction rates, Directors agreed that the MTFF should target a steady
improvement in the non-oil budget balance, keeping the government’s inter-temporal budget

-3constraint in clear perspective, and moderating distributive demands fueled by higher oil
prices.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to fiscal consolidation as reflected in the tax
and expenditure measures adopted in the 2005 budget, and their sustained effort to increase
efficiency and broaden the tax base, while strengthening tax administration. Directors called on
the authorities to build on this progress and develop a comprehensive fiscal reform package
aimed at further simplifying tax provisions and removing tax exemptions. Efforts to revamp tax
administration, including the creation of a large taxpayer unit, should be sustained to prepare
for a successful launch of the VAT. A comprehensive review of public expenditure could help
identify measures to raise fiscal savings and enhance the supply side of the economy.
Overhauling the price subsidy system, while at the same time strengthening social safety nets,
could be an important source of savings and efficiency gains. Civil service reform—in a
manner that does not create social disruptions—is also needed to address overstaffing,
low pay, and lack of skills. Directors urged the authorities to contain the accumulation of new
debt, with a few suggesting that windfall revenues be used to pay down the debt.
Directors welcomed the recent laws to allow greater autonomy and flexibility to public
enterprises and public banks in order to improve their financial position, stem their drain on
public finances, and ensure a level playing field for private sector enterprises. Directors called
on the authorities to elaborate and implement their plan to restructure those enterprises that
can be salvaged, and to develop case-by-case solutions, including liquidation, to deal with the
rest. Directors encouraged the authorities to envisage the privatization of selected enterprises.
On monetary policy, Directors agreed that the present level of interest rates is appropriate and
that a continuation of the current pace of credit expansion carries limited inflationary risks,
given the still low stock of bank loans. However, given state banks’ weak risk management
capacity and their limited lending experience, Directors recommended close monitoring of
credit developments to contain credit risk and the adoption of a modern credit scoring system.
They welcomed the authorities’ intention to strengthen the role of the central bank in
formulating and implementing monetary and exchange rate policies, and to re-orient the
activities of the Commercial Bank of Syria toward traditional commercial banking.
Directors urged the authorities to move swiftly on the much delayed agenda of launching a
government securities market, which is critical for moving toward a more efficient monetary
framework and market-determined interest rates, and for financial sector development.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ plan to establish a Securities Commission.
Directors stressed that liberalization and increased competition brought about by the entry of
private banks need to be complemented by a more comprehensive state-bank restructuring
strategy and sustained efforts to strengthen bank regulation and supervision. Directors noted
the passage of the Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism
(AML/CFT) law and encouraged the authorities to continue to strengthen the AML/CFT
framework and develop its implementing rules and regulations.
Directors welcomed the steps taken in the past year toward exchange rate unification and
current account convertibility, in particular the decision to allow the financing of private sector

-4imports of raw material and intermediate goods through the official market. Given the
significant narrowing of the spread between the official and free market rates, Directors saw
that attendant risks to unification are limited and, hence, urged the authorities to move swiftly
to unify the foreign exchange market and adopt current account convertibility.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ plan to move to a managed float system after completing
the necessary preparatory work. With regard to the trade system, while acknowledging the
positive steps in this area, Directors encouraged the authorities to introduce promptly the new
tariff structure, eliminate non-tariff barriers, and tackle other trade-related barriers.
Directors urged the authorities to improve the coverage, timeliness, periodicity, and quality of
economic and financial data to allow in-depth economic analysis and policy formulation.
They urged the authorities to participate in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of
the IMF's views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of
the country (or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions
of Article IV consultations with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at
the regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member
countries with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after Executive
Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive
Board in a particular case.
