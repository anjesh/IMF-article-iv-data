Executive Summary
Background: External and internal imbalances rose in recent years after nearly a decade of
impressive economic performance. In 2007, the current account deficit increased to an estimated
13 percent of GDP and end-year CPI inflation accelerated to 8¼ percent. Competitiveness remains
broadly appropriate, though there has been some erosion due to rapid wage growth. Over the past
half year, a tightening of lending standards has led to a welcome cooling of the housing market.
Outlook: Although the economy’s momentum is strong, the tightening of financing conditions is
likely to lead to an orderly reduction of imbalances in 2008–09 (a soft landing). With credit growth
expected to slow substantially, property-related domestic spending should ease. While a soft landing
is the most likely scenario, sharper-than-expected cooling of the housing market or scaling back of
external financing could lead to more rapid adjustment (a hard landing). Conversely, it is possible—
though less likely—that imbalances could persist (no landing). Against this background, the key
policy objectives are to support a soft landing and be prepared for a hard landing.
Fiscal policy: Although government debt is low, fiscal policy provided stimulus in 2007, which was
counter-productive given already-strong demand pressures. The fiscal contraction envisaged for
2008 is helpful, but additional tightening is warranted. For 2009, the government’s fiscal target is
appropriate, but further measures will be needed to achieve it. The new fiscal responsibility law
should help to promote fiscal discipline over the medium term, but the legal framework could be
improved further.
Financial system: Indicators of the banking system’s soundness are generally satisfactory and are
expected to remain so under the soft landing scenario. The regulatory and supervisory framework
for banks is in line with international standards, and the Bank of Lithuania conducts effective
supervision of all banks operating in Lithuania. Given the potential impact of low-probability
extreme events on the banking system, banks’ capital buffers should be increased and banks’
contingency plans in the event of liquidity shocks should be further discussed. Supervision of the
non-bank sector needs to be improved.

2007. The external current account
deficit widened to an estimated 13 percent of GDP and end-year CPI inflation rose to
8¼ percent. House prices continued to increase, accompanied by a rising share of propertyrelated investment in GDP and rapid credit growth. Rapid wage growth led to an
appreciation of the real effective exchange rate.
3.
With parliamentary elections scheduled for October 2008, political pressures to
adopt populist measures are rising. For example, against the advice of the government
and despite a veto by the president, parliament recently passed a law that will reduce the
VAT rate on fruit and vegetables in January 2009.
II. RISING IMBALANCES IN 2007
4.
Economic growth increased in 2007, reflecting strong investment and fiscal
stimulus (Tables 1 and 2). GDP growth rose from 7¾ percent in 2006 to 8¾ percent in
2007, driven by domestic demand. Investment was boosted by the booming property market
and a temporary surge in purchases of transportation equipment related to the rapid growth
of cross-border trucking services. Private consumption was supported by a tight labor
market and increased government transfers, notably restitution payments related to savings
and land. Given the high import content of domestic demand, the current account deficit
(CAD) widened to 13 percent of GDP. Production disruptions at the oil refinery contributed
to the rise in the current account deficit (by about 1 percentage point of GDP). In recent
years, the widening current account deficit has reflected the rise in foreign-financed
investment, and has been accompanied by rapid productivity growth (Box 1).

5.
Credit growth—especially to the property sector—remained rapid in 2007, but
has recently shown tentative signs of slowing (Figure 1). Increases in bank loans to
corporates and households continued to exceed nominal GDP growth, leading to rising debt
ratios. Most household debt is at variable interest rates and about half is denominated in
foreign currency (largely in euro), though household debt is reportedly concentrated among
higher-income households, and increasing loan maturities have moderated the rise in debt
service burdens. About half of bank loans are property-related. As credit has grown more
rapidly than deposits, banks have funded their lending by borrowing from abroad.
Reflecting concerns about rapid credit growth, the Bank of Lithuania (BOL) and the parent
banks of major Lithuanian banks encouraged a tightening of lending practices, including
more conservative valuation of collateral. As a result, year-on-year credit growth eased
from 51 percent at end-2006 to 45 percent at end-2007, and the month-on-month rate fell
sharply in January 2008. At the same time, regional concerns and the global financial
turbulence

Box 1. Current Account and Productivity Developments
The widening of the CAD in recent years is due to the rise in foreign-financed investment.
The increase in the ratio of gross fixed investment to GDP reflects EU accession, the relatively
low level of income per capita, and low public debt. Another structural factor has been the sharp
rise in EU funds, which have not only financed public sector investment but also stimulated
complementary private sector investment.

prompted increases in foreign currency bond spreads and domestic currency lending rates,
leading to a rise in the share of loans in foreign currency (Figure 2).

Demand pressures increased for much of 2007, but started to ease towards the
end of the year (Figure 3). The unemployment rate fell to 4¼ percent, job vacancies
increased, and real wage growth remained high. Capacity utilization rose year-on-year
through October, but has since begun to decline. Staff’s production function suggests
potential growth in 2007 of about 8 percent and an output gap of 4½ percent of GDP,
though estimates of the output gap are surrounded by large margins of uncertainty,
especially in an economy that is undergoing rapid structural change (Box 2). With output
gap estimates not significantly different from staff’s, the authorities agreed that demand
pressures are substantial. CPI inflation rose to 10¾ percent in February 2008, mostly
reflecting higher food and energy prices, but also higher core inflation, which is due to
increasing nontradables inflation (especially in the hospitality and property-related sectors).
Inflation is well above the Maastricht criterion.

7

Box 2. Estimates of the Output Gap1
Different methods produce a wide range of measures of the level of the output gap in 2007,
with the production function approach suggesting the most plausible estimate. The
Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter indicates a positive output gap in 2007 of about 2 percent of GDP,
but suffers from an end-point problem, which—if output is indeed above potential—tends to
underestimate the level of the gap. A cross-country panel regression approach to measuring
potential growth yields an output gap of about 15 percent of GDP, but underestimates potential
growth (and thus likely overestimates the output gap) in the Baltic countries in the sample
period. The production function approach suggests an intermediate estimate of about 4½ percent
of GDP.

All three estimates broadly match direct measures of resource pressures between 2000-07.
Nontradables price inflation, real wage growth, and the non-oil trade balance all point to a
tightening of supply constraints. Correlation coefficients between these coincident indicators
and estimates of the output gap vary somewhat, but the differences are not statistically
significant. The short sample period cannot be extended backwards because there is a break in
the wage data in 2000. As discussed above, methodological considerations suggest that the
production function (PF) approach yields the most plausible estimate.

The authorities and staff agreed that the REER is broadly in line with
fundamentals, but large uncertainties surround this assessment.1 The underlying CAD
is somewhat wider than the equilibrium CAD, though within the margins of uncertainty:

Staff estimate that the underlying CAD in 2007 (adjusted for the business cycle, past
movements in the real effective exchange rate, and other temporary factors) is
8½ percent of GDP. The Bank of Lithuania has a similar estimate.

•

The standard CGER macro-balance approach suggests an equilibrium CAD of
2½ percent of GDP. However, this estimate may underestimate the equilibrium CAD
in a setting of EU convergence and rapid financial integration. Based on Abiad and
others (WP/07/64), which attempts to incorporate these effects, the equilibrium CAD
is estimated to be about 4¾ percent of GDP (the standard error of the estimate is
¾−3¼ percent of GDP). The gap between the underlying CAD and the equilibrium
CAD is 3¾ percent of GDP, which implies a real exchange rate overvaluation of
11 percent. Taking into account medium-term EU capital transfers of 1½ percent of
GDP, which are a stable and predictable source of financing, the gap is 2¼ percent of
GDP, implying a real exchange rate overvaluation of 7 percent.

•

The standard CGER external sustainability approach indicates that the CAD that
stabilizes the net external asset position is 4 percent of GDP. Taking into account
medium-term EU capital transfers of 1½ percent of GDP, the gap is 3 percent of
GDP, implying a real exchange rate overvaluation of 9 percent.

By contrast, the standard CGER equilibrium real exchange rate approach suggests that the
actual REER is about 10 percent more depreciated than the equilibrium REER. The forecast
error is 10–15 percent. The average of the three estimates of real exchange rate misalignment
(equilibrium real exchange rate, macro-balance, and external sustainability) is close to zero.

In Estonia and Latvia, where economic imbalances were larger, the economic
cycle turned earlier than in Lithuania (Figure 4). Reflecting parent banks’ decisions to
rein in lending, credit flows declined, accompanied by slowing domestic demand growth
and narrowing current account deficits.
III. SOFT LANDING LIKELY IN 2008–09
12.
Although the economy’s momentum is strong, there was agreement that the
tightening of financing conditions is likely to lead to a gradual easing of domestic
demand growth (soft landing). With credit growth expected to slow substantially from
45 percent at end-2007 to 20 percent at end-2008, property-related investment (as a share of
GDP) will likely fall, though strong profitability in export-oriented sectors and the reduction
in the corporate income tax rate will support overall private investment, and EU funds will
continue to support strong public investment (Tables 5–6). Similarly, purchases of
consumer durables will likely ease, though the low unemployment rate and the cut in the
personal income tax rate will underpin continued robust after-tax wage growth and thus
consumption of non-durables. Moreover, slowing GDP growth in all main export markets—
and especially in Estonia and Latvia—will dampen external demand growth.

13.
Staff’s central forecast, broadly shared by the authorities, is that the slowing of
credit growth will lead to an orderly reduction of imbalances in 2008–09 (Table 7). The
easing of credit growth and banks’ foreign borrowing should be accompanied by lower
growth rates of domestic demand and imports, and a narrower current account deficit. Staff
projects real GDP growth of 6½ percent in 2008 and 5½ percent in 2009, in line with the
March Consensus forecast. CPI inflation would decline to 7 percent by end-2008 and
4½ percent by end-2009, mostly reflecting the fading impact of sharp increases in food and
energy prices. The current account deficit would narrow to 10½ percent in 2008 and
8¾ percent in 2009. Under this scenario, net external liabilities would rise to about
66 percent of GDP by 2013 and external debt to about 68 percent of GDP (Appendix III).

While a soft landing is likely, large uncertainties surround the outlook and
there is a risk of a hard landing. The experience of other countries shows that rapid house
price increases are sometimes followed by abrupt house price declines. In addition,
Lithuania’s dependence on external financing makes it vulnerable to a sharper scaling back
of new lending by parent banks. If these risks materialize, the fall in GDP growth would be
sharper and the adjustment of the current account deficit quicker (hard landing). In this case,
bank credit quality would likely deteriorate, putting stress on the banking system and
possibly leading to a further retrenchment of lending. Conversely, it is possible—though
less likely—that property market sentiment could recover or that competition for market
share among banks could interfere with the expected moderation in credit growth. In this
situation, GDP growth would not slow and imbalances would remain large (no landing).
15.
Against this background, the key policy objective is to promote macroeconomic
stability by supporting a soft landing and being prepared for a hard landing (Box 3).
The discussions focused on three questions:
•

What fiscal policy stance is needed to help reduce demand pressures and build fiscal
cushions?

•

How should financial supervision help ensure a measured pace of credit growth and
strong bank asset quality?

•

How is the economy positioned to ease supply bottlenecks and facilitate the

Box 3. Implementation of Fund Policy Advice
Fiscal policy: Fiscal policy was expansionary in 2007, in contrast to the tightening
recommended by the Fund. In line with Fund advice, there was no mid-year budget. The
balanced-budget fiscal rule introduced in November 2007 is consistent with the Fund’s advice
on fiscal restraint, though reform of the expenditure framework, as well as measures to enhance
transparency and increase independent scrutiny, are still under consideration.
Financial stability: Consistent with the Fund’s advice, the BOL has taken measures to
strengthen banks’ capital bases, encouraged better risk management, increased disclosure
requirements, broadened the collection of information in the credit registry, and made public
statements on risks related to the housing market.
Economic flexibility: While the labor market is already relatively flexible, no progress has been
made in easing restrictions on working hours. The completion of some municipal land use plans
has facilitated residential and commercial property development.

reallocation of resources?
IV. FISCAL TIGHTENING NEEDED
16.
Public finances are generally sound, but fiscal policy was procyclical in 2007
(Table 8). Between 2000–06, general government debt fell from 24 percent of GDP to

14
18 percent of GDP, reflecting small fiscal deficits and rapid GDP growth. However, in
2007, the fiscal deficit (including restitution payments) widened to 2 percent of GDP. This
gave rise to a fiscal stimulus of ½ percent of GDP, which—given the economy’s cyclical
position—was counter-productive.

17.
In staff’s view, the fiscal contraction envisaged for 2008 is helpful but more is
needed. The cyclically-adjusted fiscal deficit (including restitution payments) is projected
to narrow by 1 percent of GDP, which will help to relieve demand pressures. However, with
the spending of EU funds expected increase, the overall withdrawal of demand is only
½ percent of GDP. Given the need to support the soft landing and increase fiscal cushions,
staff argued for additional fiscal consolidation of ½ percent of GDP. Greater fiscal
contraction would not only have a direct impact on aggregate demand, but also provide a
credible signal of the government’s commitment to macroeconomic stability, helping to
boost investor confidence and to focus expectations on the need for slower growth. In
addition, staff argued that it would be prudent to take advantage of the current favorable
economic situation to increase fiscal cushions, given the potential for large revenue losses in
the event of a hard landing. Staff suggested that additional fiscal contraction could be

achieved by postponing restitution payments and accelerating planned increases in excise
taxes.

While recognizing the desirability of fiscal contraction from a macroeconomic
perspective, the authorities pointed to pressing social needs. The authorities noted that,

recommendations, the authorities said
that they would consider staff’s
suggestion to accelerate the planned increase in excise taxes, but that the law requires
restitution payments to be completed by 2009.
19.
The authorities plan further fiscal contraction in 2009. After taking restitution
payments into account, the latest Convergence Program envisages fiscal balance, which
would imply fiscal adjustment of 1½ percent of GDP. Staff welcomed the magnitude of the

16
planned fiscal consolidation, but observed that—on staff’s somewhat less optimistic
assumptions about revenue buoyancy—the fiscal deficit is likely to be closer to ½ percent of
GDP, implying adjustment of about 1 percent of GDP. In addition, staff noted that—on the
government’s projections—fiscal consolidation in 2009 is being achieved primarily by
cutting the nationally-financed public investment program, which is undesirable given the
urgency of improving public infrastructure.
20.
Staff argued that additional measures will be needed to achieve the desired
fiscal contraction in 2009. Given that demand pressures are expected to remain significant
on staff’s central forecast, staff recommended that fiscal policy aim for cyclically-adjusted
balance by 2010. For 2009, this would imply fiscal adjustment of 1¼ percent of GDP and a
fiscal deficit (including restitution payments) of ¼ percent of GDP. This could be achieved
by limiting the growth of current spending to nominal GDP growth and removing
exemptions on VAT, PIT, and social security taxes. Staff added that, if GDP growth does
not ease as projected, then greater fiscal contraction would be desirable. Conversely, if the
economic slowdown is considerably sharper than projected, then fiscal policy should not
exacerbate the downturn. In the unlikely event that the output gap turns negative,
discretionary counter-cyclical stimulus would be appropriate. The authorities said that they
would consider staff’s suggestions.
21.
The authorities underlined the role of the new fiscal responsibility law in
promoting fiscal discipline over the medium term. The law, which was enacted in
November 2007, prohibits mid-year budgets, requires that revenue overperformance be
saved, and stipulates that the government budget aim for balance or better, subject to escape
clauses intended to avoid procyclical policy in an economic downturn. The authorities are
planning to enhance transparency by showing exactly how a proposed budget conforms to
the fiscal target in the law, and to reduce the risk of procyclicality in an economic upturn by
providing an explicit assessment of whether a budget is inflationary. The authorities said
that they would consider staff’s suggestion to strengthen independent scrutiny of the
economy’s cyclical position and some key revenue assumptions. Separately, the authorities
pointed to recent scrutiny of government ministries’ expenditure planning by an external
accounting firm. The audit recommended better targeted and quantified evaluation criteria,
and improved cost-benefit analysis. Staff supported these recommendations and added that
better integration of strategic expenditure planning and budgeting would enhance the
medium-term spending framework.
V. HIGHER BANK CAPITAL BUFFERS ADVISABLE
22.
The Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) Update finds indicators of
the banking system’s soundness to be generally satisfactory (Figure 5 and Tables 9–10).
Profitability is high and nonperforming loans are low, and capital adequacy has increased in
recent years. Looking ahead, the cooling of the housing market and the slowdown in GDP
growth will likely increase nonperforming loans and dampen profitability somewhat.
23.
The dominance of foreign-owned banks in the banking system constitutes both
a source of strength and a risk. Foreign-owned banks account for about 85 percent of the
sector’s assets and the foreign parent banks generally have an S&P credit rating of A+. In

The regulatory and supervisory framework for banks is in line with
international standards and the BOL has taken actions to strengthen bank soundness.
Laws and regulations on bank supervision conform with EU directives, and the BOL
conducts effective supervision of all banks operating in Lithuania. In recent years, the BOL
has strengthened banks’ capital bases by raising the effective risk weight on residential
mortgages, restricting the amount of current-year profits that count toward regulatory
capital, and asking banks to fully retain profits. The BOL has also urged banks to pay due
attention to loan-to-value ratios and debt-service-to-income-ratios, and to conduct stress
tests on borrowers’ debt service capabilities under different interest rate scenarios.

BOL has the authority to conduct LOLR

the required foreign exchange coverage of BOL liabilities under the currency board. The
BOL is working to update the implementation procedures for LOLR operations, including
guidelines for the valuation and approval of collateral. The current reserve cover is about
140 percent, compared with the minimum permissible cover of 100 percent. Staff
recommended that the Lithuanian authorities further discuss contingency plans (including
credit lines) with banks, parent banks, and home country authorities. In addition, staff
suggested that the authorities weigh the fiscal cost of increased reserve cover against the
potential benefits.

19
28.
Deposit insurance coverage is extensive, though the funding of the deposit
insurance fund is below its target level. The level of coverage is in line with the relevant
EU directive, coverage relative to GDP per capita is higher than the EU average, and
virtually all depositors have full coverage of their deposits. Arrangements to ensure the
speedy payoff of depositors are in place (and were tested in two bank failures in the late
1990s). Given the rapid growth of bank deposits, which now amount to 40 percent of GDP,
the deposit insurance reserve fund has not yet reached its target funding rate of 3–4 percent
of insured deposits. At 2¼ percent of insured deposits, the fund at this stage would have
sufficient resources to cover a small bank failure. Staff observed that the introduction of
risk-based insurance premia would help curtail certain banks’ aggressive collection of
deposits and help accelerate capital accumulation in the deposit insurance fund.
29.
Cross-border crisis management arrangements are largely in place, but still
untested. The BOL has bilateral Memoranda of Understanding on supervisory cooperation
with all foreign financial supervisors of the parent banks of Lithuanian subsidiaries or
branches. The BOL also has crisis management agreements with the EU and with regional
central banks, and has participated in multilateral crisis simulation exercises. A domestic
crisis management plan is currently being discussed by the relevant authorities.
30.
As regards the non-bank financial sector, assets have grown rapidly and
financial institutions are becoming increasingly sophisticated. However, high staff
turnover at the Lithuanian Securities Commission (LSC) results in a loss of relevant market
experience. To address this, Fund staff suggested that the LSC should be allowed to pay
market-based salaries and should be given an adequate and stable source of funding,
including fees from market participants. In addition, the governance structure of pensions
funds should be strengthened and cross-sectoral supervisory arrangements should be
reviewed to address conflicts of interest by pension fund managers (banks and insurance
companies).

20
VII. STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
The recent rise in external and internal imbalances is a concern. An excess of
aggregate demand over the economy’s supply potential has led to a wide current account
deficit and an increase in domestic inflationary pressures. The underlying current account
deficit is somewhat larger than its estimated equilibrium value, though within the margins
of uncertainty. The deterioration in the net external asset position represents a risk to
external stability. Inflation is well above the level in the euro area and an obstacle to euro
adoption. Although the level of the real effective exchange rate is still broadly appropriate,
given strong productivity growth in earlier years, continued rapid wage growth could erode
competitiveness.
33.
The tightening of financing conditions is likely to lead to an orderly easing of
imbalances in 2008–09, but there is a risk of a hard landing. Following the tightening of
lending standards, the housing market is already cooling and credit growth will likely slow
substantially. Therefore, while the economy’s underlying momentum remains strong,
domestic demand growth is expected to slow, leading to a narrowing of the current account
deficit and an easing of inflationary pressures. However, the experience of other countries
shows that rapid house price increases are sometimes followed by abrupt house price
declines. In addition, Lithuania’s reliance on external financing makes it vulnerable to a
sharper scaling back of new lending by parent banks. If these risks materialize, domestic
demand growth could slow quickly (a hard landing). There is also a small risk that domestic
demand growth could remain strong and imbalances could continue to rise (no landing).
34.
The stance of fiscal policy in 2008 is helpful, but more fiscal contraction is
needed to support a soft landing and increase fiscal cushions. To help focus expectations
on the need for slower growth and to reduce the size of the cyclically-adjusted fiscal deficit,
additional fiscal contraction of ½ percent of GDP would be advisable. In any event, the
government should resist pressures to cut taxes, introduce new exemptions or tax credits, or
raise spending in the run up to the October 2008 elections. On the central scenario of a soft
landing, the government should start preparing for additional fiscal consolidation in 2009,
with the goal of achieving cyclically-adjusted balance by 2010. If GDP growth does not
slow as projected, then greater fiscal consolidation would be desirable. Conversely, if the
economic slowdown is considerably sharper than projected, then fiscal policy should not
exacerbate the downturn. In the unlikely event of excess supply, discretionary fiscal
stimulus should be considered. The new fiscal responsibility law is welcome, but the legal
framework could be further improved. In this regard, the government’s plans to enhance
transparency and reduce the risk of procyclicality in an economic upturn are welcome.
35.
The priorities for bank supervision are to maintain high lending standards and
strong risk management, and increase capital buffers. Indicators of the banking system’s
soundness are generally satisfactory and are expected to remain so under the soft landing
scenario. The regulatory and supervisory framework for banks is in line with international
standards, and the BOL conducts effective supervision of all banks operating in Lithuania.
In recent years, the BOL has appropriately strengthened banks’ capital bases and
encouraged strong risk management. Given the potential impact of low-probability extreme
events on the banking system, it would be advisable to raise banks’ capital buffers and to
further discuss with banks, parent banks, and home country authorities contingency plans
(including credit lines) in the event of liquidity shocks. As regards the non-bank financial

21
sector, improved supervision is needed given the rapid growth of assets and the increasing
sophistication of financial institutions.
36.
Greater economic flexibility would support a soft landing by easing supply
bottlenecks and facilitate the reallocation of resources in the event of a hard landing.
Among the priorities should be easing restrictions on working hours, removing obstacles to
immigration, speeding land planning processes, and streamlining the assessment of firms’
compliance with regulatory standards.
37.

APPENDIX II. LITHUANIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Over the past several years, Lithuania has made good progress in establishing a
macroeconomic database. Official data for all sectors are adequate for surveillance purposes.
Lithuania subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) in May 1996, and
its metadata have been posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(DSBB) since April 1997. Lithuania meets the SDDS specifications for coverage, periodicity
and timeliness of the data, and for the dissemination of the advance release calendars. A
significant amount of economic and financial information is now available on various
websites through the Internet (see section on Dissemination of Statistics, below). A ROSC
data module was published in November 2002.
National Accounts
The national accounts are compiled by Statistics Lithuania (SL) (the former Department of
Statistics) in accordance with the guidelines of the European System of Accounts 1995
(ESA 95). Quarterly GDP estimates at current and at constant prices are compiled using both
the production and expenditure approaches. GDP estimates by production are considered to
be more reliable than the corresponding estimates by expenditure, but no statistical
discrepancies between these two estimates are shown in the published figures as the
discrepancies are included in the estimates of changes in inventories. In general, good data
sources and sound methods are used, for the compilation of the national accounts, but
difficulties remain in measuring the economic activity of the informal sector. These latter
estimates are compiled at detailed levels of economic activity using fixed coefficients derived
from a benchmark survey conducted in 1996. The annual and the quarterly national accounts
are compiled at previous year prices and chain-linked to 2000.
Price Data
Since December 1998, CPI weights have been updated annually. The monthly CPI is
available in the second week following the reference month. The producer price index is
calculated according to the chain-linked Laspeyres formula with weights updated every year.

6

Public Finance
Data on the central government budget execution are available quarterly, although these data
are subject to frequent revisions. The ongoing treasury project is expected to improve fiscal
data quality substantially. However, further work is needed to clarify the treatment of public
health care providers and of EU transactions, and the consolidation procedure for
government operations. A new classification, incorporating the GFSM2001 was approved in
mid-2003. Since then, the MoF has been reporting to STA general government’s annual data
on an accrual and cash basis (except for local governments, which are still on a cash basis)
for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY). In addition, the MoF
has been reporting quarterly and monthly data in the GFSM 2001 format for publication in
the IFS.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
The Bank of Lithuania (BoL) reports monetary and financial statistics (MFS) to STA on a
timely and regular basis. The scope, concepts and definitions of the MFS are broadly in line
with the guidelines of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). Following
Lithuania’s accession to the European Union, the BoL implemented the ECB framework for
compiling and reporting monetary data reflecting the ECB regulations (1995 ESA) on
sectorization, valuation and classification of financial instruments.
External Sector
The BoL is responsible for compiling balance of payments, international investment position
(IIP), external debt and international reserves statistics. The BoL reports quarterly data on
balance of payments, IIP and monthly international reserves to STA on a timely and regular
basis. Balance of payments data (on a monthly and quarterly basis) are compiled using the
format recommended in the Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM5). The monthly
data correspond to several key balance of payments components, compiled on the basis of a
sample survey covering the public sector, commercial banks, and some nonfinancial private
sector institutions. The Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency
Liquidity is disseminated monthly according to the operational guidelines and is hyperlinked
to the Fund’s DSBB. Since late 2004, the BoL disseminates quarterly external debt data in
the World Bank’s Quarterly External Debt Statistics (QEDS) database.
Dissemination of Statistics
The authorities publish a range of economic statistics through a number of publications,
including the SL's monthly publication, Economic and Social Developments, and the BoL's
monthly Bulletin. A significant amount of data are available on the Internet:
•

metadata for data categories defined by the Special Data Dissemination Standard are
posted on the IMF’s DSBB (http://dsbb.imf.org);

7

•

the BoL website (http://www.lb.lt) provides data on monetary statistics, treasury bill
auction results, balance of payments, IIP, external debt and other main economic
indicators;

•

the SL website (http://www.stat.gov.lt) provides monthly and quarterly information
on economic and social development indicators;

•

the MoF (http://www.finmin.lt) home page includes data on the national budget, as
well as information on laws and privatization; and

•

the Vilnius Stock Exchange website (http://www.lt.omxgroup.com.?lang=en) has
information on stock trading.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in
US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total
external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic
currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in
percent of GDP) remain at their levels of the last projection year.

Statement by the Staff Representative on the Republic of Lithuania
April 16, 2008

1.
This statement reports on key data releases since the staff report was issued. The new
information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
The balance of payments in 2007 was broadly in line with the estimates in the
staff report. The somewhat larger-than-estimated current account deficit was more than
offset by much smaller-than-estimated errors and omissions, resulting in smaller-thanestimated financial flows.

Private sector credit growth continued to slow to 42½ percent year-on-year in
February. The slowdown was most pronounced for household lending, both mortgage- and
consumer-related.
4.
CPI inflation edged up to 11¼ percent year-on-year in March. The rise was due to
increases in food price inflation and core inflation, especially of nontradables, as well as an
increase in the excise tax on tobacco.

Article IV consultation with the Republic of Lithuania.1
Background
Economic performance over much of the past decade has been very strong, reflecting in part
broad macroeconomic stability. The growth rate of real GDP per capita has been one of the
highest among emerging market countries, inflation one of the lowest, and the unemployment
rate has declined. These favorable developments have been supported by EU accession, rapid
financial integration, and generally sound macroeconomic policies, including the currency board
arrangement, the low and declining level of public debt, and relatively flexible labor and product
markets.
However, external and internal imbalances increased in 2007. The external current account
deficit widened to an estimated 13 percent of GDP and end-year Consumer Price Index (CPI)
inflation rose to 8¼ percent. House prices continued to increase, accompanied by a rising share
of property-related investment in GDP and rapid credit growth. Rapid wage growth led to an
appreciation of the real effective exchange rate.
Public finances are generally sound, but fiscal policy turned procyclical in 2007. General
government debt fell from 24 percent of GDP to 18 percent of GDP between 2000–06, reflecting
small fiscal deficits and rapid GDP growth. However, in 2007, the fiscal deficit (including

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

restitution payments) widened to 2 percent of GDP, giving rise to a fiscal stimulus of ½ percent
of GDP. A fiscal responsibility law was enacted in November 2007. The law prohibits mid-year
budgets, requires that revenue over performance be saved, and stipulates that the government
budget aim for balance or better, subject to escape clauses intended to avoid procyclical policy
in an economic downturn.
Indicators of the banking system’s soundness are generally satisfactory. Profitability is high and
nonperforming loans are low, and capital adequacy has increased in recent years. Foreignowned banks account for about 85 percent of the banking system’s assets. In recent years, the
Bank of Lithuania (BOL) has strengthened banks’ capital bases by raising the effective risk
weight on residential mortgages, restricting the amount of current-year profits that count toward
regulatory capital, and asking banks to fully retain profits. The BOL has also urged banks to pay
due attention to loan-to-value ratios and debt-service-to-income-ratios, and to conduct stress
tests on borrowers’ debt service capabilities under different interest rate scenarios. In the nonbank financial sector, assets have grown rapidly and financial institutions are becoming
increasingly sophisticated.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Lithuania’s impressive economic performance over much of
the past decade—in particular, rapid economic growth and rising employment rates—that
reflected EU accession, rapid financial integration, and generally sound macroeconomic policies
under the currency board arrangement.
However, Directors raised concerns about the recent rise in external and internal imbalances,
characterized by an unsustainable current account deficit and an increase in domestic
inflationary pressures, resulting from excess domestic demand. Directors observed that these
imbalances will need to be reduced significantly over the medium term in order to contain
external vulnerabilities. They also noted that, although the level of the real effective exchange
rate is still broadly appropriate, continued rapid wage growth could erode competitiveness.
Given the currency board arrangement, Directors stressed that fiscal and structural policies hold
the key to stabilization and growth.
Looking ahead, Directors considered that tightening financing conditions would lead to an
orderly easing of imbalances in 2008–09, and concurred that a soft landing of the economy is
the most likely scenario. Given tighter bank lending standards and the cooling of the housing
market, a substantial slowdown in credit growth is likely. Therefore, while the economy’s
underlying momentum remains strong, Directors expected domestic demand growth to slow,
leading to a narrowing of the current account deficit and an easing of inflationary pressures.
However, Directors were concerned about the risk of a hard landing. They cited the experience
of other countries where rapid house price increases were sometimes followed by abrupt house
price declines. Directors cautioned that Lithuania’s reliance on external financing makes it
vulnerable to a sharper scaling back of new lending by parent banks. If these risks materialize,
domestic demand growth could slow quickly.

3
Directors welcomed the planned tightening of fiscal policy in 2008, and suggested additional
fiscal contraction to support a soft landing. They recommended that the government start
preparing for further fiscal consolidation in 2009, with the goal of achieving cyclically-adjusted
balance by 2010. Directors urged the government to resist pressures to cut taxes, introduce
new exemptions or tax credits, or raise spending in the run up to the October 2008 elections.
They welcomed the new fiscal responsibility law, and supported the government’s plans to
further enhance transparency and reduce the risk of procyclicality in an economic upturn. They
also encouraged the authorities to give priority to increasing government efficiency within the
context of a medium term fiscal strategy.
Directors emphasized that the priorities for bank supervision are to maintain high lending
standards and strong risk management and to increase capital buffers. They welcomed the
findings of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) update, namely that indicators of
the banking system’s soundness are generally satisfactory and are expected to remain so under
the soft landing scenario. Directors observed that the regulatory and supervisory framework for
banks is in line with international standards, and that the Bank of Lithuania conducts effective
supervision of all banks operating in Lithuania. They welcomed the Bank of Lithuania’s
measures in recent years to strengthen banks’ capital bases and encourage strong risk
management. Directors noted that the dominance of reputable foreign banks supports the
banking system’s resilience but also exposes Lithuania to the risk of financial contagion.
Nevertheless, given the potential impact of low-probability extreme events on the banking
system, Directors recommended that banks’ capital buffers be raised and that contingency
plans, including credit lines, in the event of liquidity shocks be further discussed with banks,
parent banks, and home country authorities. As regards the non-bank financial sector, Directors
urged the authorities to improve supervision given the rapid growth of assets and the increasing
sophistication of financial institutions.
Directors observed that greater economic flexibility and productivity-enhancing reforms would
support a soft landing by easing supply bottlenecks and would facilitate the reallocation of
resources in the event of a hard landing. Priorities include easing restrictions on working hours,
removing obstacles to immigration, improving the education system and encouraging
investment in science and technology, and streamlining the assessment of firms’ compliance
with regulatory standards.

Statement by Jens Henriksson, Executive Director for the Republic of Lithuania
and Darius Abazorius, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
April 16, 2008
The Lithuanian authorities were pleased by the outstanding and professional cooperation
with Mr. Morsink, Ms. Khamis and their teams. The authorities also welcome staff’s
appraisal of the recent economic developments and the policy advice on macroeconomic and
financial policy. They broadly agree with staff’s views and recommendations.
The authorities remain committed to taking further measures to maintain high quality of
bank asset and strengthen capital buffers in the banking system. To limit demand stimulus
and inflationary pressures, the authorities are seeking to tighten fiscal policy this year and to
achieve a budget surplus next year. The authorities expect a soft landing, where imbalances
contract gradually. However, the authorities are aware of the need to be prepared for a lowprobability risk of a hard landing scenario.
The solid export performance and profitability of export companies support the view that the
current account deficit is not related to the problems of competitiveness. Therefore, the
authorities agree with staff that the real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with
fundamentals. The authorities remain strongly committed to maintaining the current currency
board arrangement.
Economic developments
1. Economic growth continued to be robust in 2007. Real GDP increased by 8 percent,
marking the sixth consecutive year of rapid economic convergence. In 2008-2009, the GDP
growth is expected to get closer to its potential.
2. The average annual inflation in 2007 was 6.3 percent. In 2008, the average annual inflation
is forecasted to reach 7.9 percent, even though the 12-month inflation rate increased to 10
percent in January 2008 partly due to administrative decisions, such as tax hikes on fuel,
cigarettes and alcohol. Higher food prices would contribute to half of the average annual
inflation in 2008. The inflation is expected to slow down to 4.9 percent in 2009.
3. Although the current account deficit was projected to remain at 14 percent of the GDP in
2008-2009, the current account deficit decreased to12 percent in the last quarter of 2007. The
projected recovery of the capacity in the oil refining sector will further contribute to export
growth. Import developments will be reflecting a slowdown in investment and oil import.
The growth rate of the gross fixed capital formation is projected to decrease from 16 percent
in 2007 to 8 percent in 2008-2009.
4. Although the timing and the extent of the slowdown are still uncertain, the economy is
cooling down. In the last quarter of 2007 and in the beginning of 2008, mortgage lending

2
slowed down due to tightened lending standards. But, at least so far, there was no significant
price correction in the real estate sector or decline in the construction activity. The slowdown
is expected to be driven by a decrease in domestic demand because of a declining credit flow
and resource constraints on the labor market.
5. The authorities consider a soft landing as the main scenario due to robust profitability in
all the main sectors of the economy. In the medium-term, a decrease in the household sector
consumption would encourage a flow of financial and labor resources to more productive
tradable sectors, which would help to ensure a more balanced growth in the future. While an
abrupt decline in house prices could lead to a hard landing, the probability of such a scenario
remains very low.
6. The authorities agree with staff that the underlying current account deficit of around 8
percent is in equilibrium and that the real value of litas is close to the equilibrium real
exchange rate. The main indicators of export competitiveness – export market shares, export
growth – did not show any signals of deteriorating competitiveness in 2007. Along with the
strong growth in the exports of wood, furniture and food, there was a buoyant increase in the
exports of chemical and plastic products and transport equipment, as exporters managed to
take advantage of the favorable developments in external markets.
7. The high wage growth could become a great concern, but so far the accumulated
productivity growth over the last 8 years is approximately equal to the accumulated wage
growth. The authorities are aware that labor market convergence with the rest of the
European Union creates challenges in limiting wage growth and that higher productivity is
the way forward to contain competitiveness. The authorities are implementing structural
reforms to improve the education system as well as encouraging investment in science and
technology and important infrastructure projects.
Fiscal policy
8. The authorities agree with the mission’s conclusions that further fiscal consolidation is
needed to reduce demand pressures and increase fiscal cushions. The authorities are targeting
a deficit of 0.5 percent and a surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP in 2008 and 2009 respectively.
Excise duties on cigarettes and fuels were increased in 2008, and further increases are
envisaged due to commitments assumed under the EU Accession Treaty. The authorities
could consider to increase excise duties further in 2008, if the revenue performance is below
the target. The abolishment of some tax exemptions could improve the revenue performance
in the medium-term. A detailed impact assessment in the field of major tax exemptions is
envisaged this year, with the first results in the second half of 2008. The mortgage interest
deductibility is also currently under review.

3
9. The main Parliamentary Parties Factions have signed an agreement to balance the general
government budget by 2009. In 2007, the authorities introduced fiscal discipline rules. The
Law on Fiscal Discipline was adopted in November 2007 and the Guidelines on the
Improvement of Fiscal Discipline System were approved in the 2007 Convergence Program.
The Law on Fiscal Discipline not only ensures a better alignment of planned expenditures
with revenues, but requires the authorities to take into account the conclusions of the
ECOFIN Council.
10. The authorities are determined to continue with further efforts to improve public finance
management. They have foreseen to provide stricter regulation on the borrowing or
guarantees concerning loans used to finance state investment. The authorities noted staff’s
proposal to have independent scrutiny of the economy’s cyclical position and some key
revenue assumptions. Although the State Audit Office performs the audit of the draft budget,
the authorities are committed to further strengthen the scrutiny of the budget. Key parameters
for macroeconomic indicators and budget revenue planning should be based on the mediumterm structural deficits of the general government calculated on the basis of the data by the
European Commission.
Financial markets
11. The authorities are aware that the increased tension in the global financial markets
requires vigilance and further strengthening of the banks’ capital base, even if the banks are
capable of withstanding potential difficulties and the level of their capitalization is basically
the same as that of the EU banks. So far, the Lithuanian banks have remained relatively
unaffected, with the exception of a slight increase in the borrowing costs, which may lead to
lower profits in the future.
12. In recent years, the Bank of Lithuania (BoL) has been constantly acting to ensure a
measured pace of credit growth and strong bank asset quality. As a result, domestic banks
have granted loans more cautiously; also, they have tightened the loan granting requirements
and decreased financing to the real estate projects. In the absence of a detailed development
plan for a land lot, banks ask for additional collateral and higher pay-ins for loans for
agricultural land purchase. Loan conditions by large domestic banks are expected to be
tightened further in order to mitigate risks.
13. The authorities agree with staff that the external risk has increased, but it is manageable.
As staff precisely pointed out, most of the external borrowing is from parent banks to finance
credit growth, and the share of liabilities to parent banks is rising.
14. At the end of 2007, parent bank funding constituted about 68 percent of the external
financing of the banking system. In 2007, an average remaining maturity of funding through
direct parent banks increased to 40 months (from 28 months in the beginning of the year),
while the share of liabilities coming due within a year fell by 27 percentage points to 21

4
percent. The financing from other foreign banks and financial institutions accounts for about
15-20 percent of the external financing and less than 10 percent of the banking system assets
and represents limited risks in this respect.
15. Moreover, a slower growth in credit would limit further growth of external liabilities in
the future. A close cooperation among the supervisory authorities and central banks of home
and host countries helps to achieve a more effective response to counteract the potential
tensions in the banking system, and ensure long-term interest and commitments of foreign
banks in the Baltic markets. In the beginning of this year, a meeting took place between
representatives of central banks and supervisory authorities of Sweden and the Baltic
countries to discuss issues related to liquidity risk management and crisis prevention.
16. The implementation of the New Capital Accord (Basel II) continues to be one of the
major tasks of the BoL. In 2008, banks introduced a new procedure for calculating capital
adequacy. The BoL’s Board approved the General Provisions for the Internal Capital
Credibility Assessment Process aimed at risk assessment (in particular, credit risk) and the
strengthening and improvement of risk management. Also, the General Provisions for the
Supervisory Inspection and Assessment Process were approved. When implementing the
Basel II requirements, each bank will be subject to the ICAAP assessment and, in case of any
shortcomings, an additional capital adequacy requirement may be imposed on banks. In
addition, the BoL considers further strengthening of the liquidity risk management as one of
the main priorities in the area of supervision of credit institutions.
17. To ensure business continuity in banks and preparedness of banks for potential shocks, a
new General Provision on Stress Testing was approved last year. The results of the testing
done in accordance with the new requirements were submitted by banks to the BoL in the
first quarter of this year. In implementing the Basel II requirements, new requirements were
set for information disclosure. Banks will be obliged to publish significant information about
their operational results, the management of assumed risks and other information necessary
for consumers. In its own turn, the BoL takes part in the disclosure of the supervisory
process; the information to be disclosed can be found on the bank’s website.
18. The recommended implementation plan has been worked out, taking into account the
recommendations received during the Financial Sector Assessment Programme. Furthermore,
in order to strengthen management of both traditional and other risks, a draft General
Provisions on Risk Management has been prepared. Individual meetings of the BoL’s Board
and heads of domestic commercial banks to discuss relevant issues are held on a regular
basis.
19. To ensure that the supervisory and regulatory capacities are in line with financial system
developments, the authorities agree with staff’s advice to strengthen the regulatory and
supervisory framework of the non-bank financial sector.
