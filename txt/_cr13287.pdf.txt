STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND REQUEST FOR AN EXTENDED ARRANGEMENT UNDER
THE EXTENDED FUND FACILITY

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Political and Economic Context: Recent Parliamentary elections resulted in a large
victory for the Pakistan of Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) of Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif and led to the first democratic-to-democratic transition in Pakistan’s history.
This transition was reinforced by the July 30 election by legislators from the national
parliament and the four provincial assemblies of a PML-N president, Mamnoon Hussain.
The convincing win provides a strong mandate to implement a bold reform agenda
required to lift Pakistan’s growth potential, which deteriorated significantly over the
past decade. This is due in part to the difficult regional security situation, which has
discouraged investment, but it is also driven by periodic bouts of macroeconomic
instability and long-standing structural impediments to growth—in particular energy
bottlenecks.
Article IV Discussions: Discussions focused on macroeconomic policies to address
vulnerabilities and reforms to promote robust inclusive growth. The authorities’
ambitious economic program aims to reverse the current mix of large fiscal deficits,
accommodative monetary policy, and low reserve coverage, which provides few buffers
to absorb shocks. In this regard, staff and the authorities discussed immediate
application of a package of short-term measures in fiscal and monetary policy aimed
at reversing the unsustainable imbalances. The authorities acknowledged that these
measures must be complemented by significant structural reforms in fiscal
management, monetary and financial market institutions, the energy sector, public
sector enterprises, the business climate, and trade policy. Staff advocated a substantial
increase in targeted transfers to the poorest to compensate for the effect of fiscal
consolidation and the reductions in untargeted subsidies.
Program Discussions: The authorities have requested a 36-month extended
arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) for SDR 4.393 billion
(US$6.68 billion, 425 percent of quota). SDR 360 million ($540 million, 34.8 percent
of quota) will become available upon Board approval, and the remainder will be evenly

phased thereafter subject to quarterly reviews. The Fund supported program aims to
reduce the risk of a crisis in the short term and to address Pakistan’s underlying
medium-term problems to sustain higher and more inclusive growth. The authorities
have already taken important measures to ensure a strong start and signal their
commitment—including approving fiscal consolidation measures totaling 2 percent
of the GDP, applying higher electricity tariffs as part of a comprehensive new energy
policy, reorienting monetary policy to begin rebuilding foreign exchange reserves, and
launching a new tax enforcement program. Quantitative Performance Criteria are set to
reduce the government budget deficit to sustainable levels and reduce crowding-out
of private investment, to recalibrate monetary policy to build reserves, and to reduce
inflation over the medium-term. Structural conditionality is designed to strengthen the
tax system, address energy bottlenecks, liberalize the trade regime, restructure or
privatize public sector enterprises, improve the business climate, strengthen central
bank operational independence, enhance financial sector stability, and protect the most
vulnerable. The program carries significant implementation risks given Pakistan’s track
record, but they are mitigated by critical upfront actions and even phasing of Fund
disbursements, as well as by the strong electoral mandate and commitment to reform
of the new government.

ECONOMIC BACKGROUND
Macroeconomic imbalances, structural weaknesses, and security and political concerns have negatively
impacted Pakistan’s economy and kept growth below the level needed to reduce poverty and absorb
the labor force.
1.
Economic performance in Pakistan has been
substandard in recent years. GDP growth has averaged
only 3 percent over the past five years, insufficient to
significantly improve living standards or fully absorb the
growing labor force. With the population still rising
quickly, per capita income growth has lagged behind
other South Asian economies (Figure 1). While reliable
recent data on poverty is not available, in 2006 some
23 percent of the population lived on under US$1 a day.
According the UNDP, 49.4 percent of the population
lived in multidimensional poverty. Growth has also been
more volatile in Pakistan, in part reflecting poor
economic management. Severe problems with the
electricity supply and a difficult security situation have
been important factors in anemic growth. Productivity
growth has fallen sharply over the past two decades,
undermining the country’s growth potential.
International rankings also place Pakistan low in terms of
business climate, governance, human development, and
poverty, which also impair economic performance.

over the past five years, reflecting sharp drops in
both foreign and domestic investment. Domestic private investment dropped from 14 percent
of GDP in 2007/08 to an estimated 10.9 percent of GDP in 2012/13 (Figure 2). Weak private sector
credit growth has contributed to the decline—private credit has fallen in real terms in recent years,
crowded out by rapidly rising public borrowing and a difficult macroeconomic environment. Foreign
direct investment (FDI) peaked above 3 percent of GDP (well above other South Asia countries) in
2007/08, and has since fallen below ½ percent of GDP, putting further pressures on ailing
international reserves. As a result, private consumption has been driving the aggregate demand,
supported by workers’ remittances and farm income.

exchange rate remains somewhat stronger than
what is suggested by fundamentals and desired policies. While several exchange rate assessment
approaches7 suggest only a modest overvaluation of the exchange rate (of 3–6 percent), financial
account flows, extremely low and falling foreign exchange reserves, and a weak foreign asset
position all point to a more significant problem with external stability (Box 1).
6.
The fiscal deficit remained large. The 2012/13 fiscal deficit (excluding grants) is estimated
to be over 8½ percent of GDP, well above the original budget target (4.7 percent of GDP) due to
slippages on both revenues and expenditures. The revenue shortfall of 1¼ percent of GDP relative
to the 2012/13 budget is largely explained by the underperformance in tax collections in the
previous fiscal year, inadequate tax administration, and a slowdown in economic activity. Higher
expenditures (2¾ percent of GDP) reflect higher energy subsidies. Moreover, the provincial surplus
envisaged in the budget has not materialized. With very low external financing, the deficit has been
almost entirely financed domestically. Pakistan’s tax revenue-to-GDP ratio, at about 10 percent of
GDP, remains among the lowest in the world among non-oil exporters.8 Tax loopholes, exemptions
and concession have left a small pool for taxation. For example, agriculture is mostly outside the tax
net, and the number of taxpayers filing income tax returns is very small relative to the size of the
population (about 1 percent).

This includes about US$871 million in currency swap with China.

As of end-June 2013, gross reserves included US$871 million from a swap with China, US$2.3 billion in domestic

Pakistan
Current account

Background. Aside from an almost balanced current account in 2010/2011, Pakistan’s current
account has been in deficit for the last nine years, peaking at 8% of GDP in 2008 due to an
increased import bill from an oil price shock that year. The current account balance as a share
of GDP has been declining since then, due to lowered oil prices and official service credit
inflows (Coalition Support Fund), reaching -1.0% of GDP for 2012/13.
Assessment. A variety of approaches suggest Pakistan’s current account is slightly weaker
than the -0.1 to 0.1 of GDP implied by medium-term fundamentals.

Real exchange rate

Background. Pakistan’s real effective exchange rate (REER) has been relatively stable since the
end of the 1990s despite significant variations in the current account balance. The REER
depreciated by 4% since July 2012.
Assessment. Model results suggest that the real exchange rate appears overvalued by 3% to
6%. Extremely low and falling foreign exchange reserves, however, point to a more significant
imbalance. The exchange market pressure index, a sum of the nominal exchange rate
depreciation and reserve loss percentages, was 37% in 2011/12 and increased to 53% in
2013/14.

Capital account flows and measures

FX intervention and reserves

Foreign asset and liability position

Background. Private capital inflows have dried up, with FDI decreasing by an average of 40%
per year over the 4 years since the financial crisis, and almost no net portfolio inflows (less
than 0.01% of GDP).

Overall assessment
The external position appears weaker than the
level consistent with medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policy settings.
While the current account deficit is modest, the
low level of reserves and weak capital and
financial account make it difficult to finance.
Reserves have fallen by 44% in the past year, in
large part due to repayments to external official
creditors. Reserves had previously declined by
40% in 2008, due to a large current account
deficit and weak financial account, and then
had recovered with the assistance of official
credit.
Potential policy responses
The first step in decreasing the risk of a BoP
crisis is for the central bank to accumulate
reserves through purchases in the foreign
exchange market.

low level of reserves leaves the economy susceptible to a number of triggers that could result
in a BoP crisis, similar to in 2008.
Background. As of end December 2012, Pakistan’s net international investment position is
about -30% of GDP, with assets at 10% and liabilities at 40% of GDP, respectively. External
debt is at 27% of GDP, about 90% of which is to the official sector.
Assessment. Vulnerabilities exist given the majority of liabilities are debt liabilities and there is
a low level of foreign exchange reserves.

7.
Revenue sharing agreement continues to pose a challenge to fiscal consolidation
(Box 2). Pakistan is a federation where most of the revenues are collected by the central government
and redistributed to the provinces—which in turn transfer some funds to lower levels of
government. Under successive constitutional amendments and decisions by the National Finance
Commission (NFC), transfers to the provinces have increased sharply in recent years at a time when
the federal government has struggled to address its large fiscal deficits.9 Due to the nature of the
revenue sharing arrangements, efforts by the federal government to increase most tax revenues
would go into a common pool of which 57½ percent is automatically transferred to the provinces.
8.
The energy sector is a major drag on economic activity. The sector remains saddled with
considerable problems that have led to unreliable electricity supply and large fiscal costs, including
price distortions, insufficient collections, costly and poorly targeted subsidies, inadequate
governance and low efficiency in energy supply and distribution, regulatory inadequacies, and
insufficient investment in new energy production and modernization. As a result, power outages
(“load shedding”) have averaged around 8–10 hours a day, constraining production and
employment. Output losses are estimated at 2 percent of GDP annually. Energy-related subsidies
reached 1¾ percent of GDP in 2012/13, and payments arrears (“circular debt”)—estimated at
4 percent of GDP—continues to accumulate due to below cost recovery tariff rates, and delays in
tariff determination and fuel cost adjustments. The government cleared 1.5 percent of GDP of this
circular debt in June 2013 and is expected to clear an additional ¾ percent of GDP in the coming
months.

12½ percent, almost fully driven by direct fiscal borrowing from the SBP which more than offset the
impact of a large decline in SBP net foreign assets (NFA). Since July 2012, the SBP has reduced its
policy rate by a cumulative 300 basis points to 9 percent, citing declining inflation and the need to
promote growth.

To address that federal government’s large fiscal imbalance, revenue mobilization will have to play
an important role in restoring fiscal stability. The federal government will need to use additional
revenues resulting from tax measures or improvements in tax administration to reduce the deficit.
th
th
Lowering the share of resources, however, runs counter to the 7 NFC award and the 18 amendent of the

Constitution. Options could include applying a lower provincial share of the pool only at the margin or—
on a transitional basis—committing the Provinces to run surplus. Such cooperative outcomes could be
pursued under the umbrella of the Council of Common Interest. Eventually, a revamp of the revenueth
sharing formula will be required when the 8 NFC Award is negotiated over the next two years. A better

match needs to be obtained between revenue and expenditure responsibilities which would not leave the
federal government with chronic deficit, while the provinces run surpluses. A secondary objective of the
new formula should be to better divide revenue responsibilities to facilitate an improved tax system.
Currently, income tax responsibilities are divided by type of income and sales tax responsibilities are split
between goods and services, which complicates tax administration.

The financial system is dominated by banks that have been relatively healthy but
nonperforming loans remain high. Overall capital adequacy remained well above the statutory
minimum capital requirement (CAR), at 15.1 percent at end-March 2013. The banking system as a
whole is liquid and profitable and deposit growth has remained strong (nearly 16 percent) in recent
years. Nevertheless, nonperforming loans (NPLs) are high (14.7 percent), and a few banks operating
below CAR. The high concentration of assets in public debt (around 37 percent of total assets) at a
time of weak public finances is another source of risk. While NPLs are relatively well-provisioned for
the system as a whole (over 70 percent), the slowdown in economic activity and pressures on the
balance of payments continue to affect bank soundness.

An unchanged policy mix would elevate overall vulnerabilities and crisis risks and cloud Pakistan’s
economic prospects.
11.
Under unreformed policies, Pakistan’s economic situation will continue to deteriorate,
and near-term crisis risks are high. Low and declining SBP reserves leave the country vulnerable to
a balance of payments crisis from even relatively minor external or domestic shocks (¶13). Domestic
risks also emanate from the fiscal imbalance with the attendant high government debt rollover
requirements (30 percent of GDP per year), a severe energy crisis, and security problems. On the
fiscal side, staff’s baseline scenario projects continued weak revenue collection and high energy
subsidies would generate a budget deficit of around 8½ percent of GDP.10 With continued
monetization of fiscal deficits and further depreciation of the rupee, inflation will likely increase in
the coming months and return to double digits. The current account deficit is projected to be
around 1 percent of GDP by end-June 2014. However, the baseline balance of payments is expected
to remain under pressure given weak export growth and large net capital outflows,11 with reserves
declining to around US$3.5 billion by end-June 2014 (0.8 months of imports), and the rupee is
projected to continue depreciating against the U.S. dollar.
12.
Over the medium term, Pakistan’s economy will continue to underperform and
vulnerabilities will remain high unless comprehensive reforms are implemented. With low
savings and investment, high fiscal deficits, weak private credit, unresolved energy problems, core
inflation in double digits, and ongoing security problems,12 baseline real GDP growth is likely to
remain around 3 percent with considerable potential volatility, well below the needed growth to
make a significant dent on unemployment (Text table below). Credit to the private sector would
10

However, fiscal measures included in the 2013/14 budget would lower this to around 6½ percent of GDP (¶20).

11

Large repayments to the Fund are a key component of net capital outflows. Fund repayments peak during the next
financial year, totaling nearly US$3.2 billion.

According to the Uppsala Conflict Data Program, Pakistan has been classified as at war since 2008, but GDP growth
has averaged about 3 percent annually.

continue to be crowded out, contributing to depressed private investment. The fiscal deficit would
continue to deteriorate, requiring financial repression to maintain debt sustainability. The external
position would be under increasing pressure despite low current account deficits by international
standards. The international reserves cushion would become uncomfortably low (below one month
of imports), despite assuming large unidentified inflows. Total debt would rise significantly over the
medium term and government financing needs remain large and while external debts are sensitive
to exchange rate shocks, domestic debts could deteriorate with adverse interest rate shocks.

The risks to the medium-term outlook are tilted to the downside (Box 3). Without
significant policy adjustments and support from the international community, large domestic and
external vulnerabilities could well depress economic outcomes beyond the baseline. While, the
fragile foreign reserves position is sensitive to external shocks and could negatively impact the
macroeconomic stability, the internal shocks, in particular energy shortages and security concerns
could further prevent private sector investment and stall growth. Key risks include the following:


12

Pakistan’s energy crisis threatens the broader economy. The sector is burdened with
structural problems, price distortions, insufficient collection, theft, untargeted subsidies,
inadequate supply, and poor governance. Long and unpredictable blackouts, reaching
16 hours/day in some areas, have been disruptive for businesses, while adding to dissatisfaction
and frustration among the population.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAKISTAN



Security concerns could increase economic risks. Pakistan faces significant insurgency
problems in the regions bordering Afghanistan, which could intensify with the drawdown
of NATO forces there. Sectarian violence in Balochistan and other provinces has been another
source of unrest, while street crime in Karachi adds to security concerns.



Vulnerability to oil price shocks has risen in recent years. While oil imports declined from
33 percent of imports in 2001 to about 16 percent in 2004, they have risen each year since, and
the oil vulnerability index has risen (Box 4). In contrast, food price vulnerability is about one-third
of oil vulnerability and has been declining in recent years.



Pakistan is vulnerable to inward remittance spillovers. While a decline in oil prices would
lower import pressures, there might be adverse indirect effects on reduced remittances from
workers in oil exporting countries (60 percent of Pakistan’s remittances come from the Middle
East).



A further global economic decline could impair Pakistan’s exports. A further downturn in
Europe would have negative effects, as ¼ of Pakistan’s exports go to Europe, and most nonMiddle East remittances come from Europe. Although links to most emerging markets are weak
and capital flows to Pakistan are small, slow growth in emerging markets could add to external
sector risks.



The financial sector is not in imminent danger, but banks remain vulnerable to a further
deterioration in the overall macro-economic environment. The trend over the last decade
confirms a close negative relationship between the performance of economy and buildup of
NPLs (Figure 3). The balance sheets of commercial banks are also highly exposed to government
securities, so a fiscal crisis—if it materialized—would have a large impact.

14.
Reforms will substantially reduce Pakistan’s vulnerability to crisis. A reform package
including significant fiscal consolidation, a more flexible monetary and exchange rate policy, and
comprehensive structural reforms would reduce crisis risks stemming from unsustainable fiscal and
balance of payments positions. Reforms would also make the economy more resilient against shocks
by increasing financial buffers, as the improved policy environment would likely attract significant
international financial support.

(14½ percent), wheat and bread (12½ percent), and
cooking oil (10 percent) are the other major categories. As a

government export policy, cooking oil imports has been
hovering around 4 percent of total imports for the past decade. Pakistan’s largest import item is oil, averaging 27 percent of total
imports in the past decade. Oil imports declined from 33 percent of imports in 2001 to about 16 percent in 2004 but have risen
each year since, while international oil prices increased and simultaneously electricity generation fuel mix has shifted toward oil.

Pakistan has become more vulnerable to oil price shocks in recent years. Growing oil demand for electricity production,
coupled with rises in the international oil price, have increased Pakistan’s vulnerability to oil price shocks. Oil now accounts for
about one-third of electricity generation in Pakistan, a significant increase from the 2004 level of 16 percent. As a result, the oil
price vulnerability index2 has risen steadily since 2004 and reached its highest level in recent years. The food price vulnerability
index is about a third of the magnitude of the oil index and has been declining in recent years. However, the food index is highly
volatile and depends largely on factors related to wheat, such as the size of the domestic harvest and government trade policy.

We have used an index, developed by IMF staff, to measure how vulnerable Pakistan is to rising food or oil prices, “vulnerability to food and oil shocks indices.” The index is

a weighted combination of the ratio of oil/food imports to total household consumption (as an indicator of oil/food dependency); the ratio of food/oil imports to total
merchandise imports (as an indicator of the burden of oil/food imports); and the inverse of the level of GDP per capita (which measures the capacity to provide oil/food
safety nets for domestic consumers). Please see http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/reo/2012/mcd/eng/mreo1112.htm for further details.

Adjustment would raise medium-term growth prospects. As these reforms take hold,
savings and investment rates would increase, inflation would fall, real GDP growth would rise
significantly, and unemployment would decline. Over the medium term and with fiscal deficits
reduced to sustainable levels, debt levels would decline rapidly, lowering the country’s vulnerability
to exchange and interest rate shocks (text Table 1).
16.
Adjustment policies also carry risks, but they can be mitigated by improved social
protection. Fiscal consolidation would undoubtedly be contractionary in the near term,13 but the
negative effects can be mitigated by: (i) increasing targeted transfers to the most vulnerable
population; (ii) increasing investment by improving private sector access to credit; and (iii) alleviating
acute energy supply bottlenecks to increase productive capacity. In the short-run, immediate action
to address financial imbalances, improve the energy sector fuel mix, and enhance governance could
improve energy supplies sufficiently to contribute up to 1 percentage point to GDP growth.14 Over
3 years, the positive effects of greater price stability and policy predictability on investment and
consumption behavior together with pro-growth structural reforms—such as comprehensive energy
reforms, trade liberalization, improvements in the investment climate—along with donor support
would place the economy on a sustainably higher growth path.
Authorities’ Views
17.
The authorities share staff’s concerns about short-term crisis risks, and are strongly
committed to short-term adjustment measures together with structural reforms to boost
medium-term growth. They are more optimistic than staff about the growth outlook under a
reform scenario, however. The 2013/14 budget assumes a 4–4½ percent rise in GDP growth and the
government envisages growth rising to around 7 percent in the medium-term, while staff view
5 percent as a more likely positive scenario. The SBP also retains a more sanguine view of inflation
prospects than staff.

13

Staff used econometrics models to estimate fiscal multipliers for total revenues and expenditures which are about
one for Pakistan.

14

Joint IMF and World Bank research suggests that a 30 percent increase in energy supply would generate a
2 percent increase in GDP. In staff’s view, a 15 percent increase in effective energy supply could be obtained in the
first year by increasing the allocation of gas to electricity production, improving administration in distribution
companies to reduce losses, and tackling the circular debt problem, whereby production is lower due to financial
constraints from unpaid bills

ARTICLE IV DISCUSSIONS: TOWARD HIGHER AND
MORE INCLUSIVE GROWTH
Policy discussions focused on macroeconomic policies and structural reforms needed to avoid a crisis
and to improve sustainably Pakistan’s medium-term growth outlook.
18.
Pakistan’s key economic challenge is to put the policies in place needed to alleviate
large and persistent external vulnerabilities and to generate high, stable economic growth.
This will involve short-term stabilization policies to reduce crisis dangers and restore fiscal and
balance of payments sustainability, thus creating the preconditions for a recovery in investment.
Simultaneously, efforts need to begin on profound structural reforms to boost growth potential over
time. Together, these policy initiatives will help mitigate vulnerabilities, strengthen economic
performance, creating jobs and reducing unemployment (Box 5). Stronger policies will help mobilize
multilateral financial support from donors and encourage private sector capital inflows, which will
help to address Pakistan’s external stability problem.

A.

Return to Fiscal Sustainability

19.
The fiscal stance is not sustainable and
requires significant consolidation to ensure
sustainability. Over the past few years, declining
tax revenues and increasing energy subsidies
have worsened an already large fiscal deficit.
Domestic financing of the fiscal deficit has
produced severe crowding-out of private sector
credit, and a reliance on negative real interest
and direct financing from the SBP. Public debt
has climbed above 60 percent of GDP with very
short average maturity of domestic public debt,
and increased vulnerability of external debt
service to currency depreciation.

The 2013/14 federal budget represents an important initial step towards the needed
fiscal consolidation. The budget targets a deficit of 6.5 percent of GDP. The tax package included
in the budget is expected to raise revenues by about ¾ percent of GDP. However, in staff’s view it
makes only limited progress towards a more efficient and equitable tax system, and further efforts
will be needed to reach the medium term targets envisaged by the government. Tax revenue will
likely fall short of the budget target, but the authorities are willing to take action to compensate
(¶50). Likewise, the reduction in subsidies envisaged in the budget will not fully materialize despite
the authorities’ strong plan to reduce the subsidies.

Box 5. Unemployment in Pakistan
The labor force is growing and providing employment opportunities remains challenging.
Pakistan’s population growth rate of 2.2 percent (annual average) over the last decade is among
the highest in developing economies1 with about 40 percent of the population below the age
of 15. With participation rates also rising, the labor force is expected to grow by 3.5 percent in
the coming years. High unemployment among the youth is particularly widespread,2 and only
25 percent of employment is in the formal sector. Although, the official unemployment rate is
about 6.7 percent in 2012/13, the rural unemployment rate (9.1 percent as of 2012Q3) is twice
the urban rate (4.8 percent as of 2012Q3).
Without significant reform, unemployment
will rise in the coming years. Weak
macroeconomic policies and structural
problems, particularly in the energy sector,
would lead to low growth and high
unemployment in the coming years. Under the
baseline scenario, the projected GDP growth
hovers around 3 percent over the medium
term. According to staff calculations the
unemployment rate will rise from 6.7 percent
in 2012/13 to about 9.0 percent by 2017/18.3

Under a Fund supported program, GDP growth will pick up and unemployment would
decline gradually. The program envisages a mix of macroeconomic policy changes and structural
reforms aiming to boost GDP growth over the course of the program. Although, GDP growth will
initially decline due to fiscal contraction, it will steadily increase to about 5 percent. The
unemployment rate will increase slightly in the first two years of the program, but it will decline
to about 5.8 percent by 2017/18.

Policy actions should permanently strengthen the fiscal stance. Staff advocated a
reduction of the deficit to around 3–3½ percent of GDP in the medium-term to ease crowding out
and set the public debt on a firmly declining path—back below 60 percent of GDP by 2016/17. As
shown in the Debt Sustainability Analysis (Table 11 and Figure 4), moderate shocks to the interest
rate, growth, or the primary balance will result to debt levels above 65 percent—albeit stable, which
highlights the need for reducing the debt ratio to well below the 60 percent of GDP envisaged in the
Fiscal Responsibility Law. In staff’s view, the 60 percent of GDP threshold remains too high for a
country like Pakistan with a low tax-to-GDP ratio and exposure to significant external and internal
shocks. The consolidation should begin aggressively with measures focusing on the revenue side
and on energy subsidies, and continue until the medium-term targeted deficit is reached. In order
to protect the neediest from the effects of the envisaged fiscal consolidation, targeted cash transfer
programs need to be expanded (see ¶50). Among critical fiscal reforms are the following:


Tax policy. Pakistan’s tax to GDP ratio for 2012/13 was 9.7 percent of GDP—significantly less
than the 11.4 percent of GDP in 2002/3—so fiscal consolidation will have to rely heavily on tax
policy changes to broadening the tax base.15 The implementation of a full Value Added Tax
(VAT) remains the first-best option to raise tax revenue, but if this remains politically unfeasible,
other permanent tax policy measures could be considered to come closer to it by wholesale
reductions in exemptions and concessions, and by fully incorporating services into the tax net.
The administrative authority to grant tax exemptions via Statutory Regulatory Orders (SROs)
should be eliminated to prevent further degradation of the tax net. Income tax should integrate
income from all sources, concessions and exceptions should be eliminated, withholding should
be adjustable, with the minimum tax on turnover remaining as a control for deductions.



Tax administration. In a country of nearly 180 million people, only 1.2 million individuals and
firms file income tax returns, (of which half are corporate income tax filers). Some 118,000
entities are enrolled in the sales tax system but only 15,000 actually pay any tax, with 82 percent
of total sales and federal excise revenue coming from only 100 companies. These low numbers
reflect the long-standing failure of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to efficiently administer
the system and the inability of previous reform efforts to deliver sustained results. The
authorities need to develop and implement a strategy to strengthen tax administration, with the
technical assistance of the Fund and the World Bank. While key elements of the strategy will
need to be defined, it should include significantly stepping-up the FBR’s enforcement activities
and improving its legal authority (such as to facilitate asset seizures for tax evaders and to
presumptively bill taxpayers). The anti-money laundering framework will need to be fully applied
in this effort.



Expenditure reforms. The composition of public spending should shift to more growth friendly
outlays, including infrastructure, health, and education, with the phasing out of untargeted
energy and commodity subsidies, currently around 1.9 percent of GDP (Box 6). Targeted income

support programs should be strengthened. Civil service reform should also be considered, to
improve the quality of the public service, reduce corruption, and contain the public wage bill.
Box 6. Reducing Energy Subsidies
The authorities have launched their plan to gradually eliminate most of the energy subsidies.1 The four phase
plan is expected to reduce the subsidies from about 1.8 percent of GDP to 0.3–0.4 percent of GDP in three
years.
Phase I. The first phase entailed the
almost full elimination of the subsidy for
industrial, commercial, bulk, and AJ&K2
users, accomplished through an increase in
tariff of about 50 percent at end--July. The
majority of domestic consumers are
excluded from increases at this stage.



Phase II. The second phase entails
the elimination of the subsidy for
3
consumption over 200Kwh, SCARP , and
others (public lighting, housing schemes,
railways, HVTL4), and reducing the subsidy in
agriculture by about 13 percent. The
corresponding price increases have already
been approved and notified—effective
October 1st.

Phases III and IV. In FY 2014/15 and FY 2015/16 the authorities will reduce the remaining subsidies (on
agriculture and consumption below 200Kwh) in order to reduce the fiscal burden to 0.3-0.4 percent of GDP. By the
end of Phase IV the subsidy for consumption above 200Kwh will be eliminated, and it will be reduced for those
below 200Kwh. While most households will see price increases, subsidies will remain for the lowest level
consumers and increases in targeted transfer programs will also protect the poorest.



Pakistan strategy is broadly consistent with the lessons learned from previous energy reforms. Their strategy
addresses the six key elements usually linked with successful reforms: (i) they developed a comprehensive
energy sector reform plan with long-term objectives, (ii) they have launched a communication strategy,
(iii) the price increases are phased and sequence differently across energy products, (iv) they are
strengthening their cash transfer program to protect the poor, (v) they are working towards improving the
efficiency in state-own enterprises, and (vi) they are working towards improving the timeliness of the pricing
mechanisms.

Fiscal federalism reforms. The revenue sharing system needs to be reformed to increase
provinces’ incentives to rely less on federal transfers and more on their own revenue-raising
efforts (Box 2). A mechanism needs to be put in place to set and implement statutory limits on
provincial fiscal balances, supported by strengthened limits on provincial borrowing. In the
short-run, a binding agreement should be negotiated between the provinces and the federal
government, perhaps at the Council of Common Interest (CCI) to ensure that additional
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAKISTAN

revenues raised under a fiscal consolidation plan are used for deficit reduction rather than
to facilitate additional provincial spending. To the extent possible, this agreement should be
supported by sanctions and by technical modifications of the revenue transfer system
(i.e., a legislated “lock-box”).


Public financial management reforms. Commitment control systems for the general
government need to be implemented for better public financial management. The authorities
also need to strengthen their fiscal debt office to improve deficit financing through lengthening
the maturity of domestic debt, building a longer yield curve, and eventually returning to external
private markets for some fiscal financing (see also ¶33).

Authorities’ Views
22.
The new government feels strongly that the previous fiscal path was unsustainable
and is committed to a process of fiscal consolidation. The authorities view the FY2013/14
budget, approved by parliament on June 27, 2013, as a significant step in that direction. The
authorities are more optimistic than staff about the potential for short-term revenue gains via
improvements in tax administration. While agreeing on the need to eliminate many SROs to reduce
tax loopholes, they were less enthusiastic about eliminating the ability to issue new SROs, which
they see as a flexible and quick-response tool for addressing tax policy needs. Staff noted that SRO
authority could be eliminated for creating new concessions or exemptions, while retaining it for
other policy purposes. On fiscal federalism reforms, the authorities noted that significant
constitutional and political barriers exist to a wholesale overhaul of the system.

B.

Realigning Monetary Policy for Macroeconomic Stability

23.
The SBP has pursued an accommodative monetary policy to lift weak private
investment and growth, in light of falling headline inflation. The policy rate has been cut
repeatedly over the past two years by a cumulative 500 basis points to 9 percent. In addition, in
FY2012/13, the SBP continued direct financing of the large fiscal deficit (accounting for almost all
of the increase in reserve money). Open market operations and foreign currency swaps have also
pumped additional liquidity into the market. As a result, despite falling net foreign assets, monetary
aggregates expanded relatively quickly. However, this accommodative policy did not bear fruit in
terms of private sector stimulus—private credit shrank in real terms.
24.
Pakistan has arrived at a critical balance of payments situation through a combination
of: (i) past current account deficits occasionally coupled with weak financial accounts; (ii) reliance on
external official financing to deal with financing gaps while maintaining an emphasis on relative
exchange rate stability; and (iii) the disappearance of even modest private financial inflows following
the global financial crisis of 2008. The first step in decreasing the risk of a crisis is for the central
bank to accumulate reserves through net purchases in the foreign exchange market. In the mediumterm, a fiscal consolidation plan would help boost national saving, catalyze international support,
and lead to an improvement of the financial account.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 21

PAKISTAN

25.
Prudent monetary and exchange rate policies are needed to address declining reserves
and contain projected rebound in inflation.16 Staff advised that monetary and exchange rate
policies should focus on rebuilding foreign exchange reserves and maintaining price stability. The
SBP should signal a clear policy shift to market participants through purchasing foreign exchange
in the interbank market to bolster reserves. Staff reiterated that the SBP should refrain from further
direct lending to the government and limit open market liquidity injections to the economy.
Inflation reduction should be a top priority of the SBP, as inflationary pressures will likely materialize
in the coming 12–18 months. The SBP’s policy rate should be set prudently to contain expected
inflationary pressures, to maintain positive real interest rates to attract deposits; and to help rebuild
reserves.
26.
The SBP continued to intervene in the foreign exchange market. The SBP’s net sale of
foreign exchange in the spot market totaled US$3.35 billion in 2012/13, almost 70 percent of total
loss in reserves. Staff argued that the chief short-run challenge facing the SBP is to rebuild criticallylow reserves, so a reversal of the exchange intervention policy was urgently needed. External
competitiveness factors also suggest that a moderate weakening of the rupee would be appropriate
(¶6, Box 1). Staff expressed concern about the SBP’s heavy reliance on short-term currency
swap/forward contracts to boost gross reserves, and recommended that they be gradually scaled
back to limit risk.
27.
Independence of the SBP remains inadequate. Staff urged the authorities to amend the
SBP Act in order to establish an independent, decision-making monetary policy committee, which is
a pre-requisite for an optimal design and implementation of monetary policy. Staff stressed that full
Independence would help pave the way for improved price stability, as SBP’s primary objective, and
the elimination of future direct financing of fiscal deficits.
Authorities’ Views
28.
The SBP argued that the recent cuts in policy rates were justified given declining
headline inflation and the need to stimulate growth. While acknowledging that inflationary risks
remain and stressing that it would adjust the rates if circumstances change, the SBP added that the
impacts on private sector credit could have been severe, had the rates not been cut. The SBP
stressed that in addition to other structural factors, the banking system has not fully played its role
of financial intermediation in providing credit to the private sector, resulting in negative real rates
of private credit expansion. In addition, the SBP argued that in evaluating monetary policy in
Pakistan other factors, like law and order, and security concerns should be taken into consideration.
The SBP disagreed that capital flows to Pakistan are sensitive to interest rates in the current
circumstances and pointed to other structural factors that prevented direct and portfolio investment.
On exchange rate policy, the SBP firmly believed that its intervention policy was necessary to ensure
the stability of the foreign exchange market and in avoiding any disruption in market sentiments,
particularly during the sensitive election period. The SBP agreed that the reserves situation was
challenging but asserted that it was manageable.

Safeguarding Financial Sector Stability

29.
Growth in banks’ lending to private sector continues to be weak, while banks’ holdings
of government securities continue to expand. Financial intermediation to the private sector has
declined significantly over the last few years. Despite strong domestic deposit growth, high
capitalization and liquidity levels, and reductions of the policy interest rate and NPLs, lending to the
private sector has been diminishing as a share of total lending from around 75 percent in 2005 to
around 45 percent in 2012, as the fiscal deficit increased from less than 3 percent to around
8 percent. Staff emphasized the need to tackle this severe crowding-out of the private sector in
a credible way in order to stabilize the economy and create the conditions for future growth. The
envisaged reduction of the government’s borrowing requirement and addressing NPLs should help
stimulate private sector credit from the supply side, while greater macro stability and broader
structural reforms should boost demand for private credit. These in turn would support the recovery
of private sector investment, and thus employment and growth.
30.
Staff urged the SBP to address the undercapitalization of a few banks. The SBP has
already identified the capital shortfall for each bank that falls below CAR, where there are four
noncompliant banks (excluding one state-owned bank that is under liquidation)—representing
around 7 percent of the banking sector assets (with a total shortfall of less than 0.1 of GDP).
Moreover, there are nine banks (six private and three state owned) that fall below the minimum
capital requirement (MCR) but meet the CAR, representing 7.8 percent of the banking system assets.
The SBP has provided extension to some banks for meeting MCR, subject to maintaining healthy
CAR and presenting a timeline to meet the shortfall. Staff advised the authorities to develop a welldefined time bound Action Plan to deal with banks that are either below CAR or MCR, and
restructure or merge few state-owned banks. Continued forbearance may pose a financial threat
to financial system and have fiscal implications (e.g., in case of a need to recapitalize a state-owned
bank).
31.
Staff supported financial sector reforms to enhance the resilience of the financial
system. In particular:


Introducing a bankruptcy law: due to nonexistence of a bankruptcy law in Pakistan and the
large volume of NPLs, staff underscored the need to complete the consultation with key
stakeholders in order to finalize the draft Corporate Rehabilitation Act (CRA). At the moment,
banking courts are understaffed, with years of long litigation and resolution process, as well as
weak enforcement capacity of courts’ decisions. This is not a conducive environment for banks
to extend credit to the eligible borrowers. Therefore, there is a need to revamp the recovery
mechanisms by speeding up judicial process and filling up vacancies in banking courts with the
necessary skills to handle outstanding cases.



Setting up a deposit insurance scheme: the SBP is preparing to introduce an explicit Deposit
Protection Fund (DPF). Deposit protection is currently ambiguous in Pakistan, as under the Banks
(Nationalization) Act of 1974, the government of Pakistan implicitly guaranteed the safety of all
deposits, despite the fact that the Banks Act applies only to nationalized banks. Therefore,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 23

PAKISTAN

depositors widely anticipate that the government or the SBP will compensate their deposits in
case of a bank failure. Banks also support the introduction of the DPF. As the draft DPF Act is
being finalized, staff stressed the need to ensure that the necessary preconditions are in place
before launching the DPF, such as achieving compliance of all banks with minimum capital
requirements, appropriate regulation and effective supervision for a sound banking system, and
a special resolution regime.


Enhancing consolidated supervision: the SBP and the Securities and Exchange Commission
of Pakistan (SECP) recognize that consolidated supervision of financial conglomerates is critical
for financial stability. The regulatory framework is similar to a “twin peak” model, where the SBP
is entrusted with regulating the banking system and the SECP with regulating nonbank financial
sector. Given ownership inter-linkages in the financial sector, however, there is a challenge to
regulate these financial conglomerates. The SBP and SECP signed a Memorandum of
Understanding (MoU) to share information and monitor the financial risks on consolidated basis.
A joint task force on financial conglomerates was also established in 2010 and it meets
periodically to discuss regulatory concerns pertaining to consolidated supervision.



Strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework: the SBP has developed and
introduced several prudential regulations (e.g., loan to value, loans to deposits, and exposure
limits on individual borrowers and borrowing groups), aiming to address macro-prudential risk.
It has also improved its macro stress testing framework substantially over the years; however,
there remains no macroeconomic model that the SBP could use for generating baseline and
adverse scenarios for the stress testing. The SBP has requested technical assistance from the
IMF’s Monetary and Capital Markets to assess its overall framework for contingency planning
and crisis management. In addition, the SECP has revisited its legal framework—by drafting
legislation that is under consideration by the government—to enhance its supervisory and
enforcement powers, and to regulate futures markets. Staff also recommended that the
government restore the SECP’s budgetary autonomy.

32.
After the collapse in 2008, there has been renewed buoyancy in the stock market.
The Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE-100) set new records over the last 12 months to June 2013,
outperforming many other emerging markets (Figure 3). Staff recommended that the authorities
closely monitor any speculation and market manipulation to maintain confidence in the stock
market. Looking ahead, the SECP will continue with its reforms to develop stock exchanges through
attracting strategic foreign investors, introducing Shariah-compliant investment products, and
establishing a central counter party to provide protection to investors by reducing credit risk.
33.
Steps should be taken to develop debt markets. The corporate debt market is
underdeveloped and small. For the government debt market, measures have been taken to develop
an efficient and liquid market, by consolidating benchmark securities, automating the auction
process, and pre-announcing the auction calendar for the next quarter. To further deepen the

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAKISTAN

government debt market, the authorities need to: (i) continue aligning rates of returns on the
National Saving Schemes (NSS) to equivalent government securities;17 (ii) improve price discovery
during the auction process by utilizing cut-off rates much less frequently and allowing market forces
to determine the yield on government securities; (iii) build a more complete yield curve by
extending maturities of government securities;18 (iv) issue Sukuk instruments beyond 3-year
maturity; (v) continue to broaden the investor base to include institutional investors, and (vi) list
government debt instruments in the stock exchanges to increase secondary market liquidity.
34.
Over the medium-run, the authorities should seek to further deepen the financial
markets and develop capital markets.19 The financial system of Pakistan remains shallow in terms
of its inclusiveness, depth, efficiency, and stability. Though the system has grown over the last
decade and is diversified, it remains small and largely bank-based. There is scope for further
financial deepening by: (i) continuing to increase access to financial services through the Financial
Inclusion Program and microfinance; (ii) stimulating credit to the private sector; (iii) addressing
undercapitalization of a few banks; and (iv) developing capital markets to provide alternative means
of financing investments and investment opportunities for investors. Financial deepening should,
over the long term, sustain economic growth and increase the effectiveness of macroeconomic
policies.
Authorities’ views
35.
The authorities stressed that the banking system continues to show strong indicators
of financial soundness, with high liquidity, capitalization, and comfortable profitability. They
noted the increasing exposure of banks balance sheets to the government due to high financing
needs. They also acknowledged that there are three noncompliant banks in both CAR and MCR
which are a source of concern, and they have actively engaged with each bank for ensuring full
compliance. They believe that raising additional capital for meeting MCR is quite challenging in the
current domestic and global environment. Moreover, the authorities asserted that the recent policy
rate cuts would help stimulate private sector credit and reduce the debt burden on borrowers, and
thereby lower NPLs.
36.
To enhance the stability of the financial system, the authorities emphasized the
importance of introducing key reforms. They would finalize the consultation with key
stakeholders on the draft bankruptcy law (Corporate Rehabilitation Act) and seek to pass legislation
on a deposit protection fund over the course of the next two years. The SBP and SECP supported
staff’s recommendations for reopening the issue of consolidated supervision, while noting the
importance of the existing interagency coordination arrangements between them to stem any
possible risks from the financial conglomeration.

17

NSS rates are set at 95 percent of the cut-off of last auction.

18

Banks remain reluctant to invest in long maturity beyond a five-year tenor, given uncertainty in the policy interest
rate.

Structural Reforms for Fiscal Consolidation and Economic Growth

37.
Structural reforms, especially in the energy sector, are crucial for fiscal consolidation
and economic growth. The energy sector is saddled with considerable problems that have led to
unreliable electricity supply and large fiscal costs, including price distortions, insufficient collections,
costly and poorly targeted subsidies, inadequate governance and low efficiency in energy supply
and distribution, regulatory inadequacies, and insufficient investment in new energy production
(Box 7). As a result the output level is estimated to be depressed by some 2 percent.20 Outside the
energy sector, growth prospects are limited by the presence of loss-making public sector enterprises
(PSE) in key economic activities, a poor business climate, and a distorted trade regime—all areas
where Pakistan falls short of its peer countries.21
38.
Initial actions on energy sector reform should concentrate on “quick wins” that
contribute to fiscal adjustment and resolve energy sector bottlenecks to boost economic
growth. Staff argued that the key to reform is making the energy system financially viable, including
via clearance of circular debt, tariff adjustments, and a change to cheaper fuels. The mission
welcomed the Prime Minister’s announcement of a new Energy Policy to relieve short-term bottle
necks and encourage long-term increases in electricity supply. In this respect, out of the
Rs. 503 billion of payment arrears identified as of end-May 2013, Rs. 342 billion were cleared at endJune 2013, with the residual slated for resolution by end-August 2013. The arrears reduction will
allow cash-constrained power producers to bring additional electricity supply to the system in the
short-run and reduce load shedding by around three hours per day. Tariff adjustments will improve
resource allocation and efficiency, and will encourage conservation. Staff stressed that phasing out
subsidies is also an important component of fiscal adjustment; however, targeted income support
programs should be used to protect the most vulnerable members of the society. Cost-cutting,
improved collection from nonpayers, and efficiency measures are needed to reach full cost recovery
in the electricity sector.
39.
A key shortcoming of the current electricity sector has been the limited ability to
collect for energy supplied, due in part to a lack of specific real-time data on energy flows,
and which also results in inadequate compliance with usage restrictions. To address this,
strengthened performance contracts needs to be signed with all power sector companies to tackle
losses, raise payment compliance, and improve energy efficiency and service delivery. Staff stressed
that pending amendments to the Penal Code 1860 and the Code of Criminal Procedures 1898 need
to be accelerated to strengthen the legal framework in cases of electricity theft by enhancing
investigation, prosecution, and penalties. However, a new electricity act is still needed to modernize
governance of the sector.

Box 7. Overview of Pakistan’s Power Sector
Technical and financial problems in the energy sector have led to large-scale power outages which have depressed
1
output. In the 2000–10 period, Pakistan increased energy supply by 11 percent in per capita GWh, lagging behind her peers by
almost one fourth. Energy supply has also lagged behind growing demand at notified prices which fell behind the cost recovery
2
levels. The total installed capacity as of end FY12/13 reached around 23.5 GW, however net electrical output has been declining
in the last three years due to drags created by the growing payment arrears, derated power plants, and insufficient supply of gas.
The current generation falls short of estimated demand by 4–5 GW leading to 8–10 hours of load shedding in the system. Delays
3
in tariff determination and low collection rates contributed to increasing arrears in the sector, which further depressed supply.
Transmission and distribution (T&D) losses hover around 22 percent of total supply triple high income economies and more than
4
double the world average. Load shedding in this period led to declining capacity utilization which is estimated to cost around
4,5
10 percent of GDP.
Energy supply relies on costly fuel mix. Despite power sector’s heavy reliance on gas as a generating fuel, the insufficient
supply of gas led to the substitution to costly imported fuel. Growing allocation of gas to domestic users further elevated the
6
shortage in the power sector. Fuel imports reach 36 percent of the total energy mix, however it constitutes 70 percent of the
total energy generation cost.

Pakistan consumes all of its domestic gas production, however due to lack of investment production is dropping. The
7
current level of gas supply is just over one half of unconstrained demand due to low prices and insufficient investment. The lack
of infrastructure also makes it difficult to import gas. At current regulated domestic gas prices, quantity based allocations divert
gas from the power sector to households, transport, fertilizer production and industry. Nevertheless, low user prices discourage
new investment, promote inefficiency in gas use, and have the potential to generate fiscal cost from the gas sector. The current
level of un-accounted for gas losses reached 11 percent—way above international benchmarks.
Fiscal subsidies reached almost 2 percent of GDP per year. The sector generates direct and indirect fiscal costs through
untargeted direct subsidies to energy users and repeated bailouts of the recurrent costs in the sector. Pakistan’s direct subsidies
8
are more than double relative to median emerging market economy. The delays in determination and notification of prices also
increase uncertainty on predicting the cost of subsidies on budget.
Until recently, the increasing stock of circular debt posed to limit energy supply. The stock was estimated to reach
4 percent of GDP as of end-FY13. The debt emerges due to the gap between the actual cost of production and the revenues,
and delayed payments by distribution companies to the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA). T&D losses, delays in price
determination and notification, delays in pass through of fuel price changes, poor revenue collections, courts interference to
power sector governance, delays in subsidy payments by the government to distribution companies all contributed to the
growing circular debt. In June 2013, the government cleared large portion of the circular debt, about 1.4 percent of GDP, which
should help elevate electricity supply. However, until the underline issues are addressed in a systemic way the problem will
emerge in the future.

40.
Conservation and energy efficiency are the cheapest and the fastest ways to alleviate
the electricity shortage. Staff pointed out that pricing and other market based instruments to
encourage energy conservation will significantly improve resource allocation and energy efficiency.
Staff also urged authorities to promulgate the Pakistan Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act.
41.
Current energy generation is tilted towards the use of costly fuel oil. Changes in the
energy mix are required to decrease the production costs. The use of gas and coal rather than fuel
oil needs to be prioritized. Moreover, the development of hydropower projects needs to continue
for long-term sustainable supply.
42.
Gas supply falls short of unconstrained estimated demand by half at current prices and
investment is limited. To help tackle the gas shortages in the short-run, import of Liquefied Natural
Gas (LNG) should be a priority, along with limiting further expansion of the gas distribution
networks for domestic consumption and limiting the use of compressed natural gas to fuel vehicles.
In the medium-term new investment in gas production should be a priority, both from existing fields
and new exploration. Gradual price rationalization would encourage new production and would
allocate gas consumption to the most efficient uses. Improvements in the business climate would
also encourage new domestic and foreign investment in the sector.
43.
Governance and regulatory improvements should be important components of energy
sector reform. Half of current circular debt is caused by inefficiencies in tariff determination and
notification. Staff urged authorities to minimize the time to determine and notify tariffs and to
consolidate the process under the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) while
strengthening NEPRAs administrative capacity. Similarly fuel price adjustments need to be made on
a timely basis. Finally, the institutional capacity of all energy sector PSEs needs to be strengthened
to allow them to operate independently from the Government as efficient commercial entities.
44.
Business climate reforms should initially tackle the major impediments to entry. Staff
pointed out that liberalization of barriers to new business start-ups, simplification of legal and
taxation requirements (such as a “one stop shop” for investors), strengthening anti-corruption
efforts, and designing frameworks to improve contract enforcement would enhance the business
climate and increase investment. Access to credit for small and medium enterprises (SME) remains
very limited. In this respect, the State Bank of Pakistan’s Financial Inclusion Program makes an
important contribution.
45.
Trade policy reforms would stimulate competition, facilitate innovation and encourage
foreign investment. A decade ago, Pakistan had a relatively simple and flat import regime, with
four tariff rates from 0 to 25 percent and few exceptions. This system has been subjected to
numerous modifications which have made it complex and riddled with special conditions. According
to a study by the Customs Budget Wing in 2012, 84 percent of traded tariff headings were subject to
SROs modifying rates or granting exemptions. In staff’s view, simplifying tariff rates, eliminating
exemptions and SROs would deliver a much needed improvement in the competitive environment.
Staff also suggested a return to the 2003 framework of 4 tariff “slabs” with 0 to 25 percent rates.
Elimination of the negative list on trade with India and extending India most favored nation status,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAKISTAN

and shifting to “sensitive list” under SAFTA regime would increase regional trade. A strategy to take
full advantage of trade preferences available from the EU—where currently autonomous trade
preferences in 75 items is present—would also be advantageous.
46.
Reforming public sector enterprises will limit poor performance and help lift economic
growth by improving resource allocation. The authorities and staff agreed that comprehensive
action was needed on some 65 PSEs. Initially, a stock taking of all major loss-making PSEs would be
advisable to provide a diagnosis of the main problems. This could be followed by implementation
of medium-term action plans to privatize firms, restructure those with prospects of profitability but
which the government wishes to retain in the public sector, and close nonviable firms. Staff
suggested that for those companies with shares already in private hands, privatization should go
ahead with block sales, secondary public offerings for institutional and general public or
international listings. On restructuring improved governance and corporatization should be essential
components of reform.
Authorities’ Views
47.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff on the priorities for structural reform. They
are committed to the elimination of subsidies, but stressed that they want to move gradually to
match higher prices with increases in energy supply. To ease public resistance, they prefer initially
to concentrate price increases on nonhousehold consumers. The authorities are pursuing projects
to import gas, and recognize that bold actions on rationalization of gas prices are needed once they
are able to tackle legal impediments. To improve electricity collections, the authorities are planning
to introduce amendments to the penal and criminal codes before the end of the year. On PSE
reform, the authorities proposed an even more ambitious agenda than that recommended by staff,
while noting that sequencing should be calibrated to match market conditions and privatization
IPOs and SPOs offered only after gauging investors’ appetite and global market conditions. The
authorities noted that the EU is currently considering their request for receiving GSP plus benefits
(zero percent duty) among other trade facilitation actions. Finally, they agreed to identify the legal
and bureaucratic impediments to doing business and will build the capacity of the Board of
Investment to undertake the necessary reforms.

PROGRAM DISCUSSIONS
48.
Program discussions focused on a package of adjustment measures to reduce shortterm persistent vulnerabilities and promote robust inclusive growth by addressing Pakistan’s
underlying structural problems. The authorities and staff agreed on strong fiscal consolidation
measures to address the unsustainable government deficit problem and contribute to easing
external financing needs, as they would ease demand-side pressures, facilitate increased donor
inflows, and eventually allow for private external deficit financing. Such policies will address the large
and persistent problems in the external sector by paving the grounds for foreign exchange inflows
through increased FDI and portfolio investment. Staff and the SBP agreed that fiscal measures need
to be combined with an independent monetary policy aimed at rebuilding reserves and controlling

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 29

PAKISTAN

inflation in the medium-term. The policy mix also includes significant structural reforms to sustain
the improved fiscal stance, boost investment and growth prospects and deliver better economic
prospects for the poor through targeted support spending. The sizable fiscal consolidation should
allow the government to transition to reliance on foreign and domestic private markets and normal
project disbursements from donors to cover its future financing needs once the program ends.
Structural reforms to improve growth, ease energy bottlenecks, and strengthen the investment
climate should boost both foreign direct investment and portfolio inflows, making the balance
of payments more sustainable.
49.
The program has been designed with the lessons from Pakistan’s previous
arrangements with the Fund in mind. Staff noted that the Ex Post Evaluation (EPE) report on the
2008 program recommended the following key points for future engagement: (i) Strong ownership
and broad-based buy-in and political support to implement ambitious structural reforms; (ii) Striking
a balance between including critical reforms and avoiding overreach; and (iii) Close collaboration
with other development partners. Consistent with this, program discussions centered on upfront
conditionality focused on a limited number of permanent measures clearly aimed at Pakistan’s longstanding challenges, and steps to secure broad political support for the program. Other donors were
closely involved in program discussions, particularly in their areas of expertise and will be full
participants in the overall reform program supported by the EFF. Structural conditionality will be
focused on the most critical areas where the authorities themselves have strong ownership.
Structural benchmarks are phased over time in recognition of constraints on the authorities’
administrative implementation capacity, and significant technical assistance will be provided by the
Fund and other donors (¶76). While program design has been adapted to incorporate the lessons of
previous programs, full and timely implementation of program conditionality is ultimately the crucial
factor in determining program success.
FISCAL POLICY
The Fund supported program contemplates around 4½ percent of GDP in fiscal consolidation over
three years, of which 2 percent of GDP would be taken upfront.
50.
Under the authorities’ proposed program, the fiscal deficit would be reduced to
around 3½ percent of GDP by FY2016/17 (MEFP ¶7–9). World Bank studies suggest that
aggressively broadening the coverage of General Sales Tax (GST) and key taxes (income taxes and
import tariffs) could yield up to 4½ percent of GDP over time, and increases in tax rates (such as GST
or excises) could be considered, in addition to other potential measures (table below). On the
expenditure side, current spending—mostly electricity subsidies—could be reduced by 1½–
2 percent of GDP over the program period. Together, measures of this order of magnitude could
deliver the desired deficit reduction while permitting increased spending on growth enhancing
investment and social protection. Given the significant devolution of revenues to the provinces, the
government will seek explicit agreement with the provinces to deliver the budgeted surpluses
through saving additional revenue transfers.

30

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAKISTAN

51.
The initial fiscal adjustment effort includes permanent deficit reduction measures
of 2 percent of GDP, coming mainly from revenue increases and lower energy subsidies
(MEFP ¶8). Tax measures included in the 2013/14 budget—including a one point hike in the GST
rate—are expected to yield ¾ percent of GDP annually. Reduced energy subsidies will produce
another ¾ percent of GDP in savings. The remainder will come from lower current expenditures
(0.15 percent of GDP), savings of the PSDP budget, and (in the second half of the fiscal year) a new
levy on natural gas expected to yield about 0.4 percent of GDP on an annualized basis. As a
contingent strategy, the government will bring forward the measures identified for years two and
three of the program.
52.
The additional fiscal adjustment in years two and three of the program will be
concentrated on efforts to broaden the tax base and to further reduce untargeted subsidies
(MEFP ¶9, 10, and 13). On the revenue side, the authorities envisage measures yielding ¾ percent
of GDP in each of the subsequent years. The focus will be on eliminating exemptions and
concessions embedded in the Statutory Regulatory Orders (SROs) and in the law, as well as on
eliminating the power of the executive to grant preferential tax treatment through SROs. These
steps will facilitate gradually moving the GST to a full-fledged integrated VAT-style modern indirect
tax system with few exemptions and to an integrated income tax by 2016/17. Tax administration
reforms will also be critical to this revenue effort. On the income tax side, the authorities will focus
on 300,000 potential taxpayers, through the national data warehouse. In addition to the 100,000
notifications for late return filing under section 114 envisaged for FY2013/2014, the authorities will
pursue additional 100,000 in each of the following two years. If the tax payers fail to respond
satisfactory, these notifications will be followed by a provisional assessment of income under
section 122—which will become final if the taxpayer again fails to respond satisfactorily—and
measures to collect the tax liability (including attachment of bank accounts). The authorities will also
develop plans to strengthen the administration of customs, sales and excise taxes (structural
benchmark). On the expenditure side, further subsidy reductions of around 0.4 percent of GDP per
year are envisaged under the authorities’ comprehensive energy plan.

The provinces will contribute to the consolidation effort (MEFP ¶14). In 2013/14, the
provinces—through the Council of Common Interests—have agreed to deliver the required fiscal
surpluses through saving the additional revenue transfers. To encourage compliance, the SBP will
begin to pay interest on deposits held by the provinces. However, stronger institutional
arrangements will be needed in the future to ensure the sustainability of the envisaged fiscal
consolidation. In 2014/15 and beyond, negotiations will take place on a new NFC award which the
authorities plan to use to adjust the revenue sharing arrangements to provide a better balance
between revenue and spending responsibilities.

resources will also provide conditional cash
transfers (CCTs) to primary education, supporting 560,000 families with a benefit of Rs. 200 per child

program, reaching 6.6 million families by 2015/16 with benefits scaled up to cover inflation.

According to World Bank and UK-DFID, the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP) reaches out to the most
vulnerable members of the society through cash transfers. The current allocation provides cash assistance to
4.8 million families, which constitutes almost 16 percent of the population (almost 40 percent of the population
below the poverty line).

MONETARY POLICY
Rebuilding reserves will be the priority short-term policy objective, with maintaining low and stable
inflation taking on greater importance later on. Enhanced SBP independence and ending SBP direct
financing of the fiscal deficit will be crucial.
55.
Staff and the SBP agreed that monetary and exchange rate policies should be adjusted
to address declining reserves and a projected rebound in inflation (MEFP ¶17). In the short-term,
monetary and exchange rate policies should focus on rebuilding foreign exchange reserves. As a
first step, to signal a shift in policy and to begin attracting capital inflows, the SBP has begun net
purchases of foreign exchange in the interbank spot market. Reserves accumulation will be guided
by a tight NIR target under the program. The SBP will allow greater exchange rate flexibility, limiting
intervention in the exchange market to that needed to build reserves, cushion major shocks, and
strengthen competitiveness over time. The authorities also agreed to gradually reduce the SBP’s
short swap/forward foreign exchange position to a more sustainable level. Inflation will be contained
to around 8 percent in 2013/14, aided by the effects of fiscal consolidation in limiting domestic
demand growth and easing fiscal pressures on the money supply.
56.
Beginning in 2014/15, monetary policy should aim to reduce inflation while
continuing to rebuild foreign exchange reserves (MEFP ¶16, and 18). To guide inflation reduction
efforts, a target on NDA of the SBP envisages a reduction in money supply growth over time to rates
consistent with the inflation objective of 6–7 percent. Monetary accommodation of fiscal deficits will
be scaled back considerably, while maintaining a positive real policy interest rate will help anchor
inflation expectations. The SBP has also halted further direct lending to the government, reflected
by a continuous ceiling on total SBP credit to the government (which will fall over time and will help
lowering the reserve money growth).
57.
Enhanced central bank independence will improve monetary policymaking (MEFP ¶19).
In the near term the authorities agreed to work toward approval of amendments to the SBP law to
give greater operational independence in the central bank’s pursuit of price stability as its primary
objective. Among other things, the amendments will establish an independent, decision-making
monetary policy committee to design and implement monetary policy and will prohibit any form
of new direct lending to the government from the SBP.
FINANCIAL POLICIES
58.
The SBP will prepare detailed plans to assure that all banks come into compliance with
minimum capital adequacy requirements (structural benchmark, MEFP ¶21). The plan will cover
both state-owned and private banks and will include contingency measures in case of slippages,
indicating clearer alternatives in case banks are unable to raise expected capital.
59.
Consultations are already underway with key stakeholders on the new bankruptcy law
(Corporate Rehabilitation Act) to revamp the recovery mechanisms (MEFP ¶22). The new law
will facilitate the legal framework for rehabilitating viable corporate and financial entities while
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 33

PAKISTAN

speeding up the process of liquidation of unviable entities. The authorities also plan to approach key
stakeholders to address the concerns regarding creditor and debtor protection.
60.
A deposit insurance scheme will be introduced once preconditions are in place
(MEFP ¶23). The scheme is expected to boost confidence in the banking system, which will
encourage additional growth in deposits. The authorities agreed to pass legislation on deposit
insurance scheme and fully implement this legislation over the course of the next three years where
necessary preconditions are met such as capital adequacy, effective supervisory and regulatory
framework, and a special resolution framework.
61.
Revising the regulatory and supervisory frameworks is critical for financial stability
(MEFP ¶24). The Securities and Exchange Ordinance, 1969 “SEO 69” lacks a proper structure and
suffers from numerous inconsistencies and gaps due to several amendments made over years. The
authorities will undertake several initiatives during the program period:


The draft Securities Bill will enhance the supervisory and enforcement power of the regulator.



Regulatory power of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) will be
enhanced with a new draft bill.



A comprehensive framework for the futures markets will be prepared.



Better coordination between SBP and SECP will be implemented to effectively regulate and
supervise banking groups.

STRUCTURAL POLICIES
Critical structural measures in the energy sector together with targeted transfers to protect the most
vulnerable will be a priority under the new Fund-supported program. Other reforms will also be
important components of the arrangement, such as trade liberalization, reforms of public sector
enterprises (PSEs), and improvements to the business climate, which will kick start growth.
62.
The authorities have launched a comprehensive energy policy (MEFP ¶26). The policy to
be implemented during the program will cover all elements of the energy supply chain, demand
management, and pricing policies for better functioning of the sector:


34

Electricity sector (MEFP ¶27, and 32). Tariff rationalization has already begun, and the
elimination of payables arrears in the power sector is a positive development. However, more
is needed to limit the recurrence of arrears in the future. During the program period Tariff
Differential Subsidies (TDS) will be phased out and tariffs will be brought to cost recovery levels.
Tariff adjustments will improve resource allocation and efficiency, and will encourage
conservation. Cost-cutting and efficiency measures will also be undertaken in both generation
and distribution companies. Legal changes will be undertaken to tackle electricity theft by

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAKISTAN

enhancing investigation, prosecution, and penalties. High priority will be given to improve
energy sector governance and transparency. Additional electricity production projects will be
accelerated.


Gas sector (MEFP ¶34). The authorities will prepare a gas price rationalization plan to
accompany the electricity price rationalization already underway. In the short-run, they will
administratively allocate gas to uses with higher economic value (e.g., energy production) while
preparing to let price mechanisms take over the allocation function in the future. They will
develop facilities to import gas, and will increase incentives for higher domestic production.

63.
The authorities agreed to move forward with business climate reforms to help increase
foreign and domestic private investment (MEFP ¶36). The Corporate Rehabilitation Act,
Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Mechanisms, setting up a one-stop shop (including the human
resource and funding needs), and identifying the required changes in the regulations and
administration will be required to tackle the impediments to doing business. In this respect, the
Board of Investment, in coordination with SECP, Federal Bureau of Revenue, provincial governments,
and other concerned agencies, will develop a plan to further simplify procedures and reduce costs
for setting-up businesses in Pakistan.
64.
Trade policy and PSE reforms will be important components of the program
(MEFP ¶37). These reforms will increase consumer welfare, stimulate growth via increased
competition, and improve public resource allocation. The authorities will prepare a three-year
program to return to a simplified import tariff regime, with 4 tariff rates ranging from 0-25 percent
with few exceptions. The elimination of SROs will also remove the source of many distortions to the
trade regime. The authorities will embark on a stock-taking of all major loss-making PSEs. This shall
be followed by implementation of medium-term action plans to privatize firms, restructure those
with prospects of profitability but which the government wishes to retain in the public sector, and
close nonviable firms.
65.
Enhanced and better-targeted assistance for the poorest households is necessary
(MEFP ¶13). The poor and most vulnerable segments of the society will be protected from the direct
and indirect impacts of fiscal consolidation and tariff adjustments. The Benazir Income Support
Program (BISP) is the largest targeted social assistance mechanism directly reaching 4.8 million
families (16 percent of the population) within the two poorest quintiles. As savings from tariff
adjustments and fiscal space are realized, the authorities agreed to expand its coverage and increase
the benefit amount to protect the real purchasing power of the beneficiaries.
PROGRAM MODALITIES
66.
Access, Duration, Phasing: An extended arrangement under the EFF would be appropriate
to meet Pakistan’s medium-term financing needs, build reserve buffers from their current level of
US$5.4 billion, and put the economy on a sustainable, higher-growth path. Access of 425 percent
of quota (SDR 4,393 million, equivalent to US$6.68 billion) is based on Pakistan’s external financing
needs (Box 8). The required fiscal adjustment, outstanding credit, and record of using Fund
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 35

PAKISTAN

resources are also used to determine access. The proposed arrangement will be within normal
access limits for an extended arrangement under the EFF, even after the implementation of the
14th quota review and possible changes to normal access limits.24 Even phasing over the program
would imply net repayments to the Fund in the first four quarters of the program. The first
disbursement would be at program approval and the remaining purchases would be contingent on
completing quarterly reviews.
67.
Support from other donors. Staff has worked in close coordination with the World Bank,
the Asian Development Bank, and key bilateral donors in developing policy recommendations
(particularly for structural reforms). There are firm commitments from donors to fill the entire
financing gap for the first 12 months of the arrangement, and good prospects that there will be
adequate multilateral and bilateral financing for the remainder of the program. Financial support
from these partners is expected to reach US$6 billion during the program period, with strong
technical assistance also provided, particularly in tax administration and the energy sector.
68.
Prior actions: The following prior actions were undertaken by the authorities to kick start
reforms and signal commitment to the necessary adjustment policies:


Implementation of a series of fiscal adjustment measures (including those in 2013/14 budget)
totaling 2 percent of GDP on an annualized basis.



Elimination of tariff differential subsidies in industrial, commercial and bulk users and reduction
of subsidies to high levels of consumption totaled 0.75 percent of GDP in annualized savings.



Sustained purchases of foreign exchange by the SBP.



An agreement at the Council of Common Interest on respecting the 2013/14 fiscal balances for
the provinces under the program.



Issuance of 10,000 collection notices to individuals not registered to pay taxes based where
indirect methods suggest large potential income tax liabilities.

69.
Quantitative and Continuous Performance Criteria: The program will be monitored with
quarterly performance targets on the general government fiscal balance (consolidated federal and
provincial), net foreign assets, net domestic assets, SBP lending to the government, the SBP’s
forward/swap position, the accumulation of domestic arrears, and the standard continuous
performance criterion on the nonaccumulation of external arrears.

24

Pakistan’s quota will increase from 1033.7 million SDR to 2031 million SDR after the quota review. Table 8 indicates
the level of credit outstanding under existing arrangements and the proposed EFF.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAKISTAN

70.
Structural Benchmarks: Beyond the prior actions in the structural area, benchmarks on
structural reforms are also set. Benchmarks in the fiscal sector are designed to secure the fiscal
consolidation and distribute the burden to wider groups of tax payers. Monetary policy benchmark
is aimed at bringing more independence to the SBP through changing the composition of the
Board, extending the tenure of the Governor and eliminating SBP lending to the Government.
Financial sector benchmarks focus on initially to mitigate short-term risks posed by undercapitalized
banks and ensure that necessary institutions are set up to protect medium-term financial stability.
Finally, benchmarks in the structural policies are intended to address the long-standing problems in
the energy sector and loss making public sector enterprises which constitute critical constraints on
growth and have generated or have the potential to generate large fiscal cost.
71.
Risks: Program implementations risks are high given Pakistan’s track record, particularly
political constraints and the limited technical capacity to implement reforms simultaneously across
a wide range of activities. These risks are mitigated by critical upfront actions as well as the strong
electoral mandate and commitment to reform of the new government. Strong technical assistance
support from the international community should help ease risks that implementation will lag due
to weak technical capacity. The recent record of interventions by the Supreme Court in economic
and administrative issues may be another source of uncertainty. The governing party may lack
political support in provinces outside of Punjab, complicating provincial-federal financial
agreements. Endorsement of the 2013/14 budget parameters and medium-term program objectives
from other provinces is expected to mitigate this danger. Delays or shortfalls in financing from
public or private sources are another program risk. Public funding risks should be eased by the
strong commitments of support from the World Bank, ADB, and key bilateral partners. Private
financing risks may be reduced by the authorities’ strong privatization program (flows from which
have been very conservatively estimated).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 37

Box 8. BOP Projections and External Financing Requirement
The BOP position is sustainable with significant adjustment and new financing. While the current account
deficit is not particularly large, foreign exchange reserves are under downward pressure from three factors:
(i) weak gross financing inflows; (ii) large expected financing outflows (including repayments to the Fund); and
(iii) the possible unwinding of the SBP’s short forward position (currently at US$2.2 billion). Fiscal measures of
2 percent of GDP and Fund financing will stop reserve loss and maintain the stability of the external position.
Reserves are projected to reach adequate levels within the program period to handle unforeseen
shocks (see Table below). Under the program scenario, reserves are projected to reach to around
US$15.5 billion by the fourth quarter of 2015/16 (three months of imports). This projection incorporates
the following assumptions: the latest WEO assumptions on commodity prices and external demand; additional
inflows from the Coalition Support Fund (US$3 billion), PTCL privatization (US$0.85 billion), and sales of 3G
licenses (US$1.2 billion); and Fund financing of US$6.6 billion to close the remaining financing gap. The
program is expected to stabilize the economy and catalyze external official (US$6 billion) and private financial
inflows. FDI is expected to return gradually to its former levels as a share of GDP, driven by privatization
revenues and improved business climate.
Medium-term projections are subject to significant downside risks. First, Pakistan’s BOP is very sensitive
to volatile commodity prices. A US$10 per barrel increase in the oil price raises the import bill by about
US$600 million. Second, some capital inflows that are expected in 2013/14 may not materialize. Third, the
program scenario assumes that Pakistan will regain modest access to international capital markets in 2015/16.
Finally, SBP’s short forward foreign exchange positions may unwind faster than envisaged in the program.

at end-June 2013 the Fund’s exposure to Pakistan stood at roughly US$4.5 billion (74 percent
of gross official reserves). Repayments are concentrated in the remainder of 2013 and during 2014
(roughly US$4 billion). In addition, baseline risks to the balance of payments are tilted to the
downside, and Pakistan’s ability to regain access to international capital markets is limited without
reforms. Materialization of these risks would further erode Pakistan’s capacity to repay the Fund.
While sensitive to real depreciation shocks, Pakistan’s total external debt remains broadly
sustainable (Table 10).
73.
Safeguards: A safeguards assessment update will be completed no later than the first
review under the new extended arrangement under the EFF.

Net repayments to the Fund will also be significantly reduced in 2013/2014 and future repayments will be spread

OTHER ISSUES
74.
Outreach. As part of the Article IV consultation discussions, the mission held meetings with
business and banking leaders in Karachi and Lahore and with journalists and opinion leaders in
Islamabad. Meetings were held with the diplomatic community and with key multilateral and
bilateral donors. At the conclusion of the mission, a joint press conference was held with Minister
of Finance Dar. While direct meetings with civil society are somewhat circumscribed by security
concerns, Pakistan is a pilot case for outreach via social media, with an active twitter account
(@imf_pakistan). Further outreach efforts are planned upon Board approval of the program.
Although the authorities have taken steps toward improving Pakistan's AML/CFT regime
75.
in the context of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) initiative against noncooperative
jurisdictions, some strategic deficiencies remain. The amendments to the Anti-Terrorism Act
enacted earlier this year have addressed part of the concerns expressed by the FATF. However, the
authorities still need to further amend the Act, in particular with regard to the identification and
freezing of terrorist assets. Pakistan’s current listing by the FATF creates costs on financial
intermediation because of heightened due diligence requirements by international financial
institutions. In addition, the effective implementation of the AML/CFT framework could support the
authorities’ efforts in fighting against tax evasion and corruption.

76.
Exchange rate regime. Pakistan has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3,
and 4. Pakistan’s exchange rate regime has been classified as floating since January 2008.
77.
Data quality. Macroeconomic statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance and program
monitoring. The authorities are progressing towards closing gaps in the real sector and
strengthening the quality of fiscal and social (especially poverty) data to better inform policy
decisions and monitor outcomes. Recently, the authorities have rebased the national account
statistics and will publish quarterly national accounts starting from November 2013 in line with the
Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). Before the end of the year, they are also planning to
extend the new series back to FY1999/2000.

Technical Assistance. A comprehensive solution to Pakistan’s fiscal problems will require
technical assistance from the Fund and other donors. The highest priority is a tax administration
diagnostic mission, followed by support on public financial management and on federal-provincial
fiscal arrangements. Staff also pointed out that SBP can benefit from technical assistance on foreign
exchange auctions, citing Turkey and Mexico as good examples. TA is also required to help improve
banking supervision. The authorities have also requested assistance for applying BPM6.

STAFF APPRAISAL
79.
Pakistan is facing serious economic challenges. Overall vulnerabilities and crisis risks are
high, with subpar growth and unsustainable fiscal and balance of payments positions. Lack of
reliable electricity supply and a difficult security situation in large parts of the country have
contributed to the deterioration.
80.
The risks to the outlook are on the downside and strong policy action is required.
Domestic risks emanate from the fiscal imbalance with the attendant high government debt rollover
requirements, a worsening energy crisis, and security problems, all of which could seriously damage
growth prospects. On the external side, there are significant downside risks to the balance of
payments. Besides international oil and food price volatility, the economy also remains highly
vulnerable to adverse global spillovers through trade and remittances channels.
81.
Pakistan’s newly elected government has a strong mandate to stabilize the economy
and address critical constraints on growth. The authorities have made in important start in their
first months in office. They have approved a FY2013/14 budget with measures to boost revenues,
reduce energy subsidies, and cut the fiscal deficit. To prepare for a new extended arrangement
under the EFF with the Fund, they have undertaken additional fiscal measures. They have
implemented significant energy price adjustments and launched a comprehensive energy reform
policy. They are also preparing important reforms in the gas sector, trade policy, PSEs, and the
business climate. They have launched a new enforcement program to improve tax collections and
have appointed new senior staff in the FBR. Together, these steps to mitigate near-term
vulnerabilities and foster inclusive growth over the medium term will generate a turnaround in the
economy once fully implemented. The extended arrangement under the EFF support from the Fund
is aimed at providing sufficient resources and traction to help the authorities to pursue this
homegrown program.
82.
To ensure fiscal sustainability further consolidation is needed. While the reduction in the
headline deficit from 8.8 percent of GDP in 2012/13 to 5.8 percent of GDP in 2013/14 is an
important achievement, further efforts will be needed in subsequent years to secure medium-term
fiscal sustainability. In particular, the tax-to-GDP ratio must be raised significantly to allow for
needed social and investment expenditures while lowering the deficit. This must involve broadening
the tax base via an ambitious reduction in exemptions and concessions, and efforts to extend
taxation to areas currently not fully covered by the tax net. It will also require an overhaul of tax
administration, including by boosting training, transparency, and enforcement capabilities. Full fiscal
sustainability can only be achieved if the provinces are full partners in the adjustment effort.
83.
Monetary and exchange rate policies must be geared to rebuilding external buffers
and to maintaining price stability over time. In the short-run, the SBP must prioritize stabilizing
its foreign exchange reserves, making use of program disbursements, financial support from other
donors, foreign exchange intervention, and exchange rate flexibility. The net international reserve
targets under the program reflect this objective. Once reserves cushions begin to be restored, the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 41

PAKISTAN

SBP should increasingly focus its attention on maintaining low and stable inflation (in the
5-7 percent range). To achieve this objective, direct lending to the government must cease and
liquidity injections should be exclusively through open market operations calibrated to achieve the
program’s NDA targets. In the medium-term, full operational independence will help the SBP
improve monetary policymaking and achieve the needed inflation reduction.
84.
Continued financial sector stability and steps to deepen financial markets will
contribute to boosting economic growth. While systemic risks to the banking sector are not
particularly high at this time, the authorities need to promptly address those banks below the
minimum CAR or below the MCR to avoid future dangers. Development of additional tools to
strengthen the financial health of the system, such as deposit insurance, consolidated supervision,
and enhanced legislation on nonbank financial activities are important. Steps to deepen financial
markets will facilitate increased private investment and growth over time.
85.
Structural reforms are key to sustained and inclusive growth. The authorities’ energy
policy is geared to address the long-standing problems in the sector which constitute the most
critical constraint on growth and have generated large fiscal costs. Staff anticipates a boost in GDP
on the order of 2 percentage points over the coming years as the energy crisis is resolved. Reforms
in other areas are also critical for higher growth. As the authorities liberalize the trade regime,
restructure or privatize public sector enterprises, and take measures to improve the business climate,
rent-seeking behaviors will decline and productive investment—both foreign and domestic—will
rise sharply, boosting medium-term growth prospects.
86.
Protecting the most vulnerable from the direct and indirect impacts of fiscal
consolidation and price adjustments should be a priority. Staff welcomes the authorities’ firm
commitment to boosting targeted income support programs, as signaled by the inclusion of an
indicative floor on such spending in the program targets. Coverage and benefits of these programs
are slated to gradually increase as savings from tariff adjustments and fiscal space are realized.
87.
While there are implementation risks under the proposed extended arrangement
under the EFF, the authorities’ commitment is strong. Pakistan’s track record is spotty on
sustained adherence to IMF programs, and this will be a relatively high risk arrangement. Possible
external shocks will continue to pose risks to Pakistan’s fragile balance of payments until well into
the second year of the program when reserves will finally rise above critical levels. The delicate
security situation could also pose risks. The authorities may also encounter constraints on their legal,
administrative, or technical abilities to implement such an ambitious reform agenda simultaneously
in several governance areas. However, the new government has demonstrated considerable political
will in undertaking as a prior action around 45 percent of the total 4½ percent of GDP fiscal
adjustment required in the three-year program. They have also taken increases in sensitive energy
prices upfront. These early steps bode well for success in implementation of future program
conditionality. Ownership of the program is strong, as emphasized by the authorities’ own reform
initiatives even before program discussions began, and the government has a majority in the
national assembly to take needed actions.

88.
The proposed level of access of 425 percent of quota is consistent with medium-term
external and debt sustainability provided the program is implemented as envisaged and any
unforeseen shocks are addressed swiftly. However, additional resources from donors will be an
important component of program financing. There are firm commitments from donors to fill the
remaining financing gap for the first 12 months of the arrangement, and good prospects that there
will be adequate multilateral and bilateral financing for the remaining program period beyond those
first 12 months. Donors are expected to provide around US$6 billion of additional resources over
the next three years.
89.
In view of Pakistan’s balance of payments needs and the comprehensive package of
adjustment measures proposed by the authorities, staff supports the authorities’ request for
an extended arrangement under the EFF in the amount equivalent to SDR 4.393 billion
(425 percent of quota). Staff recommends that the next Article IV Consultation with Pakistan take
place on the 24-month cycle.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

Appendix I. Letter of Intent
August 19, 2013
Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Ms. Lagarde:
Over the past several years, Pakistan has faced considerable challenges that have adversely affected
the economy’s performance: a difficult external environment, high international oil prices, two major
floods, and continued security problems. These problems have been exacerbated by poor
macroeconomic management during the previous government and by long-standing structural
problems which have not been addressed. Falling capital inflows have been insufficient to finance
even a modest current account deficit, leading to a large reduction in international reserves.
As a result of the recent elections providing the first democratic transition in Pakistan’s history, the
new government has a majority in parliament and a strong mandate to implement ambitious
economic reforms to stabilize the economy and put our country on the path to growth and
prosperity. For this, we have developed an economic program covering 2013/14–2015/16, as
described in the attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP). The program
focuses on strengthening macroeconomic and structural policies to shore up confidence, reduce
economic imbalances, and foster sustained inclusive growth and employment generation.
In support of our economic program, we request a 36-month extended arrangement under the
Extended Fund Facility (EFF) from the International Monetary Fund in the amount equivalent to
SDR 4,393 million (equivalent to 425 percent of Pakistan’s quota, about US$6.6 billion at current
exchange rates). The extended arrangement under the EFF will provide needed external financing
and signal our determination to implement sound policies, thereby bolstering market confidence
and catalyzing additional financial support from other development partners and private sources.

66

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAKISTAN

Progress in the implementation of our program will be assessed through quarterly reviews,
quantitative performance criteria, indicative targets, and agreed structural benchmarks, as described
in the attached Tables 1-2 and the Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU). We expect the
first purchase in the amount equivalent to SDR 360 million (34.8 percent of quota, about
US$540 million) to become available upon approval of the extended arrangement under the EFF by
the IMF Executive Board.
The Government of Pakistan and the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) will provide the Fund with such
information as the Fund may request in connection with Pakistan’s progress in implementing its
economic and financial policies. The government and SBP believe that the policies set out in the
attached MEFP are adequate to achieve the objectives of the program, but will take any further
measures that may become necessary for this purpose. Pakistan will consult with the Fund on the
adoption of these measures, and in advance of revisions to the policies contained in the MEFP, in
accordance with the Fund’s policies on such consultations.
Please let us also reassure you that the policies underlying this program have the firm support of
Prime Minister Sharif, the cabinet and provincial government leaders as indicated by the recent
decision to this effect by the Council of Common Interest.
Sincerely yours,

/s/

Attachment I. Memorandum on Economic and Financial
Policies for 2013/14–2015/16
1.
The Government of Pakistan has adopted a comprehensive program to address
vulnerabilities and boost inclusive growth through macroeconomic stabilization and structural
reforms. This memorandum sets out Pakistan’s economic and financial policies for August 2013–July
2016, to be supported by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under a 36-month extended
arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF).

Economic Context
2.
Pakistan’s economy faces significant challenges. Growth has slipped to an estimated
3.6 percent in 2012/13. Productivity growth has fallen sharply and private investment has fallen by
half in the past six years, undermining future growth prospects. Lack of reliable electricity supply and
a difficult security situation in large parts of the country have been important factors behind this
poor performance. Nevertheless, Pakistan remains a country with abundant potential, given its rich
natural and human resources and its important geographical location.
3.
Macroeconomic imbalances and vulnerabilities have built-up. The fiscal deficit has
widened from 5 percent of GDP in 2008/09 to about 8.8 percent of GDP in 2012/13, driven by weak
tax collections, energy sector subsidies, and increased provincial government spending. Deficit
financing has crowded out private sector borrowing and has contributed to inflation. Headline
inflation has recently declined sharply, but it is expected to rebound. While the current account
balance has improved significantly since 2008/09—due in part to rising remittances and transfer
payments—capital inflows have collapsed at the same time as debt service obligations are
increasing significantly, producing a steep fall in foreign exchange reserves. The State Bank of
Pakistan (SBP) has also intervened in support of the currency, causing a further drop in reserves.
Over the last 12 months, the SBP‘s reserves have fallen around 40 percent to US$6.0 billion in endJune 2013.
4.
Longstanding structural impediments to growth have prevented a full realization of
Pakistan’s potential. Structural problems, particularly in the energy sector, security concerns, and
a difficult investment climate have combined with adverse shocks to undermine economic
performance. GDP growth has only averaged 3 percent over the past few years, well below that is
needed to provide jobs for the rising labor force and reduce poverty. Technical and financial
problems in the energy sector have led to large-scale power outages which have depressed output
and have imposed hardship on the public at large. A difficult business climate has contributed to a
sharp fall in private investment. Weak performance in large public enterprises in key industries
constitutes a further drag on the public finances and on growth.

68

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAKISTAN

Medium-Term Macroeconomic Scenario
5.
The government’s economic program aims to improve the medium-term growth
outlook and move toward sustainable fiscal and external positions. The program envisages
consolidation to reach a sustainable fiscal deficit with a declining debt-to-GDP ratio, prudent
monetary and exchange rate polices, strengthened financial stability, and structural reforms to
reduce macroeconomic risks and boost inclusive growth over time. In the short run, fiscal
adjustment would temper economic growth. However, the adverse impacts will be mitigated by:
(i) sharply increasing public investment and improving private sector access to credit to boost
private investment; (ii) alleviating acute energy supply bottlenecks to increase productive capacity
and (iii) increasing targeted transfers to the most vulnerable population. Improved macroeconomic
stability—together with the serious structural reforms contemplated under the program—would
improve growth significantly over the medium term.
6.
Macroeconomic stability will be secured and economic performance will improve over
time. Growth will initially remain modest (about 2½-3 percent) in 2013/14 due to the necessary
fiscal consolidation, but will then strengthen to around 4½-5 percent in the outer years as structural
reforms are implemented and the investment climate improves. Inflation will initially increase, due in
part to some weakening of the rupee as reserves are rebuilt. However, monetary policy will likely be
tightened in later years to help bring inflation down to the 6-7 percent range by the end of the
program period. Fiscal consolidation will bring the fiscal deficit from the baseline of 8.8 percent of
GDP (excluding grants) in FY2012/13 to around 3½ percent in FY2016/17. In the early stage of the
program, the current account deficit will narrow reflecting fiscal consolidation and exchange rate
depreciation. Subsequently, with growth strengthening and private investment rising because of
structural reforms, the current account deficit is projected to widen to around 2 percent of GDP,
which will be fully financed by capital inflows. Over the course of the program, the SBP’s foreign
exchange reserves will improve to US$18 billion equivalent to over 3 months of imports of goods
and services.

Economic Program

A.

Fiscal Policy

7.
Fiscal consolidation is needed to put debt on a declining path and foster sustainable
growth. Fiscal consolidation of around 4-4½ percent of GDP over the three year program will lower
the fiscal balance to around 3½ percent of GDP and place the debt-to-GDP ratio on a firmly
declining path. Moreover, a more efficient and equitable tax system would foster competition, while
providing the needed resources to finance infrastructure and support the poor through targeted
programs. An upfront adjustment of near 2 percent of GDP aims at restoring policy credibility (prior
action). The negative impact on economic activity will be ameliorated by structural reforms to boost
growth and a somewhat more accommodative monetary policy stance early in the program than
would normally be required given the inflation outlook.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 69

PAKISTAN

8.
The initial consolidation effort relied mainly on the revenue side given the chronically
low tax revenue-to-GDP ratio. The government is taking a series of measures aimed at
strengthening tax revenues by over 1 percent of GDP on an annualized basis. The tax measures
contained in the 2013 Finance Bill seek to increase revenues by 0.75 percent of GDP, and included:
(i) an increase in the GST rate; (ii) an increase in the corporate minimum tax rate; (iii) higher personal
income tax rates for the top income brackets; (iv) higher excises on cigarettes; (v) increases in several
withholding rates; (vi) introduction of several withholding rates; and (vii) imposition of new levy on
movable assets. Moreover, by end-December 2013 we will implement a new gas levy that will
increase tax revenue by 0.4 percent of GDP on an annualized basis. This package is a first step
towards a more efficient and equitable tax system.
9.
On the expenditure side, the government has initiated a plan to phase out electricity
subsidies over the life of the program. The federal government has approved at the highest level,
with support of the provinces, an energy policy entailing periodic increases in the average tariff,
aiming at eliminating the tariff differential subsidy for all consumers except the very lowest over the
next three years. The first adjustments to commercial, industrial, bulk, and large consumers (¶27)
reduced subsidies by 0.75 percent of GDP on an annualized basis (prior action). However, for the
first year we will maintain tariffs for consumers between 0-200 kWh consumption. For the second
and third years, we will further reduce subsidies by roughly 0.4 percent of GDP per year to reach a
maximum of 0.3 percent of GDP thereafter. As part of our initial adjustment package, we have also
undertaken significant cuts in ministries’ nonwage current expenditures an across the board
reduction of 30 percent from the budget allocations—amounting about 0.15 percent of GDP—by
ministerial decision), have scaled back the budgeted increase in capital spending, and will delay
some of the remaining capital spending until new revenues from the gas levy materialize.
10.
Tax administration reforms will gradually deliver further improvements in revenue
collections. An initiative to incorporate three hundred thousand new taxpayers into the income tax
net was launched in July. The 2013 Finance Bill granted the FBR access to bank information
enhancing the scope and quality of information in its databases. The first step has been taken with
the issuance of ten thousand notices based on large potential fiscal liabilities by end-July (prior
action), and will be followed by a provisional assessment, collection procedures, and penal and
prosecution proceedings. The income tax initiative will be complemented with initiatives to enhance
revenue administration for sales, excises and customs, to be developed and launched by endDecember 2013 (structural benchmark). These efforts will be further assisted by increasing the
number of risk-based tax audits to 4.2 percent of declarations (from 2.2 percent). We will also
continue to seek technical assistance on tax administration from our international partners.
11.
To ameliorate risks to the program, several contingent measures have been identified
and will be implemented in case the expected fiscal adjustment falls short of objectives. These
measures include reduced expenditure allocations in the first 9 months of the year compared to the
budget to create a reserve against any shortfall and use of reserves built into the capital expenditure
budget if needed. These could yield savings amounting to 0.5 percent of GDP. In addition, we stand
ready to take any other measures needed to assure compliance with our fiscal target.

70

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAKISTAN

12.
Beyond the current fiscal year, further revenue and expenditure measures will be
implemented to achieve a sustainable deficit of around 3½ percent of GDP by 2016/17. This
will require further fiscal consolidation of about 1¼ percent of GDP per year in the coming 2 fiscal
years. Roughly half of the adjustment could come from the revenue side, mainly through further
widening of the tax base with some contribution from improved tax administration. Among the
initiatives to widen the tax base we will finalize a comprehensive plan to separate existing statutory
regulatory orders (SROs) either by eliminating those granting exemptions or concessions through
SROs by end-December 2013. We will introduce the remaining to FY14/15 finance bill by end-June
2014. The government has already stopped issuing any new tax concessions or exemptions
(including customs tariffs) through SROs except by an act of Parliament, and will also approve by
end-December 2015 legislation to permanently prohibit the practice. We will also quantify the
remaining tax expenditures and publish a detailed list in the budget in future years. These steps will
facilitate gradually moving the GST to a full-fledged integrated modern indirect tax system with few
exemptions and to an integrated income tax by 2016/17. On the expenditure side, further reductions
in untargeted subsidies will be undertaken in 2014/15 and 2015/16, along with steps to streamline
wage and salary costs via civil service reforms.
13.
The program envisages enhanced and better-targeted assistance for the poorest
households. The poor and most vulnerable segments of the society must be protected from the
direct and indirect impacts of fiscal consolidation and tariff adjustments. The Benazir Income
Support Program (BISP) is the largest targeted social assistance mechanism directly reaching
4.8 million families (16 percent of the population) within the two poorest quintiles. For FY2013/14,
we have approved an increase in the budget allocated to BISP to PRs. 75 billion. This translates into
an increase in the level of benefits from PRs.1000 to PRs. 1200 per family per month reaching
5.7 million families and will provide conditional cash transfers (CCTs) to primary education,
supporting 560,000 families in 20 districts with a benefit of Rs. 200 per child per month attending
school. As savings from tariff adjustments and fiscal space are realized, we will further expand the
coverage of the program and increase the benefit amount to protect the real purchasing power of
the beneficiaries. In FY2014/15, we envisage expanding coverage of basic cash payments to
6.3 million families, and by FY 2015/16 to 6.6 million families (24 percent of the population) and
expansion of CCTs in at least 80 districts. In the meantime, we will phase-out the non-targeted
subsidies and strengthen the technology based platform linked with National ID database for
effective delivery of cash benefits. We are committed to exploring evidence based income
generation schemes that enables graduation of the most vulnerable including microfinance and
youth training, skills developments and asset transfer schemes.
14.
Provincial governments will play an important role in the fiscal reform process. Under
successive constitutional amendments (most recently the 18th), Pakistan has moved decisively to a
more decentralized federal system of government. The most recent National Finance Commission
(NFC) award grants 57.5 percent of most revenues to the provinces, along with a substantial
devolution of spending responsibilities and taxation authority in agriculture, property and services
which left the federal government with a severe imbalance between its remaining expenditure
responsibilities and its revenue. Since under the NFC award, the bulk of the additional revenue

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 71

PAKISTAN

generated by the program will be distributed to the provinces, an agreement has been reached at
the level of the Council of Common Interest to assure that it is used for deficit reduction or saved. In
addition, the government has tightened the balanced-budget requirement on provinces, and
provided incentives for them to maintain surpluses (prior action). Before the end of FY 2013/14,
negotiations will begin on a new NFC award and the new agreement will adjust the terms of fiscal
decentralization to be consistent with the imperatives of macroeconomic stability.
15.
Public debt management will be strengthened over the program period. The large fiscal
deficit and a weak institutional setting have hindered public debt management. Treasury bills
amount to over half of domestic debt and National Savings Schemes account for almost a quarter,
while outstanding bonds amount to only 20 percent of domestic debt. Out of the total domestic
debt (including SBP Market Related Treasury Bills), around 60 percent of debt has a maturity of less
than a year. Pakistan Investment Bonds, the prime longer-term debt instrument, have an average
duration of around 3½ years. Moreover, debt management operations are fragmented across
several agencies and the Debt Policy Coordination Office has only an advisory role. The fiscal
consolidation envisaged will reduce government domestic financing and will facilitate developing a
strategy to increase duration, lowering interest rates and rollover risks, and broadening the investor
base. In this context, during the program we plan to revamp the Debt Policy Coordination Office
into a debt management unit with enhanced authority to independently administer the
government’s financial obligations and cash flows. The unit will ensure the government’s financing
at the lowest possible cost given risk exposure parameters, and will seek to improve the
benchmarking of issues to develop a deeper financial market. We will seek technical assistance (TA)
from the IMF and the World Bank to develop a Medium Term Debt Strategy (MTDS).

B.

Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies

16.
The SBP has pursued an accommodative monetary policy to stimulate the economy,
in view of sustained weak private investment and declining headline inflation. Over the past
two years, the SBP has reduced the policy rate by a cumulative 500 basis points to 9 percent. In
addition, in FY2012/13, the SBP continued direct financing for the large fiscal deficit (about
20 percent of the reserve money) and open market operations and foreign currency swaps have
also pumped additional liquidity into the market. As a result, despite falling net foreign assets (NFA),
monetary aggregates have expanded relatively quickly; however, private credit has shrunk in real
terms.
17.
To address declining reserves and a projected rebound in inflation, the SBP will adjust
monetary and exchange rate policies. Monetary and exchange rate policies will focus on
rebuilding foreign exchange reserves and maintaining price stability. As a first step, to signal a shift
in policy, the SBP began net purchases of foreign exchange in the interbank market, which since
July 1 have totaled US$125 million (prior action). The SBP will refrain from further net direct lending
to the government, and limit open market liquidity injections to the economy to those consistent
with the program. Inflation reduction will not be a primary focus of the first year of the program so
as to mitigate the impact of the envisaged fiscal contraction.

72

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAKISTAN

18.
Beginning in 2014/15, monetary policy will aim to reduce inflation while continuing to
rebuild foreign exchange reserves. To ease some of fiscal adjustment effects, the program initially
envisages a moderate monetary policy, with policy tightening in years two and three, as exchange
rate pressure eases, to bring inflation down to the 6-7 percent range. To reduce inflation, monetary
accommodation of fiscal deficits will be scaled back considerably and policy rates will be set
prudently to ensure positive real interest rates. To protect the external position, the SBP will allow
greater exchange rate flexibility, limiting intervention in the exchange market to that needed to
build reserves, cushion major shocks, and strengthen competitiveness over time. Reserve losses
exceeding $500 million in any 30-day period during the program will trigger consultation with IMF
staff. The program envisages no further direct financing of the budget by the SBP including
purchases of government papers on the primary market (continuous PC) and limits on Net Domestic
Assets of the SBP. The SBP’s short swap/forward foreign exchange position will be gradually scaled
back to US$1.25 billion by the end of the program.
19.
Enhanced central bank independence will improve monetary policymaking.
Amendments to the SBP law will be enacted to strengthen the autonomy of the SBP, including full
operational independence in its pursuit of price stability as its primary objective, complemented with
enhanced governance structure including strong internal controls, by end-March 2014 (structural
benchmark). Among other things, the amendments will establish an independent, decision-making
monetary policy committee to design and implement monetary policy. The amendments will also
prohibit any form of new direct lending from the SBP.

C.

Financial Sector

20.
The banking system is generally well-capitalized, profitable, and liquid. While NPLs
remain high, they have come down since September 2011, as successive policy rate cuts have
reduced the interest burden on borrowers. Despite this improvement, growth in banks’ lending to
private sector continues to be weak while banks’ holdings of government securities continue to
expand. On the funding side, bank deposits continue to grow strongly, supported in part by recent
initiatives including branchless (i.e., mobile phone and internet) banking and a floor on deposit
rates. As of end-March 2013, there are four small banks (one state-owned and three private)
comprising 6.7 percent of banking system assets that fall below the minimum capital adequacy
requirement (CAR) of 10 percent of risk-weighted assets. To comply with this requirement, the
immediate capital needs of these institutions are Rs. 12.6 billion (less than 0.1 percent of GDP), but
could rise if conditions were to deteriorate significantly.
21.
The SBP will prepare a more detailed plan by end December 2013 to achieve
compliance of all banks that fall below minimum capital adequacy (structural benchmark).
The plan will include contingency measures in case of slippages and will indicate clearer alternatives
in case banks are unable to raise expected capital.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 73

PAKISTAN



State-Owned Banks: the SBP will require completion of the recapitalization of the state-owned
bank that is slightly below the CAR by end-December 2014 after having received substantial
capital injections over the past two years. The bank has returned to profitability and is gaining
deposits, but more capital is needed for full compliance.



Private Banks: Of the three private banks that fall below the CAR, the SBP has indicated capital
subscription from a private foreign investor for one to fill part of the shortfall, capital raising
plans via issuance of non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock for another, and is exploring
merger or acquisition by a foreign investor for the third bank. All three banks are asked to
provide an approved capital plan with specific timelines, where banks are expected to complete
required capital formation by end-December 2014.

22.
In revamping the recovery mechanisms, consultations on the new bankruptcy law
(Corporate Rehabilitation Act) are ongoing with key stakeholders. The new law will facilitate the
legal framework for rehabilitating viable corporate and financial entities speeding up the process
of liquidation of unviable entities. The MoF, along with the SBP and SECP, will approach the key
stakeholders to address the concerns regarding creditor and debtor protection. The draft law is
expected to be finalized by end-September 2014 and enacted by end-December, 2015.
23.
To strengthen the long-term stability of the banking system, Ministry of Finance in
consultation with the SBP plans to introduce a deposit insurance scheme. The proposed initial
coverage limit is Rs. 100,000 per depositor per bank, covering 72 percent of depositors and
40 percent of total insurable deposits. The deposit insurance scheme will be managed by a Deposit
Protection Fund, established as a subsidiary of SBP, with its own governance structure and funded
by flat premium payments from banks. The draft act for the Fund is being finalized and is expected
to be enacted by end-September 2014 (structural benchmark) and the scheme would begin
operations by end-December 2015.
24.
Revising the regulatory and supervisory frameworks is critical for financial stability.
The Securities and Exchange Ordinance, 1969 “SEO 69” lacks a proper structure and suffers from
numerous inconsistencies and gaps due to several amendments made over years. Several initiative
will address these difficulties:


The draft Securities Bill will enhance the supervisory and enforcement power of the regulator. It
will be submitted to Parliament by end-March 2014, and will be enacted by end-December 2014
(structural benchmark).



In terms of enhancing the regulatory power of the SECP, the Securities and Exchange
Commission of Pakistan Act “SECP Act,”1997, did not enable the Commission to act as an
integrated regulator and to act promptly, despite several amendments. In order to remove this
redundancy, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (Regulation and Enforcement)
Bill has been drafted which will be sent to parliament by March 2014.

74

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAKISTAN



Future markets are currently being regulated by certain amendments to SEO 69. In order to have
a comprehensive framework for the futures markets, a Futures Trading Bill has been drafted and
will be placed before the Parliament for expected approval by end-December 2014.



Finally, as banks broaden their business into non-banking financial activities, it presents a
challenge to the SBP and SECP to effectively regulate and supervise these entities. Therefore, the
SBP and SECP have agreed on a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for sharing information
and regulatory assistance, and will seek technical assistance from the IMF and World Bank to
develop a legal framework for consolidated supervision, to be prepared by end-December 2015.

D.

Structural Reforms

25.
Pakistan’s growth potential has deteriorated significantly over the past decade.
Average growth has fallen from around 5 percent from 1995-2005 to around 3 percent since 2008.
This is due in part to the difficult regional security situation which has discouraged investment.
However, the secular growth decline is also driven by periodic bouts of macroeconomic instability
and long-standing structural impediments to growth. We are committed to boosting long-term
growth by comprehensively tackling the problems of the energy sector, which we estimate has
lowered output by up to 2 percentage points per year. We will also undertake growth-promoting
initiatives to improve the investment climate, liberalize and simplify the international trade regime,
and reform and/or privatize public sector enterprises in key economic areas.

Energy Sector Reforms
26.
We will implement a comprehensive energy policy covering all elements of the energy
supply chain, demand management, and pricing policies for better functioning of the sector.
The energy sector is saddled with considerable problems, including price distortions, insufficient
collections, costly and poorly targeted subsidies, governance and regulatory deficiencies, low
efficiency in energy supply and distribution, inadequate attention to planning as a tool for optimal
decision making (particularly with regard to location, fuel choices, etc.), and insufficient investment
in new energy production. We finalized an energy policy identifying priority steps for the short-term
stabilization and the medium- and long-term viability of the sector to anchor the reform agenda at
end-July 2013. The policy was approved by the federal government at the highest level and
supported by the provincial governments to signal their buy-in to reform in the sector. We have
established an energy committee chaired by the Prime Minister with participation of relevant federal
ministries, provincial representatives, and key stake holders, which will meet regularly and take all
key decisions on a timely basis to implement the energy policy.
27.
Price Adjustments. Energy sector reform should initially concentrate on “quick wins” and
short-term measures that contribute to alleviation of energy bottlenecks and fiscal adjustment. In
this respect, we have developed a three-year plan for phasing out the Tariff Differential Subsidies
(TDS) and bringing tariffs to cost recovery level, along with cost-cutting and efficiency measures to
reach full cost recovery in the electricity sector. Tariff adjustments will improve resource allocation
and efficiency, and will encourage conservation. The plan will be approved by the Government

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 75

PAKISTAN

of Pakistan and will begin with: (i) the notification of NEPRA determined tariffs for FY2012/13;
(ii) phasing-out immediately the subsidy on industrial consumers and moving to minimum
determined tariff on, commercial, bulk and AJ&K consumers’ electricity consumption through
increasing the weighted average notified tariffs by 50 percent; and (iii) announce the elimination
and reduction of the subsidy on second group of consumers (as defined in the TMU) through
increasing the weighted average notified tariffs by 30 percent that will be in effect from October 1st,
2013. The plan, together with implementation of the first step should be undertaken by August 1,
2013 to kick start the reform (prior action). In addition, the costs of servicing the syndicated term
credit finance facility which was issued to cover some past losses will be incorporated into the
notified base tariff by end-December 2013. In the years two and three of the program, we will
generate around 0.4 percent of GDP of savings per year through reduction in subsidies to
0.3-0.4 percent of GDP at the end of the program. Tariffs for consumption between 0-200 kWh will
be retained for now, and income support programs will cushion the impact of future tariff increases
on the most vulnerable segments of the population. In years 2 and 3 of the program, subsidies will
be phased out for users above 200 kWh and reduced for all but the lowest consumers in the 0–200
kWh range.
28.
Arrears. Beyond adjusting tariffs and reducing costs to reach full cost recovery, we are
implementing a plan to resolve the difficult legacy of circular debt arrears. The plan is aimed at
making the sector viable and removing barriers to new investment. In this respect, out of the
Rs. 503 billion of payment arrears identified as of end-May 2013, we paid off Rs. 342 billion at endJune 2013 and will be resolving the residual by end-August 2013. Such arrears reduction will
alleviate cash constrained power producers and allow them to bring additional electricity supply to
the system and reduce load shedding by around three hours. We will also hire a professional audit
firm to conduct a technical and financial audit of the system to identify the stock and flow of
payables at all levels of the energy sector (including Power Sector Holding Company Limited) by
end-November 2013 (structural benchmark), and based on the findings of the report we will design
a roadmap to prevent the accumulation and recurrence of payables arrears.
29.
Monitoring and Enforcement. A key shortcoming of the current electricity sector has been
the limited ability to collect for energy supplied, due in part to a lack of specific real-time data on
energy flows, and which also results in inadequate compliance with usage restrictions. To address
this, we are going to sign strengthened performance contracts with all power sector companies to
tackle losses, raise payment compliance, and improve energy efficiency and service delivery. In cases
of failure to comply with the performance contracts, we will invoke remedial measures for
management and the Boards as specified in the Companies’ Ordinance. The government will enact
the pending amendments to the Penal Code 1860 and the Code of Criminal Procedures 1898 to
strengthen the legal framework in cases of electricity theft by enhancing investigation, prosecution,
and penalties by end-December 2013 (structural benchmark). In parallel, we are drafting a new
Electricity Act to modernize governance of the sector. The act will establish investigation systems
and a fast track judicial mechanism to improve enforcement. We are also empowering the
distribution companies (DISCOs) to take commercial decisions on power allocations and allowing
them to impose differential outages on neighborhoods with low payment rates (as is already done

76

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAKISTAN

in Karachi). This new legislation, along with the installation of smart or pre-paid metering trees, will
allow better load management in the national grid and will reduce losses. Such legislation will also
decrease the unscheduled load-shedding, which is particularly damaging to economic productivity.
In the short-run, we will move to a web-based reporting portal to monitor electricity draws to
reduce overdraws and improve information flows. The metering at the incoming and outgoing 11kv
feeders will be completed by end-August 2013. To minimize losses in fuel delivery to generation
companies (GENCOs), we will lease the fuel storage and delivery facilities to Pakistan State Oil (PSO)
by end-December 2013.
30.
Demand Side Management. Conservation and energy efficiency are the cheapest and the
fastest ways to alleviate the electricity shortage. Pricing (¶27) and other market based instruments to
encourage energy conservation will significantly improve resource allocation and energy efficiency.
In addition, we will place the Pakistan Energy Efficiency and Conservation Act before the Parliament
for expected approval by end-September 2013. Equipment performance standards will be enforced
through strengthened mechanisms, and would cover key electrical and gas equipment and
appliances, which are not yet covered.
31.
Supply Side Management. Current energy generation is tilted towards the use of costly fuel
oil. Changes in the energy mix are required to decrease the production costs. We are now
prioritizing the use of gas and coal rather than fuel oil. In the short-run, increasing the allocation
of natural gas to the power sector will deliver savings in production costs. However, quantity-based
allocations distort market conditions. We are committed to making allocations through pricing
mechanisms in the medium term. We will encourage the conversion of fuel oil-based GENCOs and
Independent Power Producers (IPPs) to coal-based plants, which could substantially reduce the fuel
component of electricity production costs. To further improve supply, we will continue to
rehabilitate generation plants, while continuing to upgrade electricity transmission and distribution
facilities to reduce technical losses. We are initiating regular efficiency testing of GENCOs by endSeptember 2013 to facilitate savings. The current round of three rehabilitations should be
completed by end-December 2013 with 500 MW capacity recovery and a 1–2 percent increase in
efficiency. Moreover, to enhance energy supply, we will continue with the development of
hydropower projects—the cheapest source of supply. Policies should also promote private
investment for power generation through both the entry of new players as well as expanding
existing capacity of those IPPs systematically adhering to energy mix targets and least cost
generation plans. The expansions are expected to generate additional 2000 MW by 2016.
32.
Governance, Regulatory, and Transparency Improvements. We have placed high priority
on improving energy sector governance and transparency. To enhance governance, we will augment
the independence, accountability, and administrative capacity of the regulatory body, the National
Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA). To reduce circular debt accumulation, the period for
NEPRA’s determination of the base tariff will be reduced from 8–10 months to 90 days by the next
determination cycle. Specifically, for FY2013/14 DISCOs will submit the tariff petitions by end-July
2013, and NEPRA will issue the determined tariff by end-October 2013. The government will notify
new determined tariffs within 15 days, and over time determination and notification of tariffs will be

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 77

PAKISTAN

consolidated with NEPRA. There is also currently a lag of 7 months for the application of fuel price
adjustments (FPAs) dictated by NEPRA because of court injunctions. We intend to address these
injunctions through the legal system to ensure timely adjustments and to revise the monthly
application of FPAs to reflect next quarter’s prices to minimize price distortions and improve
predictability by end-November 2013. To enhance transparency, a web-based reporting of
dispatching, merit order of all power plants, and payment records to stakeholders will be introduced
by end-July 2013. Second, the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) should be made operational
by separating it from the National Transmission and Dispatch Company (NTDC), hiring key staff,
issuing CPPA rules and guidelines, and taking over the payment and settlement system by endDecember 2013 (structural benchmark). Dissolution of PEPCO should also be finalized by endDecember 2013 and its remaining functions should be devolved.
33.
Energy public sector enterprise (PSE) reform. The institutional capacity of all energy sector
PSEs needs to be strengthened to allow them to eventually operate independently from the
Government as efficient commercial entities. We will transfer governance of DISCOs and the NTDC
to new boards of directors and management by end-2013. We are committed to building the
institutional capacity of the Water and Power Development Authorities (WAPDA) through continued
corporatization and commercialization, and we will strengthen WAPDA’s financial capacity by
allowing the tariff to incorporate capital investment plans and ensure timely payments by
NTDC/CPPA for all power purchased from WAPDA. In the medium term, we are committed to
introduce competitive pricing and direct contracting between power producers and wholesale
customers in the power sector. We will endeavor to incorporate this transition into future phases
of solicitation for new IPPs.
34.
Oil and Gas Sector. The current level of gas supply is barely one half of unconstrained
demand due to low prices and insufficient investment. To help tackle the gas shortages, we will
facilitate the import of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and through pipelines and limit further
expansion of the gas distribution networks for domestic consumption. We will also accelerate new
investment in existing fields, which is projected to increase supply by some 7 percent by endDecember 2013. We will retain the priority ranking of the power sector to second (after households)
and we have diverted an additional 16 percent of gas to the most efficient power plants. Last year
we announced the new Petroleum Exploration and Production Policy 2012 to offer higher gas prices
for enhanced production from existing and new fields. As new production comes on line, the cost
of this gas will be fully reflected in the base tariff on a semiannual basis. We will gradually rationalize
gas prices to continue encouraging new investment, promote efficiency in gas use, and assure that
there will continue to be no fiscal cost from the gas sector. We will announce a rationalization plan
and introduce the new gas levy by end-December 2013 (structural benchmark). The current level
of unaccounted for gas losses (UFG) is on average 11 percent due to commercial and technical
losses. We have already directed companies to reduce losses benchmarking international standards
through investment measures, managerial and administrative improvements, and through building
the capacity of the gas distribution companies. We are committed to enhancing the capacity of Oil
and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA) and Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources.

Improving the business climate, liberalizing trade, and reforming state-owned firms
35.
Sustainably boosting economic growth in Pakistan will require a sharp increase in
foreign and domestic private investment. Achieving macroeconomic stability and addressing the
energy sector bottlenecks will do much to encourage renewed investment, but improvements in the
business climate, the trade regime, and PSEs will also be essential, as Pakistan currently falls short
of its peer countries in these areas.
36.
Business Climate. Impediments in the legal framework for creditors’ rights and contract
enforcement, barriers to new business start-ups, complicated legal and taxation requirements, and
impaired access to finance hamper the business climate and investment.


Contract enforcement. We will consult with key stakeholders to finalize a new draft bankruptcy
law (Corporate Rehabilitation Act) which we will submit for public consultation by endSeptember 2013 (¶22) and will send to parliament by end-September 2014. While the draft is
prepared, we will undertake a diagnostic of needs to speed up rehabilitation of weak but viable
corporate entities, and will expedite the liquidation of the insolvent entities. In addition, we will
provide the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Mechanism, which is already functional in
Karachi.



Start-ups. We will establish a “one stop shop” (OSS) for registering limited liability companies
(LLC), including the human resource and funding needs by end-December 2013. We continue to
engage with the World Bank on this through technical assistance and capacity building. The OSS
will enable firms to complete all legal formalities at a centralized location grouping Federal
Board of Revenue (FBR), Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), and other
Government departments such as Employees Old Age Benefits Institute. In parallel, we will build
capacity to set up the OSS and strengthen the Board of Investment (BOI) in facilitating
implementation of investment friendly regulations. By end-September 2013, the BOI, in
coordination with SECP, FBR, provincial governments and other concerned agencies, will develop
a plan to further simplify procedures and costs for setting-up businesses in Pakistan.



Access to credit. Accessing credit for small and medium enterprises (SME) remains very limited.
We will build on the State Bank of Pakistan’s Financial Inclusion Program to enhance access of
micro and small enterprises to financial services. This will encompass building on regulatory
reforms, product innovation, and improved delivery mechanisms, financial literacy and consumer
protection.

37.
Trade Policy. Trade policy reforms would increase consumer welfare and stimulate growth
via increased competition. Simplifying tariff rates, eliminating the statutory regulatory orders (SROs)
that establish special rates and/or nontariff trade barriers in some 4,000 product areas, and
normalizing trade relations should deliver the much needed competitive environment.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 79

PAKISTAN



Tariff simplification. We will begin working on simplifying the tariff structure to return to the
2003 framework, with 4 slabs and 0 to 25 percent rates. Design of the new system would be
completed by end-December 2013, with application of the revised tariff rates and begin the
phase-out of trade SROs by June 2014 (see also ¶12 on SROs). Implementation of the new trade
framework would be completed by end-June 2016.



Normalizing trade relations. We are moving forward with eliminating the negative list on trade
with India and extending India most favored nation status, and shifting to “sensitive list” under
SAFTA regime to facilitate increased regional trade. We will also develop a strategy to take full
advantage of trade preferences available from the EU where we have autonomous trade
preferences in 75 items. In addition, the EU is currently considering our request for receiving
GSP plus benefits (zero percent duty) from January 1, 2014 on exports.

38.
Public Sector Enterprises. We will step up efforts to reform public sector enterprises,
focusing on limiting poor performance and improving public sector resource allocation. We are
working on a time bound strategy for 65 PSEs approved for privatization by the Council of Common
Interest (CCI) to facilitate decisions to either privatize firms, restructure those with prospects of
profitability but which the government wishes to retain in the public sector, or close nonviable firms.
The strategy will include information on the financial statements of these firms with detailed
information on government liabilities.


Privatization. The strategy for 30 firms will be announced by end-September 2013 (structural
benchmark), with plans for the remainder will be completed by end-December, 2013.



Restructuring. We have already begun the process of hiring professional chief executives and
board members for those enterprises with a corporate structure in line with the corporate
governance rules. We are developing medium-term action plans to restructure Pakistan
International Airlines (PIA), Pakistan Steel Mill and Pakistan Railways. The action plans include
partial privatization of companies through initial or secondary public offerings. Specifically:



Pakistan International Airlines. Aging equipment, outstanding loans, and incomplete passthrough of fuel costs weigh on the profitability of the firm. Our restructuring plan includes
stripping the nonviable components of PIA under a separate public sector enterprise—PIA2—by
end-December2013. We will service the guaranteed past loans of PIA2, apply a voluntary
“handshake” plan for the excess work force and liquidate by end-June 2014. The PIA will retain
some liabilities that it can service, streamline workforce and will receive capital injection from the
government. We plan to privatize 26 percent of PIA’s shares to strategic investors by end-June
2014 (structural benchmark). In the meantime, PIA will continue contracting leases on more
efficient airplanes and rationalizing routes. Shifting non-flight activities to a new subsidiary
company could be among the options in order to focus on core activities.



Pakistan Steel Mill. To restore operations, hit hard by the collapse in steel prices during the
global recession, we have appointed a professional board and secured a commercial credit line
mostly from private banks to pay for loans, wages, and raw materials. The privatization

80

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAKISTAN

commission and Cabinet Committee on Restructuring will fast track the decision-making process
to approve a new comprehensive restructuring plan by end-September 2013, with
implementation to begin immediately thereafter.


Pakistan Railways. Aging and shortage of equipment, overstaffing, and large debts continue to
weigh on railway operations. By end-March 2014 we will develop a comprehensive restructuring
plan for Pakistan railways, and the railways company will be converted from a government
department to a state-owned limited liability company.



Other companies. We have identified a number of other companies that can quickly be
privatized in the financial and energy sectors. The strategy will include plans for block sales,
secondary public offerings for institutional and general public, or international listings. We will
hire transaction advisors by end-December 2013 to sell residual shares in two major companies
with already in private hands. The sequence will be calibrated to match market conditions.
Minority stakes of two blue chip companies will be sold after gauging investors’ appetite and
global market conditions. In this regard, we will hire transaction advisors by end-December 2013
to undertake the operation. In the medium-term energy companies can also be included among
the companies to be privatized.

Financing
39.
In addition to our request for a financial arrangement with the IMF, we have
commitments for grants and loans from other bilateral and multilateral partners to fully close
the anticipated financing shortfall. We have firm commitments that financing will be in place for
the first 12 months of the arrangement. Current projections suggest a financing gap of US$15 billion
through June 2016, almost half of which will be filled by the extended arrangement under the EFF.
Roughly US$3.5 billion will be met by the estimated improvement in the balance of payments due
to the adjustment measures under the program. In addition, we expect additional external financing
assurances over the program period from the World Bank ($1.5 billion), Asian Development Bank
($1.6 billion), the United Kingdom ($0.5 billion), the United States ($0.4 billion), and others
($1.5 billion).

Program Issues
40.
There are important risks to the program. Pakistan is highly vulnerable to increases in oil
prices, and our high reliance on textile exports means that volatility in international cotton prices is a
key source of risk. In addition, a further economic slowdown in trading partner countries—including
in Europe—would adversely affect Pakistan’s exports while a scaling back of workers’ remittances
would undermine the external position further. We have consulted with the provincial governments
and are collectively committed to the key points of the adjustment program outlined in this
memorandum.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 81

PAKISTAN

41.
Program monitoring. The program will be subject to quarterly reviews, quarterly
performance criteria and continuous performance criteria as set out in the TMU. Completion of the
first two reviews scheduled for December 2, 2013 and March 2, 2014 will require observance of the
quantitative performance criteria for end-September 2013 and end-December 2013, respectively,
and continuous performance criterion as specified in Table 1. To facilitate program monitoring, we
are committed to providing detailed statistical information as specified in the TMU. We will also
continue to improve our economic statistics, including by beginning to produce quarterly national
accounts data and by improving the coverage and organization of fiscal data.
42.
An updated safeguards assessment of the SBP will be conducted in the context of the first
review.
43.
The government authorizes the IMF to publish the Letter of Intent, its attachments, and the
related staff report.

For the purposes of monitoring under the program, all assets and liabilities as well as debt
contracted, denominated in SDRs or in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, will be converted into
U.S. dollars at the program exchange rates. Net external budget financing and external cash grants
will be converted into Pakistani rupees at the program exchange rate. The program exchange rate
of the Pakistani rupee to the U.S. dollar is set at 99.66 rupee per one U.S. dollar. Gold is valued at
35 SDR (US$52.5) per fine troy ounce. The cross-rates for other foreign currencies are provided in

needs, for intervention in exchange markets to affect the currency exchange rate, and for other
related purposes. Excluded from usable reserves, inter alia, are: (i) claims on residents; (ii) assets in
nonconvertible currencies; (iii) illiquid assets; (iv) assets that are pledged, collateralized, or otherwise
encumbered, unless there is also a reserve-related liability associated with it.
5.
Reserve-related liabilities of the SBP include outstanding IMF credits to Pakistan, foreign
exchange deposits with the SBP of foreign governments, foreign central banks, foreign deposit
money banks, international organizations, and foreign nonbank financial institutions, as well as

6.
Aggregate net position in the foreign exchange derivatives is defined as the aggregate

Point No. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt (Executive Board
Decision No. 6230–(79/140), last amended by Executive Board Decision No. 14416–(09/91), adopted
August 31, 2009).The ceiling on external payment arrears is set at zero.
12.

balance of the general government balance, excluding grants, including the operations of district
governments financed from local funds. It will be measured below the line and will include:


Net external financing, excluding valuation gains and losses.



Change in net domestic credit from the banking system, excluding valuation gains and losses
from deposits denominated in foreign currency.



Change in the net domestic nonbank financing, excluding valuation gains and losses. These

Electricity Tariff Pricing Formulas and Definitions (¶27 of the Letter of Intent)
(i)

The increase in the weighted average tariffs by 50 percent on industrial, commercial,

bulk and AJ&K consumers’ electricity consumption is defined as follows
Weighted Average Notified Tariff for industrial, commercial, bulk and AJ&K consumers =
(Changes in the Industrial Users Tariff Rate for each category x DISCO’s estimated sales to
Industrial Users for each category
+ Change in the Commercial Users Tariff Rate for each category x DISCO’s estimated sales to
Commercial Users for each category
+ Change in the Bulk users’ Tariff Rate for each category x DISCO’s estimated sales to Bulk
Users for each category)
+ Change in the AJ&K users’ Tariff Rate for each category x DISCO’s estimated sales to AJ&K
Users for each category)
/ DISCO’s total sales to Industrial, Commercial, Bulk, and AJ&K Users
= 50 percent
(ii)

Elimination and reduction of the subsidy on second group of consumers by

October 1, 2013 through increasing the weighted average notified tariffs by 30 percent.


Second group of consumers is defined as the following users; (i) those with consumption
levels above 200kWh, (ii) Salinity Control & Reclamation Programme (SCARP),
(iii) Agricultural tube wells consumers and (iv) Other customers (public lighting, housing
schemes, railways, HVTL).

Adjustors

16.
The floor on NIR will be adjusted upward (downward) by the cumulative excess (shortfall)
of multilateral and bilateral creditors, Coalition Support Fund (CSF), and bond issuance relative to
projected inflows (Table 2). Gross cumulative inflows are defined as external disbursements
(including grants) from official multilateral creditors (World Bank, Asian Development Bank, Islamic
Development Bank), official bilateral creditors (UK-DFID, USAID), and external bond placements that
are usable for the financing of the central government budget.
17.
The ceiling on NDA will be adjusted downward (upward) by the cumulative amount of any
excess (shortfall) of budget support loans or budget support grants compared to the program
amounts (Table 3) and Euro bond issuance or project grants compared to projected inflows
(Table 2). Budget support grants to the public sector are defined as grants received by the
government (including provincial governments) for direct budget support from external donors
and not related to the projected financing. Budget support loans to the public sector are defined as
disbursements of loans from bilateral and multilateral donors for budget support (including
provincial governments).
18.
The ceiling on the consolidated overall budget deficit (excluding grants) will be adjusted
upward for the cumulative excess in net external program financing in rupee terms for up to
PRs 25.0 billion at end-December 2013, PRs 42.0 billion at end-March 2014, and 50 billion at endJune 2014. The ceiling will be adjusted downward for any shortfall in federal PSDP spending below
PRs 25 billion in September-2013, PRs 80 billion in December 2013, PRs 243 billion in March 2014
and PRs. 410 in June 2014; and for any shortfall in the targeted cash transfers (BISP) from their
indicative target.

An update of the March 2009 safeguards assessment was completed in March 2010 in relation to
the augmentation of access under the Stand-By Arrangement. The assessment found that: (i) efforts
are continuing to strengthen the safeguards framework at the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP),
including improved transparency and a more proactive role by the Audit Committee; (ii) the SBP’s
legal framework continues to present a safeguards risk due to unclear timetable for enacting
amendments to the SBP Act; and (iii) the treatment and use of Fund resources for budgetary
support has been clarified in an agreement between the SBP and the Ministry of Finance. The
authorities have implemented some recommendations, but the latest amendment to the SBP Act
does not cover safeguards risks raised in the previous assessments.
Exchange Rate Arrangement
On May 19, 1999, the dual exchange system was unified, with all international transactions
conducted at the interbank market exchange rate (FIBR). The de facto exchange rate arrangement is
classified as “floating”. De Jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating with no
predetermined path. The SBP does not make any explicit or implicit commitment with respect to an
exchange rate target or path. The SBP intervenes in the foreign exchange market, but does not
publish information regarding its interventions. Pakistan has accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
sections 2, 3, and 4. Pakistan is maintaining an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of June 30, 2013)
1.
Pakistan is among the largest recipients of World Bank financial assistance. The World Bank
Group program in Pakistan consists of an integrated package of financial support, including IBRD
lending, concessional IDA credits, Trust Funds and Grants administered by the Bank on behalf of
other development partners, Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Federally
Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and Balochistan, IFC investments, and MIGA guarantees, along
with complementary analytical and advisory services.
2.
The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) outlines the Bank’s strategic approach to helping
Pakistan achieve its development goals over a four year period. The Bank Group’s Board of Directors
endorsed a Country Partnership Strategy for Pakistan on July 8, 2010, covering fiscal years 2010
through 2013. The goal of the strategy is to help steer Pakistan’s economy back onto a path of high
growth by addressing key long-term constraints to growth: weak revenue mobilization, unreliable
energy supply, and a fragile security situation.
3.
A CPS Progress Report was presented to the World Bank’s Board on December 20, 2011. The
Progress Report extended the CPS implementation period by one year, to cover FY 2010 through
2014. The Report confirms that the overall strategic goal remains valid and consistent with the
priorities of the Government of Pakistan as articulated in its New Framework for Growth Strategy
(NFGS). The partnership remains centered on the existing strategic pillars of the CPS: economic
governance; human development and social protection; infrastructure; and security and conflict risk
reduction. It was agreed with the Government to extend the CPS period to include FY14.
4.

The four strategic pillars of the CPS are described below:



Improving Economic Governance. Addressing the shortcomings of Pakistan’s economic
management is critical not only for restoring macroeconomic stability but also for reducing the
likelihood of reversals leading to another cycle of growth giving way to stagnation. Enhancing
domestic revenue mobilization is an urgent priority for the Bank during the CPS period.
Strengthening public expenditure management at all levels of government will complement this
focus. The strategy also focuses on governance of markets with a view to strengthening
Pakistan’s competitiveness by addressing barriers to competition, and factor market rigidities
(including constraints in access to finance).



Improving Human Development and Social Protection. Improvement in human development,
including social protection, is critical to the goal of building resilience at the level of families and
individuals. The focus of Bank Group efforts is to support increased spending on human
development along with reforms to improve governance and accountability in the provision of
services. In education, the Bank supports government programs that combine supply side
interventions and demand-side measures to improve access to education with a focus on equity

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAKISTAN

to address regional and gender imbalances. In social protection, the Bank is supporting the
Benazir Income Support Program (BISP), the country’s national safety net program with a focus
on increasing its targeting efficiency and strengthening its operation. The Bank aims to scale up
support to strengthen health management systems and improve service delivery. Given
increased frequency of natural disasters, the Bank will bring additional focus and assistance on
the Disaster Risk Management (DRM) agenda.


Improving Infrastructure to Support Growth. Supply expansion and improving reliability and
efficiency of power and gas systems are central to Pakistan’s growth and development. At
present, power is the most pressing need in infrastructure and the Bank Group supports
adoption of policies that bring about financial sustainability, expansion of generation in a least
cost manner, and improvement in the efficiency of transmission and distribution.



Improving Security and Reducing the Risk of Conflict. The persistence of conflict in KP and FATA
poses a threat to some of the most vulnerable and marginalized populations in Pakistan, while
also challenging economic stability across the country. The Bank is seeking to help Pakistan cope
with the consequences of conflict while reducing the prospects of future conflicts. The MDTF for
KP, FATA and Balochistan is the Bank’s principal instrument for strategic engagement in crisis hit
regions in partnership with other development partners.

5.
IFC is an integral part of the World Bank Group’s program in Pakistan. The IFC strategy in
Pakistan seeks to continue expanding investments in the sectors with the highest potential
development impact and opportunities, including infrastructure (e.g. renewable energy, ports),
financial markets (e.g. SME support through access to finance, housing finance), and manufacturing
and services (e.g. agribusiness, technical education). IFC is also focused on successful
implementation of its advisory programs designed to improve the business enabling environment,
strengthen financial markets, and support development of small businesses.
6.
Pakistan is also a focus country for MIGA, where it has already provided guarantees in
hydropower and microfinance. Going forward, MIGA’s strategy seeks to support investments into
IDA countries, South-South investments, complex infrastructure projects, and investments into
conflict-affected areas.
7.
The Bank’s key principles of engagement in Pakistan include (i) delivering fewer but larger
operations to allow the Bank to focus its limited resources on strategic areas where the needs are
the greatest; (ii) increasing the use of performance-based instrument; (iii) strengthening attention to
implementation, results and communications; (iv) deepening the engagement with the provinces,
which will require significant attention to capacity support; (v) leveraging partnerships for shared
objectives; and (vi) for MDTF, start small and scale up success. The Bank would not be able to
provide policy support unless the macro-economic conditions improve, but will remain engaged in
the critical issues of revenue mobilization and power through analytical work, ongoing projects and
exploring results based operations.

8.
The current CPS implementation period is ending in June 2014. The Bank has started
preparation for the new Country Partnership Strategy in parallel to avoid a gap between the two
strategies. The new CPS covering the five-year period from 2015-19, is scheduled for Board
presentation in June 2014. Implementation of this new strategic framework will start from July 1,
2014.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of June 30, 2013)
1.
Pakistan is a major recipient of financial support from the Asian Development Bank. Since
1968, the ADB has provided more than $20 billion in assistance through the highly concessional
Asian Development Fund (ADF) window and the Ordinary Capital Resources (OCR) window.
2.
The ADB’s Board of Directors endorsed the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) covering the
years 2009-2013 in January 2009. Consistent with the ADB’s long-term strategic framework (Vision
2020), the CPS has the overarching objective of supporting sustainable and inclusive growth in
Pakistan as a means of reducing the incidence of poverty and improving welfare. The CPS outlines
the ADB’s strategic approach to assisting Pakistan in achieving its development goals over the five
year period by facilitating structural change, investment and institutional effectiveness.
3.
The main areas of current ADB operations in Pakistan reflect the CPS 2009-2013: (i) energy;
(ii) infrastructure investments in transport, logistics and irrigation; (iii) reforms in key sectors
including energy, finance, agriculture and industry; and (iv) urban services, including water, waste
management and transport.
4.
Much of ADB lending is under the multi-tranche financing facility (MFFs). At present, there
are 8 active MFFs: energy (4, $2.89 billion total); transport (2, $1.67 billion total); irrigation (1; $700
million) and urban services (1, $300 million). Of the total $5.76 for all eight MFFs, $2.5 billion has
been committed for subprojects and tranches, with $3.0 billion available for new projects in these
sectors. For 2012, we have also approved three more periodic finance requests (PFR) in the power,
irrigation and urban services sectors, for a combined amount of $417 million.
5.
The current portfolio is comprised entirely of projects, with a total value of about $3.0 billion,
with energy accounting for the largest share ($1.1 billion), followed by emergency assistance (floods
$650 million), agriculture and irrigation ($611 million), transport ($400 million), and other ($138
million).
6.
A new CPS for 2014-2018 is being prepared, that will outline ADB’s strategic approach to
assisting Pakistan over the next five year period. ADB will continue to focus on inclusive growth
through infrastructure development, reforms n key sectors including energy, finance and urban
services.
7.
In addition to its activities in the areas outlined above, the ADB has provided trade finance
support to nine Pakistani banks under its Trade Finance Facilitation Program (TFFP). To date, the
TFFP has supported over $2.0 billion in trade in Pakistan through the provision of guarantees,
working through 13 participating and 3 issuing banks in Pakistan.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of June 30, 2013
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but broadly adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: In 2013, the Federal Bureau of Statistics (FBS) completed rebasing and revising
of the national accounts statistics from fiscal year 1999/2000 to 2005/06 to bring them in line with
the concepts and definitions of the 2008 System of National Accounts (2008 SNA). The
methodology better captures concepts measurement of value-added at basic prices (instead of
factor cost), double deflation, and Financial Intermediation Services Indirectly Measured (FISIM). PBS
has compiled national accounts based on basic prices instead of factor cost. The finance and
insurance sectors have been revamped in the new methodology and the coverage of transport,
storage and communication sector has been expanded. The current national accounts series goes
back only to 2005/06 and the FBS is currently working to produce backward linking of series to
1999-2000 by December 2013, It also intends to producing quarterly national accounts (QNA), which
would be completed by November 2013. With respect to labor market statistics, the FBS has now
compiled and started releasing quarterly employment/ unemployment data, the first release being
in February 2011 and included 5 years of historical data and is investigating the feasibility of
disseminating data on wages/salaries.
Price statistics: The FBS produces three price indices: the CPI, the wholesale price index (WPI), and
the sensitive price indicator (SPI). The CPI and WPI are compiled on a monthly basis. The SPI is
compiled on a weekly basis and consists of 46 essential commodities that are consumed by the
lowest income group. The concepts and definitions of the CPI and WPI follow international
guidelines. FBS introduced the classification of individual consumption by purpose (COICOP) with
rebasing of the indices to 2007/08 in August 2011. Aside from the implementation of COICOP,
changes to the CPI included updated weights, and expanded item and geographic coverage. These
changes reflect international recommendations and best practices. Plans have been made to
complete the work to develop a Producer Price Index (PPI); IMF is providing technical assistance in
this regard.
Government finance statistics: The concepts and definitions used in compiling government finance
statistics are broadly based on the GFSM 1986, except that privatization proceeds are included
below the line. The scope of central government data is further limited because it does not cover the
activity of extra budgetary funds. Classification and sectorization in source data follow GFSM 1986
standards to a limited extent. The classification of expenditure deviates from GFSM 1986
methodology because the economic and functional classifications are mixed in reporting, in
particular, with defense and government administration expenditures not clearly identified
according to economic classification. The basis of recording GFS is on, or close to, a cash basis.
Transactions are recorded on a gross basis. Corrective transactions are not necessarily made in the
original period, as required by GFSM 1986. The authorities have indicated their intent to adopt the
methodology of GFSM 2001 over the medium term, and in line with the Board decision (No 14656

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PAKISTAN

of October 2010) to strengthen fiscal analysis, they have compiled with staff assistance fiscal table in
GFSM 2001 presentation. However, further improvements in government finance statistics are
needed and the authorities are making progress toward that objective in the context of the Project
for the Improvement of Financial Reporting and Auditing (PIFRA). Budgetary central government
operations data are regularly reported for publication in the GFS Yearbook, and use the GFSM 2001
framework. However, no data are reported on transactions in nonfinancial and financial assets and
liabilities. The authorities do not report higher frequency data for inclusion in the IFS.
Monetary statistics: The ROSC mission found that the scope of the monetary statistics is
comprehensive. The classification and sectorization of the monetary survey compiled by the State
Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) Statistics Department for reporting to the IMF and for internal use are
broadly in line with the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). The basis for recording
flows and stocks is largely consistent with the MFSM, and the SBP has indicated its intention to adopt
the MFSM in order to further improve monetary statistics. The ROSC mission that conducted the
reassessment of monetary statistics in November 2006 found that the authorities had implemented
the MFSM guidelines on the sectorization of institutional units, classification of financial instruments,
and the recording of securities repurchase agreements (repos). Also, a new reporting framework for
other depository corporations has been designed and is being implemented. Progress has been
made in resolving discrepancies in the data on interbank positions between the SBP and scheduled
banks. The SBP has reported the Standardized Report Forms for central bank (1SR), other depository
corporations (2SR), and monetary aggregates (5SR) to the Fund for publication in the IFS.
Balance of payments: Starting in the third quarter of 2003 (July–September), Pakistan’s balance of
payments statements have been prepared according to the methodology of the Balance of
Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM5). A 2007 Fund technical assistance mission made
recommendations to more closely align some recording practices with the BPM5, including in the
areas of residency, sectorization, and consistency across related data sets. Based on these
recommendations, a number of improvements have been made. Differences between the two
sources of trade data (customs records for FBS and exchange records for SBP) for exports and
imports have been widening. Most of the differences can be reconciled ex post (see SBP’s Second
Quarterly Report for FY2006), and the authorities are working to narrow these differences before the
publication of the data.

International investment position: Annual international investment position data are compiled
and published on the SBP website. Since 2010 SBP has also started publishing quarterly data on
international investment position. Annual data are available back to 2003.
II. Data Standards and Quality
The Report on the Observance of Standards and
Pakistan participates in the General Data
Codes (ROSC)—Data Module, a Response by the
Dissemination System (GDDS) since 2003,
meeting the recommendations for the coverage, Authorities, and a Detailed Assessment Using the
Data Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF)
periodicity, and timeliness of most GDDS data
were published on the IMF website in December
categories. Authorities are keen to subscribe to
the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), 2004. A ROSC reassessment focusing on
and an SDDS assessment mission is scheduled in monetary statistics was conducted in November
2006 and published on the IMF website in
January 2012. For subscription to the SDDS,

Pakistan will need to disseminate (a) monthly
data on central government operations with a
timeliness of one month; (b) quarterly data on
the national accounts, employment and
unemployment, wages/earnings, and external
debt, all with a timeliness of one quarter; (c)
more detailed breakdown of data on central
government debt and external debt; and (d)

Middle East and Central Asia Department

1.
This supplement provides an update on economic and policy
developments since the issuance of the staff report on August 22, 2013. The
additional information does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Headline inflation rebounded from 5.9 in June to 8.3 percent in July. This
rate was slightly higher than staff projections, reflecting the impact of energy and
transportation price increases. At the same time, core inflation remained at 9.3 percent.
3.
Gross official reserves are at US$4.8 billion as of August 27, 2013 in line
with Staff’s projections. SPB continued to purchase foreign exchange in the spot
market consistent with program objectives. Payments to the Fund (US$392 million) and
unwinding of the swap/forward contracts (US$150 million) are the main reasons
behind the decline in reserves.
4.
Provisional figures point to 8 percent of GDP budget deficit for 2012/13.
The deficit is ½ percent of GDP better than originally estimated. This is mainly due to
lower interest, defense and grant expenditures.
5.
The authorities have completed the five prior actions: (i) The government
implemented a series of fiscal adjustment measures reaching 2 percent of GDP;
(ii) Electricity prices were raised on certain groups of consumers as a part of the new
Energy Policy; (iii) The Council of Common Interest (including representatives of the
provinces) ratified the fiscal commitments under the program; (iv) The Federal Bureau
of Revenue launched an income tax enforcement scheme by issuing over 10 thousand
notices to suspected high income individuals and firms who did not file returns; and
(v) The State Bank of Pakistan purchased net US$125 million in the foreign exchange
spot market.

IMF Executive Board Approves 3-Year, US$6.64 Billion Extended Arrangement for
Pakistan
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved today a 3-year
arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) for Pakistan in an amount equivalent to
SDR 4.393 billion (US$6.64 billion1, or 425 percent of Pakistan’s quota) to support the
country’s economic reform program to promote inclusive growth. The Executive Board’s
approval enables an initial disbursement by the IMF of an amount equivalent to SDR 360
million (about US$544.5 million), and the remaining amount will be evenly disbursed over
the duration of the program, subject to the completion of quarterly reviews.
Despite the challenges it faces, Pakistan is a country with abundant potential, given its
geographical location and its rich human and natural resources. The authorities’ program is
expected to help the economy rebound, forstall a balance of payments crisis and rebuild
reserves, reduce the fiscal deficit, and undertake comprehensive structural reforms to boost
investment and growth. Adherence to the program is also expected to catalyze the
mobilization of resources from other donors.
Following the Executive Board discussion on Pakistan, Ms. Nemat Shafik, Deputy Managing
Director and Acting Chair, issued the following statement:
“Pakistan is facing serious economic challenges. Overall vulnerabilities and crisis risks are
high, with subpar growth and unsustainable fiscal and balance of payments positions. In this
context, the authorities’ comprehensive economic program is timely and welcome.
“The authorities’ 2013/14 federal budget represents an important initial step towards the
needed fiscal consolidation. However, to ensure medium-term fiscal sustainability and create
fiscal space for social and investment spending, it is important to raise the tax-to-GDP ratio,
including by broadening the tax base through a reduction in exemptions and concessions and
extending taxation to areas currently not fully covered by the tax net. An overhaul of tax
administration is also required, and provinces should contribute fully to the adjustment effort.

“Monetary and exchange rate policies should be geared to rebuilding external buffers, direct
lending to the government should cease and efforts to improve independence of monetary
policy need to be stepped up to pave the way for improved price stability. Risks to the
banking sector are manageable, although the undercapitalization of vulnerable banks needs to
be addressed.
“To achieve sustained and inclusive growth, short-term macroeconomic measures must be
complemented by significant structural and governance reforms. The recently announced
energy policy will address the long-standing problems in the sector, which constitute the
most crucial constraint on growth and have generated large fiscal costs. In addition, the trade
regime needs to be liberalized, public sector enterprises need to be restructured or privatized,
and the business climate needs to be improved.
“Protecting the most vulnerable from the direct and indirect impacts of fiscal consolidation
and price adjustments is a priority. Coverage and benefits of these programs should be
expanded as savings from tariff adjustments and fiscal space are realized.”
ANNEX
Recent Developments
Pakistan’s growth trajectory has borne the tolls of both internal security and macroeconomic
imbalances, as well as an uncertain global and regional environment. These factors, along
with the country’s longstanding structural problems, mainly in the energy sector, have kept
growth below the level needed to reduce poverty and absorb the growing labor force. Power
outages, resulting from many years of financial and governance problems and averaging
about 8-10 hours a day, together with devastating floods and a difficult security situation
have contributed to the anemic growth. GDP growth has averaged only 3 percent over the
past five years. Private domestic investment has dropped from 14 percent of GDP in 2007/08
to around 11 percent of GDP in 2012/13 due to a difficult business climate. With capital
flows virtually drying up, central bank reserves have declined to critical levels, falling by
some 45 percent in the past year alone. As of end June 2013, reserves stood at US$6 billion.
Much effort is needed to boost confidence in order to attract foreign direct investment in line
with Pakistan’s long-term growth potential.
Program Summary
The authorities have put in place an ambitious economic reform program aimed at reversing
the current large fiscal deficits, fostering inclusive growth and addressing Pakistan’s short
and medium term problems. They have already implemented key measures to ensure a strong
start, including fiscal consolidation measures totaling 2 percent of GDP, adjusting electricity
tariffs as part of a new comprehensive energy policy, reorienting monetary policy to rebuild
foreign exchange reserves, in addition to reducing inflation, and launching a decisive tax
enforcement program. These measures are expected to reduce the government budget deficit
to sustainable levels, reduce crowding-out of private investment, and containing inflation
over the medium-term.

3

Medium-term elements of the program:
 Raising growth gradually to near 5 percent by 2015/16 as macroeconomic stability is
entrenched and structural reforms are pursued.
 Bringing inflation down to 6-7 percent range by 2015/16, from the current level of 8.3
percent.
 Increasing central bank reserves to over 3 ½ months of imports by 2015/16.
 Reducing the fiscal deficit to 3 ½ percent of GDP by 2015/16 from an estimated 8.0
percent in 2012/13, with provincial governments contributing their fair share of the
fiscal consolidation process.
 Liberalizing the trade regime and reforming public sector enterprises through
restructuring and/or privatization.
 Improving the business climate.
 Strengthening the tax system.
 Protecting the most vulnerable from the direct and indirect impacts of reform
measures.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes the 2013 Article IV Consultation with Pakistan
On September 4, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV Discussions with Pakistan1 and approved a three-year arrangement
under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) for Pakistan in support of the authorities’ structural
reform and growth program (see Press Release No. 13/322).
Economic performance in Pakistan has been substandard in recent years. GDP growth has
averaged only 3 percent over the past five years, which is insufficient to significantly
improve living standards or fully absorb the growing labor force. Severe problems with the
electricity supply, a difficult security situation, the presence of loss-making public sector
enterprises in key economic activities, a poor business climate, and a distorted trade regime
have been important factors in anemic growth.
Headline inflation has fallen sharply in recent months, but underlying inflationary pressures
remain. The external position has weakened significantly and central bank reserves have
declined to US$6 billion (below 1½ months of imports) as of end-June 2013. The rupee
depreciated around 5 percent against the dollar during the Fiscal Year 2012/13 (July-June),
leaving the real effective exchange rate roughly unchanged.
The 2012/13 fiscal deficit (excluding grants) is estimated to be 8 percent of GDP, well above
the original budget target of 4.7 percent of GDP due to slippages on both revenues and
expenditures. The revenue shortfall is largely explained by the underperformance in tax
collections in the previous fiscal year, inadequate tax administration, and a slowdown in
economic activity. Higher expenditures reflect higher energy subsidies, including clearing the
power sector arrears. Moreover, the provincial surplus envisaged in the budget has not

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary
is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found

materialized. With very low external financing, the deficit has been almost entirely
domestically financed.
Monetary policy continued to be accommodative to lift weak private investment and growth,
in light of falling headline inflation. In 2012/13, the policy rate has been cut repeatedly by a
cumulative 300 basis points to 9 percent, while direct financing of the large fiscal deficit
continues to drive growth in monetary aggregates. However, this accommodative policy did
not bear fruit in terms of private sector stimulus—private credit shrank in real terms.
The financial system is dominated by banks that have been relatively healthy as capital and
liquidity indicators continue to be boosted by large holdings of government securities.
Nevertheless, nonperforming loans remain high at 14.7 percent at end-March 2013 with few
banks falling below minimum capital adequacy requirements.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that Pakistan’s economic vulnerabilities and crisis risks are high,
with subpar growth and unsustainable fiscal and balance of payments positions. A lack of
reliable electricity supply and a difficult security situation in large parts of the country have
contributed to the deterioration.
Against this backdrop, Directors welcomed the authorities’ ambitious economic program
aiming to reverse the current mix of large fiscal deficits, accommodative monetary policy,
and low reserve coverage, and to foster sustained and inclusive growth. They stressed that
short-term measures must be complemented by significant reforms in fiscal management, the
monetary policy framework and financial markets, the energy sector, public sector
enterprises, the business climate, and trade policy.
Directors highlighted that further consolidation will be required to ensure fiscal
sustainability. While the 2013/14 federal budget represents an important initial step, a more
efficient and equitable tax system is needed, and a significant increase in the tax-to-GDP
ratio will be key to create room for social and investment spending while lowering the
deficit. This will involve broadening the tax base through a reduction in exemptions and
concessions, the extension of taxation to areas not fully covered by the tax net, and an
overhaul of tax administration. Directors underscored that fiscal sustainability can only be
achieved if the provinces are full partners in the adjustment effort.
Directors emphasized that monetary and exchange rate policies must be geared to rebuilding
external buffers and to maintaining price stability over time. They stressed the need to cease
direct lending to the government and underscored the importance of monetary policy
independence in paving the way for improved price stability.

3

Directors underlined that continued financial sector stability and steps to deepen financial
markets will contribute to boosting economic growth. They considered that risks to the
banking sector are manageable, but encouraged the authorities to promptly address the
undercapitalization of a few banks and to monitor closely non-performing loans.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ new energy policy, which is geared to addressing longstanding problems that constitute the most critical constraint on growth and have generated
large fiscal costs. They encouraged the authorities to work closely with donors and secure
broad-based support for the continued strong implementation of their energy sector strategy.
Directors also called for efforts to liberalize the trade regime, restructure or privatize public
sector enterprises, and improve the business climate to reduce rent-seeking behaviors and
increase both foreign and domestic productive investment.
Directors stressed that protecting the most vulnerable from the impact of fiscal consolidation
and price adjustments is a priority. They commended the authorities for their firm
commitment to boosting targeted income support programs, and encouraged a gradual
expansion of coverage and benefits as savings from energy tariff adjustments and fiscal space
are realized.
Directors recognized the risks to the program from a delicate security situation, a further
deterioration in the external environment, and potential constraints in legal, administrative, or
technical capacity and resistance from vested interests to the reforms. They welcomed the
authorities’ considerable efforts in undertaking prior actions, signaling their commitment to
the program’s objectives and their willingness to take additional measures if necessary. They
emphasized the importance of close collaboration with development partners, including
through technical assistance, and continued strong political will and ownership for the
program’s success.

Statement by Jafar Mojarrad, Executive Director for Pakistan and
Muhammad Sethi, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
September 4, 2013
Our Pakistani authorities are appreciative of staff hard work and constructive discussions
under the Article IV consultation and program negotiations, which have yielded consensus
on how to address the macroeconomic imbalances and foster growth over the medium term.
The authorities are fully aware of the challenges and are determined to press ahead with
critical reforms to boost growth and restore macroeconomic stability, thereby setting the
stage for a more vigorous momentum of reforms that will help shore up confidence, mobilize
external support, and attract foreign and domestic investment. In support of their program,
the authorities have requested a 36-month arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility
(EFF), which they believe is appropriate to provide financing over a sufficiently long period
to meet stabilization and structural reform needs.
As clearly laid out in the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) and the
staff report, a difficult regional security environment, the devastating effects of the floods,
domestic political challenges, and external shocks over the past several years have adversely
impacted growth and macroeconomic stability in Pakistan. In this context, and despite its
best efforts, the previous government was not able to stay the course of stabilization and
reform and complete the last reviews under the 2008 SBA, which expired in September 2011,
and discussions on a new program could not be finalized. In the meantime, the overall
macroeconomic situation continued to deteriorate, with rising fiscal and current account
deficits, and increased pressure on reserves reflecting the unfavorable external and domestic
environment compounded by weaknesses in policy implementation.
The successful democratic transition, the first from an elected government in the country’s
history, has brought to power a government at the center of the political spectrum with strong
parliamentary majority. The new government has a clear mandate and the political support to
pursue economic reforms involving difficult policy choices, which are critical for correcting
macroeconomic imbalances and putting the economy on a high and inclusive growth path.
The overall economic program is comprehensive and well calibrated to achieve
macroeconomic stability and improve growth prospects over the medium-term. The
envisaged policy mix of fiscal consolidation, prudent monetary policy, and appropriate
exchange rate policy will help secure macroeconomic stability, while the planned structural
reforms, along with a strengthening of the social safety net, will help improve the business
climate, boost investment, and soften the impact of fiscal consolidation on growth and the
poor. The authorities agree that downside risks are high, as indicated in the report, but
believe that their strong determination to implement the envisaged reforms, as evidenced by
the upfront actions taken, offers an important upside. The authorities look forward to the
program catalyzing adequate and timely donor support to fill any remaining financing gap.

2
Fiscal consolidation
Based on past experience, the authorities are aware that the outcome of the reform program
critically hinges on their ability to achieve fiscal consolidation to put public debt on a
sustainable trajectory, increase fiscal space for priority social and infrastructure investment,
and release resources for private sector development. Under the proposed program, the
authorities aim at reducing the fiscal deficit to around 3½ percent of GDP by FY 2016/17,
entailing a fiscal consolidation of about 4–4 ½ percent of GDP over three years. In this
regard, as indicated by staff, the new government has implemented upfront measures towards
fiscal adjustment of 2 percent of GDP, including measures envisaged in the 2013/14 budget.
On the revenue side, these include among others a new levy on natural gas, higher rates of
GST, corporate minimum tax, and personal income tax for higher income bracket, as well as
increases in excises and fees. Furthermore, building on earlier efforts, tax administration
reform will be strengthened through improved Federal Board of Revenue access to
information, an increase in the number of risk-based tax audits, and enhanced assessment,
collection, and prosecution procedures. In this regard, the issuance of 10,000 tax notices
based on large potential fiscal liabilities (prior action), is an important first step in this area.
In addition, further measures aimed at widening the tax base will be implemented during the
program period, including by reducing tax exemptions and restricting the use of statutory
regulatory orders (SROs).
A major leap forward on the expenditure side is the commitment to phase out electricity
subsidy over the life of the program, along with the strengthening of the social safety net.
The first round of adjustment has been achieved by eliminating tariff differential subsidy
amounting to 0.75 percent of GDP through increasing weighted average tariff for
commercial, industrial, bulk and large consumers. Further tariff subsidy reductions are
envisaged in the following years to reach a maximum subsidy of 0.3 percent of GDP, as
indicated in the MEFP. In addition, nonwage current expenditures have been reduced through
a 30 percent across the board cut from this year’s budget allocations, equivalent to
0.15 percent of GDP. While some scaling back of the budgeted increase in capital spending
is envisaged this year, the authorities intend to preserve investment expenditure as fiscal
space is realized. The ratification of the fiscal commitments by the Council of Common
Interest, which includes representatives of the provinces (implemented as a prior action), will
ensure full contribution of all levels of Government to fiscal consolidation.
With regard to spending on social programs under the 2013/14 budget, the authorities have
increased allocation for Benazir Income Support Program (BISP, the largest targeted social
assistance program) to enable an extended outreach to over 5.7 million families through
conditional cash transfers for primary education. It is expected that by the end of the
program, 24 percent of the population (6.6 million families) would be covered under the
basic cash transfer program.

3
Monetary and exchange rate policies
Monetary policy has been a subject of intense discussion between the authorities and staff.
While the authorities recognize the importance of adjusting the policy rate as needed to
mitigate inflation risks, they firmly believe that the recent cuts were warranted by the
declining headline inflation and the need to support growth. In the same vein, the authorities’
intervention policy in the foreign exchange market has been motivated by the need to smooth
out exchange rate volatility and strengthen market confidence by further building reserves. In
this regard, and as a prior action, the SBP has purchased US$125 million in the foreign
exchange market on a net basis since July1.
In view of the uncertainty surrounding the macroeconomic environment, adequate flexibility
will be needed in calibrating the monetary and exchange rate measures and their timing to
specific circumstances in the future, which cannot be predicted with a reasonable degree of
certainty. The SBP has also expressed reservations on the methodology used by Fund staff
for the calculation of core inflation, and look forward to further consideration of the issue in
the context of the first review of the EFF.
The Selected Issue Paper on the performance of monetary policy in Pakistan makes
interesting reading, but regrettably has not benefited from a thorough review and comments
from the SBP before its circulation to the Board. The authorities have reservations about the
methodology used and the accuracy of the assessment underlying the paper’s main
conclusions, and will be sending detailed comments to staff, which they hope will be taken
into consideration before finalizing the paper for publication. If needed, the authorities stand
ready to have extensive discussions with staff on these and related issues at an appropriate
time.
Structural reforms
The authorities are cognizant of the fact that in the long run, structural reforms hold the key
to stronger growth, both by enhancing the overall efficiency of the economy and supporting
long term fiscal sustainability. Energy sector reform remains the top priority, in view of its
poor performance and the significant adverse costs to the economy and the budget. The first
major step taken in this regard has been the preparation of a comprehensive energy policy,
which addresses structural, governance, and regulatory issues. The Prime Minister chairs a
high level national committee on energy which meets regularly to take stock of progress
made under this policy. In the short term, the supply gap is being tackled by clearing
payment arrears and improving governance of the power transmission and distribution
system that currently records high losses due to poor infrastructure, mismanagement and
theft of electricity. The long term plans focus on generating affordable electricity for
commercial and industrial use by improving the energy mix and building generation capacity
that can sustain Pakistan's needs in the future while promoting a culture of energy
conservation and responsibility.

Providing a conducive and business friendly environment for investment is also high on the
list of government priorities. The “one stop shop” will provide easy access to a number of
government departments and agencies under one roof. The authorities continue to engage
with other development partners in strengthening the Board of Investment and streamlining
procedures for establishing businesses in Pakistan. Implementation of the ambitious program
of restructuring and privatization of public enterprises, along with further trade liberalization
and improved SMEs’ access to financing under the SBP’s Financial Inclusion Program,
would further strengthen private sector role, increase competitiveness, and enhance growth
potential.
Financial sector reform
As indicated in the report, the banking sector is generally well capitalized and liquid. A few
banks representing less than 7 percent of the system face financial pressures. These are being
addressed through fresh injections of equity or mergers. Introduction of a deposit insurance
scheme is under consideration to further stabilize the banking system. Besides, a new
legislation for corporate rehabilitation is also under discussion with relevant stakeholders to
improve the recovery mechanism. The authorities recognize the need for close monitoring of
the financial system and are in the process of further strengthening the supervisory and
enforcement power of the regulator.
Conclusion
The incoming government led by Prime Minister Mian Nawaz Sharif is fully committed to
stay the course of prudent policies and bold structural reforms under the proposed EFFsupported program. The authorities are cognizant of the challenges they are facing but are
confident that the difficult but necessary path of adjustment and reform that they have chosen
will help them achieve their ambitious goals of higher growth and employment with
macroeconomic stability. They are committed to taking the necessary measures as required to
ensure the achievement of their program objectives. They look forward to the continued
support from management and the Board.
