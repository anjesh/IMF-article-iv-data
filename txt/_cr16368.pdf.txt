IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Finland
On November 23, 2016 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Finland.1
Following a deep recession, growth has turned tepidly positive again. GDP increased by
0.2 percent in 2015 driven by stronger private consumption and a rebound in investment. While
net export growth was weak, falling oil prices contributed to the nominal trade balance shifting
into surplus, reducing the current account deficit. Better-than-expected fiscal performance
brought the deficit back under the 3 percent Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) limit in 2015.
Nevertheless, fiscal space is limited, as public debt reached 63.6 of GDP, which is above the
SGP threshold. Banks are well-capitalized and profitable despite the weak economy and low
credit demand.
The recovery is likely to continue but growth is set to remain slow at about 0.9 percent in 2016
and 1.1 percent in 2017. This outlook is subject to downside risks. Weaker-than-expected global
growth could further slow the recovery, while a protracted uncertainty surrounding post-Brexit
arrangements could weigh on confidence and investment. Domestically, fiscal and structural
policy efforts could weaken the recovery in the near-term, even if their longer run effects should
be positive.
The government has made progress on its ambitious structural reform agenda. The
Competitiveness Pact agreed by social partners will reduce labor costs, increase hours worked,
and aims to introduce more firm-level flexibility in the wage bargaining system. Draft bills on
the reform of health and social services provision are being discussed with stakeholders. A fiscal
consolidation plan is also being implemented. The short-term pace of consolidation has been
Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff
team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic
developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summing
up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

eased in return for reforms, without jeopardizing medium-term adjustment goals. Work is
continuing on the macroprudential policy framework and efforts to deepen regional cooperation
are ongoing.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed Finland’s return to positive growth, but noted that the recovery
will be slow and fragile and faces downside risks. Against this backdrop, Directors underscored
that reviving growth remains the country’s preeminent challenge, and should be achieved with
ambitious structural reforms and prudent macroeconomic and financial policies.
Directors commended the recent progress on structural reforms, including the reduction in the
maximum duration of unemployment benefits and the agreement on the Competitiveness Pact to
reduce labor costs. They recommended closely monitoring the implementation of the pact to
ensure that the wage bargaining process becomes more flexible at the firm level and better aligns
wages with productivity. Directors agreed that the draft bills on the health and social services
reform constitute major progress, and encouraged the authorities to develop the important
remaining elements of the new system quickly. Given the complexity of this reform, they noted
that clear and timely communication with stakeholders as well as regular progress assessment
will be critical.
Directors emphasized that efforts are also needed in other priority areas. In this regard, they
noted substantial scope for product market reforms, particularly in the retail sector and in statedominated sectors, which could increase competition and yield productivity gains. To promote
innovation, Directors generally advised reversing cuts to public research and development
(R&D) spending and creating stronger incentives for private R&D. They also called for
strengthening active labor market programs (ALMPs) and for additional measures to increase
affordable housing in urban areas to facilitate labor mobility.
Directors emphasized that fiscal policy needs to strike a balance between safeguarding long-term
sustainability and protecting the nascent economic recovery. In this regard, they generally
welcomed the near-term easing of the fiscal stance in return for structural reforms. A few
Directors considered that Finland has additional fiscal space that could be employed. A number
of Directors, however, stressed the importance of adhering to the fiscal rules under the Stability
and Growth Pact, including in the context of staff’s recommendation to implement faster the
remaining growth package spending. Directors

Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be

recommended making the composition of fiscal policy more growth-friendly, including by
reallocating resources toward R&D spending, well-designed ALMPs, and productive public
investment, and away from poorly-targeted transfers and tax expenditures. They noted that if
growth disappoints, automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate fully. More broadly,
Directors agreed that the decisive implementation of the structural reform agenda remains critical
to securing long-term fiscal sustainability.
Directors welcomed the Financial System Stability Assessment’s finding that the banks are well
capitalized and profitable. They concurred that financial sector policy frameworks should be
further bolstered to prepare for future risks. In this regard, Directors urged continued
strengthening of bank supervision, including by ensuring effective monitoring of banks’ internal
risk models and by intensifying oversight of their liquidity positions. They generally called for
increasing resources allocated to supervision to reflect the growth in regulatory complexity and
supervision intensity. While welcoming plans to introduce a systemic risk buffer and a floor on
mortgage risk weights, Directors also suggested adding instruments based on borrower and loan
characteristics to the macroprudential policy toolkit.
Directors stressed the importance of further deepening regional supervisory cooperation. They
noted that a strong agreement on data sharing and cooperation between the key supervisors will
be critical to mitigate risks from close regional linkages and Nordea Finland’s conversion from
subsidiary into a branch. Directors recommended conducting joint stress tests, enhancing joint
crisis planning, running regular crisis simulation exercises, and strengthening collaboration
between Nordic macroprudential authorities.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context: Following a deep recession, growth has turned positive again. However, a large
output gap remains and the structural decline of key high-productivity sectors (Nokia
and paper) weigh on medium-term prospects. As a member of the euro area and with
the fiscal deficit and debt close to or above European limits, macroeconomic policy
space is limited. The FSAP found that the banking system is well capitalized and
profitable, but also highly concentrated and dependent on wholesale funding.
Policy recommendations: Policies should support the recovery, boost potential growth,
and contain economic and financial stability risks.


Structural reform. Liberalizing retail trade and selected network sectors should raise
productivity. Already initiated reforms of wage bargaining and public health and
social services should be closely monitored to ensure intended results are achieved.



Fiscal policy. Fiscal policy needs to strike a balance between long-term sustainability
and protecting the recovery. Consolidation is needed, but to support growth, faster
implementation of the remaining growth package spending should be considered.
Resources should also be reallocated toward R&D spending, well-designed active
labor market programs, and productive public investment, and away from poorlytargeted transfers and tax expenditures. Automatic stabilizers should be allowed to
operate fully if growth disappoints.



Financial sector policy. Supervisory oversight should be bolstered to contain
liquidity risks at banks. The macroprudential toolbox should be expanded with the
addition of a systemic risk buffer and instruments based on borrower and loan
characteristics (e.g., a loan to income limit). Regional supervisory coordination needs
to be strengthened, including to help contain risks from the impending conversion
of Nordea—Finland’s largest bank—into a branch.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. Recent Developments
1.
Following a deep recession, growth has turned tepidly positive again. After declining by
3 percent over 2012–14, GDP grew at 0.2 percent in 2015 driven by stronger private consumption
and a rebound in private investment (Figure 1 and Table 1). Consumption was supported by lower
inflation—which boosted real wages—and temporary mortgage amortization holidays while the
upswing in investment reflected catch-up spending on machinery and equipment, especially in the
manufacturing sector. Net exports remained a drag on growth as stronger domestic demand
translated into higher real import growth, while real exports stagnated reflecting weak global
demand, a further drop in exports to Russia, and a loss of competitiveness since the crisis. Recent
data suggest that GDP growth continued to improve in the first half of 2016 (0.8 percent higher than
2015H1), driven by a further strengthening of domestic demand. But the recession has left a large
output gap (-3 percent of potential GDP) and high unemployment, which peaked at 9.3 percent in
2015. Headline inflation has slowed sharply, from 2.2 percent in 2013 to -0.2 percent in 2015, largely
due to falling oil and food prices (core inflation remains close to one percent). After a surge in
asylum seekers last year, the flow of new refugees has returned to normal levels.

2.
The recovery is aided by a dissipating drag from the structural shocks that hit Finland
in recent years. The sharp decline in key export industries (Nokia and paper) since 2007 seems to
now have largely bottomed out. Exports have stabilized and in particular the paper industry is
investing in new products and technology, resulting in an increase in investment worth ¼ percent of
GDP in 2015. However, these high-productivity industries will continue to account for a much
smaller share of employment and value added than in the past, implying slower productivity growth
than before the crisis. Rapidly declining labor force growth due to population aging remains an
additional structural drag on potential growth.

Improving terms of trade have helped
to reduce the current account deficit. Though
in real terms net exports have detracted from
growth, falling import prices, especially oil
prices, contributed to the nominal trade balance
shifting into surplus in 2015, shrinking the
current account deficit (Table 2 and Figure 2).
The net international investment position,
however, has continued to deteriorate (Table 3).
After being undervalued before the crisis, the
real effective exchange rate now appears
broadly in line with fundamentals (Annex I).

The fiscal deficit was brought back under the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) limit,
but fiscal space remains limited. The general government balance has been in deficit since 2009
reflecting the protracted downturn and increases in spending related to aging (Figure 3, Tables 4
and 5). In 2014 the deficit breached the SGP’s 3 percent of GDP threshold but Finland escaped the

Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) as the European Commission (EC) judged the excess to be small,
temporary, and exceptional. In 2015, the deficit narrowed to -2.8 percent of GDP—a positive
surprise as the original 2015 budget had forecast a -3.4 percent of GDP deficit. The better than
expected outcome was driven by revenue overperformance and lower than budgeted spending,
especially on public consumption. Public debt nearly doubled over the past decade and reached
63.6 percent of GDP in 2015, breaching the SGP threshold and making the government’s financial
position more vulnerable to shocks (Annex II). The growth in indebtedness along with the mounting
pressures from aging related spending and the need to adhere to the SGP constrain fiscal space.

appear significantly overvalued.
6.
Despite the weak economy and low credit demand, the banks remain broadly sound.
The 2016 FSAP found that banks have remained profitable in a low interest rate environment by
reducing cost-to-income ratios and increasing income from trading and insurance. Banks are also
well capitalized compared to peer countries, with a risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio (CAR) at
23.1 percent in 2015, up from 17.3 percent in 2014 (Figure 5 and Table 6). This said, their simple
leverage ratio (capital to total assets) of 5.6 percent is low compared to peers. Banks’ health and the
low level of nonperforming loans (1.6 percent of gross loans in 2015) suggest that the marked
slowdown in credit growth since 2011 mostly reflects weaker credit demand associated with the
weak economy and increased indebtedness.

Box 1. Sectoral Balance Sheet Analysis
Vulnerabilities stemming from indebtedness and cross-border exposures have risen since the crisis.1
An analysis of sectoral balance sheets shows that, in an environment of slow growth and low interest rates
the total indebtedness of the economy has increased by nearly 100 percent of GDP since 2007 to around
360 percent of GDP in 2015. Similarly, total foreign

Debts of nonfinancial corporations (NFCs) have
increased nearly 20 percentage points of GDP since
2007. Correspondingly, the share of debt in total
liabilities has risen 10 percentage points to half of the
total, increasing the financial fragility of NFCs’ balance
sheets. Moreover, NFCs’ debt service costs will rise
faster when interest rates begin to normalize. Also,
they could find it harder to rollover the larger debt
load in the event of a severe downturn, especially
since one-third of the debt is foreign financed.

Note: "Debt" is sum of bonds, loans, and other accounts payable.

Households’ indebtedness has also steadily increased since the crisis, though assets have risen too.
Most of households’ liabilities are loans from banks—predominantly mortgage loans—which have increased
by 16 percent of GDP since 2007. Household debt stood at more than 120 percent of disposable income in
2015. Meanwhile, households’ equity holdings, which constitute nearly half of their financial assets, expose
their net financial position to significant fluctuations, such as the more than 20 percent of GDP decline they
experienced during 2006-08. Households also have nonfinancial assets worth 212 percent of GDP in 2015,
mainly in real estate, so a drop in house prices would damage their net worth. Most mortgages have variable
interest rates but fixed monthly payments, which helps buffer households from interest rate shocks.
The government’s financial position has weakened, driven by rising debt eroding fiscal space. The
general government’s debt has risen by more than 30 percent of GDP since 2007, with debt held by foreign
investors accounting for 25 percentage points of that. Higher debt levels increase the vulnerability to
macroeconomic risks, where negative shocks to GDP growth or inflation or a rapid rise in interest rates could
have a sizeable impact on the future trajectory of the debt ratio. The erosion of fiscal space also constrains
the government’s capacity to respond to new shocks.
Banks’ balance sheets swelled by over 100 percent of GDP since 2007 and cross-border exposures
increased considerably. About one-quarter of this was due to Nordea shifting its derivatives book to
Finland in 2010. The rise in foreign liabilities accounts for 80 percent of the increase in total liabilities.
Overall, banks’ net financial position with the rest of the world deteriorated by more than 20 percent of GDP.
At the same time, banks’ net financial position vis-à-vis domestic households improved, as increased foreign
wholesale funding has been channeled into mortgage credit, increasing banks’ exposure to the housing
market. Higher foreign-financed wholesale funding also increases banks’ exposure to liquidity funding risks.
Nonbanks’ vulnerabilities remain limited though low interest rates have damped returns and
motivated a shift to riskier assets. Lower interest rates have reduced returns on fixed income assets,
prompting nonbanks (e.g., insurers, pension funds, and investment funds) to increase the share of equities in
their portfolios. Half of nonbanks’ portfolios consist of foreign assets, which provides diversification benefits
but also exposes them to spillovers from global financial market volatility.

7.
Substantial reforms are underway to address Finland’s challenges. The government’s
ambitious structural reform agenda published last year includes key reforms of the labor market and
healthcare and social services, and work on implementation has begun. Agreement was reached
between social partners on a Competitiveness Pact that will reduce labor costs (including via a wage
freeze in 2017) and increase hours worked, and could introduce more firm-level flexibility into the
wage bargaining system. Bills on the reform of healthcare and social services provision have been
drafted and are being discussed with stakeholders. A fiscal consolidation plan is being implemented.
Work is continuing on the improvement of the macroprudential policy and resolution frameworks.

B. Outlook and Risks
8.
Growth is expected to remain sluggish over the medium term. GDP growth is expected
to rise to 0.9 percent in 2016 and 1.1 percent in 2017, before gradually increasing further to around
1½ percent in the outer years of the forecast—

growth. Unemployment is expected to decline
slowly to 9.1 percent this year and to 8.9 percent in 2017. Inflation should gradually rise as the
economy recovers and the effects of oil and food price declines abate, rising to 0.4 percent in 2016,
1.2 percent in 2017, and reaching 2 percent by 2020. The current account is forecast to remain in
deficit as gradually strengthening export growth—with the drop in exports to Russia bottoming
out—is offset by rising imports and the unwinding of the terms of trade shock from falling oil prices.
9.
The outlook is subject to significant downside risks (Table 7). Weaker-than-expected
global growth, in particular slower growth in advanced Europe, could further slow the recovery given
Finland’s tight integration with European and world markets. Also, protracted uncertainty
surrounding post-Brexit arrangements could weigh heavier on confidence and investment than
currently envisaged. Meanwhile, a financial or economic shock in any of the other Nordics—e.g., a
correction in housing markets—could spill over to Finland through the interconnected regional
banking system and close trade links. Domestically, fiscal and structural policy efforts could weaken
the recovery in the near term, even if their longer run effects should be positive.

Authorities’ Views
10.
The authorities broadly shared the staff’s assessment of the outlook and risks. They
generally noted the same external and domestic risks identified by staff and underscored that the
ability of the Finnish economy to adjust to new shocks remained limited. On Brexit, the authorities
noted that the impact could be less large than originally feared. They also pointed out that, with the
UK accounting for only about five percent of Finnish merchandise exports, the impact would be
largely indirect—via the EU and the global economy.

POLICY DISCUSSION
A. Structural Policies
11.
Reviving growth remains Finland’s preeminent challenge. Annual labor productivity
growth dropped from about 2½ percent during 2000-07 to negative territory during 2007-14,
mainly reflecting a sharp reduction in TFP growth in manufacturing following the decline of Nokia
and the paper industry (Figure 6). Coupled with ill-timed wage increases in 2008-10, this has led to a
surge in Finland’s unit labor costs (ULC), which rose 5-15 percent more than in peer countries over
the post-crisis period. Meanwhile, declining labor participation, population ageing, and high
unemployment have resulted in slower workforce growth, further adding to the growth challenge.
Substantial cuts in R&D spending by both the private and public sectors (down by over 10 percent
in real terms since 2007), also weaken growth opportunities. These factors combined have reduced
potential growth to less than half its pre-crisis average. The reduced growth potential also highlights
pre-existing constraints on economic activity, including relatively strict regulation in retail trade and
selected network sectors (e.g., gas, rail and postal services), which exceeds the average in peer
countries and best practices, thereby constraining private sector dynamics and productivity growth.

12.
Structural reforms are needed in three mutually reinforcing areas. First, labor market
reforms are needed to raise labor supply, facilitate labor mobility (in particular between economic
sectors), and boost labor demand through better aligning wages with productivity. Second, public
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

FINLAND

sector reforms should improve public sector efficiency and help contain aging-related spending
pressures, especially in health and social services. Third, product market reforms should promote
competition and help boost productivity.
13.
The new Competitiveness Pact could achieve several key labor market reforms. The
pact, which was agreed in June 2016 and covers over 90 percent of Finnish workers, includes (i) a
wage freeze for 2017, (ii) an unremunerated increase in annual hours worked of 24 hours, (iii) a
temporary 30 percent cut in holiday bonuses for public sector employees during 2017-19, and (iv) a
2 percentage point shift of social security contributions from employers to employees over 2017-19.
In addition, the pact calls for modifications to the highly-centralized wage bargaining process aimed
at increasing firm-level flexibility and better aligning wages with productivity. In return, starting in
2017 the government will provide income tax cuts that will more than offset the impact of the shift
in social security contributions on workers’ disposable income in the short run.
14.
Other new measures should help labor market activation, participation, and mobility.
The government has decided to shorten the maximum duration of unemployment benefits from
500 to 400 days starting in 2017, and additional activation measures are being considered.
Separately, study grants for higher education are being tightened to help reduce overly long study
duration, thus getting younger people into the labor market sooner. New financial incentives for
developers to promote housing construction in key urban areas and measures to improve the
allocation of subsidized housing should facilitate labor mobility across regions.
15.
Progress is also being made on the plans to reform health and social services. Draft bills
on the first phase of the health, social services, and local government reforms have been circulated
to key stakeholders for consultation and a final proposal should go to Parliament by end 2016
(Box 2). Details of the second phase are still being developed and are expected next spring.
Box 2. Reforming Health and Social Services
In June 2016, the government presented draft bills on reforms of health and social services which aim to
contain long-run aging-related fiscal pressures by improving the efficiency of health and social services,
including by exploiting economies of scale. The main elements of the reforms are as follows:



Provision of services. Starting in 2019, all public health and social services delivery will be shifted from
the more than 300 municipalities that are currently providing such services to 18 newly established
administrative areas. The latter will be responsible for integrating the services such that public and
private sector services work more closely together, while meeting certain centrally-set quality criteria.



Financing arrangement. The reform also entails a fiscally neutral shift in taxation from local
governments to the central government, which will make transfers to administrative regions to pay for
health and social services. Correspondingly, local government tax rates and transfers they receive from
the central government will be lowered so that the overall taxation level will not increase. The modalities
of the transfer of expenses and revenues under the new financial model and related equalization
elements across regions are under preparation and will be finalized by 2020.

An envisaged second phase of the reform will aim to expand service options by allowing people to choose
between public, private, and nonprofit providers, but modalities are still being worked out.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FINLAND

16.
The progress with reform implementation is encouraging, but results should be closely
monitored. In particular, the government should follow up closely on the implementation of the
Competitiveness Pact to ensure that the envisaged increase in firm-level flexibility in wage formation
materializes. If the current agreement is not successful at better aligning wages with productivity at
the firm level, other approaches should be considered, including legislative changes to the wage
bargaining process. The legal, organizational, and fiscal changes required by the reform of health
and social services provision will be complicated to implement and key elements of the new system
still need to be developed. Clear and timely communication with stakeholders will be critical and
implementation results need to be carefully examined to identify any problems early on and ensure
the reforms generate the intended improvements in public sector productivity.
17.
Reform efforts also need to be broadened in other priority areas. Staff analysis suggests
that deregulation in selected network sectors could strengthen competition and yield substantial
productivity gains, including through downstream effects on the broader economy.1 There is ample
scope for deregulation, particularly in the retail sector—which is subject to relatively tight zoning
and planning restrictions—and in government dominated sectors such as rail and postal services,
where effective barriers to entry restrict competition. In this context, staff welcomes the recent work
to update the transportation code as well as the renewed privatization efforts initiated by the
government. Also, cross-country experience suggests that well-targeted R&D spending could foster
innovation and higher productivity growth. Recent cuts in public R&D spending should therefore be
reversed and ways to incentivize private sector R&D—such as through well-designed R&D tax
credits—should be explored further. Additional measures to facilitate labor mobility should also be
pursued. Strengthening active labor market programs (ALMPs) would help workers retrain and move
between industries. Further efforts to increase affordable housing in urban areas, such as
streamlining planning and development processes, would support labor mobility between regions.

Authorities’ Views
18.
The authorities agreed that structural reforms are critical to reviving growth. They
believed that the government program addressed the main issues, but the challenge now is in
implementation. In this regard, they underscored the importance of the agreement on the
Competitiveness Pact, which will reduce relative labor costs, lower taxes, and help Finland’s exports
regain competitiveness. They agreed that more firm-level flexibility in wage bargaining was also
critical and pointed to a recent decision by the construction workers’ union to lower the minimum
wage for new entrants as a possible early sign of increasing flexibility in the system. The authorities
emphasized, however, they are ready to take further measures if needed. On product markets, the
authorities agreed there is scope for further deregulation. They pointed to several new initiatives
currently under consideration, including relaxing store-size limits and opening the passenger rail
market to competition.

B. Fiscal Policy
19.
Fiscal policy needs to strike a balance between ensuring long-term sustainability and
protecting the recovery. While Finland had a very strong fiscal position up to 2007, having one of
the fastest aging populations in the world has contributed to a 12 percentage point of GDP increase
in public spending since then. Aging-related fiscal pressures also contribute to a sizable long-run
fiscal sustainability gap—defined as the adjustment needed to stabilize the debt ratio over the long
term—estimated at about 5 percent of GDP in 2015. To address the pressures and comply with
European rules, in 2015 the government initiated a slightly frontloaded multi-year consolidation
plan worth 2 percentage points of GDP during 2016-19. While the plan appropriately addressed
long-term sustainability needs, in the short term the substantial adjustment posed a risk to the
budding recovery. To mitigate some of the risk the authorities introduced a growth package of oneoff infrastructure and technology investments worth 0.7 percent of GDP and financed through asset
sales—though the package is back-loaded with most of the spending planned in 2017 and 2018
(0.3 percent of GDP in each year). Meanwhile, the allocation of public spending leaves room for
improvement as generous unemployment benefits with a long duration reduce incentives to work
while extensive tax breaks for energy-intensive industries support incumbent firms instead of
spurring innovation and productivity growth.
20.
The near-term pace of fiscal consolidation has been eased in return for labor market
reforms. Updates to the authorities’ fiscal plan, released in April and in the draft 2017 budget,
feature similar targets for the total adjustment (2 percent of GDP) and the 2019 deficit (-1.5 percent
of GDP) as the original plan. However, the fiscal

expenditure cuts are also planned—including
holiday bonus cuts for civil servants in 2017–19 and longer working hours agreed to as part of the
Competitiveness Pact (0.1 percent of GDP per year). Altogether, the new measures should bring the
deficit broadly back to the originally projected deficit path from 2018.
21.
The short-term easing of the pace of consolidation is appropriate and should help
support the recovery. The more accommodative fiscal stance in 2016–17—which does not
jeopardize medium-term adjustment goals—is welcome and in line with staff’s 2015 Article IV
recommendations. To further support the economy in the short term, the authorities should also

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FINLAND

consider a faster implementation of the remaining spending under the growth package. The growthfriendliness of fiscal consolidation could also be improved by reallocating resources toward R&D
spending, well-designed ALMPs, and productive public investment, and away from poorly-targeted
transfers and tax expenditures. If growth disappoints, automatic stabilizers should be allowed to
operate fully, while revenue windfalls should be used to reduce borrowing needs.
22.
To close the long-run sustainability gap, effective implementation of the structural
reform agenda remains critical. An earlier-agreed pension reform that becomes effective in 2017
is expected to close about 1 percentage point of the gap. With the 2017–19 consolidation plan
accounting for an additional 2 percentage point reduction, the successful implementation of other
structural reforms—most notably the reform of health and social services—will be key to closing the
remaining 2 percentage points and ensuring that public finances are robust to aging-related
spending pressures that will continue to build rapidly over the next decade and a half. Advancing
these reforms should therefore be a top priority from a fiscal perspective as well.

Authorities’ Views
23.
The authorities agreed that the short-run easing of the pace of consolidation in return
for reforms was a good policy bargain. They underscored that the government is committed to its
consolidation program and will make the necessary adjustment to achieve long-term fiscal
sustainability. The Competitiveness Pact and unemployment benefits reform would help boost the
labor supply and growth and would thus contribute to long-run fiscal sustainability. The authorities
also emphasized that the health and social services reform is one of the most significant reforms in
Finnish history and will improve public sector productivity and curb expenditure growth. On ALMPs
and R&D spending, they considered that the efficient use of current appropriations was more
important than shifting resources back towards these areas. They were also hesitant to bring
forward spending under the growth package as they thought it might risk breaching SGP limits.

C. Financial Sector Policies
24.
The recent FSAP found that while the banking system is well capitalized and profitable
key structural vulnerabilities remain. In the low interest rate environment, banks have successfully
offset the impact of smaller interest margins with cost reductions and increased income from
trading and insurance. Nonperforming loans remain low and capital levels are well above the
regulatory minima. Along with financial cycle indicators, this suggests near-term financial stability
risks are limited. However, the banking system is large (230 percent of GDP) and highly
concentrated, with three banks accounting for 93 percent of system assets. Banks are also reliant on
wholesale funding, which makes them particularly vulnerable to global financial market volatility.
The extent of regional interconnectedness is very high with two of Finland’s largest banks (Nordea
and Danske), headquartered in Nordic neighbors (Sweden and Denmark, respectively).

FSAP stress tests suggest that banks’ use of low risk weights may exaggerate their
capital ratios, while their reliance on wholesale funding exposes them to liquidity risks.
Although risk-weighted capital ratios would generally remain above regulatory minima under a
severe macroeconomic stress scenario, simple leverage ratios would fall below the 3 percent
minimum. Along with the largest banks’ relatively low risk density (RWA over total assets) compared
to peers, this indicates that banks using internal ratings based (IRB) models may be lowering risk
weights on some assets too much, particularly on mortgages. That said, banks would still satisfy
regulatory capital requirements with reasonably higher risk weights. Liquidity stress tests also found
that severe disruption in external wholesale funding or a collapse in the covered bond market—for
example in the case of a crisis in other Nordic countries—could lead to systemic liquidity shortfalls.

The impending conversion of Nordea Bank Finland (NBF) from a subsidiary to a
branch raises concerns. The plan by its parent to convert NBF—a systemically important bank that
accounts for about 30 percent of Finnish deposits and loans—into a branch in 2017 will bring the
bank under the supervision of the Swedish authorities and out of the direct purview of the ECB and
FIN-FSA. This raises issues regarding information sharing, supervisory responsibility and

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FINLAND

cooperation, macroprudential policy, depositor protection, and recovery and resolution planning.2
The ease with which liquidity can be transferred within the banking group poses a particular concern
for Finland. As the shift calls for further enhanced cross-border cooperation, the relevant Swedish,
Finnish, European, and other Nordic authorities have begun negotiating an agreement on the
treatment of systemic branches that should address the key issues.
27.
Progress has been made on the policy framework, but further efforts are needed to
prepare for potential future shocks. Since the 2010 FSAP update, the authorities have transposed
the new EU financial sector directives and regulations into national law, including the required
elements of CRD-IV and BRRD. In the process, a new macroprudential policy framework was also
introduced. As a result of the substantial changes in financial sector policies and the regulatory
approach since the crisis, bank and nonbank supervision and contingency planning have also
become more intense and intrusive (and, inevitably, thereby also more resource-intensive, stretching
supervisory resources thin, especially at the FIN-FSA). The progress notwithstanding, a number of
gaps remain and the FSAP made recommendations to address remaining issues (Annex III).
28.
Banking supervision needs to be further strengthened. To bolster the resilience of banks,
the FIN-FSA should ensure that banks’ internal risk models are calibrated to reflect periods of severe
stress (e.g., 1990s Nordic crisis). In this context, following the ECB’s current comprehensive review of
banks’ internal risk models, the ECB and FIN-FSA should ensure the effective ongoing monitoring of
these models. The oversight of banks’ liquidity positions in foreign currencies (and crossholdings of
covered bonds used as collateral) should also be intensified and liquidity stress tests for various time
horizons should be introduced. The FIN-FSA should stand ready to take supervisory action if
imbalances emerge. More generally, to facilitate adequate oversight the financial and human
resources allocated to banking supervision should be increased to reflect the growth in regulatory
complexity and supervision intensity.
29.
The macroprudential policy framework should be further enhanced. The authorities
should venture beyond the range of mandatory tools under CRD-IV in order to have appropriate
tools in place to address risks when they emerge. In this regard, the recent plans to add a systemic
risk capital buffer and a floor on risk weights for mortgages are welcome. Adding tools based on the
terms of loans (such as a limit on the maximum maturity) and borrowers’ debt service capacity (e.g.,
a loan-to-income cap) should also be considered. To strengthen the decision making framework, the
macroprudential policy mandate of the FIN-FSA should be more clearly defined. Also, a household
loan registry should be created to facilitate macroprudential policy analysis.
30.
Better coordinated contingency planning and deeper cross-border cooperation are
also key. To mitigate risks from regional linkages and the branchification of Nordea it will be key
that the pending agreement on systemic branches between the key supervisors provides for
sufficiently strong data sharing and supervisory cooperation provisions. It would also help to expand
the existing protocols with Nordic supervisors to include (i) formal region-wide sharing of

2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

FINLAND

supervisory data (including for branches), (ii) joint stress tests that take account of inter-linkages, (iii)
stronger collaboration between macroprudential authorities, and (iv) enhanced crisis management
cooperation and regular crisis simulation exercises. Domestically, the crisis management framework
can also be strengthened, including by formalizing inter-agency cooperation on crisis preparedness
and management and by expediting the resolution planning for systemically important banks.

Authorities’ Views
31.
The authorities broadly concurred with the FSAP findings. They welcomed the FSAP
analysis and recognized the identified vulnerabilities. They mostly agreed with recommendations to
bolster banking supervision, enhance the macroprudential policy toolkit, and deepen regional
cooperation. While endorsed by the FIN-FSA, some authorities were not convinced there is a need
to increase resources for domestic supervisors. They argued this would be at odds with the transfer
of supervisory responsibility for Finland’s largest banks to the ECB (and, in the case of Nordea, to
Sweden). The authorities agreed that the macroprudential policy toolkit should be expanded and
pointed to the planned addition of a systemic risk buffer and a floor for mortgage risk weights.
Some authorities, however, wanted to first assess the impact of these tools, before introducing
additional instruments. They also acknowledged the importance of deepening regional cooperation
and noted that an agreement between regional supervisors and the ECB on the treatment of
systemic branches should be finalized soon.

STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
The economy is emerging from recession, but the recovery will be slow and fragile.
Growth has turned positive again and the upturn is expected to continue and become more broad
based. However, with past engines of growth (Nokia, paper) significantly diminished, medium-term
growth is forecast to remain sluggish. The recovery is also vulnerable to substantial downside risks,
including weaker than expected global growth, uncertainty over post-Brexit arrangements, spillovers
from a shock in another Nordic country, and the possibility that in the short term fiscal adjustment
and labor market reforms weigh heavier on growth than anticipated.
33.
Reviving growth remains Finland’s preeminent challenge. This requires deep structural
reforms to help raise productivity and labor supply growth, well-calibrated fiscal adjustment to
restore long-term sustainability while minimizing negative short-term impacts on output, and strong
financial sector policies to safeguard financial stability.
34.
Recent progress on structural reforms is welcome but requires close follow up. The
Competitiveness Pact will reduce relative labor costs over the next few years. It could also make the
wage bargaining process more flexible at the firm level and help better align wages with
productivity. However, this outcome is not assured and the government should closely monitor the
pact’s implementation. The draft bills on the health and social services reform also constitute major
progress, but important elements of the new system remain unclear and should be developed
quickly. Given the complexity of the reform, clear and timely communication with stakeholders will

16

FINLAND

be critical and progress should be assessed regularly to identify any potential problems early on.
The recent reduction in the maximum duration of unemployment benefits is an important step and
should help increase activation.
35.
Further efforts are needed in other priority areas. There is substantial scope for product
market reforms, particularly in the retail sector and in state-dominated sectors such as rail and
postal services, that could increase competition and yield productivity gains, including through
downstream effects on the wider economy. Also, reversing cuts to public R&D spending and
creating stronger incentives for private R&D would promote innovation. Strengthening ALMPs and
further measures to increase affordable housing in urban areas would facilitate labor mobility.
36.
The near-term fiscal easing in return for reforms is appropriate, but more can be done
to protect growth. Structural fiscal adjustment is needed to close the sustainability gap but
potential adverse effects on the recovery need to be minimized. The easing of the fiscal stance in
2016-17, in return for structural reforms, is welcome in this regard. The economy could be further
supported by bringing forward the remaining growth package spending. The composition of fiscal
policy could also be made more growth-friendly, including by reallocating resources toward R&D
spending, ALMPs, and productive public investment, and away from poorly-targeted transfers and
tax expenditures. If growth disappoints, automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate fully.
More broadly, the decisive and effective implementation of the structural reform agenda remains
critical to ensuring long-term fiscal sustainability.
37.
While the banks are sound, financial sector policy frameworks should be further
strengthened to prepare for future risks. Substantial progress has been made with the
implementation of European legislation, participation in the banking union, and the introduction of
a new macroprudential policy framework. Bank supervision should be further strengthened,
however, including by ensuring ongoing effective monitoring of banks’ internal risk models and by
intensifying oversight of their liquidity positions. Resources allocated to supervision should be
bolstered to reflect the growth in regulatory complexity and supervision intensity. Enhancing the set
of macroprudential tools is also important. The plans to introduce a systemic risk buffer and a floor
on mortgage risk weights are welcome in this regard, but adding instruments based on borrower
and loan characteristics should also be considered. Inter-agency cooperation on national crisis
preparedness and management should be formalized.
38.
Regional supervisory cooperation should be further deepened. Ensuring strong data
sharing and supervisory cooperation provisions in the pending agreement on systemic branches
between the key supervisors will be critical to mitigate risks from close regional linkages and
Nordea’s conversion from subsidiary into a branch. It is also important to conduct joint stress tests
to capture regional interlinkages between banks, enhance joint crisis planning, run regular crisis
simulation exercises, and strengthen collaboration between Nordic macroprudential authorities.
39.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Finland occur on the standard
12-month cycle.

Large inward FDI flows in 2014 and 2015 are mainly due to large mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in those years such as Microsoft's
purchase of Nokia's handset business (worth 2.6 percent of GDP) and various M&A deals in the energy, manufacturing and shipbuilding
sectors worth more than 0.5 percentage points of GDP each.

Annex I. External Sector Assessment
1.
Structural shocks to key export industries caused the current account (CA) balance to
deteriorate sharply over 2007-12. Finland’s annual CA surplus averaged 5½ percent of GDP from
1998-2007, before falling nearly 6 percentage points of GDP from 2007 to 2012, driven by the
deterioration in the trade balance. Behind the fall in the trade balance was the simultaneous decline
of Nokia and the wood and paper industry. Since 2005, exports of electrical and optical equipment
have fallen 5½ percentage points of GDP, to around 3 percent of GDP in 2015. Meanwhile, wood
and paper exports have declined by about 2½ percentage points of GDP since 2002 to around 5½
percent of GDP currently. These structural shocks were exacerbated by weak global demand,
including a drop in exports to Russia, and a sharp rise in ULCs since 2007, due to a mix of rapid
wage increases during 2008–10 and falling productivity.
2.
The gradual dissipation of the drag from these shocks and an improvement in the
terms of trade helped shrink the CA deficit in 2015. The fall in commodity prices since 2013
contributed to a nearly 10 percent improvement in the

by 2021 due to continuing small CA deficits. Though the evolution of the stock of net FDI is
expected to continue to cause the NIIP to deteriorate, this is offset by the change in the stock of Net
Other Investments. Gross external debt is expected to grow more slowly than GDP, so the debt-toGDP ratio will decline slightly over 2015–21.

as the REER was assessed as undervalued, the CA balance would have been substantially lower than
the actual CA. For 2012-14, however, it appears the CA balance would have improved more quickly if
the REER had not been slightly overvalued, while for 2015 the actual CA balance is squarely in the
middle of the range of the estimated counterfactual CA balances.

Annex II. Debt Sustainability Analysis
Public debt rose to 63.6 percent of GDP in 2015, despite the fiscal deficit being better than expected,
and is forecast to be 65 percent of GDP in 2016. Under the baseline, debt is expected to peak just shy
of 67 percent of GDP in 2019 and to gradually decline thereafter. A contingent liability shock is the
stress scenario with the greatest impact on the public debt-to-GDP ratio. Under the assumptions of this
scenario, the debt ratio would peak to around 91 percent of GDP in 2020.

A.

Baseline Scenario

1.
Macroeconomic assumptions. Real GDP growth is expected to gradually pick-up, from
0.2 percent in 2015 to 0.9 percent this year and to 1.6 percent in 2021. GDP deflator inflation
remains around 1.5 percent in 2016–18, then rises to around 2.0 percent in 2019–21. Interest rates
are expected to remain subdued in the near-term due to QE and the pace of rates rises is likely to
be gradual when monetary policy eventually begins to normalize.
2.
Finland’s debt level breached 60 percent of GDP in 2015, which calls for using the
higher scrutiny framework. Though 2015 is the first year debt breached the 60 percent of GDP
threshold, it is projected to continue rising until 2019 and remain above 60 percent over the forecast
horizon. The Finnish government has announced fiscal consolidation plans to stabilize and begin
reducing the debt. The impact of these efforts on the debt ratio is partially undermined by the
expected negative growth impact of the measures, which is already incorporated in the baseline.
However, given the relatively long average maturity of Finnish public debt, the gross financing needs
remain below 15 percent of GDP every year in the baseline scenario. Moreover, the net debt ratio
remains negative due to the large stock of pension assets, though the net debt deteriorates more
than gross debt rises over time as net inflows to pension funds slowdown.
3.
Realism of baseline assumptions. The median forecast error for real GDP growth is
moderate at 0.58 percent (60th percentile). This is mostly driven by the large negative shock Finland
suffered in 2009 and the initial rapid rebound from the crisis. Median forecast errors for the primary
balance (0.33 percent of GDP) and inflation (0.22 percent) are relatively moderate as well.
4.
The forecast fiscal adjustment is not large in either absolute terms or by comparison to
other countries’ experiences. The 3-year average change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance
(CAPB) is around 0.5 percent of potential output. This places it firmly in the middle of the
distribution of CAPB adjustments across countries.

B.

Stress Testing

5.
Finland’s debt ratio would remain under 100 percent of GDP even in the worst shock
scenario examined. For the standard macro-fiscal stress scenarios, the debt ratio stays below
70 percent of GDP, except in the real GDP shock scenario. The contingent liability shock scenario
causes the largest debt ratio increase, to a peak of slightly above 91 percent of GDP in 2020.

34

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FINLAND

6.

The shock scenarios include:



Real GDP growth shock. Under this scenario, growth is one-standard deviation lower than the
baseline in 2017 and 2018 (i.e. 3.8 percentage points lower). This also causes inflation to be
around 90-100 basis points (bps) lower in these years and interest rates to be higher, by 67 bps
in 2017 and by 137 bps in 2018. The debt ratio peaks at just above 81 percent of GDP in 2019
and the gross financing need (GFN) peaks just below 20 percent of GDP in 2018.



Primary balance shock. In this scenario, the primary balance (PB) is 1.6 percentage points of
GDP lower than in the baseline in 2017 and 2018. The debt ratio is just below 70 percent of GDP
in 2018 and 2019, while the GFN peaks at just over 14 percent of GDP in 2018.



Real interest rate and real exchange rate shocks. Under the real interest rate shock scenario,
the real interest rate is 295 bps higher than the baseline over 2017-21. Despite this, debt peaks
just under 68 percent of GDP in 2020 and the GFN peaks below 13 percent of GDP. The impact
of the real exchange rate shock is even smaller, with the debt ratio only 1 percent of GDP higher
than in the baseline at its peak in 2019 and the GFN is practically the same as in the baseline.



Combined macro-fiscal shock. This scenario is a combination of the effects of the macro-fiscal
scenarios above. In this scenario, growth and inflation fall, the primary balance deteriorates, the
exchange rate depreciates, and interest rates rise relative to the baseline. The debt ratio peaks
around 84 percent of GDP in 2020, while the GFN hits an apex of 20 percent of GDP in 2018.



Contingent liability shock. A contingent liability shock could emerge in the event of a financial
crisis (e.g., as a result of spillovers from a housing market correction in another Nordic country
impacting Finland through financial, trade, and confidence channels). In this scenario, the
contingent liability shock in 2017 equals about 15 percent of GDP. Additionally, growth falls as in
the real GDP shock scenario and the real interest rate spikes 379 bps in 2017. As a result, the
debt ratio jumps by 20 percent of GDP between 2016 and 2017 and the GFN peaks at nearly 27
percent of GDP in 2017. The debt ratio peaks slightly above 91 percent of GDP in 2020.

1/ Public sector is defined as general government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over German bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Annex III. FSAP 2016 Key Recommendations
Table 1. Finland FSAP: Key Recommendations
Time*

Recommendations and Responsible Authorities
General
1.
Increase the FIN-FSA and FFSA’s financial and human resources in accordance with the
increase in regulatory complexity and supervision intensity in (i) prudential supervision of
banks (including systemic branches), (ii) prudential supervision of insurers, (iii) contingency
planning/crisis management, (iv) macroprudential policy analysis, and (v) investment funds
and their managers.
2.
Expand cooperation arrangements with other Nordic supervisors to include (i) formal regionwide sharing of supervisory data and coordinated inspections, including foreign branches and
cross-border management of investment funds, (ii) conduct Nordic stress tests, (iii) strengthen
collaboration with macroprudential authorities, and (iv) enhanced CPCM cooperation on
systemically important branches and regular crisis simulation exercises.
3.
Strengthen legal protection for staff of all financial oversight agencies.
Risk Analysis
4.
Ensure banks’ Internal Ratings Based models are calibrated to reflect severe stress.
5.
Intensify monitoring of banks’ liquidity positions in foreign currencies and crossholdings of
covered bonds used as collateral. Perform liquidity stress tests for various time horizons and
stand ready to take supervisory action if imbalances emerge.
Banking Supervision
6.
Amend law to grant the FSA full Pillar 2 powers for decisions on capital and liquidity
requirements and other supervisory measures.
7.
Ensure effective ongoing monitoring of banks’ internal risk models following the upcoming
SSM comprehensive review (TRIM project).
Macroprudential policy framework
8.
Clearly define a macroprudential policy mandate of the FIN-FSA beyond the measures
approved in laws.
9.
Create a household loan registry.
10. Introduce a systemic risk buffer and a loan-to-income limit.
11. Finalize the plan to introduce floors for the risk-weights used in internal models.
Contingency Planning and Crisis Management
12. Formalize inter-agency cooperation on crisis preparedness and management at the national
level, possibly through an expanded mandate for the FFSA Advisory Council.
13. Under the oversight of the FFSA Advisory Council, ensure agency-specific and national
financial crisis planning.
14. Expedite resolution planning for systemic financial institutions.
15. Define strategies for liquidity assistance to banks in resolution and introduce an
indemnification arrangement for ELA losses if incurred by the BoF.
Non-banks
16. Upgrade legislation to cover the supervisory actions and any other measures required in the
event of pension insurer or fund distress and if resolution becomes necessary.
17. Ensure adequacy of action plans for life insurers to meet Solvency II requirements, including
by conducting regular stress testing under adverse scenarios.
18. Monitor fund managers’ risk management processes, increase the use of supervisory data to
analyze risks, and improve FIN-FSA’s capability to conduct market surveillance.

Annex IV. Product Market Reforms, R&D Spending, and FirmLevel Productivity in Finland1
1.
Finland has suffered a unique combination of structural and cyclical shocks since 2007
and boosting productivity growth is crucial to restarting growth. Average labor productivity
growth has dropped from about 2½ percent per annum during 2000-07 to negative territory during
2007-14, mainly reflecting the decline in TFP growth in manufacturing and public services, as well as
low productivity growth in private services.
2.
There is scope to further ease product market regulation and promote innovation.
Despite the substantial progress that Finland has made in deregulating its product markets since the
1990s, OECD indicators of product market regulation at the sector level indicate that several sectors
(such as rail, retail, postal services, and airline services) remain more regulated when compared with
best practice in peer countries. Widespread
state ownership and extensive regulations in
these sectors may be impeding market entry
and competition, thereby dampening private
sector dynamics and holding back productivity
growth. In addition, there have been
substantial reductions in research and
development (R&D) spending by both the
private and public sectors–which are down by
over 10 percent in real terms since 2007. This
may also weaken opportunities for future
productivity growth.
3.
An extensive firm-level dataset is employed to estimate the productivity payoffs of
product market reforms and R&D spending. The Orbis database compiled by Bureau Van Dijk
provides financial data at the firm level on value added, number of employees, and fixed assets,
among other variables. We focus on firms in the nonfinancial private sector based on a final sample
of about 78,000 firm-year observations for the period between 2005 and 2014. Different measures
of firm productivity are calculated for the analysis, including both labor productivity (i.e., real value
added per worker) and two measures of total factor productivity (TFP) using the OLS residual
methodology and the Levinsohn-Petrin methodology, respectively.
4.
We measure the burden from PMR on all sectors in the Finnish economy using inputoutput linkages between regulated and downstream sectors. As a measure of product market
regulation (PMR), we use the OECD indicators for seven network sectors as well as retail and
professional services. Regulation in those industries can affect firms in other sectors of the economy
(i.e., the “downstream” sectors) through their use of upstream inputs. For example, a manufacturer

who relies extensively on the use of railway and postal services would bear a burden from regulation
in the railway and postal services sectors, either through paying higher prices or enduring a lack or
sub-optimal quality of services. We call this indirect burden from regulation upstream PMR and
measure it by combining the PMR indicator with the intensity of upstream input usage calculated
from Finland’s input-output table for the year 2013.
5.
Panel regression results suggest that regulation in upstream sectors has a significant
negative impact on firm productivity in downstream sectors. The results are robust to multiple
specifications and different productivity measures. Firms operating in sectors that rely more heavily
on inputs from the regulated industries are likely to be less productive than others. Our results also
suggest that for network PMR the impact on downstream productivity is more pronounced for large
firms than for SMEs. For example, a one standard deviation reduction in network PMR is associated
with higher TFP by 2.1 percent for large firms, but only by 1.1 percent for SMEs.2 Meanwhile, the
economic significance of the effect of regulation in retail trade on productivity is higher than for
network regulation. However, the impact there is only significant for SMEs, with a one standard
deviation reduction in retail PMR implying about 10 percent higher TFP, whereas there is no
evidence that large firms are affected. This possibly reflects the reliance of large firms on wholesale
markets instead of retail trade.
6.
We also find evidence that R&D plays a significant role in large firms’ productivity.
Sector level R&D expenditure from the OECD database is used to gauge the impact of R&D
spending on firm productivity. The elasticity of productivity with respect to R&D spending for large
firms in Finland is estimated to be about 0.08. That is, a 10 percent increase in the sector’s R&D
expenditure is associated with a 0.8 percent improvement in firm’s productivity.3 This magnitude is
near the median of estimates in the literature − at about 0.10, and is comparable with findings from
cross-country studies using a sample of non-G7 OECD countries. The productivity elasticity for large
firms is remarkably stable across different productivity measures. Neither of the estimated
elasticities is statistically significant for SMEs, however. This could be due to the industry-level
measure of R&D spending not capturing the private returns for SMEs to the extent that the measure
is dominated by large firms’ spending.
7.
These results suggest that further product market reforms and maintaining strong
government support for R&D could help boost productivity growth.

2

To calculate the average effect on firm productivity from reducing Upstream PMR, we keep input use intensity
across all sectors constant at the average level.
3

Given that the spillover effect of R&D could reach beyond the sector in which it is invested, the overall returns of
R&D, including both private and social returns, could be much larger than the estimated firm-level gains here.

Statement by Mr. Kimmo Virolainen,
Alternate Executive Director for Finland
November 23, 2016
On behalf of the Finnish authorities would like to convey their gratitude for the
comprehensive and candid discussions during the Article IV consultation and the
FSAP mission. The authorities find the analysis in the reports of great value and
useful for assessing progress of key reforms adopted in the government’s ambitious
program for reviving economic growth and stabilizing public finances, and for
maintaining a well-functioning and stable financial system. The authorities’ views
have been accurately documented and they broadly concur with staff’s analysis and
policy recommendations.
Recent Economic Developments, Outlook and Risks
According to the Ministry of Finance, the Finnish economy is expected to grow
1.1 percent in 2016. Over the next two years, growth will hover around 1 percent,
and cumulative growth for the whole outlook period will reach no more than some
3 percent. Despite the slight rebound, the outlook for Finland’s immediate future is
one of continued economic weakness. The 2018 forecast for the GDP will still be
some 2 percent lower than in 2008, and industrial output will be around one-fifth
lower than 10 years ago. Export performance will remain weaker than global trade,
and Finland will continue to lose market share in world trade. These developments
are well described in the staff report and the selected issues papers.
Nominal earnings will rise by just over 1 percent in 2016 and, with agreement
between the social partners on a Competitiveness Pact, the growth rate of wage and
salary earnings will slow and employers’ social security contributions will decrease
in 2017. Finnish competitiveness will improve in comparison with Sweden and
Germany, for instance.
The risks for the international economy remain skewed to the downside. Uncertainty
is expected to continue in the financial markets. Domestic risks are related to the
development of the real economy and the labor market. Economic growth in Finland
will continue to remain slower than in peer countries over the next couple of years.
The Finnish economy will be sensitive to negative shocks, and the growth rate will
not be sufficient to bring a significant improvement in the labor market. The
Government’s employment target will be difficult to reach under the conditions
forecasted, and the growth of long-term and structural unemployment will scar the
economy for a long time to come. The projected economic scenario will not
significantly improve the health of public finances in Finland.
Fiscal Policy
General government finances will remain in deficit till the end of the decade. Slow
economic growth is not generating enough tax revenue to finance public

expenditure, which is increasing with population aging. For these reasons, public
sector debt has grown rapidly for several years, and the same trend is set to continue,
albeit at a slowing pace, in the years ahead. The central government deficit is
expected to shrink to less than half the current figure by the end of the decade. The
deficit in local government is also projected to decrease over t h e forecast horizon.
However, the growing demand for social and healthcare services as a result of
population aging will cause mounting expenditure pressure in the local government
sector over the longer term. The combined deficit of central and local government
will remain high throughout the outlook period.
The deficit will remain under the EU Stability and Growth Pact’s 3 percent of GDP
reference value limit throughout the forecast horizon. The public debt-to-GDP ratio
has climbed to o v e r 60 percent. The Government has set itself the target of halting
the growth of the public debt-to-GDP ratio by the end of the government term.
Fiscal policy objectives include immediate savings, promoting efficiency in public
administration and service production, and steps to improve the conditions for
economic growth. The immediate savings measures outlined in the Government
Program are entered in the central government spending limits and included in the
State Budget. These measures account for some EUR 4 billion of total targeted
savings (of EUR 10 billion to cover the entire sustainability gap). The remaining
EUR 6 billion of savings depend upon restructuring measures designed to strengthen
public finances and to increase employment.
Preparations for the social and healthcare reform are proceeding according to plan.
Together with other measures designed to promote efficiency in public
administration, the reforms have the potential to strengthen public finances by EUR
4 billion, but only in the longer term.
Structural Issues
Structural reforms will continue on several fronts, most notably in social and
healthcare services
The authorities concur with staff that deep structural reforms are critical for the
revival of economic growth. When the Government took office in 2015, it
committed to an ambitious reform agenda that is aimed to strengthen
competitiveness and to raise the long-term growth potential of the economy. Policies
to allow more room for competition in regulated sectors and to reduce labor costs
have already been adopted. Further reforms are ongoing and under preparation
aiming at improving the functioning of labor and product markets.
The most significant reform ever taken by the Finnish authorities is the social and
healthcare services reform (SOTE) that is targeted to bring estimated savings of
EUR 3 billion from more efficient operations and administration, as well as higher
productivity of services owing to increased competition.

The first phase of the SOTE reform, concerning the establishment of new regional
governance structures of 18 counties that are responsible for organizing the services,
is undergoing the legislative process and a final proposal will be submitted to the
Parliament by the end of this year. All of the services covered in the reform can be
provided by public, private and the so called “third sector” service providers. At
present, the relevant s t a k e h o l d e r s , such as current service providers, have already
submitted their opinions on the Government’s draft reform bills. A draft proposal on
the second phase of the reform, dealing with freedom of choice and financing, will
be submitted to the Parliament next year.
Labor market reforms
Raising the employment rate. The government’s goal is to raise the labor
participation rate from 68 percent in 2015 to 72 percent by 2019, implying an
increase in the number of employed by 110,000. Demographics in Finland are
limiting labor supply. That said, the government has already tightened allowance
criteria for tertiary education in order to promote faster graduation. The pension
reforms have already raised the effective retirement age and the latest changes taking
effect in 2017 will continue this trend. Changes in the maternity and child care
benefits are also geared towards raising the labor supply of women of childbearing
age.
The Competitiveness Pact is estimated to cut unit labor costs by 4.2 percent
(including the wage freeze) from 2019 onwards. As a consequence, the Ministry of
Finance estimates an increase in employment by some 35,000 people.
More effective measures to tackle high youth unemployment. The authorities agree
that more effective measures are needed to tackle the high level of youth
unemployment. The introduction of an apprentice system has gained support,
provided that wages below minimum level during the training period can be agreed
upon. A youth guarantee agreement aims to secure vocational training for all young
people who have left secondary school and are not employed.
More effective public employment services. Public employment services are
undergoing wide-ranging reforms. It has already been agreed, in connection with the
SOTE reform, that public employment services will be reorganized into the 18 new
regional governance structures effective in 2019. Due to increased digitalization,
currently over 80 percent of jobseekers use online services. The groundwork is
underway for a common platform and a national database for recruiting agencies and
others providing online employment services. Moreover, there will be regular
follow-up on the progress of the adopted individual employment plans, and in cases
of non-implementation, there would be sanctions in the legislated benefits.
Removal of the incentive trap. The Government is working on a solution to the
incentive trap by preparing changes to the benefit system whereby a combination of
tighter unemployment benefits and transfer payments would make it more attractive

to accept employment rather than remain unemployed. This would help increase
employment particularly for low skilled labor.
Active labor market policies. Past experience of ALMPs, in particular for securing
longer term or permanent employment for low skilled and older unemployed,
suggests that they have not been effective. The authorities concur with staff that new
activation policies need to be considered.
Collective wage bargaining under scrutiny. As agreed in the new Competitiveness
Pact, further discussions for reforming the highly centralized wage bargaining
process have been ongoing for some time, albeit at a slow pace. The goal is to align
wage growth with productivity growth by making the bargaining process more
flexible and increasing competition in the labor market, resulting in higher
productivity of labor. The next wage bargaining round will be conducted at industry
level in 2017.
Enhancing labor mobility. Job openings are increasing mostly in growth centers and
measures to enhance labor mobility need to be stepped up. A major obstacle is the
lack of affordable housing in growth centers, particularly in the Helsinki
metropolitan area. Most Finns live in owner-occupied housing due to the lack of a
well-functioning rental housing market. On a positive note, housing construction in
the Helsinki Metropolitan area is increasing, but it will take time to meet the current
demand for affordable housing. The Government and local authorities are taking
measures to deal with the housing situation in growth centers by adjusting zoning
rules and building regulations.
Product market reforms
The authorities concur with staff on the importance of product market reforms to
enhance competition and operational efficiency. The government has submitted a
new transport market regulation proposal, concerning passenger and goods transport,
to the Parliament this fall. The Transport Code allows more competition in the taxi
market through deregulation and elimination of taxi quotas. Opening railway
passenger transportation for competition is currently under discussion. The
authorities agree that there is room for more deregulation in the retail sector and in
postal services.
Research & Development and Productivity
The Research & Development (R & D) expenditure peaked in 2010 at 3.8 percent
(share in GDP) and has since fallen to about 2.8 percent. The Government, in the
context of the fiscal plan, encourages more efficient use of the current resources.
Moreover, the Government has turned the focus more on promoting the utilization of
R & D results, rather than increasing resources to R & D activity per se. Funding for
seed and start-up companies with international growth potential will be increased
reflecting the idea of application of knowledge rather than creation of knowledge.

Financial Sector Stability
According to staff, the Finnish financial sector is stable and robust to shocks, and the
banking system is profitable and well capitalized. The authorities broadly concur
with staff’s main findings and with most of the FSAP recommendations.
Almost all of the recommendations from the previous FSAP in 2010 have been
implemented, including improvements in financial stability analysis and monitoring
of the mortgage market in particular. The top-down stress testing framework has
been enhanced and a new regime for bank resolution has been set up. Moreover,
the effectiveness of cross-border supervision has been enhanced through the
establishment of the SSM and a Nordic-Baltic MoU, and the FIN-FSA’s sanctioning
powers have been improved. All of these measures have contributed to strengthening
the supervisory and regulatory framework.
Vulnerabilities still remain in the financial system, such as a highly concentrated
banking sector relying heavily on wholesale and external funding. Two foreign
owned banks have a significant role in the financial sector giving rise to large and
complex cross-border Nordic exposures and risks of adverse spillover effects.
Current low interest rates pose challenges for both the banking and insurance sector.
The household debt to disposable income ratio has risen quite rapidly during the past
few years and currently stands at 125 percent. The authorities recognize this trend,
but also note that the macroprudential measures already taken, particularly a loan-tocollateral cap on housing loans, are aimed at curbing excessive rise in household
debt.
The authorities concur with the recommendation that banking supervision should be
further strengthened. Due to significant changes in the supervisory structure and
environment, this needs to be considered in the context of the Single Supervisory
Mechanism and regional supervisory cooperation. The authorities also agree that
regional supervisory cooperation, data sharing as well as systemic branch
supervision need to be enhanced.
The authorities also largely agree with staff’s assessment on the macroprudential
policy framework. There is agreement to further enhance the framework by adding
macroprudential instruments, and work is already ongoing to include the systemic
risk buffer into the toolbox. Additional instruments shall be considered based on the
review of the EU legislation, as well as further analytical work by the authorities
assessing experiences from other countries. Staff’s suggestion that the FIN-FSA’s
macroprudential policy mandate should be clarified and strengthened in the law is
not fully shared by the authorities, some of which consider the existing legislation
adequate.

Staff’s advice to formalize the inter-agency strategy on contingency planning and
crisis management is well noted. Work to this effect is already ongoing and there is
confidence that the arrangements for crisis management and resolution can be
implemented timely given well-functioning and close institutional cooperation.
The authorities will use the FSAP findings and recommendations when considering
policies and new instruments in order to maintain a well-functioning and stable
financial system.
