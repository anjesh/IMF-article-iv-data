IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with Guyana

On May 9, 2016 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Guyana.
Real economic activity expanded by 3 percent in 2015. Lower export commodity prices and
budget delays weighted down on activity, while the opening of two new large gold mines helped
support growth. Consumer prices contracted by 1.8 percent in the twelve months ending in
December 2015, reflecting lower import prices and a one-off increase in VAT exemptions. The
overall non-financial public sector deficit narrowed to 0.2 percent of GDP in 2015 from
5.7 percent in 2014. Despite the slowdown, revenues as a share of GDP increased by
4.2 percentage points, buoyed by fuel excises (which were raised as the international oil price
declined), and one-off increases in non-tax revenues. Expenditures as a share of GDP declined
by 1 percentage point, driven by a 30 percent decline in capital expenditures due to electionrelated budget delays. The current account deficit narrowed from 10.8 percent of GDP in 2014 to
4.6 percent in 2015, as the steep decline in international oil prices more than offset lower
commodity export prices. Gross international reserves stood at 3.6 months of imports at end2015. Bank capital adequacy ratios appear comfortable (averaging 23.9 percent as of December
2015), but nonperforming loans have increased to 11.5 percent of loans at end-December 2015
from 6 percent at end-December 2013.
The macroeconomic outlook is generally positive for 2016 and the medium-term. Growth is
projected at 4 percent in 2016, supported by public investment and two new large gold mines.
Twelve-month inflation is expected to remain low at around 2.1 percent by year-end. The 2016
budget reverses the fiscal stance, envisaging an overall deficit of 5.5 percent of GDP, driven by a
4 and a 2.1 percentage point increase in the shares of capital and current spending in GDP,
respectively. Revenues are projected to remain broadly flat. Lower oil prices improve the

outlook for the current account deficit, which is projected to remain at about 4½ percent of GDP
in 2016, financed by investment inflows and donor-supported investment. Reserve cover is
projected to increase to 3.8 months of imports at end-2016.
Executive Board Assessment2
The Executive Directors commended the resilience of Guyana’s economy, which continues to
grow despite global headwinds. They noted, however, that challenges and risks remain, and
encouraged the authorities to build up fiscal buffers, implement structural reforms, and
strengthen the financial sector. Directors welcomed the positive medium term outlook
underpinned by an environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive growth strategy.
Directors welcomed the marked improvement in the current account, while noting that Guyana
remains vulnerable to changes in commodity prices due to its dependence on imported oil and
the concentration of exports on a few commodities. They noted that the exchange rate appears to
be broadly in line with fundamentals, and underscored that exchange rate flexibility should play
a larger role in helping Guyana cope with external shocks.
Directors stressed the importance of fiscal consolidation in order to safeguard debt sustainability
and preserve fiscal and external buffers while maintaining growth momentum. They
recommended that fiscal consolidation efforts focus on moderating the growth of current
expenditures, in particular transfers to public enterprises, so as to preserve space for public
investment while protecting social spending. On the revenue side, efforts to broaden the revenue
base and strengthen tax administration were encouraged. Directors welcomed the efforts to
reform public enterprises, notably the sugar and electricity companies, in order to improve
efficiency and reduce reliance on government support.
Directors encouraged the authorities to move toward greater economic diversification by
advancing reforms to promote competition and improve the business climate. Given that the high
costs of electricity, transportation and telecommunications have been longstanding impediments
to growth, they supported well targeted public investment and liberalizing reforms to lower costs
and raise productivity.
Directors noted that the largely concessional nature of debt contributes to resilience and should
be preserved. They commended the authorities for taking a cautious approach in factoring in
possible future oil income in their medium term fiscal plans.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3
Directors concurred that the monetary policy stance should remain accommodative, as lower
prices for imported goods, including fuel, continue to ease inflationary pressures.
While noting that the banking sector appears well capitalized, Directors recommended
heightened vigilance given the rise in nonperforming loans, as well as tightening of provisioning
requirements and close monitoring of related party lending. They looked forward to a more
granular analysis of financial sector challenges by the upcoming FSAP mission.
Directors stressed the importance of strengthening the anti-money laundering and combating the
financing of terrorism framework. They noted that remaining deficiencies amplify the
vulnerability to de risking, which will require greater international effort to address. They urged
the prompt implementation of the action plan agreed with the Financial Action Task Force.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Background. While economic activity was supported by large new mining investments,
growth slowed to 3 percent in 2015, reflecting delayed budget implementation and lower
commodity prices. Inflation is expected to remain low. The decline in oil prices narrowed
the current account deficit. The authorities plan to stimulate growth through increased
public investment in 2016 and over the medium-term.
Focus of the discussions. Discussions centered on strategies to maintain fiscal and debt
sustainability while boosting growth, and on strengthening financial sector resilience.
Key policy recommendations:


Preserving macroeconomic stability. The prospect of large fiscal deficits
throughout the medium-term will lead to a sizable increase in public debt.
Sustainability concerns are mitigated by the largely concessional nature of debt, but
fiscal consolidation is needed to stabilize the debt ratio. To preserve fiscal and
external buffers, staff recommended tightening fiscal policy by reining in current
expenditure and transfers to public enterprises. Monetary policy should remain
supportive. Exchange rate flexibility should play a larger role in offsetting the effects of
commodity price shocks and preserving external reserves.



Strengthening financial sector resilience. Heightened vigilance is warranted due to
increases in nonperforming loans, and staff recommended tightening: (i) provisioning
requirements; (ii) large exposure limits: (iii) restrictions on related lending; and (iv)
loan classification rules. Staff also stressed the importance of an AML/CFT framework
that is fully compliant with international standards.



Structural policies to raise productivity and support strong and inclusive growth.
Reforms to the sugar sector, renewable energy projects, improvements to the business
climate, and increased investment in infrastructure and human capital can remove
structural bottlenecks, make growth more sustainable, broad based, and its benefits
spread more widely.

BACKGROUND
1.
Guyana has experienced a decade of uninterrupted growth. Nevertheless, per capita
income remains the lowest in the English-speaking Caribbean and the debt burden, though low
by Caribbean standards, remains elevated (Figure 1). The economy depends on the export of six
commodities—sugar, gold, bauxite, shrimp, timber, and rice—which represent nearly 40 percent
of GDP. In 2015, Exxon Mobil made a significant oil discovery off the coast of Guyana, on the
order of 700 million barrels. Commercial production is not expected within the medium-term.
Public debt reached 186 percent of GDP at the HIPC completion point at end-2003. In March
2007, the IDB, Guyana's principal donor, canceled its debt of nearly US$470 million (21 percent of
GDP), which, along with other debt relief, brought the debt-to-GDP ratio to 65 percent by 2009.
A strong commitment to macroeconomic stability reduced debt to 49 percent of GDP as of 2015.
2.
The opposition won the May 2015 general elections leading to the first change of
government in 23 years and the second since independence in 1966. The government faced
a legislative impasse after the ruling People’s Progressive Party/Civic (PPP/C) lost its
parliamentary majority and faced a no-confidence vote. The National Assembly was suspended
in November 2014 and dissolved three months later. Elections in May 2015 were won by a
coalition of A Partnership for National Unity-Alliance for Change (APNU-AFC), which formed a
majority government. The political stand-off and subsequent elections significantly delayed
budget implementation.
3.
The authorities have an ambitious investment strategy for environmentally
sustainable and socially inclusive growth. Improvements in transportation and
telecommunication infrastructure and renewable energy projects aim to boost productivity,
integrate remote regions, facilitate economic diversification, and ease key impediments to
growth. If well implemented, these investments can stimulate economic activity, provide a
durable increase in competitiveness, and ensure that the benefits of growth are more broadly
distributed.
4.
Since the completion of the PRGF in 2006, the authorities’ policies have been
broadly in line with the Fund advice. Initially, technical assistance focused on VAT
implementation, public financial management, and statistics. These reforms contributed to the
fiscal consolidation efforts that have helped reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio. In recent years the
Fund has recommended further fiscal consolidation to help reduce the debt and rebuild policy
buffers. The authorities view their fiscal stance as consistent with their objective of reducing the
significant infrastructure deficit and addressing unmet social needs. The 2013 Article IV
recommended ensuring that the Amaila Falls Hydroelectric Project remains financially and
economically viable. The authorities are reviewing that project. As it may no longer be pursued, it
is not considered in the baseline projections. The Fund also recommended boosting the
efficiency of public enterprises. The authorities are pursuing these efforts, notably with regard to
the electricity and sugar companies.

5.
The most recent safeguards assessment of the Bank of Guyana (BOG) was
completed in May 2007. It made recommendations to strengthen key functions, including
internal audit and reserves management, which were implemented at the time. The BOG is
audited by the Audit Office of Guyana and the audit reports state compliance with international
standards. The audited financial statements are published.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
6.
Guyana’s economy continues to grow, despite headwinds. The decline in global
commodity prices affected main commodity sectors. The sharp decline in public investment
spending due to the delayed budget and the slowdown in the commodity sectors had a knockon effect on the non-tradable sector, especially construction, wholesale and retail trade.
Notwithstanding those shocks, real GDP grew by 3 percent in 2015, down from 3.8 percent in
2014 and an average of 5 percent during 2010-13 (Text Figure). Growth was boosted by the
opening of two new large gold mines in the last quarter of 2015 (in their absence, growth in
2015 would have been 2.3 percent). Consumer prices contracted by about 1.8 percent (y/y) as of
December 2015, reflecting lower import prices and a one-off increase in goods exempted from
the VAT.

The steep decline in international oil prices narrowed the 2015 current account
deficit, while the balance of payments deficit remained due to weaker capital inflows.
Lower prices reduced the cost of oil and fuel imports, which more than offset the effect of lower
commodity export prices and narrowed the current account deficit to an estimated 4.6 percent in
2015 from 10.8 percent in 2014 and 13.3 percent in 2013. The overall balance was broadly
unchanged, reflecting lower disbursements from multilateral donors and from the PetroCaribe
agreement. 1 Despite a loss of international reserves, the lower oil import bill allowed reserve
coverage of imports to remain at about 3½ months as of end-2015.

Venezuela provides concessional long-term financing for oil importers in the region through PetroCaribe
agreements. In July 2015, Venezuela suspended the agreement with Guyana due to revival of a longstanding
border dispute.

8.
The fiscal balance improved in 2015, partly reflecting one-off factors. The overall
non-financial public sector (NFPS) deficit narrowed to 0.2 percent of GDP in 2015 from
5.7 percent in 2014, and 3.6 percent in 2013. The primary balance switched from a 4.8 percent
deficit in 2014 to a 0.8 percent surplus in 2015. Despite the economic slowdown, revenue as a
share of GDP increased by 4.2 percentage points, buoyed by fuel excises (which were raised as
the international oil price declined), and a one-off increase in non-tax revenue from statutory
agencies.2 Capital expenditures declined by nearly 30 percent compared to 2014, reflecting the
late start of the public sector investment program. Transfers to the loss-making state-owned
sugar company (GuySuCo) remain a drag on fiscal performance.
9.
The 2016 budget reverses the 2015 contractionary fiscal stance. The authorities plan
to accelerate the implementation of the public sector investment program and an early budget
was submitted to parliament, which envisages an increase in total NFPS expenditure of about
6 percent of GDP. This increase is mainly driven by a 4 percentage point increase in the share of
capital spending in GDP. While this increase may seem large compared to the 2015 low base,
due to the delayed budget, it corresponds to a 1.5 percentage point of GDP increase in the share
relative to 2014. The share of current expenditure in GDP will also rise by 2.1 percentage points in
comparison to 2015, reflecting a 1.5 percentage point of GDP increase in transfers as well as
increases in wages and goods and services. To expedite project approval and execution, the
authorities have streamlined the procurement process by updating the threshold values on
projects that can be approved by individual agencies.
10.
The budget projects a moderate increase in revenue supported by improved tax
administration. Revenues are projected to remain broadly stable as a share of GDP in 2016.
Some of the measures envisaged will lower revenues, notably exemptions from excise taxes for
newer vehicles, a 10 percent increase in the threshold for nontaxable income, and a decline in
fuel excise taxes amounting to a 10 percent reduction in gasoline prices. The revenue decline is
expected to be partially offset by a planned removal of some discretionary tax exemptions. The
government also intends to introduce measures to improve tax efficiency, enforcement and
compliance in order to boost revenue.
11.
The monetary policy stance has remained accomodative, but growth in broad
monetary aggregates decelerated in line with the slowdown in economic activity. The Bank
of Guyana (BoG)’s monetary policy goals are price stability and provision of adequate liquidity for
credit expansion and economic growth. The BoG targets broad money, and manages liquidity
through open market operations. Growth in broad money (y/y) slowed to 1.5 percent in 2015
from 5.2 percent in 2014. Credit had grown at a vigorous pace but still broadly in line with
economic growth and financial deepening. Credit to the private sector expanded at a slower
pace of 6.2 percent in 2015, down from 9.1 percent in 2014, mainly on account of reduced

In 2015, the government transferred large excess cash balances from statutory agencies (the Guyana Geology
and Mines Commission and the National Frequency Management Unit) and the Lotto Fund to its account,
amounting to about 1.4 percent of GDP, and resulting in a large one-off increase in non-tax revenues.

lending to businesses. Base money grew by 9.1 percent in 2015, driven mainly by banks’
increasing excess reserves. The benchmark 91-day Treasury bill rate increased to 1.92 percent at

international oil prices tempered
demand for foreign exchange in
2015 and the exchange rate versus the U.S. dollar remained broadly unchanged, despite limited

12.
Despite rising nonperforming loans (NPLs) and declining profitability, bank capital
adequacy ratios (CARs) appear comfortable. NPLs increased to 11.5 percent of loans at endDecember 2015 from 6 percent at end-December 2013, and are concentrated in the business
sector. Returns on assets fell from 2.7 percent at end-2014 to 0.6 percent at end-December 2015.
The effects of higher NPLs on bank CARs have been cushioned by slower accumulation of
risk-weighted assets, delayed provisioning of NPLs, and strong noninterest income (fees and
commissions). CARs have remained well above the 8 percent regulatory minimum (averaging
23.9 percent as of December 2015). However, provisioning has not kept pace with NPLs,
declining from 69.5 percent of NPLs at end-December 2013 to 38 percent at end-December 2015
(regulations only require 20 percent provisioning when the loan is secured by collateral). Related
party lending is a source of vulnerability.
13.
De-risking by global banks has been limited so far. Close to half of Guyana’s
correspondent banking providers originate from the Caribbean. Only two of Guyana’s banks have
experienced terminations on their corresponding bank relationships, which took place prior to
2013. However, there is a concern that such losses could occur with short notice. Two of the
largest banks are foreign-owned, which may attenuate their vulnerability to de-risking.
14.
The parliament passed amended AML/CFT legislation but further actions are
needed to address remaining deficiencies. Guyana has taken steps toward improving AML/CFT
compliance, including by enacting the AML/CFT Amendment Act in 2015. Nevertheless, the FATF
determined that strategic deficiencies remained, notably implementing an adequate framework
for freezing assets, establishing an operational financial intelligence unit, and performing
effective customer due diligence. In response, an amended AML/CFT bill was passed on
December 2015, which included redefining ‘beneficial ownership’ and requiring customer identity
verification when establishing a business relationship, among other measures. However, the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GUYANA

framework continues to fall short of the action plan agreed with the FATF, including the judicial
discretion in freezing assets.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
15.
Growth is projected to increase, supported by public investment and gold output.
In the baseline scenario, growth increases to 4 percent in 2016, supported by the recovery in
public investment and the level effect from the gold mines that began production in late 2015,
and are projected to contribute 1.7 percentage points to growth. Higher than expected gold
output may lead to even higher growth. With the outlook for commodity exports subdued,
medium-term prospects hinge upon productivity-enhancing reforms to diversify the economy,
improve the business environment, and increase private investment. Growth is projected at
3.8 percent during 2017–21—broadly in line with staff’s assessment of potential growth—as
public investment continues to provide stimulus and alleviate key infrastructure bottlenecks,
which should also facilitate economic diversification. Lower electricity prices, and other mining
projects should also help sustain growth once gold production in the two new mines stabilizes.
Inflation turns positive in 2016 but remains modest due to lower prices for imported goods,
including fuel.
16.
The external balance will improve in line with relatively low fuel prices and rising
commodity export prices. Despite the subdued outlook for rice and other non-gold commodity
exports, lower oil prices will improve the outlook for the underlying current account deficit, which
is projected to remain at 4½ percent of GDP in 2016.3 The terms of trade are expected to
improve further in 2016, then remain broadly constant over the medium term. The revival of a
long-standing border dispute with Venezuela led to the cessation of in-kind trade of rice-for-oil
at above-market rice prices in July 2015, which will lead to a decrease in the value of rice exports
by about 2 percent of GDP. The current account deficit is projected to increase in the mediumterm, averaging about 7.2 percent of GDP in 2017–21, financed by the resumption of investment
inflows and donor-supported investment. The overall balance is expected to improve in the
medium term, leading to an increase in reserve cover from 3½ months at end-2015 to about 5
months at end-2021.
17.
A sustained expansionary fiscal policy will lead to an increase in public debt. The
authorities indicated that the fiscal deficit is expected to remain between 5 and 6 percent of GDP
over the medium term. Under that fiscal stance, domestic financing needs will remain high, and
the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to rise from about 49 percent in 2015 to 60 percent by 2021.
While the risk of debt distress is estimated to remain moderate in the medium-term, it will
continue to rise in the absence of fiscal consolidation, which is needed to stabilize the debt-toGDP ratio. Adverse growth and exchange rate shocks can worsen the debt dynamics.

Approximately $40 million in grants from the European Union are projected for 2016, which will improve the
current account.

18.
Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside (see RAM, Table 8). The prices of
Guyana’s commodity exports tend to remain depressed with sluggish global growth, a continued
slowdown in China, and a strong U.S. dollar. Heightened financial stability risks stemming from
the slowdown in domestic activity and the large increase in NPLs warrant close monitoring.
De-risking remains a major source of concern in Guyana, and throughout the Caribbean. On the
upside, higher than expected gold production could increase output and exports. And sooner
than expected development of Guyana’s recently-discovered oil deposits would strengthen its
energy security and broaden its sources of fiscal and export earnings.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Fiscal Policy
Discussions centered on strategies to maintain fiscal and debt sustainability while boosting growth.
The expansionary fiscal policy stance is depleting buffers that should be saved for the event of
adverse external shocks. The growth in current expenditures should be moderated, the tax base
broadened, and non-concessional financing avoided.
19.
Staff recommended moderating current expenditure growth to avoid crowding out
space for public investment. Non-interest current expenditures are projected to rise by
16.0 percent in 2016, driven by double-digit increases in wages, transfers and goods and
services. Staff cautioned that increases in current expenditures are difficult to unwind, particularly

cannot yield large savings. Staff also recommended a reduction in transfers, particularly to public
enterprises, whose reform could underpin a fiscal consolidation effort. Narrowing the deficit by
1.5 percent of GDP in 2017–21 through a reduction in current expenditures would largely
stabilize the debt, reducing the debt in 2021 to 53 percent of GDP, compared to 60 percent in
the baseline scenario. Staff recommends that consolidation in order to preserve buffers.
20.
Staff welcomed the progress on public enterprise reforms. Transfers to the Guyana
Sugar Corporation (GuySuCo) were equivalent to 1.8 percent of GDP in 2015 and are budgeted
at about 1. 3 percent of GDP for 2016. Staff urged the authorities to adopt a restructuring plan
for the sector that will improve cost efficiency, productivity, and alternative revenues streams,
drawing upon the reforms proposed by the Commission of Inquiry. The initial steps taken in that

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

GUYANA

direction are welcome. The scope and pace of reform should take into account social
implications. Staff noted the improved financial performance of Guyana Power and Light (GPL),
which no longer requires subsidies for its operations. However, most of those gains stem from
low oil prices, which could prove transitory. Further progress to reduce transmission and
commercial losses will help place GPL on a more sustainable financial footing.
21.
The simplified budgetary process for public procurement by individual agencies
brings flexibility, but should not compromise project evaluation and internal controls. Staff
stressed the importance of maintaining the quality of public investment by carefully selecting
projects, taking into account their financially feasibility, impact on productivity, and social
considerations.
22.
Staff welcomed plans to improve revenues through better enforcement but
cautioned against counting on gains before they materialize. Since the revenue measures in
the 2016 Budget are likely to reduce revenue, further tax exemptions should not be granted in
expectation of improved revenue collection, especially before achieving concrete results.
Broadening the tax base by reviewing tax exemptions would help raise revenues, and staff
welcomes plans to review the VAT with a view to improve its effectiveness.
23.
The largely concessional nature of the debt is an important source of resilience, and
staff cautioned against increases in non-concessional debt. While sustained deficits will lead
to an increase in debt over the medium-term, sustainability concerns are mitigated provided
debt remains financed mostly in concessional terms. The projected deficits will be financed with a
mix of concessional external funding and grants, and domestic borrowing. External financing of
about 5½ percent of GDP, in line with recent historical experience excluding PetroCaribe, is
expected. Domestic debt consists of short-term Treasury Bills. The authorities envisage issuing
longer-term bonds with a view to developing domestic capital markets. Staff supports those
plans, which can also help the National Insurance Scheme match its liability profile, but cautions
that significant increases in domestic borrowing could crowd out credit to the private sector,
raise domestic interest rates, and have implications for growth. Staff welcomes the authorities’
intentions to continue to refrain from non-concessional external borrowing.
24.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ exclusion of possible future oil income from their
medium term plans. The recently discovered deep water oil fields have relatively high extraction
costs. Production may not be commercially viable if oil prices remain low. Exploration is
proceeding, but oil revenues are not likely to materialize in the medium-term, and authorities
have not factored in such income in their plans. Staff welcomes this cautious approach, and the
authorities’ interest in setting-up a fiscal framework for handling eventual oil revenues following
best practices. The IMF Board Paper on Macroeconomic Policy Frameworks for Resource-Rich
Developing Countries can provide guidance for these efforts.4 Staff noted that the Fund stands

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GUYANA

ready to help develop the institutional capacity and supportive infrastructure to implement fiscal
rules that would facilitate a prudent use of mineral resource revenues.
Authorities’ views
25.
The authorities stressed their plans to strengthen tax administration. While they
acknowledged that some tax measures approved in 2015 and envisaged for 2016 would
decrease revenue, they expect the effect to be small and offset by improvements in tax
administration. The authorities also noted that they expect stronger growth over the mediumterm, which will raise revenue. The authorities also indicated their wish to have technical advice
from staff and signaled their intent to solicit CARTAC support to conduct a detailed review of the
application of the VAT since its inception to present with a view of benefitting from the resulting
recommendations.
26.
The authorities noted that the large increase in current expenditure is due to oneoff reclassification changes and an adjustment in wages. In respect of the former, they
clarified that the increase in transfers was due largely to a consolidation of expenditure items of
constitutional agencies into a single category and higher capital expenditure at public
enterprises, while the increase in spending on other goods and services could be viewed as a
one-off change. As for the latter, they pointed out that wage growth will moderate in the future.
27.
The authorities remain committed to restructuring public enterprises to reduce
their reliance on government support. The restructuring of GuySuCo aims to reduce
inefficiencies and place operations on a financially sustainable footing. One underperforming
sugar estate has been targeted for closure and planned budget transfers for 2016 have been
reduced by 25 percent. The company intends to transition to a new business model that would
ensure its long-run viability, drawing upon the Commission of Inquiry’s recommendations. With
regard to the public utility GPL, a recent network modernization project has reduced some
transmission losses; further progress is expected under a new IDB/EU project. Lower oil prices
have reduced electricity generation cost and tariffs ensure cost recovery.
28.
The authorities indicated that they would continue to refrain from nonconcessional external borrowing, and expressed interest in developing domestic debt
instruments. The authorities agreed that major public investment projects should continue to be
donor financed on concessional terms. They also intend to mobilize private sector funding,
including through well designed private public partnerships. The authorities expressed interest in
developing long term domestic debt instruments with a view to developing financial markets and
mobilizing domestic savings. In this regard, technical advice from staff on debt market
development would be welcome. The authorities took note of staff’s view that domestic
borrowing should be pursued with caution as it could raise the interest burden and crowd out
private investment. They also reiterated that they are not factoring in possible future oil income
in their medium-term plans.

B. External Stability
29.
EBA-based estimates suggest that the current account is broadly in line with its
norm and that the REER is broadly in line with fundamentals The real effective exchange rate
(REER) appreciated by approximately 18 percent during July 2014–January 2016 and export
growth has slowed. The underlying current account is projected to be broadly unchanged in
2016, with the loss of rice exports to Venezuela—a permanent shock—offset by higher gold
exports. External reserves appear to be adequate under standard metrics, including when
measured against the metric for Small Island Developing States (SIDS) states. Staff noted that
while reserves are projected to grow, this is predicated on low oil prices and there is a need to
build buffers to reduce vulnerability to adverse shocks. For example, if the price of oil were to rise
to 60 dollars per barrel, ceteris paribus, reserve cover would dip below 3 months of imports in
2016 and 2017. Staff’s assessment of the external position, drawing on model-based estimates
and judgment, is that it is broadly in line with fundamentals but vulnerable to downside risks.
Staff’s proposed fiscal measures would help preserve external buffers and partly unwind the REER
appreciation.
30.
De facto exchange rate flexibility would soften the impact of terms of trade shocks.
Given limited nominal exchange rate flexibility, a strong U.S. dollar contributes to Guyana’s real
exchange rate appreciation. Recent adverse shocks to export commodity prices were offset by
lower oil prices, attenuating the BOP impact of the former. Guyana remains vulnerable to large
terms of trade shocks given its dependence on imported oil and the concentration of its exports
on a few commodities. The exchange rate regime is a de facto stabilized arrangement, with very
limited movements even in the face of large external shocks. Staff noted that exchange rate
flexibility should play a larger role in facilitating adjustment to external shocks, mitigating their
effect on growth, and safeguarding reserves. Exchange rate flexibility, supported by appropriate
fiscal and monetary policies, can help maintain the current account deficit at a safer level,
reducing external vulnerabilities.
Authorities’ views
31.
The authorities noted that the exchange rate is market determined. Exchange rate
stability reflects the confidence that market participants have in the currency and the economy
needs that confidence. They also noted that over the past year, exchange rate depreciation was
modest, with the central bank making net purchases of foreign exchange.

C. Monetary Policy
32.
With inflationary pressures muted, the monetary policy stance should remain
accommodative. Lower prices for imported goods, including fuel, continue to restrain inflation
despite the expansionary fiscal policy. Monetary policy has traction, with private credit playing an
important role in the monetary transmission mechanism (see SIP). With the implementation of
the new credit reporting act, banks will gradually have access to better information on borrower’s
creditworthiness, which should boost high-quality lending, help reduce lending rates, and reduce

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GUYANA

banks’ excess reserves. As long as inflationary pressures remain contained, a more
accommodative monetary policy stance, with base and broad money growing above nominal
GDP, remains appropriate. Such a stance, combined with an effective credit rating system and
other financial sector reforms, would support lending and growth. However, the authorities
should stand ready to tighten monetary conditions if inflationary pressures arise.
Authorities’ views
33.
The authorities agreed that the monetary policy stance should remain
accommodative. They will continue to monitor movements in international prices and their
impact on inflation and growth. In addition to open market operations, they plan to manage
liquidity through foreign-exchange market intervention.

D. Strengthening Financial Sector Resilience
34.
The financial sector is dominated by commercial banks. There are three foreign banks
and three local banks, whose combined assets correspond to about 70 percent of financial sector
assets, and are equivalent to 68 percent of GDP. The largest bank is Trinidad-based, followed by
a domestic bank, accounting for 40 and 22 percent of commercial bank assets, respectively. That
domestic bank plays a relatively large role in lending to businesses, and is the bank with the
highest share of NPLs. Among non-bank financial institutions, the New Building Society (NBS), a
deposit taking institution that focuses primarily on mortgage loans, is the largest entity
accounting for about 7 percent of financial sector assets and over a quarter of non-bank financial
institution assets.
35.
Vulnerabilities to foreign exchange and interest rate risks appear limited. A
depreciation of the exchange rate would improve the financial position of the overall banking
system since banks in aggregate carry net long positions in foreign exchange (84 percent of
capital and reserves as of December 2015). Interest rate risks are mitigated by banks’ ability to
adjust interest rates on existing loans, although a higher interest rate burden on debtors can
increase credit risk. However, banks are exposed to credit risk in their CARICOM securities. Stress
tests conducted by the authorities also suggest that the weaker banks are also vulnerable to
downgrades on their investment portfolio.
36.
Banks remain well capitalized, but heightened vigilance is warranted due to
increases in NPLs. Since the 2006 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), the authorities
have brought insurance companies and the NBS under central bank supervision. Staff supports
plans to also include credit unions under central bank supervision. Banking system aggregate
capital appears well positioned to absorb an increase in provisioning up to the levels observed
prior to the recent rise in NPLs without breaching the prudential threshold of 8 percent, but
individual banks with higher NPLs have weaker buffers. While all banks meet provisioning
requirements, only 20 percent provisioning is required when the loan is secured by collateral.
This exclusion is sensible when risks are assessed in isolation. But collateral can be difficult to

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

GUYANA

seize. And from a macroprudential perspective, there is a concern that its value may decline
following aggregate or sectoral shocks, suggesting a case for tighter requirements.
37.
Staff encouraged the authorities to continue to strengthen financial sector
supervision. Given risks stemming from loan concentration, related party lending, potential loan
classification weaknesses, collateral valuation and potential challenges in realizing collaterals,
staff recommended tightening: (i) provisioning requirements; (ii) large exposure limits;
(iii) restrictions on related lending; and (iv) loan classification rules. In addition, the stress testing
toolkit could be expanded to include shocks to loan collateral values and also take into account
inter-linkages among economic sectors, borrowers, and financial entities. Finally, staff argued for
improved coordination of supervision of insurers and banks within the same business group.
Risks from global banks’ de-risking activity should continue to be monitored. An FSAP mission
will visit Guyana in May, and provide a more granular analysis of financial sector challenges and
assist the authorities with strengthening the prudential toolkit.
38.
While recent steps towards strengthening the Anti-Money Laundering and
Combating the Financing of Terrorism framework are welcome, the authorities should
address remaining deficiencies promptly. In particular, the authorities are urged to accelerate
the implementation of the action plan agreed with the Financial Action Task Force.
Authorities’ views
39.
The authorities will continue to monitor closely the strength of the financial system
and reforms will be guided by the findings of the forthcoming FSAP mission. In the
meantime, they will continue their risk-based approach to onsite inspection of banks. They have
already urged banks to reduce NPLs to no more than 5 percent and increase provisioning. Their
financial stability assessments will continue to be published, including a summary of banks’ stress
tests results. They will continue monitoring global banks’ de-risking decisions and are open to
supporting potential solutions discussed with CARICOM. The authorities urged the Fund to
actively support efforts to find a solution to this pressing issue. Reforms to the macro-prudential
framework, including on the stress-testing framework, will be guided by the FSAP findings.
40.
The authorities plan to pass the revised draft insurance act by end-2016. This act,
which was prepared with technical assistance from the World Bank, aims to correct regulatory
and supervisory failures that were highlighted by CLICO’s bankruptcy.
41.
The authorities plan to upgrade the AML/CFT framework to international standards
in the first half of 2016. The authorities have received technical assistance from the World Bank
on this matter. The authorities are exerting efforts to fully address all deficiencies identified by
the FATF and implement the agreed action plan.

E. Structural Policies to Raise Productivity and Support Strong and
Inclusive Growth
42.
The mission welcomed authorities’ focus on promoting inclusive growth through
improvements in infrastructure, human capital, and financial inclusion. Guyana has made
considerable progress in reducing many dimensions of extreme poverty, and achieved most of its
MDGs. But its Human Development Index remains low (at 0.636, making it the 124th country in
the rankings). Integrating remote areas in the hinterland through improvements in
transportation, access to electricity, social services and agency banking will help spread the
benefits of growth and reduce poverty, given its strong regional dimension.
43.
There is scope for productivity-enhancing reforms in key sectors. Staff noted the
importance of lowering production costs in the sugar and rice sector given their high social
impact and deteriorating market outlook. The mission pointed out that Guyana’s extensive
renewable energy resources could help achieve a durable reduction in electricity costs, which are
among the highest in the region (Annex IV). This could strengthen competitiveness by promoting
value added industries. Improving the connectivity of small green technology electricity
generators to the grid could help increase supply and reduce energy losses. Staff also stressed
the potential of business outsourcing, telecommunications and ICT services as other areas for
diversification. Population aging will put pressure on the National Insurance Scheme. Increasing
the statutory retirement age can help place its finances on a more sustainable financial footing,
and also contribute to a higher potential output.
44.
The mission encouraged the authorities to further strengthen the business climate
in priority areas. The World Bank’s 2015 Doing Business Report ranked Guyana 137th out of 189

Authorities’ views
45.
The authorities outlined their strategy for environmentally sustainable and socially
inclusive growth. They reiterated their commitment to renewable energy projects, noting a
recent memorandum of understanding with a private company for a 25 megawatt wind farm.
Going forward, energy policies would draw upon the conclusions of IDB’s comprehensive analysis

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

GUYANA

of the country’s energy matrix that is currently underway. Mini hydro stations and solar panels
are expected to play a central role in hinterland electrification. A number of projects aim to
bridge the divide between the coastal area and the hinterland by improving transport
infrastructure and access to healthcare, education, and other social services. In this regard, four
hinterland communities have been selected for township development.
46.
The authorities will promote competition and economic diversification. They plan to
liberalize the regulatory framework for telecommunications and ICT services and seek to increase
airlift supply from several countries, with the view of promoting growth in tourism and nontraditional exports, including fresh fruits and vegetables, fisheries and aquaculture.

STAFF APPRAISAL
47.
Guyana’s economy continues to grow despite global headwinds. In 2015, real GDP
grew at 3 percent. Growth is projected to increase to 4 percent this year, supported by the level
effect of two new large gold mines, and an increase in public investment. Strengthening private
sector confidence is essential for maintaining growth momentum.
48.
The public investment program can promote environmentally sustainable and
socially inclusive growth. The high cost of electricity, transportation and telecommunications
are key impediments to growth. Public investment and liberalizing reforms can ease these
bottlenecks, raise productivity, help integrate remote regions, and promote diversification and
job creation. Well targeted investments can stimulate the economy in the short-run, and provide
long-lasting competitiveness gains.
49.
Oil prices have particularly strong macroeconomic implications for Guyana. Lower
oil prices narrowed the current account deficit and also improved the fiscal balance through
higher excise revenues and a reduction in the subsidies to the electricity company. While oil
prices are expected to remain low, they can suddenly reverse. Oil represents a major source of
fiscal and external vulnerability, particularly after the termination of PetroCaribe financing.
50.
Exchange rate flexibility should play a larger role in facilitating adjustment to
external shocks. Guyana remains vulnerable to movements in commodity prices due to its
dependence on imported oil and the concentration of exports on a few commodities. The
exchange rate regime is a de facto stabilized arrangement. The exchange rate is broadly in line
with fundamentals and staff believes it should play a stronger automatic stabilizer role going
forward.
51.
A moderation of the fiscal policy stance is needed to preserve fiscal and external
buffers. Sizable deficits of 5 to 6 percent of GDP in the medium-term would imply a large
increase in debt, raising sustainability concerns and contributing to external vulnerability.
Although debt distress risks remain moderate and debt service manageable due to its largely
concessional nature, fiscal consolidation needs to take place in order to stabilize the debt ratio.
Staff recommends starting consolidation in 2017, which would preserve fiscal buffers for use
when adverse shocks materialize. Consolidation should limit the growth of current expenditure

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GUYANA

and reduce public enterprises reliance in government support. Staff believes expenditure
measures are needed to preserve fiscal space for public investment and poverty reduction, ease
financing pressures and contain the public debt. Staff recommends a reduction in the fiscal
deficit by 1.5 percent of GDP for 2017–21, compared to the authorities’ current plans. This would
largely stabilize the debt to GDP ratio over the medium-term. Expenditure measures can be
complemented by improvements in tax administration. There is also scope for reviewing tax
exemptions so as to broaden the tax base.
52.
The largely concessional nature of the debt remains an important source of
resilience, and should be preserved. Non-concessional financing should be approached with
care, including domestic borrowing which can drive up interest rates. This may require adjusting
the size of the planned fiscal deficits based on the envelope of concessional financing and grants.
53.
The monetary policy stance should remain accommodative. Lower prices for
imported goods, including fuel, continue to restrain inflation. As long as inflationary pressures
remain contained, an accommodative policy stance remains appropriate.
54.
Banks remain well capitalized, but heightened vigilance is warranted due to
increases in nonperforming loans. There is scope for tightening provisioning requirements
including in the case of collateralized loans, large exposure limits, restrictions on related lending,
and loan classification rules. A Financial Sector Assessment Program mission will visit Guyana in
May to provide a more granular analysis of financial sector challenges and assist the authorities
with strengthening the prudential toolkit.
55.
While recent steps towards strengthening the Anti-Money Laundering and
Combating the Financing of Terrorism framework are welcome, the authorities should
address remaining deficiencies promptly. In particular, the authorities are urged to accelerate
the implementation of the action plan agreed with the Financial Action Task Force.
56.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Guyana be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario
most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective
assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” indicates a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a
probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects
staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities.
Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Annex I. External Balance Assessment
Model based estimates suggest that the current account deficit is broadly in line with its norm and
that the real exchange rate is appropriate. Nevertheless, some flexibility in the nominal exchange
rate together with fiscal consolidation would help contain prospective import growth, boost export
competitiveness, and build buffers against potential external shocks.
1.
The real effective exchange rate
(REER) appreciated by approximately
18 percent during July 2014–January
2016, notwithstanding modest nominal
depreciation relative to the US dollar.
The REER appreciation largely reflects
developments in the value of the US
dollar—which the Guyanese dollar follows
closely—against the Euro and other major
currencies.1

Annex II. External Reserves Adequacy
Both standard and risk-weighted measures of reserve adequacy indicate that reserve coverage of
imports would be adequate through 2021. The current account deficit initially narrows in 2016
under the WEO projection of a sharp decline in international oil prices, then widens as the oil price
rises and imports outpace exports due to higher investment and the subdued outlook for
commodity exports, then narrows modestly. The reduced reserve coverage of imports would not
provide an adequate buffer against severe but plausible external shocks.

2.
Reserves are projected to remain well above 3 months of imports through 2021.
Coverage remains well above 3 months of imports under the WEO January 2016 assumption that
international oil prices would fall to about 35 dollars per barrel in 2016 and remain below
50 dollars per barrel for most of the next five years. The ratios of reserves to broad money and
reserves to short-term debt remain adequate, due to the small quantity of the latter. The
projected reserve coverage of imports is sensitive to the assumptions made for the future path of
international oil prices. For example, in a scenario were oil jumps back to 70 dollars per barrel,
ceteris paribus, reserves would cover less than 2 months of imports by 2017, and less than one
month by 2020.
3.
With oil prices low, international reserves rise above the adequacy threshold under
risk-weighted metrics. The first risk-weighted measure is applicable to all countries and
suggests that reserves at end-2015 represented 130 percent of the adequacy threshold and
would exceed the threshold by 2021. The second risk-weighted measure, which uses specific
metrics for Small Island Developing States (SIDS), also points to improving adequacy through
2021. Under this metric, reserve coverage of imports is in the middle of the adequacy range of
75–100 at end-2015 and exceeds the threshold by 2018.

Annex III. Guyana’s Power Sector Reform
1.
Guyana depends heavily on imported oil for its power needs. The country’s installed
power generation capacity is about 83 percent oil-based and 17 percent biomass (bagasse)fueled. This capacity translates into a generation mix that is almost entirely dominated by oilbased generators, which supply about 95 percent of the country’s power consumption.
2.
The oil-dependent power generation mix contributes to macroeconomic volatility.
High oil prices widen the external current account deficit, increase fiscal transfers to the public
utility Guyana Power and Light (GPL) and reduce oil tax revenues due to the limited pass-through
in the domestic fuel pricing regime. Accordingly, adverse oil price shocks consume foreign
exchange and fiscal resources. Volatility in oil prices quickly propagates to the external and fiscal
sectors.

3.
High electricity costs and tariffs are a
drag on competitiveness and growth. Oil price
shocks increase the cost of power generation. When
those costs are passed on to users, they increase
the cost of production and constrain investment.
Average retail electricity prices were among the
highest in the region in 2014 (Text Figure 1). GPL’s
relatively high rate of technical and commercial
losses also contributes to high electricity prices.
Although the recent decline in oil prices has
provided some respite, Guyana remains exposed to
oil price corrections.

4.
Oil-dependent power generation is at odds with the vast renewable energy
potential. The country has extensive hydro power potential, estimated at 7600 MW, which by far
exceeds its annual consumption and installed capacity. Various studies have identified 67 sites as
suitable for hydro power generation. Guyana’s climate is also suitable for wind and solar power
generation while its sugar and rice industries provide opportunities for co-generation of
electricity from biomass (sugarcane bagasse and rice husk).
5.
A transition to a green power matrix will bolster resilience to shocks while reducing
its carbon footprint, but has been delayed by various constraints. Interest in developing
Guyana’s hydro potential dates back to the first oil shock of 1974-75. Plans to build a large
hydroelectric project at Amaila Falls began in the late 1980s and evolved through several
proposals and rounds of negotiations but implementation has been constrained by the project’s
large size, complexity, cost, and Guyana’s limited fiscal space.
6.
Guyana has recently launched a comprehensive review of its power sector strategy.
The government has tasked the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) with a review of its
optimal energy matrix. The IDB will assess the optimal power generation mix for the country,
looking at a broad array of energy sources. The government has also retained an international

36

GUYANA

consultant for a review of the feasibility of Amaila Falls Hydropower Project. The power sector
strategy will draw upon the results of these studies.
7.
The government has also taken steps to increase the contribution of renewables to
its power generation mix. A recently signed MoU with a private firm provides an opportunity
for the construction of a 25 MW wind farm. The government has put in place fiscal incentives to
promote solar power and will use solar panels and mini hydro stations in remote communities
without grid access. Solar power is also increasingly used by businesses to power their buildings
and operations. In this respect, enabling green technology independent power producers to sell
their excess power to the grid could reduce energy losses, increase supply, and lower tariffs. The
government is also exploring the modalities of renewing its ground-breaking low carbon
partnership with Norway, which has provided grants for developmental projects in exchange for
Guyana’s progress in preventing deforestation and reducing the economy’s carbon footprint.

b.
On February 27, 2009, the Executive Board concluded the 2008 Article IV consultation.
c.
On March 17, 2010, the Executive Board concluded the 2009 Article IV consultation (IMF
Country Report No. 10/292).
d.
On February 16, 2011, the Executive Board concluded the 2010 Article IV consultation
(IMF Country Report No. 11/152).
e.
On November 9, 2012, the Executive Board concluded the 2012 Article IV consultation
(IMF Country Report No. 12/254).
f.
On December 19, 2013, the Executive Board concluded the 2013 Article IV consultation
(IMF Country Report No. 14/294). Guyana is on a 12-month cycle for Article IV consultations.
Safeguard Assessments
The most recent safeguards assessment of the Bank of Guyana (BOG) was completed in May
2007 in respect of the then expected PRGF arrangement. Overall the assessment noted capacity
constraints, including in the internal audit function. Recommendations were made to enhance
internal audit reporting and to improve external audit quality to enable compliance with
International Standards on Auditing (ISA) and IFRS. In the reserves management area, staff
recommended the establishment of an investment committee. The latter has been implemented.
The BOG continues to be audited by the Audit Office of Guyana and the reports state compliance
with ISA. The BOG’s financial statements refer to IFRS and are published.
Exchange Rate Arrangement
Guyana has accepted the obligations of Article VIII––Section 2, 3, and 4—and maintains an
exchange system that does not have any multiple currency practices, and is free of restrictions on
the making of payments and transfers for international transactions, with the only exception of
certain exchange restrictions for the preservation of national and international security. Guyana’s
de jure exchange rate regime is floating. Guyana’s de facto exchange rate regime is classified as a
stabilized arrangement. The BOG conducts transactions on the basis of the weighted average
quotations of the three largest dealers in the exchange market. The currency of Guyana is the
Guyana dollar. The exchange rate was G$206.50 per U.S. dollar on December 31, 2015.
ROSC, FSAP, EPA Participation

BANK-FUND COLLABORATION UNDER THE JMAP
AND RELATIONS WITH THE BANK
A. Bank-Fund Collaboration Under the JMAP
1.
The World Bank Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), 2009–2012, was endorsed by the
Bank’s Board of Executive Directors in May 2009. The completion report for the CAS is underway
and a new country strategy is currently under preparation. The current IBRD/IDA1 portfolio is
comprised of three projects totaling US$35.6 million. IFC’s committed portfolio in Guyana
amounts to $48 million (January 2016), and includes one project in the mining sector. IFC also
has four advisory services projects: i) the Guyana Bank for Trade and Industry (GBTI) Risk
Management ($0.3 million for Risk Management and SME Banking); ii) the LAC regional Indicator
Based Reform Advisory ($2.1 million); iii) the Caribbean Regional Credit Bureau ($2.1 million); and
iv) Trade Logistics in the Caribbean ($2.3 million). Currently, MIGA has no exposure in Guyana.
2.

The work of the World Bank is aligned along the two main areas of the CAS.


Strengthening Environmental Resilience and Sustainability. The Bank has two active
projects focused on flood risk management: the IDA funded Flood Risk Management
Projects ($11.9 million), supporting the reduction of vulnerability of coastal areas to
flooding of coastal areas; and the grant funded (Guyana REDD + Investment Fund – GRIF)
Cunha Canal Rehabilitation Project (US$3.7 million), approved in December 2015.



Improving the Quality of Education. The Bank is helping Guyana to improve the quality
of education delivered through three projects. The current two IDA projects include the
Guyana Secondary Education Improvement Project (US$10 million), and the University of
Guyana Science and Technology Support Project (US$13.7 million. The third project, Early
Childhood Education, is grant funded by the Global Partnership for Education.



The Bank is conducting additional work in support of the financial sector through a
Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening Initiative (FIRST) grant to the Bank of Guyana
(US$0.5 million).

1

Financing to Guyana is usually done at concessionary rates and channeled through the International
Development Association (IDA), the World Bank’s fund for the poorest that provides interest-free loans and
grants to low-income countries and through a series of trust funds managed by the Bank. Guyana’s total IDA 16
allocation for FY12–14 is 14.3 SDR/US$21.9 million. IDA 17 indicative allocation for FY15–17 is
16.5 SDR/US$22.7 million.

RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of February 2016)
2016 Highlights



Net cash flow was negative in 2015 for the first time in the last decade. With respect to loans,
this trend is expected to continue in 2016.



From the 2014–2015 Fund for special operations allocation period, a total of $1.7 million for 3
Technical Cooperation (TC) projects was approved to support the collection of data and
enhance data gathering capabilities in Guyana. Among these TCs is one for the design and
execution of a survey of living conditions, which has not been undertaken in Guyana since
1992.

2016 Program



The Bank is in the final year of implementing the Country Strategy (CS) for Guyana 2012-2016.
The Strategy supports the priority areas of: sustainable energy, natural resources
management, private sector development and public sector management, as well as the
strategic dialogue areas of transport, citizen security and water and sanitation, with the crosscutting theme of concerns affecting Amerindian communities. The Bank is at the preliminary
stage of preparation of the new CS and given the focus of this Administration, it is expected
that new priority areas may include social sectors, agriculture and private sector development.



For 2016, projects expected to be approved include: Maternal and Child Health;
Modernization of the Justice System; Sustainable Agricultural Development Program; and
Enhancing National Quality Infrastructure for Diversification and Trade.

Three new TCs are scheduled for approval in 2016: (i) GY-T1120: Institutional Strengthening to
Guyana Social Safety Net; (ii) GY-T1121: Improving the Delivery and Outcomes of Maternal and
Child Health Services; and (iii) GY-T1122: Women Community Based Groups for Rural Road
Maintenance. Other new TCs will come on stream as the 2016 allocation of US$1.76 million
received for Guyana under the Small and Vulnerable Countries Funding is yet to be programmed
and the Bank is in discussion with GOGY regarding priorities.



No investment grants are scheduled for approval in 2016.

Portfolio in Execution


The active investment portfolio consists of nine investment loan projects for an approved amount
of US$167.5 million; two investment loans co-financed with EU/CIF grant resources for US$96.25
million; one loan guarantee for US$2.5 million and four investment grant projects for US$19.41
million, representing a total approved amount of US$285.66 million with a total undisbursed
balance of US$200 million (please see text table below).



In 2015, two investment loan projects exited the portfolio: (1) GY-L1019: Second Low Income
Program (approved: US$27.9 million); (2) and (2) GY-0055: Georgetown Solid Waste Management
(approved: US$18.1 million). GY-L1025: The Georgetown Sanitation Improvement Program
(approved: US$9.5 million) was extended for another 6 months to allow for completion of
activities and will be closed in 2016. Similarly, wrap up activities for GY-L1006: Support for
Competitiveness Program (approved: US$48.7 million) are ongoing in 2016. Also in December
2015, one investment loan project, the Expansion and Integration of Basic Nutrition GYL-1028
with undisbursed balances of US$3.1 million was reformulated to support hinterland housing
across Guyana.



Four new TCs were added to the portfolio in 2015 with financing from the FSO allocation for
Small and Vulnerable Countries. These TCs were (1) GY-T1114: Support to Statistical Capacities of
Guyana (US$0.4 million); (2) GY-T1118: Design and Execution of a Labor Force Survey in Guyana
(US$0.4 million); (3) GY-T1119: Execution of Crime and Victimization Survey (US$0.15 million) and
(4) GY-T1117: Design and Execution of a Household Survey of Living Conditions (US$0.75 million).

Excludes the fully disbursed PBL: GY-L1043.

Net loan flows are projected to continue to be negative in 2016, stemming from repayment
amounts (principal and interests) higher than expected disbursements under the investment
loan portfolio. As of 31 January 2016, Guyana’s total outstanding debt to the IDB is
US$488,044,005. The Table below shows for 2016, projected negative net flows of US$4.06
million. The table below does not account for projected disbursement of investment grants.
If the projected disbursement amount of $5.56 million of the two major investment grants
were to be included, the result would be, although low, a positive net flow for 2016.

Most of the interventions programmed in CDB’s 2013-17 Country Strategy Paper (CSP) for
Guyana had already been approved as of December 31, 2015. These included the Sea and River
Defense Resilience Project in the amount of US$25 million and the US$7.5 million Sugar
Mechanization Project, which both remain under implementation. The Sugar Mechanization
Project also entailed approval of a small grant component to address gender integration issues in
the sugar industry. Other grants approved under the CSP totaled around $2.25 million as of
December 31, 2015, which largely reflected the approval of the eighth cycle of the Basic Needs
Trust Fund poverty reduction program in Guyana (BNTF 8). Guyana also benefited during this
period from grant funding under CDB’s Caribbean Technological Consultancy Services (CTCS)
program, as well as the Stand-by Facility for Caribbean Single Market and Economy (CSME)
Implementation.



An uptick in approval activity is anticipated from the latter half of 2016. New resources have
become available for Guyana and the project pipeline is currently being expanded and the CSP
revised accordingly.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of March 20, 2016)

A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provided to the Fund is broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, although
timeliness, reliability, and coverage of selected data can be improved. Selected data are only
available during missions and upon request. Monetary statistics, exchange rates, interest rates,
and financial prudential indicators are available with a lag from the website of the Bank of
Guyana (BOG). The Ministry of Finance (MOF) provides macroeconomic and fiscal statistics in
various publications available on its website. While specific areas of statistics have received
technical assistance, some limitations remain in the compilation and dissemination of data for
certain sectors. Guyana has subscribed to the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) in
2011.
National Accounts: The compilation of national accounts has been strengthened in the past
decade but some limitations remain in certain areas. In 2010, GDP was rebased with 2006 prices
to reflect the structural changes since the transition to a market-based economy. This resulted in
a more than sixty percent increase compared to the old GDP, based on 1988 prices. Caribbean
Regional Technical Assistance Center (CARTAC) missions have provided technical assistance on
national accounts, which helped strengthen production-side GDP compilation, the rebasing of
national accounts and medium-term projections. Further work could entail compilation of
expenditure-side GDP and quarterly GDP. The Bureau of Statistics (BOS) could increase the
coverage of surveys, particularly with respect to the services sector. Since January 2010, the BOS
has adopted a new household income and expenditure survey (HIES) and has expanded the
basket of the CPI index and revised its weights. The coverage of the CPI index could be further
broadened to reflect price movements in areas other than Georgetown. There is also room to
improve the timeliness of statistics on labor markets, gender and poverty.
Government finance statistics: Technical assistance delivered in 2014-15 has focused on
building capacity in the areas of internal audit, tax administration, revenue forecasting, tariff
classification of goods using the Harmonized System, customs valuation, debt management and
medium-term fiscal projections. Past technical assistance missions have found that there is room
to improve the definition and treatment of one-off nontax revenues in medium term projections.
Authorities plan to continue to work on improving tax administration and to build a framework
for managing mineral revenues based on international best practices. The authorities have
expressed interest in technical assistance on developing a domestic long-term bond market.
Fiscal statistics are disseminated through several Ministry of Finance (MOF) publications,
including the Mid-Year Report on the annual budget, the Budget Speech and other budgetrelated documents.
Monetary statistics: The BOG has made significant progress in improving the quality of
monetary statistics, especially as regards the institutional coverage. The monetary statistics
currently include the BOG, other depositary corporations (commercial banks, the New Building
Society, and trust companies), and other financial corporations (finance companies, life insurance

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

GUYANA

companies, non-life insurance companies, pension funds, and asset management companies).
The BOG’s monetary statistics provide data for publication in the IFS Supplement, based on
standardized report forms. The BOG publishes financial prudential indicators in its quarterly
report and on its website on a regular basis.
Balance of payments: In 2014, a mission from CARTAC identified data gaps and made
recommendations for improvements, including: (i) the development of a register of large public
and private enterprises that could be requested to provide data on their transactions and
positions with nonresidents; (ii) improving data collection and compilation with regards to
services; (iii) inclusion of investment income from reserve assets; (iv) clarifying the classification of
income accounts to ensure that they occur between residents and nonresidents; (iv) properly
recording debt forgiveness; and, (v) surveying direct investment enterprises. The mission initiated
the production of quarterly current and capital accounts according to the sixth edition of the
Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6) for the period March
2011 to September 2013. The mission also initiated the production of experimental (partial)
international investment position (IIP) statistics from the information that is available on
government debt, reserve assets of the central bank, and MFS. The mission developed an action
plan for the implementation of balance of payments and IIP surveys and for the development of
balance of payments and IIP statements. The BOG does not report the international investment
position (IIP) because it currently does not have the capacity to compile such statistics. This is
one of the priority areas identified for technical assistance from CARTAC.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By
Jorge Roldos and
Andrea Richter Hume
(IMF) and John Panzer
and Mark Roland
Thomas (World Bank)

Prepared by the staff of the International Monetary Fund in
consultation with the World Bank Staff.

Guyana’s risk of external debt distress remains moderate and debt service manageable.
The update of the DSA shows that indicators of the risk of external debt distress remain
under the relevant threshold despite some deterioration. The results of the debt
sustainability analysis (DSA) suggest that the NPV of external debt to GDP reaches
28 percent of GDP over the medium term while debt service would rise to 6 percent of
revenue. Stress tests reveal vulnerability of public debt to extreme shocks.

GUYANA

BACKGROUND
1.
Debt relief, PetroCaribe debt write-offs and fiscal consolidation efforts have helped
reduce Guyana’s external debt burden significantly in recent years. Total public sector debt
has declined from 96 percent of GDP in 2006 to 48.6 percent in 2015. Under the Multilateral Debt
Relief Initiative (MDRI), the Fund, the World Bank, and the IDB provided debt relief amounting to
US$611 million in 2006–07. Paris Club bilateral creditors and some non-Paris Club creditors
granted debt relief as part of the 2004 Paris Club agreement.1 Negotiations with other non-Paris
Club creditors about debt relief are protracted with the debt in question amounting to around
15 percent of total debt or 7 percent of GDP.2 Meanwhile, part of the debt owed to Venezuela
under the PetroCaribe agreement has been written off against Guyana’s rice exports to that
country. Furthermore, the non-financial public sector (NFPS) deficit declined from 8.6 percent of
GDP in 2005 to 0.2 percent of GDP in 2015.
2.
Over the last six years, total gross public debt has declined by about 19 percent of
GDP. The debt-to-GDP ratio declined from 67 percent in 2009 to 48.6 percent in 2015. Over the
same period, external debt declined from 46 percent of GDP to 36 percent, and domestic debt
declined from 21 percent of GDP to 12 percent. Multilateral institutions—particularly the InterAmerican Development Bank, the Caribbean Development Bank and the International
Development Association—are the main external creditors. Debt has a long maturity profile and
low average interest rates.
3.
Over the years, Venezuela had become an important donor through PetroCaribe’s
concessional loans to finance Guyana’s oil imports, an arrangement that has stopped.
Although these loan disbursements were sizable, a large portion of these funds had been
deposited in an account at the Central Bank of Guyana to be used as a ‘sinking fund,’ which, on a
net debt basis, has a smaller impact and lowers debt vulnerabilities as it increases gross reserves
available to service external debt. In addition, Guyana had repaid part of its PetroCaribe debt
with rice exports and the accumulated savings under the financing arrangement.
4.
Guyana’s external debt burden thresholds correspond to the ones associated with a
medium policy performance rating. The three-year average of the CPIA (Country Policy and
Institutional Assessment) of Guyana has remained stable at 3.3, corresponding to a medium
policy performance rating. This implies the following thresholds: (i) a PV of debt-to-GDP ratio of
40 percent; (ii) a PV of debt-to-exports ratio of 150 percent; (iii) a PV of debt-to-revenue ratio of
250 percent; and (iv) debt service-to-exports and revenue ratios of 20 percent, respectively.
Debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative was granted by all multilateral creditors except one,
by Paris Club bilateral creditors, and four non-Paris Club creditors (China, India, Venezuela, and Cuba). Debt owed to Brazil
and North Korea was paid off without relief.
1

These creditors include Argentina, Bulgaria, Kuwait, Libya, United Arab Emirates, and Serbia, as well as a loan from an
Indian commercial entity (Tata). In addition, the situation of the CARICOM Multilateral Clearing Facility (CMCF) debt has
not been resolved yet.

MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK AND BASELINE
SCENARIO ASSUMPTIONS
A. Background
5.
Guyana’s economy continues to expand, albeit growth slowed in 2015 due to
domestic and external factors. Real GDP growth decelerated to 3 percent in 2015 but is
projected to increase to 4 percent in 2016, lifted by increased output from two large gold mines
and accelerated implementation of the public sector investment program. Inflation will remain
subdued, averaging 2 percent during the medium term and 3.5 percent on average during the
long term. The external current account deficit is expected to widen to about 7percent of GDP on
average in 2017–21 and remain approximately at that level in the long term, reflecting higher oil
imports and persistent shocks to the prices of Guyana’s commodity exports. As a result of this
and slightly lower net capital inflows, gross international reserves are projected to fall below the
standard threshold (3 months of imports) in the long term without policy adjustment.
6.
The nonfinancial public sector deficit for 2015 was 0.2 percent of GDP and is
expected to rise to 5.2 percent of GDP on average during 2016–21. The lower fiscal deficit in
2015 was mainly due to one-off factors, including election-induced declines in public capital
spending. Public debt stood at 48.6 percent of GDP in 2015.

B. Baseline Scenario: Projections and Assumptions
7.
Medium term growth outlook remains positive but could be constrained by
financing and low productivity barring far reaching structural reforms. The authorities’ plans
for the energy sector and improvements in infrastructure, coupled with robust growth in
construction and gold production, will sustain growth of about 3.8 percent on average in
2017–2021 and through the medium term.3
8.
Baseline fiscal consolidation is expected to be insufficient to reduce debt ratios
more rapidly in the long term. The overall NFPS deficit is projected to remain high at about
4.7 percent of GDP on average over the projection period, as capital spending associated with
infrastructure needs remains high.4 As a result, gross public debt is projected to increase to
60 percent and 75 percent of GDP by 2021 and 2036, respectively. The concessional nature of the
debt helps limit that increase. The baseline scenario does not assume any additional debt
reduction through rice exports to Venezuela in 2016 and beyond.

The projection excludes the discovery of oil by Exxon Mobil, which could begin production as early as 2020.
However, it is not accounted for as it is currently at an exploratory stage.
3

Nevertheless, the primary deficit is projected to decline somewhat from 3.8 percent in 2021 to 2.3 percent in
2036.

9.
The current DSA shows some deterioration in long-run debt sustainability relative
to the 2013 DSA, driven by the looser fiscal stance assumed in the baseline. The public debt to
GDP ratio in the current DSA reaches 75 percent by 2033 compared to 48.4 percent in the 2013
DSA, even though the initial debt stock is significantly lower (about 10 percentage points of
GDP). The 2013 DSA assumed a steep fiscal consolidation that achieved an average surplus of 1
percent during 2013-33. In contrast, the current DSA assumes a continuation of the current fiscal
stance, with an average fiscal deficit of 4.8 percent in the long-term.

ASSESSMENT OF BASELINE SCENARIO: GROSS
EXTERNAL DEBT
10.
The analysis suggests that Guyana’s external debt remains sustainable under the
baseline scenario and the country faces a moderate risk of debt distress, but external debt
ratios are vulnerable to shocks (Table 1, Figure 1). All sustainability indicators remain
comfortably below their thresholds. The PV of gross external debt-to-GDP ratio increases
gradually to 28 percent in the long term (compared to 30 percent in the previous DSA). Most of
the improvement in the PV of gross external debt-to-GDP ratio compared to the 2013 DSA was
due to lower projected disbursements in the long term. External debt would remain manageable
as long as the government is committed to the policy of borrowing on highly concessional terms.
Debt service-to-exports and debt service-to-revenue ratios also remain well below their
respective thresholds, reflecting the concessional nature of outstanding debt and new external
borrowing in the near-term.
11.
Bound tests and alternative scenarios show that Guyana’s external debt is
vulnerable to large shocks and a deteriorated economic environment (Table 2, Figure 1).
Guyana remains vulnerable to large terms of trade shocks given its concentration of its exports
on a few commodities and dependence on imported oil. The PV of debt-to-GDP ratio breaches
the threshold in the event of a one-time 30 percent depreciation (Figure 1 and Table 2, B6).
Although stress tests suggest no breach of thresholds for the repayment capacity of Guyana,
debt service-to-exports and debt service-to-revenue ratios are higher compared to the previous
DSA, underlying increased vulnerability to large shocks. Please note that the declining debt
under the Historical scenario is mostly driven by a mechanical extrapolation of past debt
forgiveness, which is unlikely to take place in the future.

ASSESSMENT OF BASELINE SCENARIO: GROSS
PUBLIC DEBT
12.
The analysis of total gross public debt shows that the risk of debt distress increases
in 2020–21 and beyond (Tables 3 and 4). The nominal total debt-to-GDP ratio reaches the
60 percent threshold in 2021 and remains on an upward trajectory throughout 2036 absent fiscal
consolidation. The PV of the public sector debt-to-GDP ratio is also estimated to increase

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GUYANA

monotonically, reaching 61 percent of GDP in the long term. Given the trajectory, fiscal
consolidation is needed to place the debt on a steadily downward path.
13.
Total public debt is vulnerable to standard shocks. Vulnerability of the public debt to
shocks underscores the importance of closer monitoring of the Public Sector Investment
Program (PSIP). This is important to ensure that the projects are financially viable and that they
increase the economy’s productivity (Table 4, Figure 2). The PV of debt-to-GDP ratio is most
vulnerable to shocks to GDP growth (Table 4, B1). Assuming a GDP growth is at historical average
minus one standard deviation, the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio would increase to 47 percent in the
medium term and 68 percent by 2036, which is 6 percentage points higher than the baseline
scenario. Debt service payments would remain manageable reflecting the high concessionality of
the public debt. Nevertheless, in some scenarios debt service could increase to as much as
20 percent of revenues, which could limit significantly resources for public investment and social
spending.

CONCLUSION
14.
Guyana’s risk of debt distress remains moderate, but is rising. In the baseline
scenario, debt indicators remain well below their respective thresholds over the projection
period. The PV of external debt-to-GDP ratio increases to around 28 percent in the long run. But
Guyana remains vulnerable to large terms of trade shocks given the concentration of its exports
on a few commodities, and its dependence on imported oil (which also has large implications for
the fiscal sector). Sensitivity analysis and bound tests show high vulnerability of Guyana’s debt to
shocks, in particular, in the case of new loans on less favorable terms and one-time 30 percent
depreciation. Nevertheless, debt service would remain manageable reflecting the high
concessionality of public borrowing. However, under some scenarios and bound tests debt
service could increase significantly, reducing the amount of resources available to public
investment and social spending. In light of the risks associated with plans to significantly increase
expenditure, the authorities should proceed with extreme caution (e.g., by ensuring that the
projects are financially viable and that they increase the economy’s productivity) and improve
debt management. A significant increase in non-concessional debt, including domestic
borrowing, may be needed to finance persistent deficits. That would bring additional risks which
are not captured in this LIC DSA, and warrant close monitoring. The gross public debt to GDP
ratio is projected to reach 60 percent of GDP by 2021, a relatively high level which can bring
heightened financing risks on the non-concessional component.

3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.

Sources: Country authorities; and Fund Staff estimates and projections
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows. Debt forgiveness has significantly reduced the value
of debt and extrapolating the shock leads to negative values in 2034-36, which were set to zero.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Statement by Otaviano Canuto, Executive Director for Guyana
and Veronica Ramcharan, Senior Advisor
May 9, 2016
On behalf of the Guyanese authorities, we thank the IMF team for the constructive
discussions on macroeconomic developments and policy issues in Guyana and appreciate the
frank and open discussions with the mission team that visited Georgetown in February- March
this year.
In an environment of heightened uncertainty and downside risks in the global
economy, the authorities remain vigilant and focused on strengthening macroeconomic and
financial resilience. Guyana’s economy continues to benefit from strong macroeconomic
policies and a strategic reform agenda designed to promote environmentally sustainable and
inclusive growth. Beyond the short term, measures include structural reforms to raise
productivity and labor participation, strengthening institutions and physical infrastructure, and
further advancement of regional and global integration.
Economic Developments and Outlook
Despite numerous challenges and a difficult external environment, Guyana’s
e con om y remains resilient, as evident by a decade of steady growth. The decline in oil prices
has had a significant positive effect on the economy. Along with accelerated activities in the
rice, sugar, gold and construction sectors, this has renewed optimism and confidence in the
business community. Staff projects that GDP growth would increase to 4 percent in 2016 from
3 percent in 2015. However, the authorities are of the view that growth would accelerate at a
faster pace this year to at least 4.4 percent, as the impact of the services sector is being
underestimated by staff in their assessment.
The public investment program is expected to provide a significant boost to the
construction and manufacturing sectors. Despite the decline in contribution from the rice and
sugar industries as a result of external shocks, the authorities are currently assessing the
viability of diversifying these sectors towards downstream value added products, which can
boost GDP growth over the medium term and become an important source of fiscal revenue.
Pertaining to the significant oil and gas discoveries off the coast of Guyana, the
authorities took the initiative to undertake exploration and other capacity building efforts. They
are currently assessing the feasibility of developing an LNG facility to refine the gas. This
investment will bring fruitful rewards to the Guyanese people through increased fiscal
revenues, employment and income, which will propel Guyana towards achieving sustainable
development goals and mitigate the country’s exposure to any subsequent increase in oil prices.
In addition, an Oil and Gas Committee was established in February 2016 and charged with
developing the sector. In addition, external assistance is being sought to establish a Sovereign
Wealth Fund and supporting legislation. It should be noted that the authorities h a v e taken an

extremely conservative stance and have not factored in the possible future revenues from oil
the gas into their medium-term framework.
On the external front, reserve coverage is expected to remain broadly adequate and the
authorities agree with staff that the current account deficit is broadly in line with its norm and
that the real exchange rate is appropriate. The current exchange rate regime has served the
country well. The exchange rate is market determined and the Bank of Guyana (BOG)
intervenes on occasion, but only to smooth excess volatility in the foreign exchange market.
Fiscal Policy
The authorities are determined to promote robust economic growth while committing
to prudent fiscal policies. Guyana’s fiscal balance improved considerably in 2015, underpinned
by the rebound in revenue collection. The primary balance registered a 0.8 percent of GDP
surplus in 2015 from a 4.8 percent of GDP deficit in 2014. The overall Non- Financial Public
Sector (NFPS) deficit improved considerably from 5.7 percent of GDP in 2014 to just 0.2
percent of GDP in 2015.
The fiscal deficit is projected to remain between 5 and 6 percent of GDP over the
medium term. Given the ambitious development agenda undertaken to bridge the significant
infrastructure gap and address unmet social needs, the authorities intend to carefully calibrate
their consolidation strategy to limit the adverse impact on the debt-to-GDP ratio, without
forfeiting their objectives. They continue to improve their debt management strategy and
emphasize that they will refrain from utilizing non-concessional external borrowing. Private
sector funding would be mobilized through the increased use of well-designed private public
partnerships.
The Ministry of Finance instituted a macro-fiscal framework to aid in the fiscal
diagnosis of the economy and to enhance projections for the real sector over the medium term.
The outlook is positive for the coming years. Prudent and targeted expenditure, coupled with
more effective revenue collection and a sustainable debt position, will continue to
underpin
fiscal policy. The government is determined to push ahead with its diversification drive in all
sectors of the economy, upgrade infrastructure and promote structural reforms, to lay the
foundation for progressively higher and inclusive growth. These measures will also mitigate the
country’s exposure to volatile global commodity prices and climate-related challenges.
An amended Fiscal Management and Accountability Act was passed and implemented
in 2015, paving the way for the financial autonomy of constitutional bodies. The government is
examining the establishment of a Parliamentary Budget Office to support the functioning of
Parliament and has established a Tax Review Committee charged with providing a range of
recommendations to improve the taxation system. The first report from the Committee
recommended several measures that were already delineated in the 2016 budget. This has been
done in conjunction with other revenue enhancing measures which include streamlining the

operational efficiency of the Guyana Revenue Authority (GRA) and amendments to several
pieces of pertinent legislation.
Financial Sector Reform
Last year, the authorities requested the Fund to conduct a new Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP). The scoping mission was completed during the latter part of
2015, with the actual financial sector assessment commencing this month. The FSAP findings
will guide the reforms to the macro-prudential framework.
The authorities are committed to supporting the development of the financial sector and
promote financial inclusion. Since the 2006 FSAP, the authorities have brought insurance
companies and the New Building Society (NBS) under the supervision of the BOG. In order to
promote financial inclusion and deepen the financial sector, the BOG has begun to license
money service operators located outside of Georgetown, to facilitate businesses and individuals
who reside in rural areas. Also, as part of the financial consumer protection initiative, the
outreach of the National Financial Literacy Program has been broadened. The authorities are
also assessing the feasibility of agency banking to allow local non-banks to provide some
financial services in rural communities and will promote the expansion of mobile banking.
The BOG is currently moving towards Basel II implementation and intends to move
to Basel III in the near future, to strengthen the regulatory framework and align banks’ capital
requirements with internationally recommended best practices. In addition, through the
Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening Initiative (FIRST) of the World Bank, the BOG is
receiving technical assistance to strengthen supervision of the non-bank financial institutions
and insurance companies. The initiative aims to close gaps in the supervisory perimeter,
regarding prudential and non-prudential standards, and to build supervisory capacity, as well
as facilitate the development of a legal and institutional framework for market conduct and
financial consumer protection. The BOG is currently in the process of rolling out a deposit
insurance guarantee scheme. The authorities plan to pass the revised draft insurance act by
end-2016, which was prepared with technical assistance from the World Bank, and is intended
to correct regulatory and supervisory failures that were highlighted by CLICO’s bankruptcy.
The authorities continue to cooperate with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)
and the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF) to fully comply with all outstanding
deficiencies related to its Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism
(AML/CFT) regime and become compliant with the FATF Revised Recommendations. In
2015, the National Assembly passed legislation and guidelines on terrorism and terrorist
financing and have fully satisfied five of the eight elements of the Action Plan and partially
satisfied the remaining three. In December 2015, Guyana passed further amendments and
regulations, including guidelines on freezing, unfreezing and providing access to frozen funds.
The Financial Intelligence Unit is being restructured, to streamline the functions with those
specified in the FATF Recommendation. The authorities have also initiated a National Risk

Assessment Exercise with technical assistance and guidance from the World Bank. The
outcome will facilitate the implementation of appropriate risk management and risk mitigation
policy strategies.
The de-risking phenomenon continues to be a source of concern for the authorities.
However, while they agree that the current AML/CFT framework needs to be further
strengthened – the deficiencies are expected to be rectified by the end of June 2016 – they wish
to highlight that this does not guarantee that there will be a resolution to the issue. The
authorities continue to call on the Fund to play a more active role in finding a solution and
addressing the needs of its membership.
Structural Reforms
Taking into account policy constraints, the authorities have targeted initiatives in areas
that can deliver the greatest growth return. These include bridging the divide between
coast
and hinterland; investing in traditional and new industries; improving the conditions for private
sector growth and job creation; enhancing the education system and the skill levels of the
workforce; improving healthcare and caring for vulnerable sections of the population. Within the
medium-term monitoring and evaluation strengthening initiative, it is now mandatory for all
Ministries to report on their key performance indicators against set targets, while Budget
Agencies and Regions must develop and implement strategic plans that are monitored through
performance indicators and adopt Performance Monitoring Frameworks.
The authorities remain committed to restructuring public enterprises to reduce their
reliance on government support. The re-engineering of the Guyana Sugar Company
(GuySuCo) to a new business model aims to reduce inefficiencies and place operations on a
financially sustainable path. Planned budget transfers have been substantially reduced for 2016
and are expected to steadily decline and eventually cease over the medium term.
With regard to the public utility Guyana Power and Light (GPL), the authorities are
moving ahead with the necessary reforms to improve its efficiency, upgrade outdated
infrastructure and strengthen governance. The government is negotiating a power purchase
agreement (PPA) with a private developer for a $50 million wind farm which is expected to
provide a significant power increase to the national grid. The project will provide energy at less
than half of the current cost, which will translate to lower electricity tariffs to consumers.
In collaboration with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the government has
developed a draft energy matrix – to be finalized in 2016 – indicating the most suitable blend of
energy options to boost the resilience of the energy sector. One option presented in the matrix
was the reconfiguration of the Amaila Falls Hydro Project, which was determined to be unviable
in its current configuration. Discussions are currently ongoing with a bilateral partner pertaining
to a final review and determination of the future of the project. In line with their policies to
promote green energy, the authorities have prioritized the construction of four mini-hydro power

stations, which are expected to play a central role in hinterland electrification.
The authorities continue to promote competition and economic diversification. They
plan to liberalize the regulatory framework for telecommunications and ICT services, and have
already allocated funding towards the establishment of a Centre of Excellence in Information
Technology (CEIT). They have also undertaken several projects to improve the business
environment, which include the implementation of the Micro and Small Enterprise
Development (MSED) initiative and the development of a Single Window Automated
Processing System (SWAPS).
The authorities have recognized that strong data systems and data rich information are
critical to policy formulation. As such, resources have been allocated to improve the capacity of
the Bureau of Statistics to undertake critical surveys and generate timely socioeconomic
statistics.
