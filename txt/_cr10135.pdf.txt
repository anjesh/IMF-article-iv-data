DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
and Request for a Stand-By Arrangement
Prepared by the Western Hemisphere Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Rodrigo Valdés and Dominique Desruelle
October 26, 2009
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


Backdrop. A financial crisis in 2003 (fueled by the failure of several fraud-ridden banks) led to a
generalized loss of confidence and a major bailout that doubled public debt. An SBA (2003-05) went
quickly off-track. However, confidence improved after President Fernández took office in mid-2004 and
his new administration designed a strong economic program supported by another SBA (2005-08) that
successfully stabilized the economy. President Fernández was re-elected in 2008 and continued with
broadly adequate macro policies but the global financial crisis is threatening growth prospects and stability.



2008 Article IV. The last consultation was concluded in January 2008. At that time, Directors commended
the authorities for the impressive recovery from the 2003 financial crisis. They considered the main policy
challenge was to better target social spending, while generating primary fiscal surpluses to lower public
debt to pre-crisis levels.



Developments. The economy grew 5¼ percent in 2008, but decelerated to 1½ percent in the first half of
2009. Inflation rose to 15 percent (yoy) in August 2008, and then fell to –1½ percent in September 2009.
Monetary policy switched from a tightening cycle in 2008 to a loosening stance in 2009. Fiscal policy was
expansionary and the consolidated public deficit more than doubled to 4½ percent of GDP in 2008 and
then fell to about 3 percent in the first half of 2009 (on an annual basis). The external current account
deteriorated to almost 10 percent of GDP in 2008 due to higher food and fuel prices but has improved in
the first half of 2009 as import demand fell and the terms of trade improved.



Policies. The authorities intend to implement a strong macroeconomic program and a well-balanced
structural reform agenda to face the adverse external environment. Staff stressed the need to enhance
mechanisms to respond to the global financial crisis and recommended a fiscal stimulus in 2009 and the
first half of 2010 as well as the continuation of a flexible monetary and exchange rate policy while
deepening structural reforms to secure macroeconomic stability.



SBA Request. The authorities are requesting a 28-month SBA for SDR 1,094.5 million (500 percent of
quota). The main objectives of the program are to pursue short-term countercyclical policies while
strengthening medium-term sustainability; reduce vulnerabilities exposed during the global crisis, and lay
the foundations for a gradual recovery and sustained growth.



Discussions. These took place during August 24-28 in Washington and September 4-17, 2009 in Santo
Domingo. The mission met with Central Bank Governor Valdez, Finance Minister Bengoa, Economy
Minister Montás, senior government officials, representatives of the banking community, and the private
sector. The staff team consisted of A. Santos (head), G. Bannister, M. Dehesa, A. Alichi, (all WHD),
K. Hosono (SPR), and M. Cortes (MCM). J. Estrella (OED) participated in the meetings.

I. TRENDS, DEVELOPMENTS AND VULNERABILITIES
A. Introduction
1.
Context. The global economic and financial crisis has significantly worsened the shortterm economic prospects and may jeopardize some of the achievements of the last 5 years.
Economic recovery from the 2003 financial crisis has been impressive. Real GDP grew
40 percent in the last 5 years, one of the highest expansions in Latin America and the best
performance of the Dominican economy in the last quarter of a century. Inflation fell from over
40 percent in 2003 to 4½ percent in 2008. Fiscal deficits have been cut in half, from almost
9 percent of GDP for the consolidated public sector in 2003 to about 4½ percent in 2008. The
public debt-to-GDP ratio was reduced by almost one-half, from about 60 percent in 2003 to
35 percent in 2008. However, social progress remains a challenge, and despite recent
improvements, poverty indicators are still weaker than before the 2003 crisis.
2.
Program. To safeguard the achievements of the last several years, and against the
background of unfavorable external conditions, large uncertainties and a sizable balance of
payments need, the authorities are requesting a 28-month SBA for 500 percent of quota
(SDR 1,094.5 million). The objectives of the program are twofold: first, to conduct countercyclical policies at the beginning of the program (from the last quarter 2009 to the first half
2010) to mitigate the drastic economic downturn; and second, to address debt and fiscal
sustainability issues in the latter part of the program (after mid-2010), while embracing an
ambitious structural reform agenda. Successful implementation of a Fund-supported program
will unlock significant financing from other multilateral sources.
B. Economic Conditions
3.
Output. Following a period of high economic growth of some 9½ percent per year in
the period 2004-07 and 5¼ percent in 2008, growth slowed significantly to 1½ percent year-onyear (yoy) in the first half of 2009, in line with other economic slumps in the region. The rapid
deceleration was the result of the global credit crunch, a weak external demand and a
procyclical fiscal policy, which

Sectors. The economic slow down was
broad based, with manufacturing, trade
and financial services being the most
affected.

4.
Inflation. There are disinflationary
pressures due to the unwinding of supply shocks
and the cooling off of the economy. While supply
shocks (mostly on food and fuel) took headline
inflation to 15 percent in August 2008 (yoy), the
reversal of these shocks, in addition to a
tightening of monetary policy, brought inflation
down to 4½ percent in December 2008 (a
10½ percentage point disinflation in 4 months).
Inflation continued falling in 2009 as the
economy decelerated further and inflation in
September 2009 turned negative (–1½ percent
yoy), while cumulative inflation in the first
9 months of the year amounted to 4⅓ percent.
However, core inflation (which excludes food
and energy prices) has been less volatile, rising
to 9¼ percent in August 2008 (yoy) as the effects
of the supply shocks began to affect expectations
and other prices in the economy, and falling to
8½ percent in December 2008. Despite a
loosening of monetary policy in 2009, core
inflation fell further to about 3 percent in
September 2009 as domestic demand remained
weak.

5.
Fiscal position. Against the background of
lower tax collections and higher energy subsidies,
fiscal policy was relaxed significantly in 2008 and
the overall deficit of the consolidated public sector
(including the quasi-fiscal deficit of the central
bank) more than doubled (from 1¾ percent of
GDP in 2007) to 4½ percent of GDP. The relaxed
fiscal stance was reversed in the first half of 2009
due to financing constraints, and the deficit shrank
to some 3 percent of GDP (on an annual basis),
but the broad procyclicality of the policy
continued.



Revenues. Tax collections declined by 1½ percent of GDP in 2008 due to one-off
extraordinary capital gains tax in 2007 and the introduction of exemptions aimed at
improving competitiveness. Non-tax revenues also fell significantly due to the decline
in royalties from the main nickel mine. Tax revenues declined further in the first half of
2009 (over 10 percent in real terms) due to the deteriorating economic environment.



Expenditures. Current spending increased by 1¼ percent of GDP in 2008, mostly as a
result of higher untargeted electricity subsidies due to higher world oil prices, which
amounted to almost 2¾ percent of GDP. During the first half of 2009, current
expenditures fell by 7 percent in real terms with capital expenditures even more
depressed as financing was tight.

6.
Monetary stance. Monetary policy has been largely countercyclical, switching form a
tightening cycle in 2008 when supply shocks (food and fuel) threatened to spill over to other
prices in the economy, to a loosening stance in 2009 when inflation was controlled, and the
economy was softening.


Interest rates. The overnight deposit rate—the main policy rate—was tightened by
200 basis points to 9½ percent during 2008. The policy was reversed in 2009 and the
overnight rate has been reduced by

aggregates are beginning to expand
again, the additional liquidity has not translated yet to further credit to the private sector
as banks and firms have acted cautiously against increased market uncertainties.



Exchange rate and reserves. The gross international reserve position of the central
bank stood at about US$2½ billion at end-2008 (about 2¼ months of imports of goods
and nonfactor services) with limited intervention in the foreign exchange market and a
gradual weakening of the exchange rate. The Dominican peso depreciated about
3 percent against the U.S. dollar at end-2008 (yoy). During the first three quarters of
2009, the level of international reserves was relatively stable and the exchange rate
depreciated further by 1½ percent against the U.S. dollar.

10
7.
Financial system. Banks remain well-capitalized, liquid and profitable. The good
policies of the post-crisis period have enhanced the ability of the financial system to weather
this global storm. Banks continue to be liquid to
insure against the uncertain global economy and

under the unlikely scenario in which the economy contracts by 5 percent.

External accounts. The external position has weakened due to a number of diverse and
recurrent external shocks.


Current account. A severe deterioration in the terms of trade in 2008 (due to higher
food and fuel prices) and a fiscal expansion led to a sharp increase in imports and
doubled the external current account deficit to nearly 10 percent of GDP. While external
demand has weakened considerably, a recovery in the terms of trade (with import prices
falling faster than export prices) and a depressed domestic demand has resulted in an
improvement of the external current account deficit to about 6 percent of GDP in 2009.



Financial account. The large current account imbalance of 2008 was financed by
record high foreign direct investment (FDI) and additional public borrowing, which
limited the reserve loss to some US$300 million in 2008 (less than 1 percent of GDP).
The financial account surplus is projected to be smaller in 2009 due to lower private
flows as external financial conditions deteriorated.

Monetary policy has been expansive in 2009 in response to lower inflationary pressures and
slower economic activity, but credit has not picked up as demand remains dampened.

C. Domestic and External Landscape
9.
Outlook. The prospects for the Dominican economy for the last quarter of 2009 and
2010 are not encouraging given the continued negative impact of the global crisis and the weak
external and domestic demand. Economic conditions are expected to remain depressed, but
improved policies adopted over the last few years and the sound fundamentals would make it
possible for the economy to rebound gradually in the second half of 2010, once the global crisis
is over. The economy is expected to bottom out at the end of 2009 and growth is expected to
bounce back gradually in 2010, although it will remain below potential until 2014. Tourism is
likely to be depressed in the short-run as the global economy recovers gradually and the one-off
increase in tourist arrivals in the second quarter (due to the A-H1N1 influenza virus scare in
Mexico) is not likely to be repeated. The high investment in mining and tourism in the past has
enhanced the capacity in the economy and will facilitate a rebound once external conditions
improve.
10.
Risks. The Dominican Republic continues to be vulnerable to external shocks with risks
tilted to the downside. The incipient global economic recovery could be slower than envisioned
or even stall, reducing tourism receipts and exports, and opening up a financing gap in the
balance of payments as well as putting pressure on the currency. Large movements in the
exchange rate could affect some household and corporate balance sheets that are dollarized and
could further impact consumption and growth. Tighter external financing and higher spreads on
external bonds could also affect the ability to finance a larger fiscal deficit—forcing an early
procyclical fiscal adjustment, and eventually depressing private sector confidence. Although
banking sector indicators reveal a relatively healthy system, a large negative output gap and
high unemployment could further impact bank asset quality and put stress on particular banks.
While only a handful of A-H1N1 influenza cases have been reported, it could depress tourism
demand further if the virus spreads quickly.

14
D. Social and Political Environment
11.
Tensions. The depressed economic conditions are likely to deteriorate unemployment,
poverty and social indicators in the absence of policy actions. There are some social tensions
over low public salaries, and weak delivery of basic services (electricity, water, health, and
public safety). Demonstrations by health care employees over salary increases have intensified
and expanded to other low-paid public employees.
12.
Politics. Political parties continue to discuss the new Constitution proposed by
President Fernández that aims at modernizing the country’s legal system. The new Constitution
includes a chapter on the monetary authority, which enshrines Central Bank independence. A
consensus has been reached to ban consecutive re-election of the president, but to allow a
president to run again after four years out of office. With this provision, President Fernández
will not be allowed to run for a third consecutive term in the 2012 election. Legislative
elections will take place in mid-2010, but there are no polls to predict electoral preferences.
These elections are particularly important as the next legislative term will last 6 years, or
2 years more than previous ones.
II. ARTICLE IV DISCUSSIONS
13.
Focus. The consultation discussions focused on the viability of easing macroeconomic
policies to limit the negative impact of the global economic slowdown, and to regain the path
of high sustainable growth. The authorities and staff recognized the need to achieve fiscal
consolidation over the medium-term; to strengthen financial institutions and regulations (as
highlighted by the recent FSAP update); and to adopt longer-term structural reforms to
strengthen competitiveness and enhance growth prospects. Staff stressed the need to conduct
countercyclical policies while doing the necessary ground work to adopt long-term policies,
including strengthening fundamentals, ensuring debt sustainability and implementing an
adequate reform agenda.
A. Short-Term Macroeconomic Policies
14.
Output gap. Standard estimation procedures indicate that output was about 2½ percent
above its potential in 2008. However, estimates of potential output are subject to large
uncertainties as the adoption of deep structural reforms in the aftermath of the 2003 banking
crises are bound to have a permanent effect on growth fundamentals. With growth projected
between ½ and 1½ percent in 2009, staff estimates that the output gap will be negative by
3 percent by end-2009, bottoming out at -5 percent around mid-2010; the authorities agreed
with that assessment. The emergence of a negative output gap calls for the adoption of more
supportive countercyclical policies (Box 1).

15.
Fiscal impulse. While the public finances are not ideally positioned to engage in
countercyclical policies due to the large deficit of the consolidated public sector in 2008, there
is a strong case for relaxing the fiscal stance in the remainder of 2009 and part of 2010, and
then to start a process of fiscal consolidation once the world economy strengthens and the
output gap begins to close. The 2009 budget is consistent with a consolidated fiscal deficit of
3⅓ percent of GDP. However, in the absence of adequate financing, the budget deficit could be
as low as 2½ percent of GDP, implying a highly procyclical response. Staff estimates that this
policy would entail a negative fiscal impulse of around 1 percent of GDP. The 2010 budget
should also be framed in the context of a relaxed fiscal policy given the large and increasing
negative output gap. The authorities shared staff views and concurred with the need to
strengthen fiscal policy over the medium-term to return to the path of declining debt to GDP
ratios.


Automatic stabilizers. While it is important to allow automatic stabilizers to work on
the economic downturn, there is a risk that the decline in revenues observed in 2008-09
may be partly related to tax evasion and other abuses in the context of the tax
exemptions contained in competitiveness laws. Maintaining tax revenue will thus
require the development of a tax compliance strategy including sustained effort to
improve tax and customs administration and rationalization of tax exemptions.



Discretionary policy. Increases in spending should be focused on social expenditures to
protect the poor, and capital expenditures for the greatest fiscal multiplier effect. A
large proportion of transfers continues to be taken up by the electricity sector, which
will absorb over 1 percent of GDP in 2009. Electricity reform is thus crucial to free up
resources for social and infrastructure investments. The authorities agreed with this
analysis.

16.
Monetary easing. There is limited scope for further cutting of the policy rate given the
aggressive cuts of the first three quarters of 2009. The rapid reduction in policy rates has
resulted in real short-term interest rates (ex-ante) of about zero for 2009-10. Further easing
through interest rates may not be successful in boosting the real economy because of the strong
liquidity preference by banks and the low demand for credit. Moreover, further easing could
compromise exchange rate stability and international reserves. While the central bank should
be satisfying the additional demand for liquidity, the authorities should remain vigilant and
stand ready to gradually withdraw liquidity once the demand for private credit picks up. The
monetary authority broadly agreed with this assessment and stressed that they have a good
track record of switching their policy stance in a timely fashion.
17.
Exchange rate management. Macroeconomic policies have been conducted in a
manner that aims at relative stability of the currency. The Dominican peso has been weakening
gradually against the U.S. dollar (especially since the last quarter of 2008) while remaining
broadly in line with macro fundamentals in the context of their managed floating regime. The
relative stability of the Dominican peso is in sharp contrast to the weaknesses in the other

18
currencies in the region during 2009. The central bank intervenes frequently with small
amounts to reduce the variability of the exchange rate and to ensure the smooth working of the
foreign exchange market, in the context of stable foreign reserves. The authorities see relative
exchange rate stability as an important variable to maintain confidence. In contrast to other
cases, staff does not see currency mismatches as a valid argument to prevent further exchange
rate flexibility. The central bank should be prepared to allow more flexibility in the exchange
rate, especially if the weaker global environment causes further pressures on the balance of
payments. The authorities agreed with this assessment and pointed out that the Dominican peso
has recently fluctuated much more than in previous years as a result of market forces. There
was agreement that the Dominican peso is in line with fundamentals (Box 2).
B. Near-Term Financial Policies
18.
Rationale. Given the disruptive and costly financial crisis of 2003, staff emphasized
the importance of continuing strengthening the financial sector to ensure the efficient and
sustainable intermediation of financial savings in the economy. The authorities acknowledged
the importance of the sector and noted significant institutional strengthening since the 2003
crisis, in particular the improvement in prudential regulations and the strategy to recapitalize
the Central Bank.
19.
Credit flow. Credit to the private sector has been the weakest in many years as a result
of the economic slowdown, bank’s risk aversion, stringent credit policies, and the global credit
crunch. The authorities were encouraged to maintain the lower reserve requirements to
facilitate a higher supply of credit in the economy. The authorities noted that credit conditions
have started to improve, with lending rates falling ten percentage points since the beginning of
the year accompanying the decline in the policy rate, although they considered that they still
need to maintain an expansive policy stance.
20.
Crisis management framework. The FSAP Update mission assessed the crisis
management framework as broadly appropriate, with room for improvements. In particular, the
powers of the Superintendence of Banks (SB) to issue “cease and desist” orders could be
established in law and the terms for the provision of lender of last resort (LOLR) assistance
could be better specified. The framework is largely untested, particularly with regard to the
application of the Systemic Risk Law, and therefore it is recommended that crisis simulation
exercises be conducted to identify gaps, including on coordination arrangements.
21.
Financial soundness. Some financial soundness indicators have shown a moderate
deterioration (e.g., the NPLs ratio rose to 4½ percent in August 2009 from just below 4 at end2008), but the system remains well capitalized (with a capital adequacy ratio of 15 percent),
sufficient to withstand the stress that could be associated with a more pronounced downturn. In
any case, close monitoring of the situation should continue in order to ensure the system
remains solid. The authorities should abstain from adopting forbearance of their norms and
regulations, and the temporary removal of certain loan risk classification requirements

19

Box 1. Dominican Republic: Calculating the Output Gap
The methodology used to calculate the output gap is standard. The output gap is the
deviation of observed output (either actual or expected) from the potential output.
Observed output was calculated as the seasonally-adjusted series of the quarterly GDP
data for 1999:Q1- 2009:Q2 and
Dom inican Republic: Output Gap
program projections until end-2014.
Potential output was calculated by
GDP deviation from potential
8
(percent)
using a Hodrick-Prescott filter to a
6
similar time series.
4

These calculations indicate that the
Dominican economy is currently
below its potential. Real GDP growth
averaged 5.6 percent during 19942008, but is expected to be close to
zero in 2009. While output was above
its potential in 2008, it is estimated to
have fallen below potential in 2009. It
is estimated that the output gap was 2¼ percent in the second quarter of 2009
and that it will bottom out at around 5 percent by mid-2010.

The current negative output gap is
expected to be reduced along with the
recovery in the global economy in the
medium term. With the recovery of the
global economy, Dominican output is
expected to firm up and the output gap to
be closed by 2014. Risks for the return of
output growth to potential are mainly
driven by risks in the recovery of the
world economy.

Box 2. Dominican Republic: Exchange Rate Assessment
Available indicators suggest that the exchange rate is broadly in line with macroeconomic
fundamentals, although there are some statistical uncertainties. A number of different indices
suggest that the real exchange rate depreciated significantly in 2003-2004 in reaction to the financial
crisis, but appreciated back to its pre-crisis level in
2006-2007, and remained relatively stable since then.

remained more depreciated (Figure 1).

Econometric models. These models and other
analysis suggest that the exchange rate is broadly in
line with macro-fundamentals. Using parameters for
emerging market countries, the macro-balance
approach suggests a current account deficit norm of
about 4 percent of GDP. With an underlying current
account deficit of about 4 percent of GDP (taking
into account the temporary shocks from the global
financial crisis and the projected increase in mining
exports) this analysis suggests that the exchange rate
is broadly in line with macroeconomic fundamentals.
The external stability analysis suggests that the
exchange rate is about 3 percent above (i.e.,
overvalued) the rate that would maintain the NFA position at its current level. The fundamental
equilibrium real effective exchange rate analysis suggests that movements of the observed real effective
exchange rate are not statistically different from their long-run fundamentals (although the standard
errors are significant).

introduced early in the year should be allowed to lapse at end-2009.
22.
Central Bank recapitalization. Legislation was enacted in July 2007 to gradually
recapitalize the BCRD and to buttress its credibility. A capitalization of about 20 percent of
GDP was expected to be done in 10 years (an average transfer of 2 percent of GDP per year).
Implementation of the law ran into trouble last year, with the government falling behind in
covering interest payments, in part reflecting a sharp drop in tax revenues and the limited
ability of the government to access domestic capital markets. In view of these difficulties, staff
supported the authorities plan to keep the spirit of the recapitalization plan but to proceed with
an amendment to the law to allow for the recapitalization to take place over 15 (rather than 10)
years, but cautioned that further delays could seriously erode the credibility of the central bank
(Box 3).
C. Medium-Term Structural Policies
23.
Fiscal issues. It will be critical to reinvigorate structural fiscal reforms to facilitate
fiscal consolidation over the medium-term. Staff pointed out that annual consolidated public
sector primary surpluses of about 2 percent of GDP are needed over the medium-term to put the
public debt-to-GDP ratio on a declining path and ensure debt sustainability (see Appendix 1).
To reach this goal the authorities will have to review and strengthen tax policy, revenue
administration, and public financial management. Tax policy priorities include measures to
avoid abuse from recent tax incentives, strengthening criteria for eligibility of tax benefits on
investment, reviewing appropriateness of tax rates, and rationalizing tax exemptions.
Improving customs administration, including updating the customs code and related legislation,
is also a priority. The authorities agreed with this assessment and mentioned that they had
introduced a new framework for public financial management under the previous program, but
some actions are still needed to make the framework operational, including fully implementing
the treasury single account system and a medium-term budget framework. On the expenditure
side, it will be critical to address the problems of the electricity sector.
24.
Monetary anchor. Considerable work is needed to establish a proper monetary anchor.
There is some confusion about the anchor followed by the central bank and the risk of pursuing
multiple objectives. The introduction of a full-fledged inflation targeting regime will clarify
objectives and policy instruments. It will be important to continue with the recapitalization
exercise (even in a modified form) to strengthen credibility of the central bank. As intermediate
steps, it will be important that the central bank establishes a credible medium-term inflation
objective, commits itself to price stability, strengthens communication policy, increases
transparency, and enhances accountability. A proper inflation targeting regime will anchor
expectations and cement a low inflation environment. The authorities are committed to their
inflation objectives (currently between 6 and 7 percent), and mentioned that they have gained

22

Box 3. Dominican Republic: Central Bank Recapitalization
Large interventions during the 2002-03 crisis significantly worsened the capital position of the
central bank (BCRD). To control the liquidity impact of its assistance to banks (for which it
received assets of uncertain quality), the BCRD issued short-term certificates and raised reserve
requirements. As a result, quasi-fiscal losses increased, and the central bank’s capital was eroded to
an estimated minus 20 percent of GDP at end-2005.

certificates. In particular, it mandates that budgetary transfers to cover interest on recapitalization
bonds gradually rise as a proportion of expected GDP (from 0.5 percent of GDP in 2007 to
1.5 percent of GDP in 2017). However, the government was unable to meet fully its recapitalization
obligations in 2008.

A lengthening of the recapitalization period is needed to ensure the government has the ability
to meet its obligations. The level of budgetary transfers associated with a ten-year plan places

25.
Electricity bottlenecks. The electricity sector continues to be a major source of
inflexibility for macroeconomic policy given the significant public subsidies it absorbs each
year.1 Despite recent progress made in the context of projects with the IDB and the World
Bank, the electricity sector has been the Achilles heel of all reform programs. To address
serious shortcomings in the sector, the authorities should aim at a comprehensive reform of the
sector with the objective of generating and distributing electricity at a competitive price while
at the same time eliminating indiscriminate subsidies and increasing cost recovery. This
structural reform should require the appropriate legal framework and the political will to
implement it. The success of such a reform hinges on: (i) enforcing the criminalization of
electricity theft; (ii) revising and making more transparent the contracts between generators and
(public sector owned) distributors that have traditionally resulted in energy prices much higher
than costs for the distribution system; (iii) automatically adjusting consumer tariffs to reflect
costs; (iv) improving governance of the public corporation and the distributors;
(v) disconnecting the amount of subsidies to distributors from their losses (to encourage
efficiency); and (vi) restructuring the public sector distribution companies with a view to lower
their high operational costs and target their investment program in favor of higher efficiency
and capacity. The authorities are aware of the inefficiencies of the current institutional
framework and agreed that indiscriminate subsidies are not a cost-effective way to conduct
policy.
26.
Growth impediments. The Doing Business 2010: Reforming through Difficult Times
report by the World Bank highlights the progress made by the country in reforming some of the
impediments to growth related to business regulations. The business environment improved
substantially in the area of protecting investors, reducing the overall ease of doing business
ranking to 86 from 102 the previous year (out of 183 countries). The gain in the overall ranking
is mostly due to the adoption of a new company law that strengthened investor security by
requiring greater corporate disclosure, director liability, and shareholder access to information.
Nevertheless, significant impediments still exist, particularly in the area of ease of starting and
closing a business as well as registering property. While the Dominican Republic compares
favorably with respect to the average for Latin America (average rank 106) and is similar to the
ranking of the Caribbean region (average rank 83), the authorities intend to work with World
Bank staff to ensure policies are adequate and to keep making progress in the overall ranking.
Staff identified the high cost of borrowing as an impediment to growth, to start new business
1

The government spent 2¾ percent of GDP in electricity subsidies in 2008, or about US$1.2 billion. If these
resources were to be allocated each year as transfers to the poor (about 750,000 families), each family would have
received US$130 a month, which would go a long way toward eliminating poverty in the country (currently
estimated at about 30 percent of the population). This transfer would be more than enough to eliminate extreme
poverty.

24
and to increase private investment in general. The authorities recognize the importance of
eliminating impediments to growth and mentioned their intention to take measures to continue
improving on these indices.
27.
Poverty alleviation. Poverty is still above the pre-2003 crisis levels, and inequality
remains entrenched. About a third of the population is considered to live in poverty. Some
progress was made in reducing urban poverty, but less was achieved in rural areas. Moreover,
spending for human development remains below regional averages, and tends to be procyclical.
A conditional cash transfer (CCT) program (Solidaridad) has made progress in targeting the
poor, but needs to expand coverage, enhance targeting, institutional organization, and
identification of beneficiaries. The conditional aspect of the cash transfer program also needs to
be strengthened to ensure that it improves health and nutrition indicators. The government
should also strengthen the fully subsidized health insurance regime (which covers 1¼ million
individuals), and should increase its coverage to reduce out-of-pocket expenditures among the
poorest members of society, with a view to implement the mandates of the universal health
insurance laws. The authorities agreed with the assessment and reiterated their commitment to
implement polices to alleviate poverty, including under the Solidaridad program.
III. THE 2009-12 ECONOMIC PROGRAM
28.
Goals. In view of the difficult economic situation, the mounting balance of payments
need, and the challenging budget position, the authorities are requesting a 28-month SBA for
500 percent of quota (SDR 1,094.5 million) to support their economic program and unlock
multilateral financing. The program’s objectives are to pursue a countercyclical policy at the
beginning of the program and then to switch focus to sustainability and structural issues in the
remaining period of the program as laid out during the surveillance discussions.2 In view of the
large public sector borrowing requirements and the limited financing available, part of the Fund
purchases will be directed to the budget to satisfy the public sector’s external need. The
program also attempts to meet a large international reserve accumulation need at the central
bank coming from the relatively low level of reserves, and the uncertain external conditions.
The economic program has been designed to address the macroeconomic deficiencies and
institutional weaknesses identified in the current Article IV consultation (Section II). The
technical assistance will be refocused to achieve structural reforms under the program.

2

Broadly speaking, the program will cover 10 quarters (from 2009:Q4 to 2010:Q1). Countercyclical policies will
be the main policy issue in about 30 percent of the time covered by the program (Q4-2009 to Q2-2010), whereas
sustainability issues will be the main policy concern in the remaining 70 percent of the time (Q3-2009 to Q12012).

Macroeconomic framework. The recovery of the world economy is likely to be slow
and it will take some time for external demand to firm up, resulting in low remittances and a

Box 4. Dominican Republic: Fiscal Response to the Crisis
A process of fiscal consolidation began after the 2003 crisis, aimed at reducing the consolidated public debt-toGDP ratio from close to 60 percent of GDP to its pre-crisis level of 25 percent of GDP. This trend moderated
significantly in 2008, when fiscal policy was relaxed as

international prices. In the first half of 2009, fiscal policy was
2
tightened again considerably as a cyclical decline in revenues
and a scarcity of financing led to a sharp reduction in primary
0
spending. Under a passive scenario this policy would have
resulted in a primary surplus of 0.9 percent of GDP for the

year for the Central Administration, an adjustment of almost
2 ½ percent of GDP with respect to 2008. The Fund-4
supported program aims to secure financing for a fiscal
expansion to avoid this procyclical contraction and impart a

Output gap (percent of potential GDP)
The OECD methodology was used to derive a measure of
the fiscal stance.1 Calculations were based on the nonfinancial public sector non-energy primary balance as interest
payments are mostly made to non-residents and changes in
subsidies reflect changes in international oil prices rather than
domestic demand. The primary balance is decomposed into
the cyclical primary balance (the part that moves with the
economic cycle) and the cyclically adjusted primary balance
(the effect of discretionary policy). The change in the cyclical
primary balance represents automatic stabilizers, while the
change in the cyclically adjusted primary balance is the fiscal
impulse.

(0.9 percent) will be due to the fiscal impulse. Fiscal policy will
remain expansionary in the first half of 2010 but, starting mid-2010, it will return to a more sustainable stance as
the economy recovers and the fiscal consolidation planned under the program begins.

quarter of 2009, the authorities’ fiscal program will allow a relaxation of policies of as
much as 2 percent of GDP compared to a passive scenario which assumes no program
(or 1¼ percent of GDP compared to the 2009 budget). This would result in an overall
public sector deficit of about 4½ percent of GDP for the year as a whole, validating
lower tax collections while avoiding further cuts in capital expenditure. The higher
fiscal deficit will be financed by disbursements from the World Bank, IDB and IMF as
well as placements in the embryonic domestic bond market. Staff estimates that the
proposed fiscal policy for 2009 will inject a fiscal impulse of almost 1 percent of GDP,
which is within the norm of countries in the region. For the first half of 2010, the policy
stance will continue to be supportive; the 2010 budget will be executed more quickly
and the program envisages a fiscal stimulus of as much as 2 percent of GDP to contain a
further widening of the output gap (Box 4). There is a risk that the fiscal stimulus of the
last quarter of 2009 is not fully implemented, for that reason fiscal targets are being
established on a cumulative basis for 2009 and 2010 so that the fiscal stimulus can be
carried over to 2010 and is not aborted, while at the same time the quality of the
spending is not compromised.

Actual reserves are below the optimal level needed to withstand a shock equivalent to all short
term external debt and foreign currency deposits. The international reserves shortfall declined in the
recovery phase (2005-07) and is projected to diminish again during 2009-12 under the program thanks
to exchange rate flexibility, improved fundamentals and better debt management. In the absence of an
SBA the gap between optimal and actual reserves would have been around 6½ percent of GDP in 20102012, while with the proposed program the gap would be less than 2 percent of GDP.

finance external debt payments; about ¼ of the SBA will be devoted to budgetary
support (SDR 300 million, of which SDR 200 million will be made available in 2009
and SDR 100 million in 2010), and the remaining ¾ will go to support the international
reserve position of the central bank (SDR 795 million), which still falls short of the
usual metrics of adequacy (Box 5). It is estimated that the Fund will cover about
12½ percent of the financing needed for the fiscal impulse.

It is estimated that the cost of all tax exemptions currently amounts to about 6 percent of GDP; the quantitatively
most relevant exemptions that could be eliminated in the short-run are: (i) the value added tax on imports (0.4
percent of GDP); (ii) exemptions to hydrocarbons (0.9 percent of GDP); and (iii) tariffs (0.2 percent of GDP).
Under the system of preferences for exporting industries (PROINDUSTRIA), certain firms retain the privilege of
not paying VAT at the border but only after sales in the domestic market. The cost of these exemptions is
estimated at 0.2 percent of GDP.

Monetary policy. The immediate policy objective will be to support aggregate demand
by continuing to implement a countercyclical policy while ensuring that inflation is under
control and declines gradually over the medium-term. The authorities proposed a monetary
program that uses base money as the anchor. Given the low level of private credit, the central
bank has reduced reserve requirement and is prepared to increase liquidity by expanding
currency issue by as much as 12 percent in 2009 and 8 percent in 2010 (on the assumption that
some of the 2009 liquidity injection is reversed in 2010). The growth of base money will be
much lower in 2009 than in previous years due to the reduction in reserve requirements (which
increases the money multiplier) but will recover in 2010. The proposed monetary program is
consistent with the central bank’s inflation objective of 6-7 percent for 2009-10 (MEFP ¶ 1617).

expected to have normalized. The central bank is satisfying the higher demand for
liquidity through a reduction in reserve requirements and an expansion of its NDA for
2009 and 2010 (MEFP ¶ 19).



Net international reserves (NIR). Given the severe external shock, the program will
allow for a reduction in NIR of about US$350 million in 2009. Part of the decline in
NIR can be attributed to the use of US$300 million of Fund resources for budgetary
support, as the government will use the resources to pay their debt service in the last
quarter of 2009. For 2010, it is expected that NIR will remain flat for the year as a
whole (despite the government’s use of US$150 million of Fund resources for budget
support) while allowing for some moderate use of reserves in the first half of the year
(MEFP ¶ 18).6 The NIR are expected to rise after 2010 as external and credit conditions
normalize, reducing further vulnerabilities in the economy.

6

The Fund support of the budget will not be recorded in the Central Bank balance sheet as a reserve liability
because it will be an obligation of the central government. For program monitoring purposes, staff will adjust the
Central Bank’s balance sheet to record all the reserve liabilities of the country (with a corresponding peso
counterpart in NDA).

Exchange rate policy. While the exchange rate has depreciated gradually in the recent

(US$0.3 billion)7. For 2010, the
financing requirements will increase to US$3.9 billion, and they are expected to be covered
broadly with private sector flows (US$1.5 billion), public indebtedness (US$2.0 billion,
including a bond placement for US$0.6 billion), and the Fund (US$0.4 billion). Despite the
larger borrowings in the short-term, external debt analysis show that once a proper adjustment
period is allowed, the fundamentals will continue strengthening and the external debt-to-GDP
ratio will return to a declining path (see Appendix I).

7

External financing is on track to meet program projections for 2009. Public sector borrowing through endOctober 2009 is estimated at about US$1.0 billion following the IDB approval of budgetary support loans of
US$0.5 billion in late October. The World Bank’s Board is scheduled to discuss two policy development loans for
US$0.3 billion in mid-November.

32

Adjustor. In recognition of possible delays in disbursements from external sources, the
program will accommodate transitory shortfalls in programmed external financing for up to
US$300 million. Both the program ceiling on net domestic assets and the program floor on net
international reserves of the central bank will be adjusted accordingly (see Technical
Memorandum of Understanding, Attachment 3).
B. Institutional Strengthening
35.
Tax administration reinforcement. Reversing the decline in tax collections of
2008-09 will require a strengthening of tax and customs administration. Staff has tentatively
identified measures in this area that could improve collections without changing tax rates or tax
policy, including: (i) approving a new customs code and related legislation; (ii) implementing a
new organizational structure for the customs and the tax administrations; (iii) strengthening the
audit function; and (iv) modernizing and simplifying customs procedures. The authorities will
design a plan to strengthen customs and internal tax collections by reinforcing tax
administration and rationalizing tax exemptions by March 2010. The authorities are requesting
technical assistance from the Fund to help them in the design of the plan. Once the plan is
designed, it will be implemented in the context of the program and key measures will become
future structural benchmarks (MEFP ¶ 21-23).
36.
Basel criteria adoption. Elimination of forbearance on regulatory requirements will be
key to strengthen credibility. The Superintendence of Banks (SB) has issued most of the
necessary regulations for risk-based supervision, but additional efforts are needed to achieve a
complete implementation of this process. Risk-based supervision allows individual banks to
take different levels of risk as long as

implementation. In addition, the authorities will strengthen the regulatory framework by
developing, by March 2010, a plan to achieve compliance with all of the Basel core principles
for effective supervision by 2012. The authorities are requesting technical assistance from the
Fund for this purpose. The strategy will be implemented in the context of the program and key
steps of the strategy will become structural benchmarks at a later stage (MEFP ¶ 24).

Box 6. Dominican Republic: Structural Issues in the Electricity Sector
The electricity sector in the Dominican Republic has a track record of poor performance. The
distributors have been registering significant losses for

performance is less due to the level of electricity tariffs,

but more due to structural shortcomings, which have led to
very low efficiency in the distribution system. The poor

The major structural impediments in the sector are non-technical and are related to its poor
management structure. Technical losses, related to inefficient transmission of electricity, comprise
only a fraction of total losses in the Dominican electricity distributors and are in line with regional
averages. What differentiates the

costs); badly designed subsidy structure (non-focused subsidies to consumers and moral hazard for
distributors due to expectation of government coverage of losses); low operating efficiency of the
distribution companies; and weak financial planning (there are unnecessary delays in fulfilling financial
commitments, with adverse effects on the sector and economy’s risk rating).
Medium term policies could help tackle these structural issues in the distribution system and
lower the electricity sector’s adverse pressure on public finances. These include: implement the
electricity theft criminalization law, install proper meters and ensure that they are not tampered with or
removed, design fixed price contracts to users whose consumption is hard to monitor, rationalize the
restrictive contracts between distributors and generators, make the tariff changes automatic to reflect
costs, phase out non-focused subsidies and replace them with targeted ones (this has already started with
the elimination of the blackout reduction program PRA and the introduction of BONOLUZ), improve
operational management and governance of distribution companies, and revamp the payment system to
minimize arrears to the generators. Given that public finances are currently under heavy pressure, now it
is relatively more politically feasible to resolve the structural impediments in the electricity sector.

34
37.
Inflation targeting framework. The authorities have been successful in controlling
inflation, but it will be important to continue strengthening institutions and procedures to better
anchor inflationary expectations and be able to implement a full-fledged inflation targeting
framework by the end of the program. The authorities will create a plan by June 2010 to
formally adopt an inflation targeting regime in early 2012. The authorities are requesting
technical assistance from the Fund for this purpose. Implementation of the strategy will become
structural benchmarks for the remainder of the program (MEFP ¶ 24).
38.
Electricity sector policy. The shortcomings in the electricity sector are well known and
the sector has been the weakest reform area in previous programs. The authorities intend to
eliminate indiscriminate electricity subsidies by 2012. They are in the process of creating a
commission led by the minister of economy to oversee all aspects of this reform. The
authorities will present a strategy paper on how to conduct electricity sector reform with a view
to eliminating untargeted subsidies by end-December 2009. The authorities will request
technical assistance from the IDB and the World Bank for this purpose. As in other cases,
implementation of the strategy will become structural benchmarks later on in the program
(MEFP ¶ 26) (Box 6).
39.
Developing domestic capital markets. While the financial system continues to
improve, private investment could grow faster if borrowing costs were reduced. The
authorities’ efforts to achieve fiscal consolidation over the medium term will go a long way
towards reducing long-term interest rates and foster private investment. However, there is room
for action in the short-run as market conditions do not reflect (at times) the underlying
fundamentals of the economy. To address this issue, the authorities will design by September
2010 a plan to: (i) develop capital markets; (ii) adopt a debt management strategy; and
(iii) reduce the perception of country risk and the borrowing costs in the economy, including by
having greater communication with international capital market participants. Implementation of
the strategy will become structural benchmarks for the remainder of the program (MEFP ¶ 27).
C. Social Safety Net Reinforcement
40.
Conditional cash transfers program enhancements. Against the background of
deteriorating economic conditions, the authorities intend to strengthen significantly the social
safety nets and the conditional cash transfer (CCT) programs to reduce the social cost of
unemployment and other economic hardships. The government has committed to increase the
expenditures for education and health by ¾ percent of GDP a year during 2010-12. In addition,
the government will increase the coverage of the CCT program by 70,000 families and will
increase the transfer to some 45,000 families already covered by the program by December
2009 (MEFP ¶ 28).

35
IV. SURVEILLANCE AND PROGRAM ISSUES
A. Medium-Term Scenario
41.
Baseline scenario. The economy is expected to recover by 2011 and to grow at the
average rate of 6 percent thereafter. The output gap is expected to disappear by 2014. Under the
baseline scenario, inflation will come down gradually to align with world inflation and will stay
at around 3 percent. Fiscal consolidation efforts will be completed by 2012 and the
consolidated public sector will generate a primary fiscal surplus of 2 percent of GDP, enough to
put the public debt-to-GDP ratio on a declining path. Public debt will go up to 40 percent of
GDP in 2010-11 but will come down to 35 percent by 2014 and 30 percent by 2020. On the
external front, the economy will adjust to higher oil prices and exports will rebound, in line
with the world economy, reducing the external current account deficit to about 4 percent of
GDP, mostly financed with private flows (especially FDI).
B. Program Modalities
42.
Access. The severity of the shocks, the magnitude of the balance of payments need, the
uncertainty created by the global crisis, and the length of the global slow down justifies having
a longer and larger arrangement. The authorities and staff believe that an arrangement covering
most of the remainder of President Fernandez’s term will help insulate the country from undue
expenditure pressures, while providing the

the global economy recovers and
uncertainties in the external environment ease. It is estimated that Fund purchases under the
SBA will cover about ¼ of the balance of payments need of the country in 2009-10. The SBA
will also catalyze disbursements from other international financial institutions that altogether
will cover almost ¾ of the balance of payments need in the same period (with the remaining
amounts being covered by the placement of a sovereign bond and the SDR allocation).

36
43.
Safeguards assessment. An update safeguards assessment of the Banco Central de la
Republica Dominicana has been initiated in accordance with Fund policy. The update
safeguards assessment is expected to be completed by the time of the first program review.
44.
Working groups. The authorities intend to create an inter-institutional task force with
staff from the central bank, the ministry of finance, and the ministry of economy to monitor
program implementation and report to policy makers on a timely basis. In addition, there will
be a program monitoring group consisting of members of the staff and the authorities to ensure
that the program is properly implemented and to identify problems at an early stage. The
monitoring group is expected to meet every other week through video conference and to share
information and ideas.
C. Miscellaneous Issues
45.
Capacity to repay the Fund. Notwithstanding the rather low NIR, the Dominican
Republic’s capacity to repay the Fund is strong. The repurchase burden remains at a
comfortable level, and the DSA suggests that the relatively low level of current public debt
(about 35 percent) will increase through 2012 and then decline for the rest of the decade. The
Dominican Republic’s debt burden is one of the lowest in the region (even after the SBA
purchases). The government is fully committed to macroeconomic stability and prudent
policies, and has never had arrears to the Fund.
46.
Post program monitoring. At the time of the last SBA review in January 2008, the
level of Fund credit outstanding was 190 percent of quota. In line with Fund policies (at that
time) which expected countries with Fund exposure above 100 percent of quota to engage in
post program monitoring (PPM), the IMF Executive Board took the decision that a PPM was
needed in August 2008. The first PPM review was completed in January 2009 with the
expectation that the second review would take place 6 months later. However, access limits
were modified in March 2009 and the threshold for PPM was raised to 200 percent of quota.
Against this background, and given the new SBA request, no further PPM is warranted.
47.
Exchange system. The Dominican Republic has accepted the obligations of Article
VIII, sections 2, 3, and 4, and does not have restrictions on payments and transfers for current
international transactions nor multiple currency practices.
48.
Statistical issues. The Dominican Republic subscribes to the General and Special Data
Dissemination Standards. Economic data are generally adequate for surveillance and program
monitoring, although there are several areas where data provision could be improved (including
timeliness of fiscal data, accuracy of imports data, expanding private capital flows databases,
measurement of credit of cooperatives, and the activities in the country of offshore branches
and subsidiaries of financial groups). A Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes
(ROSC) on statistical issues was presented to the IMF Executive Board in 2006.

37
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
49.
Overall. The Dominican economy has been hit by a number of exogenous shocks: the
food and fuel price shock in 2008, and the global financial crisis in 2009. These shocks were
unprecedented in level and scope and (at times) overwhelmed the authorities’ ability to
respond. The monetary authority was quick to tighten policies in 2008 to contain inflation and
prevent a spill over of price pressures and inflation expectations to other goods, and then
loosened policies swiftly in 2009 once the economy softened. However, the fiscal authority
faced a number of inflexibilities that prevented them from reacting adequately. Price rigidities
magnified electricity subsidies in 2008 to very large levels and lack of financing forced the
authorities to follow an inadequate procyclical budgetary stance for the first 3 quarters of 2009
(repeating the same procyclical pattern of 2008). Nevertheless, the program designed by the
authorities addresses these shortcomings by adopting a more flexible and countercyclical policy
response while at the same time providing an exit strategy to reduce public indebtedness and
return to long-term sustainability.
50.
Fiscal. An adequate fiscal response is the centerpiece of the program, which aims at
pursuing expansive policies in 2009-10. The Fund-supported program will catalyze financing
from multilateral development banks and international capital markets. The program’s fiscal
stimulus is appropriate given the need to cushion the economy from the effects of the weak
global economy and facilitate its recovery in the second half of 2010. However, the
implementation of the program will be challenging. The authorities’ ability to tap domestic and
international bond markets will depend in large measure on establishing a credible track record
of performance early on in the program with well-targeted expenditures (predominantly in
capital and social spending). Similarly, the implementation of fiscal structural reforms and the
electricity reform will greatly facilitate the achievement of the fiscal targets under the program
after 2010 to bring the primary fiscal balance up to 2 percent of GDP, ensuring sustainability
and lowering the debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium term. The authorities have signaled their
commitment to these reforms, and they are well-advised to begin these reforms as early as
possible to fully reap the benefits of these policies later on in the program.
51.
Monetary. The central bank is quickly becoming a flexible monetary institution able to
adopt appropriate policies in a timely manner. The management of policies in 2008 and 2009
demonstrated that it has come a long way from the old days of handling banking problems and
financial crisis in 2003. While the pass-through from the exchange rate to prices remains high
in the Dominican Republic, the central bank still needs to gradually introduce more flexibility
in the exchange rate to avoid giving the impression that the monetary anchor in the economy is
the exchange rate (this is especially important giving the relatively low level of gross
international reserves by regional and international standards). The program proposed by the
authorities will provide a good opportunity for the central bank to demonstrate that it can
strengthen its policy framework and can credibly introduce an inflation targeting regime.
Dollarization continues to be a challenge and it is expected to decline gradually as the policy
framework is strengthened. It will be equally important that the government stand by their

38
commitments to finalize the recapitalization of the central bank, even if it is under a modified
schedule that would require 15 rather than 10 years.
52.
Financial. The FSAP update indicated that there have been significant improvements in
the regulation, supervision and financial strength of the banking system. It has been reassuring
to find out that in the middle of a global credit crunch, Dominican banks remain liquid, solvent
and profitable. It will be important to continue monitoring the banking system closely and to be
prepared to take the necessary measures to prevent any systemic problem.
53.
External. The external shocks have generated large balance of payments needs that are
being covered by this program. It will be important to maintain a strong implementation of the
program to avoid compromising any of the secured financing. The current account deficit is
expected to remain high at about 6 percent of GDP in 2009-10 and will continue to be a source
of vulnerability, especially if oil prices increase beyond program projections. An additional
concern is the timing of the rebound in tourism. While the world economy is expected to
continue with a shallow recovery in 2010, tourism demand may take longer to pick up as
potential tourists may still need to deal with high levels of indebtedness, reductions in their
wealth, or lack of a job in their home countries. Over the medium term, the outlook is more
positive; the Dominican Republic is believed to have relatively large mining reserves of gold
that are likely to attract large direct foreign investment, which in turn will generate significant
foreign exchange for the country. NIR accumulation will become significant after 2010, which
would help to reduce vulnerabilities further.
54.
Structural. The structural reform agenda is adequate, ambitious and diverse. It strikes
the right balance between fiscal, financial, growth and poverty concerns. It also presents an
approach that is bound to enhance ownership in the agenda by emphasizing the design of plans
and strategies by the authorities themselves which they need to implement later. The proper
implementation of the reform agenda will require a high degree of coordination among the
different policy makers involved. This will provide an excellent opportunity for the interinstitutional working group in Santo Domingo to identify problems ahead of time and to ensure
proper implementation of the program.
55.
Vulnerabilities. There is the evident risk that the authorities may implement the first
phase of the program (countercyclical policy) and not the second part (sustainability issues).
However, the authorities are fully committed to the implementation of the whole program as
they will be reaping the benefits of the reforms. This is a difficult program that will require a
large level of coordination; there is a risk that the authorities run into capacity constraints. Early
work on developing strategy papers for the implementation of structural reforms will be key to
avoid slippages. In addition to the economic risks, there are also political and social
uncertainties. On the economic side, the global recovery may be softer or the world economy
may deteriorate further. On the political side, there are congressional elections in mid-2010 and
the government may be under pressure to spend beyond program projections. On the social
side, the situation is tense and pressures to increase current spending may compromise capital

39
expenditures and the objectives of the program. Because of these risks, it will be important that
the government explain to the population all the elements of the program. In this sense, the
success of the program will depend not only on the authorities determination to strongly
implement the reforms contained in the program, but also on their ability to communicate
policies appropriately and persuade stake holders about the merits of the policies adopted.
56.
Staff position. On program issues, staff supports the authorities request for a new SBA.
The authorities’ program strikes a good balance between short-term business cycle
considerations and medium-term structural and sustainability issues. Achieving the ambitious
objectives of the program will require sustained efforts on the part of the authorities and the full
support of the international community. On surveillance issues, staff proposes that the next
Article IV consultation take place within the 24-month cycle subject to the provisions of the
decision on Article IV consultation cycles.

ANNEX I: SUMMARY OF ANNEXES
Fund Relations
As of end-September 2009, the Dominican Republic’s outstanding obligations to the Fund
amounted to SDR 288.94 million (132 percent of quota), which remain from the latest Fund
Stand-By Arrangement (SDR 437.8 million) approved January 31, 2005. The last Article IV
consultation was concluded on January 30, 2008 and the First Post-Program Monitoring
Review was concluded on January 12, 2009. FAD, MCM and STA have provided substantial
technical assistance since 2004 and an FSAP Update was conducted in March 2009 (the
original FSAP was conducted in 2001). A safeguards assessment of the Central Bank of the
Dominican Republic (BCRD) was completed in 2005, and an updated assessment will be
completed before the first review under the proposed arrangement. The earlier safeguard
assessment noted that the BCRD implemented a number of recommendations from earlier
assessments, but also identified vulnerabilities mainly in the areas of internal controls over
the reporting of monetary data to the IMF, financial reporting and external audit. The
Dominican Republic has not yet ratified the Fourth Amendment.
Relations with the World Bank Group
As of September 30, 2009 the World Bank’s total loan commitments in the Dominican
Republic amounted to US$326.2 million of which US$234 million remains to be disbursed.
The loan portfolio consists of ten loans: seven for investment, two for Technical Assistance,
and an Emergency Recovery Loan. Two Development Policy Loans (DPLs) have recently
been negotiated (Public Finance and Social Sector; and Performance and Accountability of
Social Sectors) and their congressional ratification is expected before the end of 2009.
Portfolio performance in the Dominican Republic is improving, with the disbursement ratio
at 14 percent as of October 2009, above the regional (Latin America and the Caribbean)
average.
Relations with the Inter-American Development Bank
As of October 9, 2009, the IDB’s loan portfolio amounted to US$604.7 million of which
$303.1 was undisbursed. On October 21, 2009 the IDB approved a Financial Emergency
Loan to support a Fiscal Strengthening Program for US$500 million, of which
US$300 million will be disbursed in 2009 and the remainder in 2010. The IDB is currently in
the final stages of the design of the IDB Country Strategy for the period 2009-2012.
Statistical Issues
Economic data reported to the Fund are generally adequate for surveillance purposes, but
there are some weaknesses which are currently being addresses with the help of STA
technical assistance. The Dominican Republic has participated in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) since November 2005.

APPENDIX 1. DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
External debt sustainability
External debt appears to be sustainable in the medium-term, although the external debt-toGDP ratio is expected to increase in the short-term as economic growth slows and sizable
public external borrowing takes place to smooth the adjustment to the external shock. Over
the medium-term the external current account deficit is expected to decline as: (i) tourism
and remittances recover with the global economy; (ii) exports grow as the benefits of
CAFTA-DR and significant foreign direct investment in the mining industry begin to bear
fruit; and (iii) prudent fiscal and monetary policies and structural reforms are implemented
under the program. Foreign direct investment and support from official creditors are expected
to be sufficient to finance the reduced level of the external current account deficit over the
medium-term.
Public debt sustainability
Despite the temporary run-up in public debt as a result of the current crisis, fiscal policy
under the program will result in a declining ratio of public debt-to-GDP in the medium-term.
The program calls for a primary deficit of the consolidated public sector of 0.8 percent of
GDP in 2009, gradually moving to a primary surplus of 2 percent of GDP by 2012, and
remaining at this level going forward. Under these assumptions, the ratio of public debt-toGDP would rise to 40 percent by 2010-11, but fall back to its end-2008 level of 35 percent of
GDP by 2014. Maintaining a primary surplus of 2 percent of GDP, and assuming an average
growth rate of real GDP of 6 percent and inflation around 3 percent would gradually bring
the public debt to 30 percent of GDP by 2020.
Bound tests
External and public debt would remain sustainable under shocks represented by standard
bound tests. A combined shock to interest rates, real GDP growth and the external current
account deficit of ¼ of a standard deviation around historical averages would bring the ratio
of external debt to GDP to 32 percent in 2012, before starting to fall again in 2013. A similar
shock to public debt (with interest rates, real GDP and the primary deficit at ¼ of a standard
deviation around historical averages) would bring the ratio of public debt to GDP up to
44 percent in 2013 before starting to fall in 2014. A one-time 30 percent real depreciation in
2010 would increase external debt to 41 percent of GDP and public debt to 50 percent of
GDP in that year, but they would fall to 30 and 45 percent respectively by 2014.

ATTACHMENT 1. LETTER OF INTENT

Banco Central de la República Dominicana
Secretaría de Estado de Hacienda
Secretaría de Estado de Economía, Planificación y Desarrollo
Istanbul, Turkey
October 6, 2009
Mr. Dominique Strauss Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431

Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
Like many economies around the world, the Dominican Republic has been adversely affected
by the global economic crisis and the credit crunch in capital markets, with a deteriorating
external outlook, falling aggregate demand, and lower tax revenues; while the limited
financing for our budget is creating the conditions for a procyclical fiscal response, greatly
constraining our ability to react to these shocks. This letter and the attached memorandum of
economic and financial policies (MEFP) outline an economic program that the Government of
the Dominican Republic intends to adopt to strengthen its capacity to respond to the crisis.
The main objective of this program is to boost economic recovery in an environment of
macroeconomic stability and strengthen our growth prospects by conducting a counter-cyclical
policy in the short-run while achieving sustainability over the medium-term. These efforts are
being supported by the adoption of a reinvigorated structural reform agenda. To this end, we
are requesting a 28-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) through February 2012 in an amount
equivalent to SDR 1,094.5 million or 500 percent of quota (about US$1,700 million) which
will support the program detailed in the attached MEFP.
The previous SBA (2004-07) was very successful and allowed us to recover from the domestic
financial crisis of 2003 and paved the way to achieve high growth with low inflation in the
period 2004-08. In fact, the Dominican Republic grew 40 percent in that period, equivalent to

60

some 8 percent per annum and became one of the fastest growing economies in Latin
America. In our view, the international outlook will remain unfavorable for some time. Thus,
we would like to replicate the past experience of success with the Fund by designing a strong
economic strategy to achieve the highest and most sustainable growth possible for our
economy.
The government believes that the policies set forth in the MEFP are adequate to achieve the
objectives of its program, but it will take any further measures that may become appropriate
for this purpose. The government will consult with the Fund on the adoption of these
measures, and in advance of revisions to the policies contained in the MEFP, in accordance
with the Fund’s policies on such consultation. We will also provide Fund staff with all the
relevant information required to complete program reviews and monitor performance.
The authorities will observe the standard performance criteria against imposing or intensifying
exchange restrictions, introducing or modifying multiple currency practices, concluding
bilateral payments agreements that are inconsistent with Article VIII of the Fund's Articles of
Agreement, and imposing or intensifying import restrictions for balance of payments reasons.
During the period covered by the program, there will be quarterly quantitative performance
criteria (Table 1) and structural benchmarks (Table 2). There will be eight quarterly reviews to
be completed by mid-March, mid-June, mid-September, and mid-December of 2010 and 2011.
These reviews will be associated with the observance of the relevant performance criteria.
We have authorized the Fund to publish this letter and the attached Memorandum of
Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP), to facilitate a wider access and review of our
policies to the international community and to economic agents within the Dominican
Republic.
Sincerely yours,

ATTACHMENT 2. MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
I.

Background

1.
After emerging from the 2003 financial crisis as one of the fastest growing economies
in Latin America, the Dominican Republic was hit by external shocks in 2008 that affected
macroeconomic performance. In the first half of 2008, a sharp deterioration in the terms of
trade due to falling nickel and rising food and energy prices led to sharp increases in the
external current account deficit and an acceleration in inflation. The fiscal position
deteriorated mostly as a result of measures to alleviate the effect of these shocks on vulnerable
groups which generated higher energy and food subsidies, among others, while monetary
policy was tightened to address emerging inflationary pressures. In the second half of 2008, as
the economy was adjusting to the external supply shocks, it was further hit by the effects of
the global financial crisis. Bank lending came to a halt and international trade slowed
considerably reflecting increased risk aversion and the rapid weakening of external demand.
As a result, growth slowed significantly to 5.3 percent for 2008 (compared to almost 9 percent
for 2007), inflation fell to 4.5 percent, the lowest in Latin America (after reaching a high of 15
percent year-on-year in August 2008), and the exchange rate depreciated moderately by 3.5
percent against the US dollar.

II.

2009 Developments

2.
During 2009, the economy has continued to feel the effects of the international crisis,
although it has been one of the best performers in the region. Growth reached 1.4 percent in
the first half of the year, compared to a fall of 1 percent in Latin America as a whole, mainly
due to the expansion of agriculture. At the same time, inflation continued decelerating to
–
0.5 percent year-on-year in August, well below the average for the region, as commodity
prices continued to fall while core inflation remained at around 5 percent.
3.
This resilience of the Dominican Republic economy has in part been due to the timely
and speedy loosening of monetary policy that was implemented since the beginning of 2009.
Following the tightening in 2008, the policy interest rate (overnight) was lowered by 550 basis
points to 4 percent in the first eight months of the year. In addition, reserve requirements were
lowered to promote bank lending to priority sectors. While credit remained stagnant in the first
quarter of the year, as banks preferred to absorb the additional liquidity in the system, there
were signs that bank lending was beginning to recover in the second quarter of 2009, as lower
interest rates stimulated demand for construction and mortgage lending.
4.
Fiscal policy was tight in the first half of 2009 as the cyclical decline in tax revenue
and restrictions in financing limited expenditure. Tax revenues fell by 11 percent in the first

62

semester, due mainly to the decline in imports and the weakening of consumption. At the same
time, primary expenditure fell by more than 10 percent compared to 2008, as electricity
transfers fell (related to the lower cost of fuel) but also due to lower expenditures on goods
and services, and capital spending related to the restrictions in financing. As a result, the
consolidated public sector primary balance for the first half of the year was zero.
5.
Despite the rapid deterioration of the world economy, the exchange rate and
international reserves have remained relatively stable. The external current account deficit
narrowed to around 3.5 percent of GDP on an annual basis in the first half of 2009 (from a
deficit of 10 percent of GDP in 2008), as the decline in exports, tourism and remittances was
offset by an even larger decline in oil and non-oil imports. At the same time, inflows of
foreign direct investment remained strong but lower than in previous years. International
reserves fell by about $150 million (about 6 percent) in the first half of 2009, reflecting mainly
lower disbursements of international financial institutions, while the nominal exchange rate
depreciated by about 3 percent in line with the deteriorated fundamentals.

III.

Medium-Term Macro-framework for 2009-12

6.
The government’s program for 2009-12 aims at implementing a counter-cyclical policy
through an expansionary fiscal stance and an accommodative monetary position in the shortrun, to counteract the effects of the global financial crisis on the economy, and a gradual fiscal
consolidation effort over the medium-term (starting in mid-2010) to ensure fiscal
sustainability and the return of the public debt-to-GDP ratio to a declining path. Monetary
policy will continue to maintain in the short-term an accommodative stance to offset the
effects of the global financial crisis in the economy. At the same time, recognizing the
importance of increasing the potential for growth and sustaining a strong expansion in
economic activity, the program will aim to implement structural reforms in key areas of the
economy. Over the next few months, the government will produce detailed strategy papers in
key areas outlining specific structural measures to be implemented during the course of the
program. The main elements of the structural agenda include:


Institutional reforms aimed at strengthening public financial management to allow the
adoption of a medium-term expenditure framework to support fiscal consolidation. In
addition, higher tax collections will be achieved by improving tax administration,
strengthening enforcement of the legislation on fuel taxes, and limiting tax exemptions
and incentives;



A reform of the electricity sector to improve the efficiency of distribution, eliminate
indiscriminate subsidies and ensure financial viability, reducing its burden on public
finances;

63



Monetary and financial sector reforms, including: (i) technical adjustments to the
ongoing recapitalization of the central bank through amendments to the law while
maintaining the spirit the original draft; (ii) enhancing banking supervision; and
(iii) the implementation of an inflation targeting framework to help safeguard financial
stability, control inflation, and anchor expectations;



A strategy for the development of local debt markets and public debt management that
will improve access to longer term financing and lower the cost of finance for the
government and the Dominican private sector in domestic and international markets,
with a view to improve the rating of the public debt.

7.
The program aims to restore real GDP growth to the robust rates that prevailed before
the external crisis. Output growth is estimated at 0.5 to 1.5 percent in 2009, but recovering to
the 2.5-3.5 percent range in 2010 as the fiscal stimulus takes effect and the economy recovers.
Going forward, real GDP growth is expected to recover to its potential of 6 percent in 2011
and beyond. Inflation pressures for 2009-10 are expected to remain subdued, well within the
original target range that the central bank has established of 6-7 percent, and falling gradually
to the level of main trading partners (3 percent) over the medium-term.
8.
The external current account deficit is expected to fall to around 6 percent for 2009-10,
as the recovery in exports and tourism receipts is partly matched by a recovery in oil imports
and non-oil imports related to investment. In the capital account, flows of foreign direct
investment to the mining sector are expected to continue, while other private financing flows
will remain subdued. Over the medium-term, the external current account deficit is expected
to fall gradually to around 4 percent of GDP, as exports recover with external demand and
mining sector investments for export become operational.
9.
Following the fiscal expansion in 2009-10, the program aims at achieving fiscal
consolidation in the medium-term to bring the debt-to-GDP ratio back to its 2008 level. For
2009 the program aims at a primary fiscal deficit of the consolidated public sector of
0.8 percent of GDP, consistent with an overall deficit of 4.5 percent of GDP (significantly
higher than the deficit of 3.3 percent of GDP which is consistent with the 2009 budget). For
2010 the program aims at a gradual consolidation, bringing the consolidated primary fiscal
balance to zero, mainly through improvements in tax administration and recovery of tax
revenues due to higher economic activity. Going forward, increasing revenue from the
proposed structural reforms and a moderate containment in expenditure (especially energy
subsidies) will lead to a gradual increase in the primary surplus of the combined public sector
to 1 percent of GDP in 2011 and 2 percent of GDP in 2012 and beyond. Under these
assumptions, the overall public debt is expected to increase from 35 percent of GDP in 2008 to
40 percent of GDP in 2011, only to fall to 35 percent of GDP by 2014, and continue declining
in subsequent years.

IV.

Macroeconomic Policies for 2009-10

10.
In order to facilitate the monitoring of the program, the government will establish an
inter-institutional task force with staff from the Central Bank, the Ministry of Finance, and the
Ministry of Economy to monitor implementation and provide timely information to policy
makers on program developments on a high frequency basis.
A. Fiscal Policy
11.
The government intends to implement a countercyclical fiscal policy for the rest of
2009 and the first half of 2010. This will lead to a loosening of expenditures (predominantly in
capital and social expenditures), which have been constrained in the first half of the year by
the fall in tax revenues and the lack of external financing. The program aims at increasing the
fiscal deficit of the central government by about 1.2 percent of GDP (from the level of 1.9
percent of GDP in the original budget) to 3.1 percent of GDP in 2009. This is consistent with a
loosening of the primary fiscal balance from a surplus of 0.6 percent of GDP in the 2009
budget to a primary deficit of about 1.1 percent of GDP in this program. Excluding interest
payments and transfers related to the energy sector (which have little effect on final demand),
it is estimated that this expansion would result in a fiscal impulse of about 0.9 percent of GDP
for 2009 compared to the fiscal stance in 2008. In 2010 the program aims at a gradual
consolidation that would begin in the second half of the year as the economy recovers, leading
to an overall deficit of the central government of 2.6 percent of GDP (consistent with a
primary deficit of 0.4 percent of GDP).
12.
The government will implement a number of measures to improve tax administration
and compliance in 2009-10. A central element of this strategy will be the rationalization and
better implementation of Law 112-00 on hydrocarbon taxation and Law 557-05 (article 23),
which creates the selective ad-valorem tax on fuels to improve tax collections, make more
transparent price calculations, rationalize tax exemptions and transfer the administration of
tax collection to the domestic tax directorate (DGII). It is expected that this change will
produce higher tax collections of 0.2 percent of GDP. Additional revenue enhancing measures
planned for 2009-10, which could yield 0.3 percent of GDP a year, include:


Transfer to DGII collection of taxes under Law 112-00 on fossil fuels until the new
hydrocarbon’s law gets approved.



Control underinvoicing and contraband of fuel products through the creation of an
inter-institutional committee of public sector agencies related to the energy sector to
oversee the functioning of the hydrocarbon sector (Decree 369-09), which will
integrate information from different agencies;

65



The introduction of an information system (impresoras fiscales) to register the value of
cash transactions in commercial establishments such as supermarkets and other retail
outlets, to improve the efficiency and efficacy of collections;



Simplification of tax procedures for small and medium-sized enterprises to improve
compliance and increase the tax base.



Considering the high level of tax exemptions in the country, the government will
review all the legislation that includes tax breaks and tax exemptions with a view to
eliminating those that do not conform with the objective of the legislation.

13.
On the expenditure side, the government will prioritize public investment and social
spending, to maximize the effects of the fiscal expansion on economic activity. In particular,
central government expenditure on wages and salaries will decline gradually after reaching
about 4 percent of GDP in 2009, while current spending on goods and services will remain
stable as a share of GDP. Transfers to the electricity company CDEEE will be limited in line
with reform in the sector, bringing them down from 2.7 percent of GDP in 2008 to 1.1 percent
of GDP in 2009 and no more than 0.8 percent of GDP in 2010. This will allow the government
to increase capital spending to 4 percent of GDP in 2009 (from the depressed levels of the first
half of the year) and 5 percent in 2010, with the aim of promoting important infrastructure
projects, and to increase priority social spending. It will be particularly important for the interinstitutional task force on program implementation to closely monitor the level and
composition of expenditures to ensure the greatest benefit from the fiscal loosening in 200910.
14.
Implementing the fiscal expansion contemplated for 2009 will result in a gross public
sector borrowing requirement of about US$2.8 billion, or around 6 percent of GDP, which is
US$700 million higher than originally contemplated in the budget for 2009. The government’s
financing strategy seeks to secure the multilateral financing originally envisaged in the budget
and gain access to additional multilateral financing through emergency loans and the use of
IMF financing. The bulk of multilateral financing would be used in 2009, with about US$350
million coming from the World Bank, US$450 million from the IDB and US$300 million
from the use of IMF resources for the budget. These resources would be complemented by
some US$250 million from Petrocaribe and around US$550 million of project financing for
public investment, with the remainder coming from domestic bank loans and the domestic
bond market.
15.
For 2010 the program envisages a gross public sector borrowing requirement of about
US$2.6 billion, or around 5.5 percent of GDP, which would be secured through a mix of
multilateral resources and private sector financing. As the program increases the level of
capital spending, the largest source of financing in 2010 will be project financing with
US$700-800 million, followed by multilateral organizations with some US$550 million in
budgetary support (US$250 million from the IDB, US$150 million from the World Bank, and

66

US$150 million from the IMF). Petrocaribe will continue contributing with US$240 million
and some US$100 million are expected from the sale of state assets. The government will
complement its financing requirements through the placement of a bond in international
capital markets for US$500-600 million once conditions improve and spreads fall. The
remaining amounts will come from domestic bank loans and the domestic bond market.
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
16.
After the loosening in the first eight months of the year, the central bank will continue
to maintain an accommodative monetary policy stance to support the fiscal expansion, while at
the same time safeguarding its inflation objective of 6-7 percent for 2009-10. Given the rapid
reduction in interest rates over the last several months, there is limited scope for further
monetary easing.
17.
As the economy recovers in 2010, the central bank will be prepared to adapt its
monetary and exchange rate policy to the new economic conditions with the objective of
preserving macroeconomic stability, prevent capital outflows and safeguard their international
reserves.
18.
The central bank will continue to manage monetary policy within the framework of a
managed floating exchange rate regime. Gross international reserves reached a record level in
2007 and fell significantly in 2008 and in the first months of 2009 due to the international
financial crisis. In the short run, gross international reserves will be replenished gradually and
by end-2010, they are expected to recover the level of 2007. While this level is low for an
economy as open as the Dominican Republic, the authorities consider that, under the current
circumstances, the programmed level of reserve accumulation is consistent with very limited
intervention in the foreign exchange market to avoid undue pressures on the exchange rate as
the economy recovers.
19.
One of the principal objectives of the government’s program is to support the recovery
of domestic credit as economic growth accelerates. Under current circumstances, the shortterm monetary program does not contemplate using the traditional limits on net domestic
assets, to avoid unnecessarily restraining the policy space of the central bank to support the
growth of bank credit. As the economic recovery takes hold in the second half of 2010,
however, the traditional programming ceiling on net domestic assets will be reincorporated to
ensure a growth of monetary aggregates consistent with the program’s inflation objective. The
monetary program envisions a relatively large growth of currency issue in 2009 despite low
inflation and growth to satisfy bank’s demand for additional liquidity and to create the
conditions for higher private credit. The demand for currency issue is expected to moderate in
2010 as conditions in credit markets normalizes. Private sector credit is expected to remain
subdued, growing at around 5 percent per year for 2009-10, before recovering to its historical
level in subsequent years.

67

V.

Structural Reforms for 2009-10

20.
The government’s reform agenda aims to safeguard medium-term fiscal sustainability
while strengthening the institutional framework for financial stability and rapid and
sustainable growth. The government sees these as self-reinforcing objectives that will help
lower the overall cost of finance and improve the growth potential for the economy.
A. Tax Administration Reform
21.
The main focus of public sector reform will be to ensure a return to fiscal sustainability
after the expansion in 2009-10. The government continues to be committed to an ambitious
goal of reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio to the 25-30 percent of GDP range in the mediumterm, considering this to be an optimal level given the vulnerabilities that the economy faces.
To achieve this target, sustained primary surpluses on the order of 2 percent of GDP for the
combined public sector are necessary.
22.
On the revenue side, improvements in the fiscal position will be supported by reforms
in tax administration and a strengthening of customs administration. There will be a higher
level of integration between the two tax collection institutions (DGII and Customs) to
exchange information and exploit synergies. The reform does not contemplate changes in tax
rates to achieve this fiscal objective. The program will contain a structural benchmark on the
design of a tax administration strategy, which will be developed with technical assistance from
the IMF and other institutions by March 2010. The reform will include measures to strengthen
the institutional capacity of the tax and customs authorities and audit and control procedures,
as well as a plan to rationalize tax exemptions.
23.
There is also a need to improve budgetary procedures and expenditure control at the
commitment level for all levels of the government. The design and presentation of the budget
will be enhanced by including the job structure and number of positions in each budgetary
chapter, by better programming and executing expenditures and by developing and gradually
implement procedures to monitor the budget of decentralized agencies, municipalities and
public enterprises. While there is a single treasury account, some expenditure commitments
continue to be unregistered and the treasury account does not cover all levels of the public
sector. The government is committed to improve the coverage and implementation of the
single treasury account and will develop a program for the improvement of public financial
management practices. This program will include the consolidation of all receipts received by
all municipalities and other public institutions as well as international aid and domestic and
external loans (the loans from multilateral financial institutions in foreign exchange will be
exchanged for local currency at the central bank as a way to contribute to the strengthening of
the international reserves and to meet the reserve objectives under the program). The practice
of budgetary advances will be severely restricted.

68

B. Financial Sector Reform
24.
Financial sector reform is essential to support the recovery of economic activity by
facilitating the intermediation of credit, lowering risk and avoiding financial turbulence. The
main elements of the financial sector reform effort will include:


Preparation for the implementation of an inflation targeting framework by early 2012,
to strengthen the credibility of monetary policy and anchor inflationary expectations in
the context of a more flexible exchange rate. The particular elements of this strategy
include, inter alia, the strengthening of an integrated process for macroeconomic
monitoring, forecasting, and policy formulation to enable a shift in the basis for policy
decisions to the medium-term outlook for inflation and growth, and a strengthened
communication strategy to promote understanding of the new policy framework and
the basis for policy decisions. The program will include a structural benchmark for
June 2010 on the formulation of a plan detailing roll-out of these elements over the
next two years.



The government remains committed to the transfer of resources to recapitalize the
central bank in line with the objectives of the BCRD Capitalization Law, recognizing
that this is essential to enhance the credibility of monetary policy and the successful
adoption of an inflation targeting framework while supporting the gradual reduction in
reserve requirements and the build-up of international reserves. However, the
government plans to submit to Congress a limited set of amendments to the law
including technical adjustments and the lengthening of the period of recapitalization
from 10 to 15 years, which will allow for a less onerous schedule of transfers in the
context of an unexpected decline in economic activity in 2009 and 2010, while
following the spirit of the original legislation.



Building on the wide ranging legislative and regulatory reforms for the banking system
of the last few years, the government is fully committed to support continued efforts to
improve supervisory practices as recommended in the recent update to the Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP). In particular, the program will include a
structural benchmark to develop a strategy to deepen and widen the implementation of
risk-based supervision by March 2010. Such strategy will include plans for
strengthening the capacity to asses the quality of banks’ management and riskmanagement policies and practices, the development of comprehensive risk profiles of
banks, and the introduction of supporting changes to the organizational structure of the
Superintendence of Banks. Effective implementation of such a strategy will support
ongoing efforts to preserve and strengthen financial sector resilience, improve
compliance with the Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision, and help
in the effective application of consolidated supervision

69

C. Recovery and Growth Enhancement
25.
It will be important to adopt a number of additional measures to safeguard the
economic recovery while strengthening the growth prospects of the economy. We believe that
measures in the electricity sector as well as those directly aimed at reducing the cost of
borrowing in the economy (other than through monetary policy), including by reducing the
external perception of country risk, should be key to achieve a successful recovery from this
crisis.
26.
Improving the functioning of the electricity sector will enhance the prospects for high
and sustainable growth in the economy by ensuring an adequate and stable supply of energy,
while at the same time supporting the objective of fiscal sustainability by reducing its
dependence on the public finances. The government has begun to develop a strategy for
reform in the sector, in conjunction with the World Bank and the IDB, and will formalize a
program of specific structural reforms by December 2009, which will constitute a structural
benchmark under the program. The main elements of the strategy will include:


Tariff adjustments and the implementation of a more flexible tariff system to cover the
costs of generation and distribution;



Gradually eliminating the generalized electricity subsidy by 2012 and focusing it on
the poor;



Reducing technical losses and improving metering to reduce electricity theft;



Improving management of distribution companies;



Creating a special account to implement government payments to generation and
distribution companies;



Implementing an external audit of the finances of the government distribution
companies, and the corporate unit;



Developing a plan to invest in new generation and distribution capacity.

27.
All of the reforms mentioned above will lower borrowing costs and reduce country risk
to the extent that they improve financial intermediation and reduce financial and fiscal risks.
To complement these reforms the program will include a structural benchmark for September
2010 on the development of a strategy to strengthen public debt management and the
development of local debt markets to enhance access to longer term financing. In addition, the
strategy will include an agenda of additional reforms aimed at improving the government’s
creditworthiness and the credit rating of Dominican Republic sovereign bonds in international

70

markets, thus lowering the financing costs for domestic private sector which uses public debt
as a benchmark.
D. Social Safety Net
28.
As economic conditions deteriorated over the last several quarters, this has created
pressures over the most vulnerable groups of society, especially the poor and the unemployed.
The government intends to strengthen the social safety net by increasing social spending and
prioritizing public investment. The government will increase the coverage of the conditional
cash transfer program by 70,000 families living in extreme poverty and will increase the
payment to over 45,000 families already covered by the program. The government will
increase its spending in health and education by 0.75 percent of GDP a year in 2010-12 with a
view to: (i) increase the coverage of the public health system to include unemployed and
people living in extreme poverty as well as strengthen preventive medical care; and
(ii) increase the number of classrooms and improve maintenance of existing schools.

VI.

Other Issues

29.
The government has no external arrears, and it will regularize all outstanding domestic
arrears, including those with electricity generators, by using the available financial
mechanisms before the end of the year.

ATTACHMENT 3. TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
This Technical Memorandum Understanding (TMU) presents the definitions of the variables
included in the quantitative performance criteria annexed to the Memorandum of Economic
and Financial Policies (MEFP), and the information requirements needed to ensure adequate
monitoring of economic and financial developments.
I. Quantitative Performance Criteria: Definition of Variables
A. Cumulative Floor on the Central Government Balance
The overall balance of the central government covers government activities as specified in the
budget.
Revenues are recorded when the funds are deposited in the Treasury account. Revenues will
also include grants. Central government expenditures are recorded on an accrual basis and
will include transfers to other government units as well as all transfers to the electricity sector.
Interest payments, however, will be recorded on a due basis. Capital expenditure will include
any in-kind capital expenditures defined as the externally financed investment projects
(through loans and grants) in case they are not included in the execution of the budget.
The balance of the central government will be measured from “below the line” as the change
in the central government’s net financial position (assets minus liabilities). The net financial
position of the central government includes: (a) non-bank central government debt, external
and domestic, including debt with the IMF for budgetary support and short-term debt
approved by the Ministry of Finance; (b) external and domestic bank borrowing (net of
deposits), including deposits in the central bank; and (c) any other nonbank financing,
domestic or external, including the sale of public assets and the net change in the stock of
domestic and external arrears, including arrears to electricity distributors. Domestic arrears of
the nonfinancial public sector are defined as delays in the payment of contractual obligations
beyond the grace period set in the respective loan or debt contract or 30 days in case the grace
period is not specified. Capitalizations or purchases of equity in public companies will be
treated as an above-the-line expenditure transaction. External debt flows (i.e., disbursements
and debt service), will be converted to Dominican Republic pesos at the exchange rate of the
day in which the transaction takes place.
The following uses of funds will not affect the deficit and will be recorded below the line in
2009: (i) clearance of central government domestic arrears incurred before end-December
2008; (ii) amortization of loans and bonds; (iii) bonds issued for the recapitalization of the
Central Bank and Banco de Reservas; and (iv) other arrears with suppliers incurred by endDecember 2008. A memorandum line in the information reporting the Central Government
fiscal operations will report items (i) to (iv) in this paragraph.

B. Cumulative Floor on the Consolidated Public Sector Balance
The consolidated public sector comprises: (i) the operations of the nonfinancial public sector;
and (ii) the quasi-fiscal operations of the central bank. The balance of the nonfinancial public
sector comprises the overall balances of the central government (as defined before) and the
rest of the nonfinancial public sector (municipalities, decentralized entities, social security
entities, and public enterprises).
The rest of the nonfinancial public sector includes the following non financial public
enterprises: Corporación Dominicana de Empresas Eléctricas Estatales (CDEEE, including
Empresa de Generación Hidroeléctrica Dominicana ), Empresas Distribuidoras de Electricidad
del Norte (EDENORTE), Empresas Distribuidoras de Electricidad del Sur (EDESUR),
Empresas Distribuidoras de Electricidad del Este (EDESTE) , Consejo Estatal del Azúcar,
Corporación de Fomento Hotelero y Desarrollo Turístico, Corporación de Acueducto y
Alcantarillado de Santo Domingo, Acueducto y Alcantarillado de Santiago, Acueducto y
Alcantarillado de Moca, Acueducto y Alcantarillado de la Romana, Instituto Nacional de

75

Aguas Potables y Alcantarillados, Corporación de Acueducto y Alcantarillado de Puerto Plata,
Proyecto de la Cruz de Manzanillo, Instituto Postal Dominicano, Corporación Estatal de Radio
y Televisión, Instituto Nacional de la Vivienda, Lotería Nacional, Autoridad Portuaria
Dominicana, Refinería Dominicana de Petróleo.
The overall balance of the rest of the nonfinancial public sector will be measured from “below
the line” as the change in the net financial position (assets minus liabilities) on the basis of
changes in: (i) domestic bank credit and deposits; (ii) domestic and external arrears, and (iii)
external disbursements less amortizations.
The quasi-fiscal balance of the central bank included in the consolidated public sector balance
is measured as all the administrative and financial revenues minus costs (including costs of
monetary policy and interest on the central bank debt and operational expenditures). Given
uncertainties on interest payments of the central bank by the end of 2009, the cumulative floor
on the consolidated public sector will be adjusted downward by up to a limit of RD$0.5 billion
for interest payments in excess of RD$27.5 billion for 2009. No adjustments will be applied
for 2010 unless agreed between the authorities and the Fund staff in case there is a change in
the recapitalization plan of the central bank.
Profits and losses arising from valuation changes of foreign currency denominated assets and
liabilities will not be considered to determine the balance of the nonfinancial public sector.
Fiscal targets for 2009 and 2010 will be measured as a cumulative floor measured from endDecember 2008.

The information to compute the overall balance of the nonfinancial public sector will be
provided to the Fund by the central bank, based on information provided by the government’s
accounting office (expenditure) and various units of the Secretaría de Hacienda (revenue,
nonbank domestic debt and arrears, external debt and arrears, and externally financed capital
expenditure).
C. Floor on Central Bank Consolidated Net International Reserves (NIR)
For program monitoring purposes, the consolidated NIR is defined as the difference between
gross international reserves of the central bank and reserve liabilities, including debt of the
Ministry of Finance with the IMF as follows:
Gross international reserves include claims against non-residents, denominated in foreign
convertible currencies that are in the direct effective control of the central bank and are readily
available for such purposes as foreign exchange market intervention. Such assets include gold
(valued in dollars at end-2008 prices), cash, deposits abroad (excluding funds used as

77

collateral for central bank or other nonfinancial public sector liabilities), holdings of SDRs,
and the IMF reserve position.
Reserve liabilities include debt with the IMF, including that of the Ministry of Finance, and
short-term (up to one year) foreign-currency-denominated liabilities, including commitments
to sell foreign exchange from derivatives or other contracts, and other guarantees or contingent
liabilities.
The consolidated NIR definition does not modify the central bank balance sheet accounting
rules. The consolidated NIR as defined above differs from the NIR definition included in the
previous 2005 Stand-By Arrangement that excluded reserve requirements on foreign currency
deposits, and government and bank deposits in foreign currency as they were considered part
of the reserve liabilities.
To meet this performance criterion at each relevant date, the 5-day average of daily
consolidated NIR values must be above the floor. The 5-day average will be calculated on the
basis of the last five working days of each relevant month.

D. Ceiling on Central Bank Net Domestic Assets (NDA)
Central Bank net domestic assets (NDA) are defined as the difference between the monetary
base and Consolidated NIR, as defined above. For the purposes of the program the monetary
base is defined as equivalent to emisión monetaria , which includes currency issue (currency
in circulation plus cash in vault) plus peso reserve requirements held by financial institutions
at the central bank.
To meet this performance criterion at each relevant date, the 5-day average of daily NDA
values must be below the ceiling. The 5-day average will be calculated on the basis of the last
working days of each relevant month.
For accounting purposes, dollar accounts will be converted to pesos at the accounting
exchange rate of RD$36.5 per dollar.

NDA targets will be adjusted upward (downward) for any increase (decrease) in reserve
requirement deposits (encaje) associated with peso deposits at the central bank. NDA targets
will be adjusted downward (upward) by the surplus (shortfall) in program disbursements up to
US$300 million.
E. Ceiling on the Accumulation of Arrears of Public Electricity Distributors with

Safeguards Assessment. The BCRD was subject to a safeguards assessment with
respect to the Stand-By Arrangement approved on January 31, 2005. The assessment, completed
on April 27, 2005, noted that the BCRD implemented a number of earlier safeguards
recommendations, but also identified vulnerabilities mainly in the areas of internal controls over
the reporting of monetary data to the IMF, financial reporting and external audit.
VIII.

Annex II—Relations with the World Bank Group
1.
The World Bank’s total loan commitments in the Dominican Republic amounts to
US$326.2 million, of which US$234.0 million remains to be disbursed. The loan portfolio
consists of ten loans: seven for investment (Water and Sanitation in Tourist Areas, Early
Childhood Development, Health Sector Reform I and II, Youth Development, Social
Protection -including an additional financing of US$10 million- and Energy Distribution);
two for Technical Assistance (Financial Sector and Energy Sector); and an Emergency
Recovery Loan. The Water and Sanitation in Tourist Areas loan, the Health Sector Reform II
loan and the additional financing for Social Protection will be signed by the end of
November, 2009 and their congressional ratification is expected to take place before the end
of the year.
2.
Two DPLs have been recently negotiated and their congressional ratification is also
expected to take place before the end of 2009.These are: the Public Finance and Social
Sector DPL and the First Performance and Accountability of Social Sectors DPL.
3.
One investment project is under preparation: Municipal Development Project
(US$20 million). The World Bank Group portfolio also includes additional commitments
from the IFC and MIGA.
4.
Portfolio performance in the Dominican Republic is starting to improve after the last
FY09 setback. As of October 2009, the disbursement ratio is 14 percent, above of the
regional (Latin-American and the Caribbean) and sub-regional (Caribbean) average of
7.8 and 9.7 percent respectively; commitments at risk are 7.7 percent and projects at risk are
10 percent. If the portfolio follows the trend observed in the first quarter of FY10 (July –
August 2009), we could expect significant improvements in its performance by the end of the
year.
5.
A comprehensive set of analytical studies has been completed in recent years. In
FY 2009, a Growth Study CEM (Country Economic Memorandum), an update of the
Financial Sector Assessment Program, a new Country Partnership Strategy (FY09-FY13) and
an update of the Report of the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) in Accounting
and Auditing. The Bank will be delivering in November 2009 a set of Policy Notes that have
been feeding the National Development Strategy.

1/ Estimate, excluding a probable US$300 million disbursement from the Fiscal Strengthening Program, to be approved in october 2009.

2.
As of October 2009 the Bank is close to approving a Fiscal Strengthening Program
(US$500 million), which would contemplate additional disbursements in two tranches (US$300
million in 2009 and US$200 million in 2010). For 2010, the Bank will work in the preparation of
three investment projects: the second phase of the Program to Support an Agricultural
Competitive Transition (US$30 million); the Education Decennial Plan Support Program
(US$39 million); and the second phase of a Social Protection Program (US$35 million).
Additionally, the Bank is currently in the final stages of the design of the IDB Country Strategy
for the period 2009-2012.

Annex IV—Statistical Issues
General issues and data adequacy for surveillance
3.
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. The
authorities are working to correct weaknesses in their statistical database. The country has
participated in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since November 2005.
4.
In 2005, a data ROSC mission assessed the statistical system, which is highly
centralized in the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (BCRD). The mission found that
notwithstanding recent efforts to improve the quality of macroeconomic statistics, important
weaknesses remained. The legal framework is adequate for monetary and balance of
payments statistics, but not for other macroeconomic statistics. In most areas the
macroeconomic statistics should more closely follow current international methodologies,
and source data need to be more fully developed. Statistical techniques are broadly adequate,
except for the significant shortcomings of the consumer price index (where weights and
reference periods are not aligned). Periodicity and timeliness of data meet or exceed GDDS
recommendations. Revision analysis and studies are generally absent or not disseminated.
Real sector statistics
5.
GDP data. Five STA missions from January 2002 to April 2004 assisted the BCRD
in compiling consistent quarterly GDP estimates, and updating the base year of the annual
series to 1991. Although a new series for the period 1991–2003 was published in July 2004,
the new series was not immediately incorporated in the official quarterly GDP figures. The
revised annual and quarterly series for the period 1991–2005 were released on
March 16, 2006. The revised GDP estimates are, on average, 17 percent higher than the
previous ones. The new base year of 1991 is already outdated as international guidelines on
national accounts compilation recommend updating the base year at least every five years.
6.
CPI data. The CPI weights are based on the 1997–98 household expenditure and
income survey and need to be updated. The 2005 data ROSC noted the need for appropriate
adjustments for seasonal and missing price imputations, changes in product specifications
and quality, and new products. The CPI also needs to take into account imputed rent for
owner-occupied dwellings and dwellings used by third parties without payment.
7.
Other. Data are not always reported for publication in International Financial
Statistics (IFS) with the required timeliness and have weak coverage of major real sector
indicators. There are no available series for producer prices and wages (except minimum
wages). Quarterly and annual industrial production data are posted on the central bank’s
website.
Government finance statistics

9
8.
The April 2002 multisector technical assistance mission and the August 2005 data
ROSC mission identified significant shortcomings in the fiscal data on the general
government. These shortcomings included (i) legislation that does not clearly define the
responsibility for collecting, compiling, and disseminating government finance statistics
(GFS); (ii) data sources and data collection procedures that need to be more fully developed;
(iii) an analytical framework for compiling GFS that is not fully aligned with international
guidelines; (iv) lack of formal procedures to coordinate the exchange of information among
GFS compilers; and (v) the absence of an integrated system of financial management that
supports GFS compilation.
9.
The 2002 mission prepared an action plan to improve collection, compilation, and
dissemination of fiscal data, and elaborated a table to bridge the budgetary and the
Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) classifications. The 2005 mission
concluded that the number of staff of the State Secretariat of Finance (SSF) was insufficient
for the compilation of GFS and that the coverage of the GFS remained incomplete. An
April/May 2007 statistics mission assisted the BCRD and the SSF in improving the
collection, compilation, and reporting of GFS, on accrual and cash bases, based on the
GFSM 2001. The BCRD compiles and disseminates annual GFS data published in the
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook.
10.
The country is currently participating in a regional project for the harmonization of
GFS for Central America, Panama, and the Dominican Republic (CAPDR). As part of this
project, a June 2009 mission provided further assistance to tackle the issues raised in the
previous paragraphs and assisted the authorities in improving the quality of annual accrualbased data.
Monetary and financial statistics
11.
The monetary statistics currently reported to WHD are affected by the following
issues: (i) lack of sufficient detail to allow for a proper sectorization of accounts and
classification of financial instruments; (ii) concepts and principles underlying valuation,
classification of financial instruments, and sectorization of institutional units are inconsistent
with internationally accepted methodology; (iii) the institutional and financial instrument
coverage is not comprehensive; and (iv) the system for reporting lacks a consistent
methodology. To address these issues, April 2003 and July 2004 monetary statistics missions
began the development of an integrated database to be used by the authorities, STA, and
WHD, based on the methodology recommended in the Monetary and Financial Statistics
Manual. Although the methodology applied in the new database is sound, several problems
remain, including lack of data on financial cooperatives and offshore operations of resident
banks.
12.
The country began to report monetary data to STA in the standardized report forms
(SRFs) in August 2007, which are being used for national publications as well since July
2009. SRFs based data overcome the shortcomings described in the previous paragraph;

10
however, the lack of data on financial cooperatives and offshore operations of resident banks
still remains. The SRFs were developed in the context of a regional project for the
harmonization of monetary and financial statistics in Central America and the Dominican
Republic that ended in December 2008.
External sector statistics
13.
Since February 1997, balance of payments statistics have been compiled according to
the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. However, problems of coverage remain
for imports, capital transfers, income, and the financial account, giving rise to large errors
and omissions. Three technical assistance missions during 2002–04 have assisted the BCRD
in improving balance of payments statistics and preparing the International Investment
Position (IIP) data, which are now available up to 2007. A follow up mission was conducted
in August 2007 that focused on sample surveys and statistical techniques to improve the
compilation of direct investment, portfolio investment, and other nonfinancial private sector
assets and liabilities, as well as domestically issued public debt held by nonresidents. A
15-month action plan with recommendations for improving the balance of payments and IIP
statistics was prepared by the mission in consultation with the BCRD. The compilation of the
external accounts complies with the requirements of the GDDS in terms of periodicity and
timeliness.
Data dissemination
14.
The authorities publish quarterly reports on economic developments. The reports
contain timely preliminary data on real GDP, consumer prices, interest rates, exchange rates,
balance of payments, exports and imports, operations of the central government, and the
banking system. The Quarterly Bulletin of the BCRD contains more detailed information on
sectoral developments, but the bulletin is sometimes published with delays. The BCRD also
maintains a website that presents selected data on a relatively timely basis.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on the Dominican Republic
November 9, 2009
This statement provides additional information on developments since the issuance of the
staff report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation and Request for a SBA for the Dominican
Republic. This information does not change the thrust of the staff report.
I. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
The latest economic indicators confirm that the recession continues. Economic activity
remains weak, there are no pressure on domestic prices and the sharp contraction in trade and
taxes is still ongoing.


Aggregate demand remains depressed. Non-oil imports fell by almost 25 percent in
the first half of 2009 (yoy) and continued to fall at the same rate in the third quarter.
Similarly, exports fell by over 35 percent in the first half of 2009 (yoy) and
30 percent in the third quarter. Electricity consumption was down 8 percent to August
2009 (yoy). Travel arrivals are the exception, having fallen 3½ percent in the first half
of 2009 (yoy), they expanded by 1½ percent in the third quarter (yoy).



Inflation continues to be subdued. Headline inflation for October 2009 was
0.2 percent, taking the 12-month rate to -0.3 percent and cumulative inflation in the
year to 4.5 percent.



Monetary policy remains accommodative. The monetary council met on October 30
and decided to leave interest rates unchanged. The growth of monetary aggregates
and private credit remains low.



The foreign exchange market continues to be stable. The Dominican peso stayed
flat with respect to the U.S. dollar in October 2009, after having depreciated only
3 percent in the previous 12 months. The Central Bank had virtually no intervention
in October (net sales of US$75 million).



The fiscal position remains tight. Preliminary information indicates that overall
revenues fell by 10 percent in the period January-September 2009 (yoy). The fall in
revenues was matched by a similar fall in expenditures, with current expenditure
down 2 percent and capital expenditure down over 30 percent.

II. DEBT ISSUES
There are no sovereign arrears to external creditors. However, there are potential claims
on the government. In addition, the authorities are carrying out an inventory of claims to
ensure accuracy of the debt reporting system.

2



Clearance of arrears. In October 2009, the authorities settled arrears to external
creditors for some US$16 million outstanding as of end-September 2009. Payments
for about US$2½ million were made mostly to suppliers and about US$13½ million
were reconciled and securitized with PDVSA (the state oil company of Venezuela)
following the principles of the 2005 Caracas accord.



Potential claims on the government. There are potentially two large claims on the
government: (i) an American company has threatened to sue the Dominican
government in U.S. courts for US$100 million for breach of a contract signed in 2002
on a housing project that was never carried out; and (ii) the heir of a former owner of
several companies expropriated in the early 1960s during the Trujillo administration
is seeking compensation from the government. According to the claimant, the value
of these claims could be over US$1 billion.



Debt verification. The authorities are conducting an exercise to verify the amounts
recorded in their debt reporting systems. According to the system, there are unverified
claims for about US$6 million to several foreign suppliers of the public electricity
corporation (CDEEE) from the late 1980s for which records are incomplete and partly
inconsistent; the records do not allow yet to form a view as to whether the claims are
valid. If the verification exercise determines that these claims are not valid, staff will
propose to take them out of the debt reporting system.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
November 16, 2009

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with
the Dominican Republic
On November 9, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the 2009 Article IV consultation with the Dominican Republic.1
Background
The Dominican economy has been adversely affected by the global crisis. Output has been
below potential as real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth is decelerating rapidly from over
5 percent in 2008 to an estimated 0.5 to 1.5 percent in 2009. Inflation has fallen rapidly to 0.3 percent year-over-year in October 2009 as the supply shocks of last year have unwound.
The external current account deficit is estimated to be around 6 percent of GDP in 2009, about
4 percentage points lower than in 2008, as imports have fallen more than exports, tourism and
remittances. The banking system has withstood the global crisis and remains liquid, wellcapitalized and profitable.
Monetary authorities have responded to the crisis in a timely manner, but fiscal policy has
been constrained by a lack of external financing. The Central Bank lowered its policy interest
1 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
rate by 550 basis points to 4 percent during 2009, and reserve requirements were also
lowered by 250 basis points to 17.5 percent. Following a relaxed stance in 2008, fiscal policy
has been tight in the first 3 quarters of 2009, as a decline in tax revenues of 10 percent to
September (with respect to January–September 2008) was met with a larger decline in
expenditures. The deficit of the consolidated public sector was about 2 percent of GDP during
the first three quarters of 2009, or around 1 percentage point of GDP lower than during the first
three quarters of 2008.
Structural impediments in the fiscal and electricity sector put a heavy burden on public
finances. There is a risk that the decline in tax revenues observed in 2008-09 (of more than 10
percent) may be partly related to undue use of tax exemptions contained in competitiveness
laws. Serious structural weaknesses continue to leave the state-owned electricity distribution
companies with large losses. Untargeted subsidies to cover these losses remain a drain on
public finances, absorbing over one percent of GDP in 2009. Notwithstanding these subsidies,
the quality of service to citizens in the electricity sector remains very poor.
The authorities’ program aims to limit the effects of the global slowdown on the economy while
establishing the conditions for robust and sustainable growth. The program is expected to
catalyze financing from multilaterals for the conduct of a countercyclical fiscal policy in the
short term, while monetary policy will remain flexible to respond to the liquidity needs of the
economy. The medium-term program calls for a gradual fiscal consolidation to ensure
sustainability as the economic activity rebounds. International reserves will also be increased
to comfortable levels as the exchange rate is gradually made more flexible and the Central
Bank adopts a full-fledged inflation targeting regime in the medium-term. The authorities’
program also aims to address fiscal impediments, especially in the area of revenue collection,
and to eliminate untargeted electricity subsidies. The authorities‘ economic program is
supported by a Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF, which was alslo approved by the
Executive Board on November 9 (see Press Release 09/393).
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They noted that the global
economic recession has significantly weakened the Dominican economy, with growth declining
markedly in 2009. Inflation has remained subdued and the current account deficit narrowed.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ economic program, which aims at returning the economy
to its high, sustainable growth path, through flexible, countercyclical policies in the short run,
and pursuing over the medium term a fiscal consolidation strategy and an ambitious structural
reform agenda.
Directors supported the temporary fiscal stimulus in 2009-10, including the full play of
automatic stabilizers, in light of well below potential output and as financing constraints are
relieved. Fiscal policy could be relaxed as additional external financing is secured, targeting
investment projects with high social returns while strengthening social safety nets. At the same

3
time, Directors called on the authorities to follow through on their commitment to medium-term
sustainability by shifting to a fiscal consolidation effort beginning in the second half of 2010.
Work should start promptly on the planned structural measures, in particular improvements in
tax administration, with Fund technical assistance, and on the elimination of untargeted
electricity subsidies. The finalization and implementation of a comprehensive plan to address
structural impediments in the electricity sector also remain a high priority.
Directors welcomed the flexible implementation of monetary policy, with a timely shift to an
accommodative stance in 2009 to stimulate economic activity. While this stance remains
appropriate at present, Directors noted the limited scope for further reducing policy interest
rates, as well as banks’ high liquidity preference. Directors encouraged the monetary
authorities to remain vigilant and stand ready to withdraw liquidity gradually as private credit
picks up. They commended the authorities for the progress in strengthening the central bank
as an effective monetary authority, and stressed the importance of proceeding with the
recapitalization plan to enhance its credibility further.
Directors welcomed the monetary authorities’ commitment to a flexible exchange rate, and
took note of the staff assessment that the real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with
fundamentals. Given the relatively low level of international reserves, gradually introducing
more flexibility within the current managed floating regime would help cushion potential
external shocks. Consideration would also need to be given to continued strengthening of the
monetary anchor, and Directors supported the authorities’ intention to move to an inflationtargeting regime once the supporting institutional framework has been put in place.
Directors welcomed significant improvements in the regulation, supervision, and financial
strength of the banking system. As a result of previous reforms, the Dominican banking system
remains liquid, solvent, and profitable, despite the global credit crunch. Directors emphasized
the need to continue monitoring the system closely and stand ready to take necessary
measures to prevent systemic problems. They encouraged the authorities to advance the
implementation of risk-based consolidated bank supervision and regulation, and to formulate
strategies for domestic capital market development and debt management.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with the Dominican Republic will be held in
accordance with the Executive Board decision on the consultation cycle for members with
Fund arrangements.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

IMF Executive Board Approves US$1.7 Billion Stand-By Arrangement for
the Dominican Republic
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved today a 28-month
Stand-By Arrangement for the Dominican Republic in the amount of SDR 1,094.5 million
(about US$1.7 billion) to support the country’s strategy to cope with the adverse effects of
the global economic environment.
The authorities’ program aims to pursue short-term countercyclical policies; strengthen
medium-term sustainability; reduce vulnerabilities exposed during the global crisis; and lay
the foundations for a gradual recovery and sustained growth. The Stand-By Arrangement is
designed to bolster confidence in the policy framework and catalyze additional financing
from other multilateral sources.
Following the Executive Board discussion on the Dominican Republic, Mr. Murilo Portugal,
Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, made the following statement:
“Following several years of rapid growth, the Dominican economy has weakened
significantly in 2009, due to the global economic recession. The authorities timely adjusted
their monetary policy stance to stimulate economic activity on the back of subdued inflation.
The financial system has weathered the recent global crisis relatively well, as a result of
reforms undertaken after the 2003 financial crisis. The lack of adequate financing, however,
constrained the conduct of countercyclical fiscal policy.
“The authorities’ macroeconomic framework, supported by a Stand-by Arrangement with the
Fund, aims to limit the effects of the global recession on the economy through the
implementation of short-term countercyclical polices, while establishing the conditions for
robust, sustainable growth. Successful implementation of this program will unlock significant
financing from other multilateral sources, creating space for an adequate fiscal response. It
will be important that the authorities follow through with their fiscal consolidation plan and
structural reform agenda critical for medium-term sustainability.

“The planned fiscal stimulus will focus on high-return investment projects and current
expenditures to strengthen social safety nets. The authorities are committed to addressing
deficiencies in the revenue administration, and implementing a comprehensive plan to tackle
structural issues in the electricity sector, aimed at abolishing untargeted subsidies while
providing adequate service to the public.
“Monetary policy will continue to support economic activity and build up international
reserves, with exchange rate flexibility to help cushion against external shocks.
Implementing the plan for central bank recapitalization remains an important priority, crucial
for the credibility of the monetary policy framework. The central bank intends to adopt fullfledged inflation targeting over the medium term.
“The Dominican banking system remains liquid, solvent, and profitable, despite the global
credit crunch. The authorities continue to monitor the impact of the economic slowdown, and
plan to advance the implementation of risk-based consolidated bank supervision and
regulation,” Mr. Portugal said.

ANNEX
Recent Economic Developments
The global economic and financial crisis has significantly worsened short-term economic
prospects and may jeopardize some of the achievements of the last 5 years. Economic
recovery from the 2003 financial crisis has been impressive. Real GDP grew 40 percent in
the last 5 years, one of the highest expansions in Latin America and the best performance of
the Dominican economy in the last quarter of a century. Inflation fell from over 40 percent in
2003 to 4.5 percent in 2008. Fiscal deficits have been cut in half, from almost 9 percent of
GDP for the consolidated public sector in 2003 to about 4.5 percent in 2008. The public debtto-GDP ratio was reduced by almost one-half, from about 60 percent in 2003 to 35 percent in
2008. However, social progress remains a challenge, and despite recent improvements,
poverty indicators are still weaker than before the 2003 crisis.
Program Summary
To safeguard the achievements of the last several years, and against the background of
unfavorable external conditions, large uncertainties and a sizable balance of payments need,
the authorities are requesting a 28-month SBA for 500 percent of quota
(SDR 1,094.5 million). The objectives of the program are twofold: first, to conduct
countercyclical policies at the beginning of the program (including the last quarter 2009 and
the first half 2010) to mitigate the drastic economic downturn; and second, to implement
actions to address debt and fiscal sustainability issues in the latter part of the program
(starting in mid-2010), while embracing an ambitious structural reform agenda.

take additional measures to keep the program on track, if necessary. We ask the Board to
support a program that is expected to help decisively in bringing the Dominican Republic’s
economy back to a path of robust and sustainable growth.
