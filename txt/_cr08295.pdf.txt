BARBADOS
Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2008 Consultation with Barbados
Approved by Ranjit Teja and G. Russell Kincaid
July 8, 2008

• Background. After solid performance in recent years, growth is projected to slow to
2¼ percent in 2008, reflecting spillovers from the economic slowdown in advanced economies. At
the same time, sharply higher costs for imported oil and food are projected to push up inflation to
9 percent and widen the current account deficit to 8½ percent of GDP.
• Focus of consultation. The discussions focused on policies to balance the conflicting risks to
inflation, growth, and medium-term sustainability. While the government has maintained some
policy space by postponing the liberalization of the capital account, its options are constrained by
high public debt and the peg to the U.S. dollar. The staff made the following recommendations:
¾ Fiscal policy should focus on creating the space for targeted support to vulnerable groups
within this year’s reduced deficit target and on identifying measures to lower public debt
and support external sustainability over the medium term.
¾ Monetary policy should aim at containing inflation expectations. Thus, further reductions
in interest rates should be contingent on signs of a sharper slowdown in demand than is
currently anticipated.
¾ The wage bargaining process, which is conducted under a tripartite framework, should
support fiscal and monetary policies by minimizing second-round effects of the oil and
food price shocks on inflation.
¾ Financial sector policy should focus on strengthening banking regulation, oversight of the
nonbank sector, and cross-country cooperation among regulators and supervisors. An
FSSA, summarizing the findings of an FSAP Update mission, is being issued separately.
• Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed with the thrust of these recommendations, but on
fiscal policy, preferred to rely on nontax rather than tax measures to raise revenues. They indicated
that specific measures would be included in the revised budget to be presented in early July.
• Exchange system. Barbados has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4,
and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on current account transactions. While the
real exchange rate is not far from its estimated equilibrium, domestic policy adjustments will be
needed in the medium term to contain external imbalances under its fixed exchange rate system.
• Mission. The team visiting Bridgetown during June 4–16 comprised Christina Daseking
(head), Gamal El-Masry, Alejandro Guerson, and Magda Kandil (all WHD). Jonathan Fried
(Executive Director) and Marco Espinosa (MCM) participated in the concluding discussions.

2.
As a small and open economy, however, Barbados lacks scope for diversification
and is vulnerable to external shocks. The country’s trade openness and dependence on
tourism and a few other services expose it to geopolitical tensions and cyclical swings. This
has been reflected in significant output volatility, including a major crisis in the early 1990s
and a recession after 9/11. Moreover, while the 33-year peg to the U.S. dollar enjoys strong
support and credibility, vulnerabilities arise from high public debt and a sizeable current
account deficit. Indeed, even though the exchange rate is currently close to its estimated
equilibrium, and there are no apparent signs of competitiveness problems in the dominant
tourism sector, an adjustment of domestic policies will be important over the medium term to
contain external imbalances and preserve sustainability (Box 1).
3.
Last year’s Article IV consultation focused on reducing these risks against the
backdrop of a prospective opening of the capital account. This step would have
constrained further the conduct of monetary policy and placed an even larger burden of
stabilization on fiscal policy. Key recommendations were:
•

fiscal consolidation, to support the buildup of international reserves and reduce public
debt, so as to allow an effective policy response to shocks while safeguarding the
sustainability of the peg;

•

adoption of market-based monetary policy instruments, to manage domestic liquidity
in a more volatile environment; and

+6 percent around its equilibrium value.
Recent tourism developments suggest broadly adequate
competitiveness. The country has maintained its share of Caribbean
tourist arrivals, while tourism receipts have actually risen relative to
regional competitors, reflecting Barbados’ successes at the higher-end
market segment.
The equilibrium real exchange rate approach implies a minor
overvaluation. This method relies on a panel regression of actual
exchange rates on a set of fundamentals, using a sample of
tourism-dependent countries (i) in the Caribbean and (ii)
110
across the world (IMF Country Report No. 08/96). For the
105
former, the actual rate falls within the 95-percent confidence
band around the equilibrium, with estimated deviations in the

range of -1 to +6 percent and a point estimate of +2½ percent
(overvaluation). The results for the larger sample of tourism95
dependent countries are similar.

The external sustainability approach suggests the need for

medium-term policy adjustment. This method focuses on
the difference between the underlying current account and the

current account that stabilizes a country’s net international

investment position (NIIP). In Barbados, complete NIIP data
are not available, owing to capacity constraints. The authorities collect data on a subset of NIIP, however, which
captures most of the country’s net foreign debt and currently stands at 10 percent of GDP. 1 Stabilizing this net
debt measure, shifts the focus to the current account deficit, minus net FDI inflows, which would have to decline
to about ½ percent of GDP to keep the net external debt ratio constant. At the same time, there would be sizeable
increases in equity liabilities from net FDI inflows that are not captured by this measure. This stabilizing position
compares with a medium-term projection of 2 percent of GDP for the non-FDI financed current account deficit,
which assumes a deteriorating external environment but also an improvement in the fiscal position under current
policies. The additional current account adjustment of 1½ percentage points of GDP could be achieved by a real
depreciation of about 4 percent, using standard trade elasticities scaled by openness. Alternatively, the same
adjustment could be achieved by additional fiscal savings of about 3 percentage points of GDP—assuming that
about half of the current account impact is offset by lower private savings. Without this additional fiscal
adjustment, net external debt would be projected to stabilize at around 40 percent of GDP.

The net foreign debt measure is derived as the sum of external public and private sector debt (non-bank), minus

strengthening of financial sector regulation and supervision, to guard against
excessive exposures and spillovers under an open capital account.

4.
The new government faces the additional challenge of responding to a
deteriorating external environment. So far, Barbados has shown resilience to the financial
turmoil in advanced markets, and economic performance has remained fairly robust (Box 2
and Figure 1). However, confronted with a weakening global environment; rising imported
food prices; and growing fiscal losses from limited pass-through of record high oil prices, the
government took a number of important decisions, including:
•

a more sequenced approach to capital account liberalization, with a postponement of
the previous administration’s plan to remove controls on regional transactions early
this year;

•

a joint agreement with CARICOM partners to eliminate or reduce the common
external tariff on selected food items on a temporary basis; and

•

a large adjustment in controlled prices for fuel products to stem fiscal losses and
reduce the distortion of price signals. This was later followed by a decision to grant
limited tax rebates on diesel fuel to sectors hardest hit by the adjustment (e.g., farmers
and fishermen).
II. POLICY ISSUES

5.
The discussions focused on the appropriate mix of policies to balance the
conflicting risks to inflation, growth, and medium-term sustainability. At the current
juncture, with significant price pressures and great uncertainties about the severity of the
global slowdown and its impact on Barbados, the mission and the government broadly agreed
on both the economic outlook and the following priorities for a coordinated policy response:
¾ Fiscal policy. Identify areas for fiscal savings to create space for targeted support of the
most vulnerable groups and reduce the high public debt ratio over the medium term.
¾ Monetary policy. Contain inflation expectations by resisting interest-rate reductions at the
current juncture and making further cuts contingent on a sharper-than-expected slowdown
in aggregate demand.
¾ Wage formation. Support fiscal and monetary policies by promoting wage moderation
within the established tripartite framework to minimize second-round effects of the oil and
food price shocks.
¾ Financial sector policy. Strengthen banking regulation, prudential oversight of the
nonbank sector, and effective cross-country cooperation among regulators and supervisors.

6
Box 2. Barbados: Recent Developments and Short-Term Outlook
Thus far, the global financial turbulence has had little effect on Barbados, but a sustained
economic slowdown in advanced economies could translate into weaker tourism receipts and
FDI. Inflation was kept low by limited pass-through of high fuel prices. These have been
adjusted recently, however, and as elsewhere, the government is under pressure to respond to
rising food prices.
•

The financial turmoil in advanced economies has had little impact on Barbados’
banks, thus far. Banks remain liquid and do not appear exposed to the risky
mortgage-backed securities or highly leveraged operations that have resulted in large
losses at U.S. and European financial institutions.

•

Economic activity has remained fairly robust but is likely to slow in the course of
this year. The economy grew at a solid rate of 3¼ percent in 2007, with tourism
performing well throughout the first quarter of 2008, helped by improved
competitiveness vis-à-vis Europe and Canada. As a result, the current account deficit
declined to 7¼ percent of GDP in 2007, and reserves rose to 4 months of imports. As
the global slowdown takes hold of Barbados’ main trading partners, however, tourism
receipts are expected to weaken. A similar slackening is anticipated in the buoyant
housing market for luxury houses, resulting in lower FDI inflows.

•

Downward-trending annual inflation rates masked pent-up price pressures that
have recently been unleashed. A freeze of retail fuel prices introduced in late 2006
helped reduce consumer inflation from 7½ percent in 2006 to 4 percent in 2007.
However, it also resulted in large losses at the state-owned National Oil Company, in
the range of 1–1¼ percent of GDP. To prevent further fiscal losses and price
distortions, the new government decided in April to raise prices for individual oil
products by some 25–75 percent. This adjustment, together with record high food
prices, is now pushing up inflation, and world oil prices have risen further since.

A. Fiscal Policy: Providing Support While Safeguarding Sustainability
6.
The new government stressed its commitment to fiscal prudence, with a view to
balancing the central government accounts over the medium term. A revised budget for
this fiscal year will be presented to Parliament in early July. While specific measures remain
to be announced, the authorities indicated that the new budget would stay within their earlier
deficit target for the central government of 2¼ percent of GDP. The mission welcomed the
implicit adjustment of about 1¾ percentage points of GDP in FY 2008/09, while pointing to
the need to offset the combined effect of a likely economic slowdown and targeted support
measures in the form of larger social assistance, a higher tax credit threshold, and a price
rebate on diesel for selected sectors.
The authorities will need to tighten fiscal

7.
Notwithstanding these commitments, current policies are unlikely to reverse the
rising trend in the overall public debt ratio over the medium term. Despite strong
economic growth during the past three years, total public debt rose to 95 percent of GDP—or
a still high 87 percent if earmarked sinking funds are netted out. As much of the recent
increase reflected off-budget projects and deficits in public enterprises, the mission welcomed
the government’s decision to reassess the costs and benefits of earlier-planned projects, such
as the multi-purpose sugar factory. Nevertheless, a projected fiscal adjustment of
3½ percentage points of GDP under current policies—1¾ percentage points assumed for
2007/08 and another 1¾ percentage point projected over the medium term, as a result of lower
capital spending and

9
transfers to public enterprises—is unlikely to reverse the rising trend in the debt ratio. (Table 6
and Figure 2). A high probability for the debt ratio to rise and the need for a persistent
adjustment in the primary balance are further confirmed by a stochastic analysis of the debt
dynamics based on historical patterns (Box 3).
8.
Accordingly, the mission encouraged the authorities to adopt a more ambitious
adjustment path, consistent with restoring a public sector surplus in the medium term.
Specifically, it recommended an additional tightening of 4 percentage points of GDP above

Box 3. Barbados: Stochastic Analysis of Fiscal Policy and Public Debt
A simulation exercise incorporating the possibility of shocks reveals that, based on the historic
experience of the past 27 years, the probability of rising public debt is high in the absence of persistent
policy changes. The simulations indicate that a continuation of revenue and expenditure patterns
observed in the past would have a 75 percent probability of raising the debt ratio above its 2007 level
over the medium term.
This result is obtained from a VAR model of the Barbadian economy and its fiscal dynamics. The
estimated model includes as variables the real growth of the different components of the fiscal balance
(tax revenue, primary and off-budget expenditures, and interest payments), real GDP growth, the real
exchange rate, and the T-bill rate. It is used to generate a large number of simulated projections of the
primary balance by generating shocks to these variables with the same properties (volatility,
persistence and co-movement) as actual shocks during the period 1980-2007. The simulated series are
then used to determine debt ratios based on the following identity:

dt =

(1 + rt )
d t −1 − pbt + oet ,
(1 + gt )

where d is the debt-to-GDP ratio, r is the real interest rate, g is real GDP growth, pb is the simulated
primary balance as a share of GDP, and oe is off-budget expenditures as a share of GDP. Recursive
substitution provides a large number of debt projections that can be tabulated to obtain probability
distributions of debt dynamics for each simulated year (2008-13).
The results indicate that even in the most benign scenarios with positive shocks, the debt ratio is
likely to increase. There is a 75 percent probability that the medium-term debt ratio will exceed its
current level, assuming off-budget expenditures of 2.6 percent of GDP—which is the average observed
during 2000-07. In this case, the model predicts an average debt ratio of 106 percent of GDP by 2013.
The elimination of off-budget expenditures alone would reduce the probability of a deterioration in the
debt ratio to one-third. Bringing the debt ratio on a firmly declining path, however, is likely to require a
sustained change in the primary balance.

The authorities agreed with the mission on the need to reverse the rising trend in
the public debt ratio over the medium term. They pointed to the measures they had already
taken as an indication of their resolve to restore fiscal prudence and alluded to additional
measures in the forthcoming budget. Although gross financing needs of about 20 percent of
GDP are significant, the mission agreed that rollover risks were mitigated by the high share of
domestic liabilities in public debt and the fact that one-third of them are held by the National
Insurance Scheme (Tables 3 and 6). Nevertheless, such risks could mount in a more
challenging environment, particularly if the debt ratio continued to rise.
10.
The mission therefore urged the authorities to decide promptly on measures to
generate the necessary fiscal savings, suggesting a number of options.
On the expenditure side, the government could achieve savings by:

•

Better prioritizing new government projects. This is crucial to contain debt creation
outside the central government, whereby a consolidated presentation of all quasi-fiscal
activities in the budget would provide additional scrutiny.

•

Adjusting prices of utilities and public services to reduce the budgetary impact of
across-the-board subsidies and mitigate costly price distortions. An automatic passthrough mechanism for fuel together with adjustments in regulated prices for other
subsidized goods and services, such as natural gas, water, and transportation, could
generate medium-term savings of perhaps 1–1½ percent of GDP.

•

Containing the public sector wage bill. This will be important not only to support the
government’s adjustment efforts, but also to help mitigate second-round effects on
inflation. A reduction by ½ percentage point of GDP would bring the wage bill back to
its recent historic minimum of 10½ percent of GDP.

On the revenue side, measures could include:

•

Raising tax rates on offshore activities. Maximum corporate tax rates for offshore
businesses are at 2½ percent, compared with 25 percent for domestic companies, but
generate about two-thirds of corporate tax revenues. Raising offshore tax rates by just
1 percentage point would still keep them at attractive levels, while generating
additional revenues of up to 2 percent GDP.

•

Lifting the cap on the property tax. Currently, property taxes are capped at an
equivalent of US$30,000 a year. With a maximum tax rate of 0.75 percent, the cap
becomes effective for properties valued at or above US$4 million, which is a buoyant
market segment, dominated by non-residents. While the initial revenue impact of
lifting the cap may not be large—perhaps on the order of ¼ percent of GDP—it would
grow with the rate of property appreciation.

12
•

Reducing tax incentives for foreign investments. Past estimates put the costs of the
various incentive schemes at about 6 percent of GDP. Actions on this front could
deliver additional revenue of perhaps 1–2 percent of GDP in the medium term, but
would be most effective if coordinated with other countries in the region.

•

Improving tax administration. Integration of the different domestic tax departments
under a Central Revenue Authority, as envisaged by the government, will facilitate
strategic policy implementation and should create some savings of perhaps ½–
1 percent of GDP from synergies and improved compliance.

•

Adjusting the VAT. Tax collection could also be strengthened through improvements in
the VAT system, for example, by removing exemptions and extensive zero-ratings.
Such actions could raise revenues by an estimated ¾–1¾ percentage points of GDP.

11.
The mission stressed that this list of measures, while not exhaustive, provided the
government with choices. Taken together, the measures could generate savings of about 5–
9 percentage points of GDP over the medium term—well in excess of the mission’s proposed
additional adjustment of

cap, at a later stage. They were concerned, however, about raising international business taxes
or the VAT in the current environment. Instead, the authorities saw room to raise non-tax
revenues through fees and charges, with specific proposals to be included in the revised
budget.
B. Monetary Policy: Containing Inflation Expectations

12.
The mission endorsed the Central Bank of Barbados’ cautious approach to
adjusting its policy rate in response to the easing in the United States. While historically,
Barbados’ minimum deposit rate has tracked the U.S. federal funds rate fairly closely, the
CBB has lowered interest rates only twice in the past year, by 50 basis points in November
2007 and 25 basis points this March. As a result, the interest differential has risen to 250 basis
points in April, or 130 basis points relative to the six-months LIBOR. Lending rates have only
been lowered by 35 basis points, while private credit growth has continued to moderate.

13
Absent a surge in short-term capital inflows—which have been kept at bay by imperfect
capital mobility and exchange controls—or signs of a sharper economic slowdown, the
mission considered this policy appropriate to contain inflation expectations. While core
inflation and wage growth seem to have been contained thus far, the authorities agreed that the
outcome of upcoming wage negotiations will be an important factor going forward.
... and private sector credit growth continued to slow
further from very high rates.

The mission encouraged the authorities to continue preparations for introducing
indirect policy instruments. With the expectation that exchange controls for regional
transactions would be removed early this year, the CBB was working on options for shifting
from interest rate controls and reserve requirements to market-based policy instruments. Plans
were well advanced to activate the discount facility, using repos and reverse repos, and to
forecast liquidity. In parallel, the CBB was considering ways to build up a stock of securities
for prospective open-market operations. While the mission understood the rationale for
delaying the liberalization of the capital account until global markets have calmed, it
encouraged the authorities to continue with the necessary preparations for the introduction of
indirect policy instruments to be able to move forward as soon as practical.
C. Wage Formation: Minimizing Second-Round Effects on Inflation

14.
The outcome of wage negotiations
will play a decisive role for the effectiveness
of other policies in addressing the current
challenges. With much of the recent rise in
food and oil prices believed to be permanent,
importing countries will have to adjust to the
implied cut in real incomes. The faster this
adjustment takes place, the smaller the

subsequent economic and social costs of persistent inflation. This calls for a coordinated
policy response where properly targeted and stability-oriented fiscal and monetary policies are
complemented by wage agreements that help contain second-round price pressures.
15.
The government agreed with the mission on the importance of wage moderation
at the current juncture. It noted that Barbados’ tripartite framework of consultation between
government, business, and trade unions has
been successful in restoring and maintaining
competitiveness, particularly after the severe
crisis in the early 1990s. At that time, unions
agreed to a nominal cut in public sector and a
freeze in private sector wages to defend the
peg to the U.S. dollar. Real wages also
adjusted to the most recent economic shock in
2001. Thus, the government was hopeful that
national consultations in mid-June would be
successful in generating a consensus on wage
moderation in the months ahead to prevent second-round price pressures and future job losses.

D. Financial Sector Policies: Strengthening Regulation and Supervision

16.
An FSAP update mission found a resilient financial system in the face of the
global turmoil but also some weaknesses in its regulation and supervision. The domestic
banking system appears currently sound, profitable, and able to weather moderate shocks. It is
also well insulated from the offshore sector, and the new deposit insurance scheme is a
welcome addition to the safety net. Nevertheless, the mission identified a number of
weaknesses in financial sector regulation and supervision that need to be addressed to contain
future risks to financial stability. Its key recommendations are summarized in Box 4 and
include:
•

Enhancing banking sector regulation. While noting a number of important upgrades
that have been implemented in recent years, the FSAP team recommended additional
measures to enhance banking regulation, including in the areas of asset classification,
provisioning requirements, and large exposure and related-party transactions.

•

Improving regulation and supervision of the nonbank financial sector, which with
assets of about 65 percent of GDP is nearly half the size of the banking sector.
Currently, insurance companies rely largely on self regulation, which exposes the
sector to material risks. For credit unions, which are currently under supervision of the
Registrar of the Cooperatives, there is a need to step up joint inspections with the
CBB. Establishment of a Financial Services Commission, with a clear mandate and
structure to supervise the entire nonbank financial sector, should help remove these
gaps.

15
Box 4. Key FSAP Update Recommendations1
1. Banking

•
•
•

•

Update capital adequacy, classification of assets, and loss provision regulations.
Issue aggregate-limit regulations for large exposures and related-party transactions to be applied on
a consolidated basis, and licensing criteria for holding companies.
With banks predominantly foreign owned, there is an urgent need to strengthen cross-border
consolidated supervision and home/host collaboration, including by conducting simulated “fire
drills” to help plan and exercise the response to a crisis.
Improve the level of public awareness of the features and function of the new deposit insurance
scheme.

2. Insurance

•
•
•

Formalize regulation of the insurance sector.
Improve the timeliness of supervisory returns, including by imposing fines for late-filing, and
redesign processes for onsite inspection, and offsite analytical support.
Given the sector’s ever-growing cross-border activities and ownership dependence, strengthen the
collaboration with regional authorities in the supervision of larger international conglomerates.

3. Credit Unions

•
•

Resume joint on-sight examinations by the Central Bank of Barbados and the Registrar of the
Cooperatives Department.
Consider issuing a specialized Credit Union Law.

4. Securities Markets

•

•

Provide the Securities Commission with statutory power to make legally binding rules, inspect and
access all information of regulated firms, share information and otherwise cooperate with domestic
and foreign supervisors.
Develop and implement a regular inspection program for regulated firms and require them to have
adequate internal control- and risk-management policies and procedures.

5. Financial Services Commission

•

With progress in the supervision of both the credit union and insurance sectors having come to a
halt, and given the importance of bolstering the powers of the Securities Commission, the new
government should promptly clarify its plans regarding the mandate and structure of the yet-to-be
established Financial Services Commission.

III. STAFF APPRAISAL

17.
The government is faced with the challenge of balancing conflicting risks to
inflation, growth, and medium-term sustainability. While direct spillovers from the
financial turmoil have been contained, Barbados is likely to feel the delayed impact of weaker
global demand on tourism, with repercussions on the rest of the economy. At the same time,
the government is under pressure to respond to rising food and fuel prices, while high public
debt is severely constraining its fiscal space. Moreover, whereas Barbados’ real exchange rate
is currently not far from its estimated equilibrium, domestic policy adjustments will be needed
in the medium-term to contain external imbalances under the fixed exchange rate system.
Addressing these challenges will require a coordinated response of fiscal, monetary, incomes,
and financial sector policies.
18.
Fiscal policy will need to identify savings to finance targeted support to the most
vulnerable groups, while containing risks to medium-term sustainability. The government
is planning to gradually eliminate the central government deficit, starting with a tightening of
1¾ percentage points of GDP this year. However, to reverse an otherwise deteriorating trend
in the public debt dynamics and reduce external imbalances, the authorities will have to take
additional measures that would shift a sizeable overall public sector deficit to a modest surplus
by 2013. As savings will take time to build, it will be important to identify and commit to
specific revenue and expenditure measures early on.
19.
Monetary policy should continue to focus on containing the risk of entrenching
inflation expectations. The CBB’s decision to lower interest rates by only 75 basis points
since last fall, has created a sizeable differential with U.S. rates. This comparatively tight
stance is appropriate, in the absence of a surge in short-term capital inflows, to contain
inflation expectations. Further easing of interest rates may be warranted at a later stage should
there be signs of a more severe slowdown in economic activity. In the meantime, the

17
authorities should advance the preparation for introducing indirect monetary policy
instruments to be ready for the shift once global financial markets have calmed.
20.
The outcome of wage negotiations will play an important part in determining the
effectiveness of the overall policy response to the current challenges. To the extent that the
price increases are persistent, wage moderation, aimed at minimizing second-round effects of
the oil and food price shocks, will be crucial to help the economy adjust in the least harmful
way. For this reason, it is important to avoid wage indexation to currently high headline
inflation rates.
21.
Risks to external and domestic stability can be further reduced by addressing
identified weaknesses in prudential oversight of the financial sector. The authorities
should, therefore, swiftly implement the main recommendations of the FSAP update mission.
Besides a number of important provisions to strengthen banking regulation and cross-border
cooperation, priority should be given to improving the much weaker prudential oversight of
the non-bank sector.
22.
The provision of macroeconomic data is broadly adequate for surveillance.
However, efforts should be made to improve the coverage and timeliness of national accounts,
monetary, and balance of payments data, including the net international investment position.
23.

It is recommended to hold the next consultation on the standard 12-month cycle.

APPENDIX I. BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF APPENDICES
Discussion. The 2008 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Barbados during June 4-6, 2008.
The staff team comprised C. Daseking (head), G. El-Masry, A. Guerson, and M. Kandil (all WHD).
Jonathan Fried (Executive Director for Barbados) and Marco Espinosa (mission chief for the FSAP
Update mission, MCM) participated in the wrap-up meeting. The mission met with Senator Hon. Darcy
Boyce, Minister of State for Finance and Energy; Dr. Marion Williams, Governor of the Central Bank of
Barbados; government officials; and representatives of the private sector, labor unions, and the
opposition.
Exchange Rate Arrangements. Barbados accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4
on November 3, 1993, and there are no restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions. The Barbados dollar has been pegged to the U.S. dollar since mid-1975 at
BDS$2.00 = US$1.00.
Fund Relations.
• Financial assistance. Barbados has no outstanding purchases and loans with the Fund. The last
financial arrangement was a Stand-by Arrangement for the period 02/07/1992 to 05/31/1993 totaling
SDR 23.9 million, of which SDR 14.7 million was drawn.
•

Recent technical assistance:
¾ In January 2008, a mission from the Statistics Department visited Barbados on monetary and
financial statistics.
¾ In March 2008, a mission from the Fiscal Affairs Department visited Barbados and provided
assistance in the administration of indirect taxes and customs.
¾ CARTAC is currently assisting the Barbados Statistics Services on rebasing, and improving the
coverage of, national accounts.

Relations with the World Bank Group. The World Bank just recently concluded an HIV/AIDS
awareness and prevention project. A successor project, totaling US$35 million, which is expected to be
approved in the second half of 2008 would support the implementation of the 2008–2013 Barbados
National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan.
Relations with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). The IDB’s Country Strategy with
Barbados for the period 2005–08 is focused on public sector reforms and improving competitiveness.
The IDB’s current Barbados portfolio totals US$129 million, comprising US$3.3 million in technical
assistance grants and US$125.9 million in investment loans.

Relations with the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB). Since 1970 the CDB has provided
Barbados with loans and grants totaling US$276 million in support of the productive sectors,
economic infrastructure, health and education. In 2006, a technical assistance loan of
US$3.5 million was approved.

Exchange Rate Arrangements:
The Barbados dollar has been pegged to the U.S. dollar since mid-1975 at BDS$2.00 =
US$1.00. On May 31, 2008, the official buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar were
BDS$1.98 and BDS$2.04, respectively, per US$1.
There are no restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current

3
international transactions subject to approval under Article VIII. There are exchange
controls on some invisibles, but bona fide transactions are approved. All capital outflows
and certain capital inflows require approval. The authorities accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 on November 3, 1993.

1.
The World Bank just recently concluded an HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention project.
A successor program would support the implementation of the 2008–2013 Barbados National
HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan, specifically to promote: (i) adoption of safe behaviors, in particular
amongst the most vulnerable groups; (ii) access to prevention, treatment and social care, in
particular for the most vulnerable groups; (iii) capacity of organizational and institutional
structures that govern the NAP; and (iv) use of quality data for problem identification, strategy
definition and measuring results. The estimated amount is US$35 million and is expected to
become effective in the second half of 2008.

Loan approvals by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to Barbados have averaged
around US$9 million annually since the IDB was formed in 1959. Disbursements have averaged
around US$7 million. Net flows have entered into negative territory in recent years, owing to a
slow-down in project implementation.

APPENDIX IV. BARBADOS—RELATIONS WITH THE CARIBBEAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As at end-May 2008)
The Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) approved US$276.0 million in loans, contingent loans,
equity, and grants to Barbados between 1970 and May 2008. This represents 9.3 percent of total
approvals to CDB’s borrowing member countries.
Of the total funds approved US$78.7 million or 28.5 percent were allocated to the productive
sectors which comprise agriculture, manufacturing, tourism, and mining. Within the productive
sectors, US$45.5 million, or 16.5 percent of the total, was allocated to the manufacturing sector,
while tourism accounted for US$28.9 million, or 10.5 percent.
Economic infrastructure accounted for US$143.8 million or 52.1 percent of approved funds. Of
these funds, US$88.1 million (31.9 percent) were allocated to the transportation,
US$50.2 million (18.2 percent) to the education, and US$3.2 million (1.2 percent) to the health
sectors.
Approximately US$13.5 million in new loans (multisector) was approved in 2003 while no new
loans were approved in 2004 and 2005. In 2006, a technical assistance loan of US$3.5 million
was approved. No new loan was approved from January 2007 to May 2008.

APPENDIX V. BARBADOS—STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
While data provision has some shortcomings, it is broadly adequate for surveillance
purposes. Barbados participates in the General Data Dissemination System, with metadata and
the authorities’ plans for improving the statistical base posted on the Fund’s Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board.
Real Sector
2.
The Barbados Statistical Services compiles national accounts statistics according to the
1968 SNA manual. A lack of current, reliable source data on nonsugar agriculture, private
construction, and nontourism service activities affects production-based GDP estimates. To
address some of the weaknesses in this area the authorities initiated a census of economic
activity in June 2005. The census covered tourism, financial businesses, and transport and
communications. Expenditure-based GDP estimates are derived from selected surveys; the
household survey yields a reliable estimate of aggregate consumption, but the external trade and
investment surveys suffer from certain weaknesses. Constant price GDP estimates, compiled by
the central bank, have an outdated 1974 base year; the authorities are currently updating the base
year to 2000 in order to facilitate comparison within the Caribbean Community area. Because of
these deficiencies, it is likely that GDP is underestimated by as much as 25-50 percent. The
authorities, with the assistance of CARTAC, are currently working on revising the national
accounts statistics.
3.
Despite recent initiatives to update the consumer price index and the index of industrial
production, potential misalignments in real estate prices are not addressed due to the absence of a
systematic index of property prices. The consumer price index uses an expenditure basket for
1998–99 for its July 2001=100 series introduced in January 2002. The index of industrial
production is based on the sectoral weights from 1982; the authorities are currently working
towards rebasing the series to 1994.
Government finance statistics
4.
Fairly comprehensive and up-to-date above-the-line data are available for the general
government, but there is a lag in the reporting of transfers. As a result of the incomplete coverage
of off-budget transactions, a discrepancy exists between the overall balance and financing data.
Public enterprise data are not systematically and promptly reported to the Ministry of Finance
and Economic Affairs. Financial sector data on public sector net domestic borrowing usually
cannot be fully reconciled with above-the-line fiscal data, partly because of limited availability
of nonbank financial sector information. The authorities introduced accrual accounting of public
finance in April 2007.
5.
There has been a pause in the reporting of annual and subannual fiscal data for
dissemination in the Fund’s publications. Consolidated annual general government data were
reported through 2004 for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook, and
subannual budgetary central government data were reported through December 2006 for IFS.

9
Monetary and financial statistics
6.
Important weaknesses remain with respect to the overall quality, coverage, and timeliness
of the monetary and financial statistics. The 2007 and 2008 STA missions found that the quality
of monetary and financial statistics was compromised by various methodological problems,
misclassifications, and the inconsistent application of residency criterion. The missions
recommended correcting a number of misclassifications of accounting data, assisted the Central
Bank of Barbados (CBB) in compiling the standardized report forms (SRFs), and established a
framework for an Integrated Monetary Database (IMD). The January 2008 follow-up mission
compiled a comprehensive depository corporations survey, which included all depository
corporations except money-market mutual funds (MMMFs), for which data were unavailable.
The mission finalized the SRF-based returns for reporting data for all deposit-taking financial
institutions to the CBB. The CBB has recently started compiling monetary statistics based on the
SFRs, which include comprehensive detailed depository corporations’ data. They were submitted
to STA in March 2008.
External sector statistics
7.
Lags in the compilation of merchandise trade data, in particular, information on the
activities of the offshore sector, limit the timeliness of the external current account balance
estimates. Estimates of the components of the external financial account need to be improved,
including data on the net international investment position. Quarterly balance of payments
estimates are no longer provided for publication in the IFS. Flows affecting net foreign assets
should be recorded above the line and accounted for in foreign reserve movements.

Statement by the Staff Representative on Barbados
July 25, 2008

1.
This statement updates the Board on developments in Barbados since the issuance of
the staff report (7/8/2008), including the main policy initiatives announced in the Prime
Minister’s budget presentation on July 7, which do not change the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
2.
Recent data are consistent with the staff’s projections for 2008. The latest national
accounts estimates confirm the staff’s projections of a significant slowdown in economic
activity in 2008. Following a buoyant first quarter, preliminary data for the second quarter
suggest a marked weakening in growth, led in particular by the construction and tourism
sectors. Accordingly, the authorities now expect the economy as a whole to grow by 2–
2½ percent during 2008, consistent with staff projections of 2.3 percent. The authorities also
expect an acceleration in inflation to about 8 percent (compared with 9 percent projected by
staff).
3.
The revised budget proposals are also broadly consistent with the fiscal stance
for FY 2008/09, as presented in the staff report. The new proposals include increases in
taxes on alcohol, tobacco, and gambling, and a wide range of nontax revenues, such as fees
on vehicles, professional services, and mobile telephones. These measures are estimated by
the authorities to provide additional revenue of about 1.3 percent of GDP on an annual basis.
The government proposes to use this fiscal space to finance additional expenditures and tax
rebates to targeted groups, estimated to cost 1.1 percent of GDP. These expenditures include:
raising the old-age pensions and welfare payments to low-income recipients; providing free
bus transportation for school children; zero-rating of VAT for building materials for lowincome housing; and supporting agriculture, energy conservation, and alternative energy
production. Incorporating these measures into the revised projections for the central
government balance implies a deficit of 2 percent of GDP in FY 2008/09, slightly lower than
the deficit projected in the staff report of 2.2 percent of GDP.
4.
The government has also decided to adopt an automatic adjustments for fuel
prices. Effective August 2008, prices on petroleum products and natural gas will be regularly
adjusted on the basis of a predetermined formula, and without any political involvement.
Accordingly, fuel prices are expected to be increased in August, and such regular
adjustments are likely to prevent a deterioration in the overall public sector balance that
would have otherwise occurred as a result of losses by the National Oil Company.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August 27, 2008

International Monetary Fund

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
Barbados
On July 25, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Barbados. 1
Background
Barbados’ economy benefits from strong institutions and social and political stability. The
country has one of the highest per capita incomes in the region, compares favorably on a wide
range of social, political, and competitiveness indicators, and enjoys an investment grade rating.
These factors have helped Barbados become a prime location for high-end tourism and
offshore financial services. As a small and open economy, however, Barbados lacks scope for
diversification and is vulnerable to external shocks. The country’s trade openness and
dependence on tourism and a few other services expose it to geopolitical tensions and cyclical
swings. Moreover, while the 33-year peg to the U.S. dollar enjoys strong support and credibility,
vulnerabilities arise from high public debt and a sizeable current account deficit.
Barbados has weathered the global financial turmoil well, thus far, but a deteriorating external
environment is posing significant challenges to the new government, elected in January. Fairly
solid growth in 2007 continued through the first quarter of 2008, driven by strong tourism activity
and helped by improved competitiveness vis-à-vis Europe and Canada. However, as the global
slowdown is increasingly taking hold of Barbados’ main trading partners, economic growth is
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
expected to decline by 1 percentage point to 2¼ percent in 2008. Inflation, which was kept low
by price controls, is projected to accelerate this year. The spike reflects record high import
prices, particularly for oil and food, in conjunction with the recent adjustment in controlled fuel
prices, which had been kept unchanged since late-2006. As a result, inflation is projected to rise
to 9 percent this year from 4 percent in 2007. At the same time, the rising import bill and the
slowdown in tourism will widen the current account deficit to a projected 8½ percent of GDP
from 7 percent in 2007.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that Barbados has benefited from strong institutions and social and
political stability. Directors observed that the Barbadian authorities are faced with a significant
challenge of balancing conflicting risks to inflation, growth, and medium-term sustainability.
While direct spillovers from the financial turmoil have been contained, Directors cautioned that
weaker global demand could affect the Barbadian economy primarily through its important
tourism sector, at a time when inflation has been pushed up by rising food and fuel prices. With
the exchange rate pegged to the U.S. dollar and fiscal space constrained by high public debt,
Directors stressed the importance of addressing these challenges through a coordinated policy
response.
Directors saw the main task for fiscal policy in identifying savings to finance targeted support to
the most vulnerable groups, while containing risks to medium-term sustainability. They
welcomed the recently revised budget, which combines a reduction in the central government
deficit with well-identified revenue measures to finance additional social and other priority
spending. Directors encouraged the government to make additional efforts to generate a
modest overall public sector surplus over the medium term, to reverse unfavorable debt
dynamics and put public debt on a firmly declining trajectory. As fiscal savings could take time
to materialize, Directors advised the authorities to identify specific revenue and expenditure
measures early on. They welcomed the recent adoption of an automatic fuel price adjustment
mechanism as an important step in this direction.
Directors saw the main role for monetary policy in containing the risk of entrenching inflation
expectations, and deemed the current policy stance as appropriately tight. However, a reduction
in interest rates may become necessary should a more severe slowdown in economic activity
be accompanied by easing of inflationary pressures. Directors also encouraged the authorities
to advance preparations for introducing indirect monetary policy instruments, to be ready for
their implementation once global financial markets have calmed.
Directors viewed the outcome of wage negotiations as critical in determining the effectiveness
of the overall policy response to the current challenges. Wage moderation was needed to
minimize second-round effects of the oil and food price shocks and thereby help the economy
adjust in the least harmful way. Directors warned specifically about the risks of wage indexation
to currently high headline inflation rates.

3
Directors agreed that the 33-year peg of the exchange rate to the U.S. dollar enjoys strong
support and credibility and has served the economy well. The real effective exchange rate is
currently not far from its estimated equilibrium, and there are no apparent signs of
competitiveness problems in the dominant tourism sector. Directors stressed, however, that
adjustments in domestic policies will be important in the medium term to contain external
imbalances.
Directors welcomed the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) update finding that the
financial system remains resilient in the face of the global turmoil. To ensure that Barbados’
financial sector continues to thrive, they encouraged the authorities to address the identified
weaknesses in its prudential oversight and to implement the key recommendations of the FSAP
update mission. In addition to a number of important provisions to strengthen banking
regulation and cross-border cooperation, Directors recommended that priority be given to
removing the gaps in the supervision of the nonbank sector.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
Reader to view this pdf file) for the 2008 Article IV Consultation with Barbados is also available.
