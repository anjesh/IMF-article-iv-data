STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND FIFTH REVIEW UNDER THE EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY

KEY ISSUES
Context. The economy is recovering from the January 2010 earthquake, albeit at a slower
pace than anticipated. Prudent macroeconomic policies have helped keep inflation in the
single digits and improve the external position. However, underexecution of capital
spending due predominantly to limited administrative and absorptive capacity, coupled with
a series of natural disasters, including cholera and tropical storms, has slowed down the
reconstruction and the economic recovery. The business environment remains unattractive
and the political situation tense.
Outlook. The recovery is expected to be firmer in 2013, assuming a rebound in agricultural
output and a pickup in public investment. Medium-term prospects are promising. The risks
to the outlook are on the downside, stemming mainly from a further slowdown in the world
economy, a volatile political environment, a fragile social context, and continued weak
capacity.
Article IV discussions. Policy discussions focused on macroeconomic policies and structural
reforms to accelerate the reconstruction, foster broad-based and inclusive growth, create
jobs and reduce poverty. The authorities and staff agreed that meeting these challenges will
require, in addition to political stability and improved security conditions, optimizing
sustainable growth-oriented fiscal policy, particularly by (i) ensuring fiscal sustainability; (ii)
expanding the fiscal space for development goals; (iii) improving the execution rate and
quality of capital spending; and (iv) strengthening public financial management (PFM). It will
also require maintaining price stability and facilitating external adjustment, and improving
the business environment by eliminating key impediments to private investments as well as
to growth and job creation.
Program implementation. Program performance is broadly satisfactory. All end-June 2012
indicative targets have been observed and all end-September 2012 quantitative performance
criteria have been met. But progress on structural reforms has been mixed. The authorities
have implemented the end-June 2012 benchmark and two out of the three end-September
2012 benchmarks. Two end-March 2012 structural benchmarks are not yet observed.

Haiti’s growth and development challenges are daunting. In 2011, real per capita GDP
was about US$ 1,034,1 25 percent below its level twenty years ago. Almost 80 percent of the
population lives with less than US$2 per day

frequent natural disasters, these indicators reflect
deep domestic institutional and structural weaknesses.
2.
The massive 2010 earthquake further exacerbated the country’s development
challenges. A total of 220,000 people were killed, including one out of three civil servants (many in
middle management), 1,200 teachers, and over 500 health personnel. In addition, 300,000 houses,
13 out of 15 ministerial buildings, 4,200 schools, and more than 60 percent of the country’s hospitals
were damaged or destroyed. Total damage caused by the earthquake was estimated at about
US$9 billion, the equivalent of 120 percent of 2009 GDP.

3.
In the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake, the Haitian authorities have adopted a tenyear action plan for building a better Haiti.2 This plan provides a framework for the
reconstruction, while laying the ground for achieving sustainable economic growth and reducing
poverty. Donors pledged about US$10 billion in

functions and undertake much-needed reforms, including in the fiscal, financial, monetary, and
statistics areas.
4.
Significant progress has been made since the last Article IV consultation in July 2010 −
just after the earthquake––to safeguard macroeconomic stability. Supported by the ECF
arrangement and in line with policy advice in the 2010 Article IV, economic activity has rebounded
and macroeconomic policies have contributed to smooth adjustment to the large aid inflows and
keep inflation in the single digits (Figure I). Official inflows and remittances contributed to
strengthen the external position. Haiti’s debt situation has significantly improved owing to
additional debt relief from major partners (including the Fund) after the January 2010 earthquake.
5.
However, the pace of the reconstruction
has been slow. Progress was made in relocating
people housed in temporary shelters, rebuilding many
schools and restoring all state functions. About
80 percent of the debris generated by the earthquake
has been removed. Further efforts are needed to
provide permanent lodging to the remaining people
still living in tents and rehabilitating many important
structures, including public buildings, schools and
hospitals.

6.
The business environment remains unattractive. Doing Business Indicators rank Haiti at
174 out of 185 countries, while the 2012–13 Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) ranks it 142 out of
144 countries. According to these indicators and the investors’ survey of the GCI, the major
constraints in Haiti’s business environment include poor infrastructure, access to finance,
administrative procedures to start a business, and taxation.
7.
The country is extremely vulnerable to exogenous shocks. Since the earthquake, the
country has repeatedly suffered from natural disasters, including cholera and two major hurricanes
and multiple floods (Box 1). Together, Hurricanes Isaac in August 2012 and Sandy in October 2012
caused at least 50 deaths and overall losses estimated at US$570 million (7.2 percent of 2012 GDP).
The agricultural sector (about one-fourth of GDP) was again severely hit. In addition to direct costs
to physical and human capital, natural disasters complicate macroeconomic management,
undermine growth, and increase poverty.

Box 1. Haiti: Natural Disasters
Haiti’s exposure to natural disasters is exceptionally high. Over the last 20 years, the country has
been struck by 60 natural disasters, affecting about 6 million people and causing almost
US$ 9 billion in damages.
The 2010 earthquake stands as the biggest natural disaster in Haiti’s history. It affected almost
4 million people and caused damage estimated at about 120 percent of 2009 GDP. More recently,
hurricanes Isaac (August 2012) and Sandy (October 2012) caused about $170 and $400 million in
damages, (mostly in the agricultural sector). Yet, improved warning and rescuing systems limited
the toll on the population, compared to previous disasters.
Natural disasters may have severe economic consequences. In addition to direct costs to physical
and human capital, natural disasters complicate macroeconomic management, undermine growth
and increase poverty. In Haiti, after the
2010 earthquake, real GDP declined by

natural disasters are estimated to have
reduced growth performance by an
average of 1 to
2 percent of GDP. They also put pressure on the fiscal and external accounts and slowed progress
toward poverty reduction. However, in most instances, adequate and timely external financing has
helped the country address immediate resource needs and limit contractionary macro policies
that could aggravate the effects of the shocks.
So urce: www.emdat.be

The national risk and disaster management system (NRDMS) in place needs to be further
strengthened. While natural disasters can rarely be prevented, the policy response will have an
important impact on the speed of recovery. Available fiscal and external buffers, flexibility in
macroeconomic policies, and external financing can help mitigate the impact of the shocks and
accelerate the recovery. Much can also be done ex ante to reduce the human suffering and
economic costs of natural disasters. These include relocating communities from disaster-prone
areas, enforcing building codes, holding food inventories as buffers against drought, and
developing emergency response mechanisms and a comprehensive system of social safety nets
for the most vulnerable. Building a better Haiti will require enhancing the NRDMS, which still
suffers from a lack of capacity, resources, and institutional support, to reduce vulnerabilities,
protect human and physical capital and establish the conditions for broad-based and inclusive
growth.

8.
The political situation remains volatile and tense. Recent publication of amendments to
the Constitution opens the door for dual nationality, a measure aimed at involving Haitians living
abroad in the development of Haiti. However, the President’s lack of majority in Parliament remains
an impediment for the passage of key legislation. In addition, the upcoming cycle of senatorial,
municipal, and other local elections4 coupled with pervasive poverty and lack of progress in
improving living standards could heighten social and political tensions. The security situation
remains challenging.
9.
Looking ahead, macroeconomic policies and structural and institutional reforms to reduce
the country’s vulnerability to foreign assistance and to natural disasters, and create a conducive
environment for private sector investment, will be needed to sustain high growth, reduce
unemployment, and raise living standards. In the near-term, the main challenge remains to take full
advantage of the technical assistance and financial support made available by the donor community
and the IFIs, including the IMF, to build capacity, accelerate the reconstruction, and sustain the
recovery while safeguarding macroeconomic stability.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A.

Recent Developments: Weak Recovery

10.
Economic activity decelerated and inflation picked up. After contracting by 5.4 percent in
FY2010 following the earthquake, economic activity expanded by 5.6 percent in real terms in
FY2011. Real GDP growth decelerated to 2.8 percent in FY2012, reflecting a spring drought, the
impact of Hurricane Isaac, and delays in implementing key public investment projects. Inflation
remains in the single digits, although it has picked up to 7.6 percent in December, up by
2.7 percentage points since June, reflecting primarily higher international food prices and reduced
domestic food supply, because of Hurricanes Isaac and Sandy.
11.
The overall fiscal deficit for FY2011/12 was higher than expected. Revenue was slightly
below target (12.8 percent of GDP instead of 13.5 percent, corresponding to a 5.7 percent decline in
nominal terms), because of lower imports and persistent inefficiencies in the tax and customs
collection process. Disbursement of budget support was significantly lower than planned
(US$27 million against US$55 million), reflecting the country’s limited administrative and absorptive
capacities and slow progress in key structural areas important to donors, including procurement and
governance. Emergency spending following Hurricane Isaac, outlays for new ministries and higher
transfers to the electricity company, increased current spending by almost US$50 million above
target (0.6 percent of GDP). Domestically-financed capital spending slightly exceeded the program
target, although some of the spending merely represents transfers of resources to project accounts
4

The elections, which were initially planned for November 2011, have been postponed several times, particularly due
to contention regarding the composition and mandate of the Permanent Electoral Council. Then there was an
agreement to form a transitional body with a mandate to solely oversee the forthcoming elections. Discussions are
still ongoing between the Executive, Legislative, and Judiciary to nominate the nine members of the Council.

and not actual project execution5. Overall, the government ended FY2012 with a deficit of
5.9 percent of GDP, against a programmed deficit of 3.6 percent.
12.
The external position has strengthened. The current account deficit decreased to
4 percent of GDP, from 4.6 percent in FY2011, despite the significant drop in official transfers from
19.6 percent of GDP to 12.5 percent of GDP, due to the completion of the immediate postearthquake disaster phase, slow progress in structural reforms, and weak execution and absorption
capacities. At the same time, capital inflows, including FDI, continued to be strong. The overall
balance of payments recorded a small surplus and, gross international reserves increased to
US$2.2 billion at end-December 2012, equivalent to 6 months of imports, above the commonlyused rule of thumb of 3 months of imports.
13.
Monetary policy has been largely passive. Key policy rates have remained unchanged
since January 2011. However, increase in public sector deposits contributed to a marked slowdown
in broad money growth. Overall, broad money increased by 6.9 percent in 2012, well below the
programmed level (11.2 percent).
14.
Bank credit growth has been strong. Commercial bank credit to the private sector has
continued to grow (34.5 percent at end-October 2012, y/y), fuelled by rising demand for short-term
trade credit. Credit growth in gourdes was 1.7 times higher than that in dollars in October 2012
(37.5 vs. 22.7 percent), reflecting continued macroeconomic stability and recent decisions by the
Central Bank to eliminate the requirement to keep in gourdes 30 percent of the reserves for dollar
deposits.
15.
The banking sector remains sound and profitable. Banks had an average capital
adequacy ratio of 16.8 percent at end September 2012, above the regulatory minimum (12 percent).
Returns on assets and equity are comfortable, and non-performing loans are low, at 2.4 percent of
total loans at end September 2012. Liquidity and exchange rate risks related to the high financial

mainly to larger commercial entities that derive most of their income in US dollars. Vulnerabilities
remain, particularly related to the concentrated lending portfolios, relatively underdeveloped credit
risk management practices and weak governance.
16.
The implementation of the recommendations of the 2008 FSAP to further strengthen
the financial sector is underway, albeit with some delays. The January 2010 earthquake has
slowed down the reform process, shifted priorities and added new challenges. Nevertheless, some
progress was made with (i) the adoption of a new banking law, (i) the hiring of a new audit firm to
conduct the audit of the BRH; and (iii), the establishment of a T-bill market (See Table 9). Measures
have also been taken to enhance coordination between the central bank and the ministry of finance,
and to improve liquidity management. Work is ongoing with the World Bank to establish a credit
bureau and set up a collateral registry.

B.

Prospects and Risks: Promising but Challenging

17.
The recovery is expected to continue in FY2013. Real GDP is projected to grow by
6.5 percent assuming a rebound in the agricultural sector and the continued execution of several
large public investment projects, including those aimed at promoting exports and tourism.6 Inflation
should remain stable, in the mid-single digits. Official transfers are expected to decline reflecting the
transition from the emergency situation, as well as weak execution and absorption capacities in
Haiti. Higher reconstruction-related imports would widen the external account deficit, and reduce
gross liquid official reserves to 5.5 months of imports.

Medium-term prospects are promising. Maturing ongoing agricultural projects, a rebound

imports and improved exports. Total government debt-to-GDP, the medium-term fiscal anchor, will
remain below 30 percent (the pre-earthquake level).
19.
The outlook is subject to significant downside risks. On the external front, a severe shock
to global growth could have negative spillovers (See Risk Assessment Matrix below) —
predominantly through remittances (about 18 percent of GDP in 2012), trade (exports were
13.2 percent of GDP and mainly destined for the US), and official transfers (about 12.5 percent of
GDP). However, remittances displayed some resilience during past episodes of the global slowdown.
Higher food and oil prices are also a major source of external risk. On the domestic front,
heightened political tensions could postpone or again slow down public investment spending and
delay the reform agenda. Lingering social tensions, fueled by pervasive poverty and lack of progress
in improving living standards, and natural disasters, could also impede the fragile recovery and
constrain Haiti’s growth prospects. Finally, Haiti’s debt continues to be assessed as high-risk
(Country Report No. 12/220; February 24, 2012).7
20.
The authorities broadly agreed with the staff’s overall outlook. However, they believed
that growth could be higher than projected because of (i) the launching of the reconstruction of key
public buildings, including those of the Ministries of Economy and Finance, and of Commerce as
well as Parliament; (ii) the creation of four micro parks in rural areas aimed at improving the
harvesting, stocking, and preservation of agricultural products; and (iii) the ongoing work to
strengthen the national risk and disaster management system. Staff saw some merit to the
authorities’ views, but pointed out that low capacity remains a major hindrance. In addition, staff
emphasized that real GDP growth under the baseline scenario (6.5 percent) depends critically on a
strong pick-up in reconstruction-related projects, including the construction of several public
buildings. Also, the authorities viewed lower aid flows and higher food prices as key risks to the
outlook. They indicated that lower official transfers coupled with the withdrawal of many
international NGOs could lead to a more rapid decline in net international reserves in the medium
term. They remain, however, committed to keeping international reserves above three months of
imports.

POLICY CHALLENGES FOR SUSTAINING A BROADBASED AND INCLUSIVE GROWTH
21.
Policy discussions focused on macroeconomic policies and structural reforms to
accelerate the reconstruction, foster broad-based and inclusive growth, to create jobs and
reduce poverty. The authorities and staff agreed that in addition to political stability and
improved security conditions, meeting this challenge will require (i) optimizing fiscal policy for
higher and more inclusive growth; (ii) maintaining price stability and facilitating external
adjustment; and (iii) and improving the business environment by eliminating key impediments
to private investments as well as growth and job creation.

A.

Optimizing fiscal policy for high and inclusive growth

22.
Staff and the authorities agreed that fiscal policy can help achieve higher and more
inclusive growth while ensuring medium-term sustainability.9 This will require expanding the
fiscal space for development goals, improving the execution rate and quality of capital spending,
and strengthening public financial management (PFM).
23.
The FY2013 budget targets an overall deficit of 5.3 percent of GDP, down from
5.9 percent in FY2012. The decline reflects mostly higher revenue and somewhat lower current
spending.
Revenue is projected to reach 14.1 percent in FY2013, up from 12.8 percent of GDP in
FY2012. This increase reflects reforms

2013 (MEFP, ¶ 14). Improved identification and evaluation of merchandise and a better
control of exemptions are expected to enhance collection at customs.


The wage bill is expected to increase by almost 0.6 percent of GDP owing mostly to new
hiring in social sectors and security, and higher salaries for the low-earning civil servants.
Nevertheless, the budget targets lower levels of goods and services as well as transfers to
make room for higher development spending. In particular, outlays in goods and services will
remain in line with previous years’ levels (MEFP,¶ 15). Consistent with the authorities’
intention to step up the reconstruction, domestically-financed capital spending will be
ramped up to around 9 percent of GDP, more than 2 percent higher than in 2012. The
projected deficit is fully financed with external resources (4.4 percent of GDP) and domestic
financing, including issuance of T-bills (0.9 percent of GDP).

24.
Staff viewed the FY 2013 fiscal policy stance as broadly appropriate, but
highlighted several implementation risks. First, the

Looking ahead, fiscal policy will aim at further enhancing revenue mobilization and
improving the composition of public spending. Domestic revenue would increase to about
15 percent of GDP in 2017 while donor support is expected to trend down to about 6 percent of
GDP, down from 10.6 percent in FY2012. Current expenditures are expected to be contained
below 11 percent while protecting social spending (Box 2). Progress with reconstruction and the
country’s developmental needs would maintain capital spending high in the medium term. The
overall deficit is projected to decrease gradually to 3.1 percent of GDP by 2017.
Expanding the fiscal space for achieving development goals
26.
The revenue target for 2013 is ambitious. The authorities indicated that the
underperformance observed in the first three months of FY2013 is partially due to Hurricane
Sandy, which disrupted revenue collection. They were confident meeting the end-year target,
and reiterated their commitment in stepping up efforts to increase revenue mobilization. Staff
underscored the need for steadfast implementation of the revenue measures included in the
2013 budget law. The authorities and staff agreed that, given the high reconstruction-related
needs, the government has the option of drawing down its deposits and issuing additional T-Bills

in the event of a shortfall in domestic revenue, while ensuring medium-term debt sustainability
and macroeconomic stability (MEFP,¶ 13). The authorities could also consider reducing some
non-priority current spending or delaying some non-reconstruction-related domesticallyfinanced capital spending (without affecting the overall execution and consistency of the
investment program).
27.
The authorities are aware that achieving their revenue target of 15 percent by 2017
will require moving forcefully on tax policy and administration reforms. This will require
decisive actions to further improve revenue collection and compliance, reduce and rationalize
exemptions (more than 3 percent of GDP in FY2011), and expand the tax base, including through
increased formalization of economic activity (MEFP,¶ 21). In particular, staff underscored the
importance of launching a broader reform of the tax system, including a shift to a VAT system.
Efforts are also needed to improve controls, internal audits, and training in both customs and
revenue administrations.

Box 2. Haiti: Strengthening Social Safety Nets and Human Capital
Haiti ranked at 158 out of 187 countries in the UNDP Human Development Index in 2011. The literacy rate
remains significantly lower than that of the Caribbean average and maternal mortality almost four times higher
than average. Government spending on education and health remains relatively low, at 2.1 and 1.4 percent of
GDP respectively, compared to 3.8 and 3.4 percent on average in the region. Health spending in Haiti has
actually declined since 1997 in percent of GDP. Therefore, strengthening current transfer schemes and safety nets
for the poor while increasing spending in health and education, remain key priorities.

under the PSUGO (Programme de Scolarisation Universel Gratuit et Obligatoire). The conditional cash transfer
program (“Ti-manman-cheri”) has benefitted about 25 thousand women who have been receiving monthly
allowances from the government. The disabled and elderly have also benefitted from cash transfers.
Looking ahead, the authorities intend to promote access to preschool, primary and secondary education through
dedicated learning centers, expanding school feeding programs, strengthening vocational and technical training
through the creation of training centers and government fellowships and increasing the provision of health
services.

The authorities agreed that further restraint on recurrent expenditure would free
resources to fund growth-enhancing projects and social spending. This will require:


Containing the public sector wage bill. The wage bill in Haiti remains relatively low in
comparison to regional peers and low-income countries. Staff recognized the need for higher
civil service wages to compensate for cost-of living increases, maintain competitive pay to
improve administrative capacity, and support the hiring of additional workers in social
sectors. However, it reiterated the importance



Gradually unwinding subsidies to the electricity company EDH. While conceding that this is a
challenging issue given its social and political impact, the authorities agreed that a
comprehensive strategy, developed with the assistance of key donors, would help reverse the
financial difficulties of EDH, reduce budgetary transfers (MEFP,¶ 15), and create the
conditions for improving electricity availability at a reasonable cost (Box 3).

Improving the execution rate and quality of capital spending
29.
The execution rate of public investment has been low.10 This underperformance is
attributable to various factors, including poor design and preparation of projects, low execution
capacity, lack of coordination between government agencies, weak reporting, political
uncertainty, volatile security, and loose enforcement of internal control mechanisms.
30.
There was a broad agreement that weaknesses in public investment, including a
low execution rate, have impeded reconstruction and slowed growth. The steady rise in
investment particularly during the post-earthquake period put pressure on the already weak
institutional framework, overran current technical capacity, and highlighted the fragile state of
the project management process. Public investment efficiency as measured by the Public
Investment Management Index (PIMI)11 ranked Haiti in the lowest quartile of project
performance.

Improving the execution and quality of capital spending will require a strong
political commitment and leadership to upgrade the current public investment framework
through enhanced transparency, better procurement practices, and stronger governance.
In particular, there is a need to redefine and clarify responsibilities among government
institutions involved in public investment project management, strengthen the units in charge of
project execution within ministries (including by hiring technical experts), enhance the control
system, and promote a more dynamic information system (MEFP,¶ 16). Preliminary results of an
analytical paper on this issue were presented to the government and the donor community and
its recommendations were well received.12 Staff intends to continue working with the authorities
and donor community to strengthen project preparation, execution, and control while ensuring
the overall quality and consistency of public investment.
Improving public financial management
The authorities reiterated their commitments to improve public financial management.
In particular, the authorities highlighted ongoing progress towards a treasury single account
(TSA), with completion of the first phase that included closing all identified dormant
government accounts in the banking system, and the training of public accountants. It is now
important to introduce the TSA by June 2013 in a first wave of ministries with adequate
capacity for a rapid shift. The authorities and staff viewed the establishment of a TSA as key
to improving cash management, budget execution and the quality of public spending,
particularly by enhancing the execution rate of capital spending and improving transparency
by eliminating the current practice of bunching transfers of resources to project accounts
including strategic guidance and project appraisal, project selection and budgeting, project implementation, and
project evaluation and audit.

near the end of the fiscal year. Continued progress needs to be made to strengthen budget
formulation, execution, transparency and reporting, and improve internal and external
controls (MEFP, ¶ 22).
Box 3. Haiti: Electricity Sector
By law, the public utility Electricité d’Haïti (EDH) holds a monopoly over the purchase, transmission,
distribution and commercialization of electricity, and generates about 15 percent of the energy produced in
Haiti. About 75 percent of the electricity it distributes is produced by independent power producers, the rest
being generated by power plants operated by the Tripartite Cooperation (Haiti-Venezuela-Cuba). Installed
generation capacity of 212 MW is insufficient to meet peak load demand estimated at around 250 MW.
Insufficient generation capacity and inefficient distribution grid lead to frequent energy rationing, which
causes businesses and residential users to rely on expensive back-up generators. There is no clear
responsibility within the Government for sector oversight, and no investment master plan for the sector.
EDH’s financial situation is critical. Technical and commercial losses are estimated at about 66 percent, the
ratio of energy unpaid to energy produced is high (35 percent of the energy delivered is stolen), 1 and the
utility paid bills cover less than a third of the electricity generated. In this context, EDH charges high
electricity tariffs: average tariffs amount to $0.31/kWh2, at par with levels in the Caribbean, but industrial and
commercial tariffs are even higher at $0.35/kWh.
In February 2011, a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was agreed between the government, the IADB,
and USAID to help reform the electricity sector. On August 2, 2012, the EDH Board approved a loss
reduction plan for the utility. On August 17, 2012, the external firm TETRATECH was given the authority to
implement measures to improve EDH performance. A new managing director and deputy directors were also
appointed at EDH to improve management of the company, reduce distribution and commercial losses, and
raise bill payments proceeds. In addition, the government and EDH signed a MoU establishing a mechanism
for budgetary transfers to the electricity sector for the fiscal years 2013 to 2016. Despite all these recent
measures and an improvement in revenue collection, the sector financial situation remains dire. Government
transfers to EDH amounted in FY2012 to US$ 142 million.
Next steps would include (i) an immediate analysis of the current financial situation of EDH and the sector as
a whole; (ii) measures to improve the financial situation of EDH and of the electricity sector over the
medium-term; and (iii) the design of a detailed program to implement a financial recovery strategy for the
electricity sector, starting with the preparation of a financial recovery plan. More specifically,
 EDH is developing a plan with the support of donor partners to restore EDH’s financial soundness,
including reducing losses and production leakages, improving the distribution network, enhancing bill
collection, and strengthening energy supply. This plan, which would eliminate transfers by 2016, will be
submitted to the government for adoption in April 2013.
 Donors (including USAID, the World Bank, and the IADB) have committed to support the
government’s electricity strategy through a coordinated investment plan of approximately
US$400 million over the next five years, focusing on loss reduction, grid rehabilitation and extension,
and technical assistance to improve capacity in the sector and within EDH.

Staff and the authorities agreed that further strengthening administrative capacity
will be critical to improve PFM and the delivery of public services. Staff reiterated the Fund’s
commitment to continue assisting Haiti, including in capacity-building. Since October 2011, a
long-term IMF expert has been posted at the MEF, particularly to build capacity at the Treasury
and help with the creation of the TSA. Several macro-fiscal missions have also taken place in the
recent months13 to provide training and help (i) establish and make operational a macro-fiscal
unit at the Ministry of Economy and Finance; and (ii) prepare macro-fiscal forecasts and
analyses. The next visit scheduled for March 2013 will aim at developing tools for the analysis of
the quality of capital expenditure. In addition, a series of technical assistance missions have taken
place to help strengthen revenue administration and improve tax policy.
33.
There was a consensus that potential fiscal risks associated with extra-budgetary
funds and quasi-fiscal activities need to be closely monitored. In particular, the government
should remain vigilant and closely monitor the risks associated with the joint-venture between
the Haitian and Venezuelan governments on public investment. The new company has been
created and registered with the tax administration and its managing director has been
appointed. Once operational, the company will manage the PetroCaribe program, and
PetroCaribe-related inflows will become a non-governmental debt. This is not expected to
worsen the medium-term fiscal and public debt sustainability, as the new entity is expected to
continue to finance PetroCaribe –related capital and social spending. Staff reiterated the need to
enhance transparency and accountability, including through the timely publication of the annual
budgets and the audited annual financial statements of the new company.

B.

Maintaining price stability and facilitating external adjustment

34.
Monetary policy will continue to focus on achieving price stability. Both staff and the
authorities agreed that the current monetary policy stance appropriately supports the postearthquake recovery while keeping inflation in single digits. The recent pickup in inflation
reflects mainly higher international food prices and disruption in the supply of domestic foods
caused by recent hurricanes and floods. Inflation is expected to remain in the 5-6 percent range
over the coming year, assuming that the shock from international food prices will recede and
domestic food production will recover. However, staff reiterated the need for the central bank to
remain vigilant in monitoring inflationary pressures. The authorities indicated that policy
tightening could be done through available tools, including the policy rate, the required reserves
ratio, and the issuance of central bank and Treasury bills.
35.
Unwinding excess liquidity will enhance monetary transmission mechanisms and
facilitate the conduct of monetary policy. The banking sector remains highly liquid. In line
with the recommendations of the 2008 FSAP, the authorities have taken steps to deepen the
domestic financial market and improve liquidity management (MEFP, ¶ 17). In particular, the legal
and operational market infrastructure is in place and several initial T-bill issuances were
13

Cash Management”.

successful. However, there have not been regular issuances, predominantly because of the lack of
financing needs by the Treasury. In this context, staff was encouraged by the recent framework
agreement for securitization of the large government debt toward the BRH.14 This will help
further develop the T-Bill market and gradually
absorb excess reserves.

The authorities are cognizant of the
need to limit dollarization to strengthen the
traction of monetary policy. While declining
in recent months, dollarization remains high.
The authorities agreed with staff that reducing
dollarization will require a positive and longer
track record of political and economic stability,
greater flexibility in the exchange rate, and
deepening of domestic financial markets to
provide alternative investment opportunities
instead of foreign currency deposits (MEFP, ¶
18).

led to the gourde’s appreciation in real

that the small appreciation of the gourde does not pose a threat to external competitiveness.

The current level of international reserves of about six months of imports provides
Haiti a good buffer in the near term. Official transfers significantly increased after the
earthquake from US$395 million in FY2009 to US$1446 million in FY2011 before declining to
US$988 million in FY2012. Similarly, private transfers, mostly workers’ remittances, have increased
by US$140 million during the same period.

provides Haiti a relatively good buffer in
the short-term. Preserving external stability
in the long term hinges on improving competitiveness and promoting exports. In this respect,
staff was encouraged by the recent launching of the industrial Park of CARACOL.15
Sources: BRH; and IMF estimates

39.
Greater flexibility in the exchange rate will help protect external stability. The
authorities agreed that they should take advantage of the current situation, adequate reserve
coverage and a REER broadly in line with fundamentals, to allow for greater flexibility in the
exchange rate. However, they were concerned that the country’s shallow foreign exchange
market could lead to significant exchange rate volatility, as lumpy transactions or very few
participants could cause jumps in the exchange rate. They also expressed concern about upside
inflation risks associated with exchange rate depreciation. The authorities reaffirmed their
commitment to the floating exchange rate regime but wished to move cautiously and gradually
to single-price foreign exchange auctions. A first step is to allow more participants and promote
the development of the interbank foreign exchange market. At the same time, BRH interventions
in the foreign exchange market will continue to aim at smoothing excessive fluctuations (MEFP,
¶ 19).

C.

Strengthening the Business Environment

40.
The authorities agreed that improving the business environment is urgent to raise
productivity, enhance competitiveness, and lift constraints on growth (MEFP, ¶ 23). The
business community in Haiti as well as international surveys indicated that weak infrastructure
and lack of access to finance have been two major impediments to private sector-led growth.

15

CARACOl is a new industrial park in the north of the country. The authorities expect the park to boost exports
and generate several thousand jobs.

Upgrading the country’s infrastructure
41.
Addressing the infrastructure gap is
critical for growth prospects. Haiti performs
poorly on most infrastructure indicators.
Ramping up domestically-financed investment is
crucial to build the necessary infrastructure that
would unlock the country’s potential. To
safeguard public debt sustainability, the
authorities agreed with staff to seek
concessional financing for infrastructure,
including PetroCaribe resources and PublicPrivate Partnerships (MEFP, ¶ 26). They indicated
that they are finalizing the legal framework for
PPPs (MEFP, ¶ 23).

Deepening financial intermediation while preserving stability
42.
The authorities are extremely keen to further deepen financial intermediation.
Commercial bank credit to the private sector has increased on average by about 28 percent a
year over the last two years, reflecting predominantly the impact of the reconstruction, large
current transfers, the increased liquidity in the banking system and new measures, including the
creation of a Partial Guarantee Funds in the aftermath of the earthquake. However, at about
19 percent of GDP at end-September 2012, credit to the private sector stands well below the
average for LICs, due to a broad range of factors, including significant weaknesses in the legal
and institutional framework, the fragile security situation, and limited competition between
banks16. In addition, banks restrict their lending to a limited number of economic activities and

borrowers. The authorities consider further improvements in financial intermediation as crucial
for their growth revival agenda (MEFP, ¶ 20). Measures include the establishment of a credit
bureau, setting up a collateral registry, adopting a legal framework for the supervision of
microfinance institutions, and implementing regulatory changes to facilitate leasing.
43.
The authorities recognized that rapid credit growth, while essential, could also pose
a number of challenges for the banking system and the economy. Recent credit growth has
been healthy and the banking sector remains relatively sound and profitable. Nevertheless, the
authorities and staff concurred that the rapid credit growth may require a tightening of
prudential regulations and closer supervision to preserve financial sector soundness. (MEFP, ¶
20). 17 The BRH has requested technical assistance from the IMF to develop macroprudential
rules. In particular, an upcoming 3 day-workshop will focus on a set of prudential, regulatory,
legal, and structural measures to maintain credit quality and limit macroprudential risks. Staff
emphasized the need to accelerate the implementation of the recommendations of the 2008
FSAP to further improve the financial regulatory and supervisory framework.

PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION
44.
Program performance is broadly satisfactory. All end-June 2012 indicative targets
were observed and all end-September 2012 performance criteria were met. Full data are not yet
available to assess observation of end-December indicative targets. In the structural area, the
authorities have implemented the end-June 2012 benchmark related to the closing of all
dormant accounts of the central government at the central bank and commercial banks as well
as the two end-September 2012 benchmarks on the creation of the fiscal policy unit with the
MEF and of the unit in charge of the medium and large enterprises. The third end-September
benchmark related to the move to single-price foreign exchange auctions has not been
implemented yet, mostly because of lack of competition in the FX market, which is dominated by
a few major players. The authorities’ objective is to start by expanding the number of participants
in the FX markets. Also, two end-March 2012 structural benchmarks are not yet observed. The
benchmark on strengthening the debt unit with fully operational middle and back offices is
underway as it is linked to the passage of the organic law on the reorganization of the Ministry of
Economy and Finance which the government intends to submit to Parliament early 2013. The
second benchmark related to the public debt law is also expected to be submitted to parliament
at the same time. The Minister of Finance has submitted the two draft laws in January 2013 to the
Prime Minister’s office before submission to the Parliament by end-March 2013. Thus, the two
benchmarks would be rescheduled from end-March 2012 to end-March 2013.

17

Staff presented to the authorities the preliminary results of an analytical paper addressing this issue. The paper
was well received.

OTHER ISSUES
45.
Safeguards assessment. The authorities continue to implement the recommendations of
the 2010 follow-up review of the safeguards assessment (MEFP, ¶ 28), albeit with some delays.
Progress is underway to migrate to IFRS, including the creation of a special committee to
monitor its implementation. The recent adoption of the framework agreement between the BRH
and the MEF paves the way for the securitization of central bank credit to government. Lastly,
staff urged the authorities to activate the Investment Committee as an independent oversight
body and appoint a compliance officer to monitor observation of foreign reserves policy and
investment guidelines.
46.
Anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). The
draft AML/CFT law is being finalized and should be enacted by Parliament during its spring 2013
session (MEFP, ¶ 29). Staff encourages the authorities to ensure the new law’s compliance with
the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards and to proceed with its effective implementation
as this will support efforts to combat corruption.
47.
Data provision. Data are broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, but data gaps,
linked to capacity constraints, still occur in many areas, including national accounts, balance of
payments and social and labor market indicators.

STAFF APPRAISAL
48.
The economy is gradually recovering from the January 2010 earthquake. Prudent
macroeconomic policies have helped keep inflation in the single digits and improve the external
position. However, under-execution of capital spending, due predominantly to limited

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

HAITI

administrative and absorptive capacity, coupled with persistent political tensions and instability,
and a series of shocks, including cholera and tropical storms, have considerably slowed down the
reconstruction and economic activity. The recovery is expected to be firmer in 2013, led by a
rebound in agricultural output and a pickup in public investment. The risks to the outlook are on
the downside, stemming mainly from a volatile political environment, fragile social context, and
weak capacity.
49.
Fiscal reforms should continue. Fiscal space for poverty-related and growth-enhancing
spending should be secured through increasing revenue and containing current spending. The
2013 revenue target is ambitious but could be achieved provided there is strong resolve to
combat fraud, particularly at customs, and strengthen revenue collection. In this context, staff
welcomes the launch of the e-declaration in January 2013 and urges the authorities to
implement rapidly the remaining measures specified in the 2013 budget law. Looking ahead,
efforts will need to be stepped up to further strengthen revenue administration, reduce tax
expenditure, and expand the tax base. There is ample room to improve the composition and
quality of spending. In particular, staff urges the authorities to adopt a comprehensive energy
sector reform to gradually reduce subsidies to EDH. Recent efforts are welcome to improve
public financial management and in particular to establish a treasury single account. Continued
progress needs to be made to strengthen budget formulation, execution, transparency and
reporting, and improve internal and external controls.
50.
Improving the execution rate of public investment should be a key priority.
Ramping up domestically-financed investment is crucial to build the necessary infrastructure that
would unlock the country’s potential. Staff urges the authorities to work closely with donors to
strengthen project design and preparation, execution, reporting and control while ensuring the
overall quality and consistency of public investment. In particular, it is urgent to strengthen the
agency in charge of procurement and the units in charge of project assessment and
programming (UEP) and of technical execution (UTE) in line ministries, including by hiring
international experts in key spending ministries.
51.
Efforts to further develop and strengthen social safety nets are essential. Recent
initiatives to alleviate poverty through direct transfers are welcome. However, targeting the
beneficiaries of these policies is a daunting task as a very large segment of the population is
highly vulnerable, and government resources are limited. Spending will have to be frequently
audited to prevent the misuse of funds, and impact analysis conducted to ensure that the money
spent helps meet the authorities’ social goals. The government will have to strike a balance
between helping the poor and not creating unrealistic expectations about how much
government can do. A sustainable fight against poverty can only be waged through high and
inclusive growth.
52.
The monetary policy stance is appropriate. The authorities will need to remain vigilant
to keep price inflation under check. Further progress to improve liquidity management, deepen
the domestic financial market, strengthen market-based operations, and reduce dollarization will
help strengthen monetary transmission mechanisms.

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

HAITI

53.
The authorities’ continuing commitment to exchange rate flexibility is welcome.
Greater exchange rate flexibility would help absorb external shocks and increase monetary policy
effectiveness. Consideration should be given to the gradual introduction of single-price foreign
exchange auctions and BRH’s interventions should be limited to smoothing excessive exchange
rate volatility.
54.
Improving the business environment is urgent to raise productivity, enhance
competitiveness, and achieve higher and more inclusive growth. Measures are under way to
streamline the country’s numerous, complex, and cumbersome regulations, reduce the cost and
alleviate the burden of doing business, and promote private sector development. However, a
strong political consensus and commitment are needed to move ahead with long-awaited
structural reforms to make Haiti a country open for business and attractive for investors. It will be
particularly important to address the country’s infrastructure gap, deepen financial
intermediation while safeguarding stability, and strengthen human capital. The authorities also
need to vigorously pursue reform of the energy sector to reduce the high cost of electricity and
improve the reliability and efficiency of energy supply. Clarifying the property rights will also
help.
55.
Staff supports the completion of the fifth review of the ECF arrangement in view of
Haiti’s good performance so far and the authorities’ commitment to the program.
56.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Haiti be held in accordance with
the decision on Article IV Consultation Cycles adopted on September 28, 2010, as amended.

Haiti’s current account deficit has declined from 12.5 percent of GDP in 2010 to
4 percent in 2012. The trade deficit remained high at 23.5 percent of GDP at end-September
2012, due to both high aid-related imports and

2.
Haiti’s level of exports at about 15 percent of GDP remains low compared both to
the Caribbean and Latin America average. Moreover, exports remain highly concentrated
with textile exports accounting for about

Foreign Direct Investment in Haiti has

Improvements in the ease of doing business and the climate for private domestic and foreign
direct investment are critical for competitiveness. Among the main sources of foreign
technology, FDI often plays a key role and innovation is important for improving productivity
and competitiveness. Haiti needs to continue developing a legal framework that harnesses
entrepreneurship by promoting transparency and accountability in the rule of law and
protecting property rights and continue investing

The real exchange rate in Haiti is assessed
to be broadly in line with its medium-term
fundamentals based on the standard CGER
approach. Haiti’s real effective exchange rate
(REER) has remained broadly stable since the 2010
earthquake. It has appreciated only by 7 percent
despite the large inflows of remittances and

external aid. This reflects a moderate depreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate and
relatively higher inflation compared to key partners.
5.
According to the Equilibrium real
effective exchange rate (EREER) approach,
the current REER is close to the equilibrium
value estimated from a set of fundamentals,
including GDP per capita relative to trading
partners, current transfers, terms of trade, and
openness, the REER, and investment as a share
of GDP. Results show a modest undervaluation
as of end-September 2011; the recent
appreciation of the REER reflects predominantly
an equilibrium response to movements in
fundamentals.

7.
Diversification and increase of exports as well as of FDI are critical for external
sustainability and enhanced competitiveness in Haiti. Given the high dollarization and real
exchange rate broadly aligned with the fundamentals, improving competitiveness in Haiti is
predicated on structural reforms to boost productivity. In order to reduce supply-side
bottlenecks, improve the business environment and promote export diversification, legal and
regulatory reforms as well as significant improvements in infrastructure are needed.

Appendix I. Letter of Intent
February 14, 2013

Mrs. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington D.C. 20431
United States of America

Dear Mrs. Lagarde:
1.
The economic recovery process is slower than planned, as a result of several factors,
including the passage of tropical storms Isaac and Sandy in August and October 2012, a drop in
external aid, and weak administrative and absorptive capacities. Notwithstanding these adverse
conditions, implementation of our program supported by an arrangement under the Extended
Credit Facility (ECF) remains broadly on track.
2.
We observed all end-June 2012 indicative targets and met all end-September 2012
performance criteria. In the structural area, we have implemented the end-June 2012 benchmark
related to the closing of all dormant accounts of the central government at the central bank or
commercial banks as well as the two end-September 2012 benchmarks on the creation of the
fiscal policy unit with the MEF and the unit in charge of the medium and large enterprises. The
third end-September benchmark related to the move to single-price foreign exchange auctions
has not been implemented yet. Our objective is to start by expanding the number of participants
in the FX markets. Also, two end-March 2012 structural benchmarks are not yet observed. The
benchmark on strengthening the debt unit with fully operational middle and back offices is
underway as it is linked to the passage of the organic law on the reorganization of the Ministry of
Economy and Finance. The second benchmark is related to the public debt law. Both draft laws
are being reviewed by the Prime Minister’s office and will be submitted to the Parliament by endMarch 2013.
3.
The ECF-supported program will continue to play a pivotal role in supporting the
reconstruction and recovery, maintaining macroeconomic stability and achieving broad-based
and inclusive growth. In this context, the government is committed to creating more room for
poverty-related and growth-enhancing spending; maintaining price stability and facilitating
external adjustment through prudent and well-coordinated macroeconomic policies; and moving
ahead with key structural reforms to boost productivity and competitiveness, and to support
sustained growth.

4.
To meet these objectives, we intend to make full use of all available technical assistance
and financial resources, including those freed by the IMF PCDR, a share of which will be allocated
to increase the domestic revenue intake through further reforms aimed at broadening the tax
base and modernizing the revenue administration. In this vein, we have agreed on the need to
improve customer service at DGI by launching and operating an electronic tax declaration
system.
5.
The reform agenda will also focus on enhancing public financial management, and
economic governance, strengthening the financial sector, and creating the conditions for an
appropriate environment for private investment. We will also strengthen the coordination with
our partners and improve the efficiency of aid flows through the new mechanism for
coordination and harmonization of aid. This mechanism provides for an alignment of
international funds on national development goals and government investment programs, and
relies on the national budget as the main vehicle for channeling all aid.
6.
In support of these policies and in view of the progress made in implementing the
program supported by the ECF arrangement, the government requests the completion of the
fifth review and the approval of the sixth disbursement for an amount equivalent to
SDR 4.914 million. The upcoming sixth review, which will assess performance based on endMarch 2013 targets, is envisaged for July 2013.
7.
We will regularly update the IMF on economic and policy developments and will provide
the data needed for adequate monitoring of the program. The government will continue its
policy dialogue with the IMF and is prepared to take any further measures as deemed
appropriate to meet its program objectives. We will consult with the Fund ahead of the adoption
of these measures and any revisions to the measures outlined in the MEFP, in accordance with
the Fund’s policies on such consultation.
8.
The Government authorizes the IMF to publish this letter, the attached Memorandum of
Economic and Financial Policies, and the related Staff Report, including the placement of these
policy documents on the IMF website, following the IMF Executive Board's conclusion of the
review.
Sincerely yours,

ATTACHMENT 1. MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES

Introduction
1.
This Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) supplements and
updates the MEFPs that have preceded it since July 2010. It reviews recent economic
developments and progress in implementing our macroeconomic and structural program under
the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement, approved by the IMF Board on July 21, 2010. It
also sets out macroeconomic policies and structural reforms that we will pursue during
FY2012/2013.

Political background and recent economic developments
2.
Recent political developments are encouraging. Prime Minister Lamothe and his
reform-minded cabinet are pressing ahead with an agenda favoring an acceleration of the
reconstruction and key reforms to improve economic management and governance. The current
cabinet is forward-looking and reform-minded and is gaining support from large segments of
the population. The recent publication of constitutional amendments opens the door for dual
nationality and will pave the way for a greater involvement of the Haitian living abroad in the
development of the country. Nonetheless, we also are aware of the need for the upcoming
election cycle for the renewal of one third of the Senate and all municipal governments1 to be
organized in the best security conditions so as to lessen political tensions. The security situation
remains our main priority.
3.
The economic recovery has been weaker-than-planned and 12-month inflation has
risen. Economic activity has been uneven across sectors. It remained buoyant in the
manufacturing, energy, and commerce sectors. In contrast, agricultural output was weaker, as a
result of the spring drought and the passage of Hurricane Isaac at the end of August. At the
same time, activity in the construction sector and transportation has remained modest, due in
part to the low execution rate of public investment caused by the political stalemate and the late
approval of the budget. On balance, for the year as a whole, the economy has grown only by
2.8 percent, against a target of 4.5 percent. In contrast, inflationary pressures from international
food prices have pushed headline inflation to 7.6 percent through end-December 2012, up
2.7 percentage points since June 2012.
4.
The fiscal deficit outcome for FY2012 is higher-than-programmed. The overall fiscal
deficit reached 5.9 percent of GDP, against a program target of 3.6 percent. This
underperformance reflected lower-than-planned domestic revenue, a drop in grants, and slightly
higher-than-planned spending. On the revenue side, the intake reached 12.8 percent of GDP,
compared with a program objective of 13.5 percent, mainly on account of lower customs duties.
Disbursement of budget support fell short of the 0.7 percent of GDP target by 0.4 percentage

points, partly because of slow progress in key structural areas, including procurement and
governance, delays in some donors’ disbursement process stemming from external aid
conditionality and complexity, and the country’s limited administrative and absorptive capacities.
Current spending slightly exceeded the target by 0.6 percentage points of GDP, as a result of
some additional spending for damages caused by Hurricane Isaac. Domestically-financed capital
spending was slightly above the target of 6.4 percent of GDP.
5.
Monetary policy continued to aim at low and stable inflation. Broad money growth
has moderated to 6.9 percent, against a program target of 11.2 percent, due to a larger-thanprogrammed decline in bank net credit to government.
6.
While credit has grown at a fast pace, the banking sector remains sound. Credit
grew by 29.8 percent year-on-year through end-September, with demand boosted by short-term
trade credits and long-term borrowing for investment projects weaker than planned given delays
in adopting the budget and appointing a new Prime Minister during the first half of 2012. Work
is ongoing on establishing credit bureaus and insurance law has been submitted to the
Parliament. Key indicators suggest that the financial sector is relatively liquid and profitable.
7.
The overall balance of payments recorded a surplus in FY2012. Consequently, gross
international reserves rose to US$2.2 billion at end-December 2012 (6 months of imports of
goods and services). Both merchandise exports and imports were below targets. Textile exports
were negatively affected by the drop of the US demand and imports. At the same time, the
current and capital and financial accounts outcome were better than programmed. Since April
2010, the gourde has depreciated gradually against the U.S. dollar by about 8 percent.
8.
Our program remains broadly on track. We have met all end-June indicative targets
and observed all end-September 2012 performance criteria. In the structural area, we have
completed two out of the three end-September 2012 benchmarks. The implementation of the
third end-September 2012 benchmark related to the implementation of a single auction system
in the FX is underway. We have also made progress regarding the two outstanding end-March
2012 structural benchmarks on debt management. The benchmark on strengthening the debt
unit with fully operational middle and back offices is underway as it is linked to the passage of
the organic law on the reorganization of the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The second
benchmark is related to the public debt law. Both draft laws are being reviewed by the Prime
Minister’s Office and will be submitted to the Parliament by end-March 2013. At the same time,
we have continued our efforts in improving public financial management and making headway
on improving the business environment.
The government program for 2013
9.
We are facing significant challenges in the period ahead. Our overriding priority is to
create jobs, increase spending linked to poverty reduction and provide housing to the
350,000 people still living in temporary shelters although more than 1 million people have been
relocated, particularly in the context of the project 16/6. We must also pursue our efforts to

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

43

HAITI

rebuild the country, maintain macroeconomic stability, while creating the conditions for
sustainable (broad-based and inclusive) growth, and build resilience against shocks through
appropriate macroeconomic policies and environmental consolidation. Our macroeconomic
policies and structural and institutional reform agenda mirror these challenges, as we seek to
enhance the country’s resilience, particularly to natural disasters, protect long-term growth,
reduce unemployment, and raise living standards. A significant shock to global growth is a major
risk, which would have consequences for exports, foreign aid, and remittances, although the
latter has displayed some resilience in the past. Other risks are higher food and energy prices,
heightened political and social tensions that could delay public investment spending and the
reform agenda.
10.
Medium-term projections remain broadly unchanged compared with earlier
estimates. Maturing ongoing agricultural projects, a rebound in public construction investment,
and rising exports of textiles and other manufacturing goods assembled in emerging free zones
are expected to sustain growth in the medium term supported by improvements in infrastructure
and services as well as in the business environment. Domestic revenue collection should continue
to improve, while donor support is expected to trend down. Tight control on current spending
and appropriate and sustainable levels of capital outlays, and the promotion of innovative
public-private partnerships are expected to improve the fiscal position in the medium term. The
external account deficit would decline, associated with a gradual winding-down of
reconstruction-related imports and improved exports.
11.
Our long-term goal is to transform Haiti into an emerging country by 2030. For that
purpose, we are committed to undertake appropriate reforms and investments aimed at enabling
a business-friendly environment, developing small and medium enterprises and reinforcing the
rule of law. To ensure a steady progress toward this long-term goal, a “Presidential Consultative
Council for Economic Growth and Investment” has been set up.

A. Macroeconomic Policies
12.
The recovery is expected to continue in FY2013. Real GDP growth is projected to
reach 6.5 percent in FY2013, on the assumption of a rebound in public investment spending, the
continued implementation of several projects to promote exports and tourism,2 and a rebound in
agriculture. Inflation should remain stable, in the mid-single digits. Higher reconstruction-related
imports would widen the external account deficit, and reduce gross liquid reserves to
5.5 months of imports.

Renovation and upgrade of the airports in Haiti’s two largest cities are almost completed. The 128-room Royal
Oasis five star hotel is open and the 106-room Best Western hotels is scheduled to open in FY 2013.

44

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

HAITI

Fiscal policy
13.
Within the framework of an expanded fiscal space, fiscal policy will aim at
increasing poverty-related and growth-enhancing spending, while building cushions
against future shocks. In this context, we will step up efforts to further increase domestic
revenue, and improve the composition and the quality of public spending. We are targeting a
fiscal deficit of 5.3 percent of GDP, only about 2 billion gourdes higher than the one projected at
the time of the fourth ECF review, reflecting higher current spending outlays. The deficit is fully
financed with external resources (4.4 percent of GDP) and domestic financing, including issuance
of T-bills (0.9 percent of GDP). Given the high reconstruction-related needs, the government has
the option of drawing down its deposits and issuing additional T-Bills in the event of a shortfall
in domestic revenue, while ensuring medium-term debt sustainability and macroeconomic
stability. We will also consider reducing some non-priority current spending or delaying some
non-reconstruction-related domestically-financed capital spending.
14.
In 2013, we will continue improving our tax-to-GDP ratio. Our revenue target is
14.1 percent of GDP, 1.3 percentage points above the 2012 outcome. The improvement will
result from (i) the expected economic rebound; (ii) the full impact of the FY2012 measures
(higher excise tax on alcoholic beverages, fees on casinos and house games); and (iii) tighter
control on tax exemptions; and (iv) a set of new measures comprising tighter controls,
improvements in tax collection made possible by the implementation of the e-declaration, and
actions by the customs to strengthen valuation and inspect all imports into the country. In
addition, the newly created tax payer unit for medium and large enterprises and unit for NGOs
will be instrumental in expanding the taxpayer net, improving compliance, making headway in
rationalizing exemptions and ensuring the strict application of those in effect, and strengthening
our tax collection network. The appointment of a Secretary of State in charge of tax reform is
also a step forward in improving coordination and ensuring a good command of the tax reform
plan.
15.
We will improve the composition of current public spending. As part of a cautious
effort to keep current spending under control, we will offset the increase in the wage bill by
limiting spending on goods and services to 3 percent of GDP, and further reducing subsidies to
the electricity company to 0.7 percent of GDP, down from 1.5 percent of GDP in FY2012, in order
to free resources that will be allocated to fund growth-enhancing projects and poverty-related
spending. Lower electricity sector subsidies are anticipated to result from the pursuit of the
restructuring plan seeking, with support from the World Bank, IDB and USAID, to improve the
financial management of EDH, and reduce technical losses. We have made some progress on the
social front through direct budgetary transfers, and we are planning to improve current transfer
schemes and safety nets, notably to alleviate the effects of natural disasters on the poor
segments of the population. Current spending is projected at 11.3 percent of GDP, against an
outcome of 11.9 percent of GDP the year before.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

45

HAITI

16.
We are upgrading the public investment framework to improve capacity and
enhance project management, and maximize the impact on growth. In this context,
domestically-financed capital spending is projected to increase to 9 percent of GDP, a
2.2 percent of GDP rise in FY2013. More funds will be allocated to social and growth-inducing
projects. To boost capital spending efficiency, we will undertake a reform of the investment
framework in two phases. The first phase will aim at (i) defining the mandate of the UEPs
(Analytical and Programming Units) to include all phases of project management and strengthen
them with adequate resources; (ii) enhancing the SYSGEP; (iii) increasing procurement capacity;
(iv) clarifying the roles of the government agencies involved in project management; and (v)
reforming capital expenditure procedures, in line with the introduction of the Treasury Single
Account. The second phase will start in 2014 with the assignment of international experts to
UEPs, and the introduction of new disbursement, execution and control procedures. This new
framework will be supported by the new mechanism for coordination and harmonization of aid
which provides for an alignment of international funds to national development goals and
government investment programs, and relies on the national budget as the main vehicle for
channeling all aid. As a result, the new investment framework will seek to unify the public
investment projects into one coherent program.
Monetary and exchange rate policies
17.
Our monetary policy will continue to aim at price stability. Consumer price inflation is
expected to be in the 5-6 percent range in FY2013 as the shock from international food prices
recedes and domestic food production recovers. Nevertheless, we will remain vigilant against
second round effects and take appropriate steps should they materialize. We are also taking
steps towards improving liquidity management, strengthening market-based operations and
developing macroprudential regulatory mechanisms.
18.
We will enhance our monetary framework through additional actions aimed at
reducing excess liquidity and lessening dollarization. Measures in this context include
developing a domestic T-bill market (the legal and operational market infrastructure is in place
and two initial T-bill issuances were successful), securitizing the large government debt to the
BRH to boost the T-Bill market, and improving liquidity management. We are also using reserve
requirements to control liquidity in the system. On the reduction of dollarization, our agenda
aims at establishing a longer positive track record of political and maintaining macroeconomic
and financial stability, higher flexibility in the exchange rate, and deepening of domestic financial
markets to provide alternative investment opportunities to foreign currency deposits.
19.
We will allow greater exchange rate flexibility going forward. Our interventions in
the market will continue to aim at smoothing out excess volatility, while not resisting
fundamental trends. While on a declining trend over the past two years, our interventions in the
FX market are conducted on an ad hoc basis through bilateral active or passive (via a window)
transactions, Our main objective is to improve the functioning of the FX market. We are planning
to introduce a system of single price foreign exchange auctions; as a first step, we will allow more
participants and promote the development of the interbank foreign exchange market.

20.
Further improvements in financial intermediation are needed to support the
growth agenda. At about 19.1 percent of GDP, commercial banks’ credit to the private sector in
2012 was well below the average for LICs. This reflects a broad range of factors, including the
fragile security situation, and limited competition between banks. While the banking sector
remains relatively sound and profitable, the recent uptrend in credit to the private sector signals
the importance for updating financial legislation to improve regulation and supervision. We will
establish a committee aimed at closely monitoring systemic risks and financial stability issues
through macroprudential surveillance. A new insurance law is expected to contribute to improve
business and protect consumers; and creation of credit bureaus will enable increasing lending to
SMEs, a goal which is high on our agenda to sustain growth and diversify the economy.

B. Structural Reforms
Revenue administration and tax policy
21.
For the medium-term, and with support from the newly-created Unit for the
Analysis of Fiscal Policy, we will outline a broader reform of the tax system, including a
shift to a VAT system and actions for streamlining tax expenditure. As a result, we are
planning to raise the revenue-to-GDP ratio to 15 percent by 2017. Other actions will include
improving the coverage for taxpayers; strengthening the efficiency and controls of revenue
collection; putting together a more equitable and business-friendly tax system; and moving
towards the CARICOM external tariff system.
Public financial management
22.
We remain committed to continue improving the management of public finances.
The rehabilitation of the budget remains a critical reform and we are taking steps toward
strengthening budget formulation, execution, transparency and reporting, and improving
internal and external controls. An update of the legal and regulatory framework has been
prepared and is expected to be approved by the Government during the coming weeks and then
transmitted to Parliament. This legal package includes a new organic law for the MEF that will
enable the revamping of the Directorate General of Budget, the creation of a new Directorate
General of Treasury and Public Accounting, which will include the Debt Unit, provisions to
improve tax and customs administration, and the establishment of a central structure tasked with
economic analysis, and oversight of economic developments. In doing so, we are guided by the
principle that all public resources and spending are channeled through the budget with a view to
preempt extra-budgetary outlays, including for pension and education purposes. Accordingly, we
will ensure that the creation of the upcoming joint-venture between the Haitian and Venezuelan
governments on public investment does not translate into fiscal risks. A MoU has been signed
between the MEF and BRH to lock in the total amount of debt due by the Public Treasury to BRH
and the modalities of payment, plus a set of provisions to ensure better cash management in
order to fully implement the TSA. Regarding the introduction of a treasury single account, we
have completed the first phase that called for closing all identified dormant government
accounts in the banking system, training of public accountants, and drafting a manual of

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

47

HAITI

procedures. As a next step, we intend to introduce by January 2013 a first pilot of the TSA at the
MEF before extending it to a first wave of ministries in June 2013 with adequate capacity for a
rapid move. We will then gradually introduce multi-year budgeting and medium term
expenditure frameworks as part of an ambitious budgetary reform, while we are taking steps to
create Planning (UEP) and Studies units in every ministry. This measure is intended to improve
public investment spending efficiency.
Other reforms
23.
We remain committed to our reform agenda aimed at improving the business
environment. Reforms in this area are crucial to raise productivity and competitiveness and lift
constraints on growth. At the core of our agenda is the establishment of public-private
partnerships in key areas, like infrastructure, utilities, export industries, and tourism. A special
management unit for public-private partnership has been established within the MEF to ensure a
steady implementation of those partnerships. In addition to putting in place the institutional
framework to attract such investments, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry is also preparing
a range of measures to reduce the cost and alleviate the burden of doing business. One of the
key objectives is the creation of a “Guichet Unique Electronique” aimed at reducing the process
of registration for new firms to a 10-day period through a simplification of procedures.
24.
Another key area of action is the energy sector. We will vigorously implement the
current plan seeking to stabilize and gradually upgrade the electricity company’s technical,
commercial and financial functions. We have already strengthened the management team and
enhanced the legal and institutional framework. The next step is to adopt a comprehensive plan
to enhance production and distribution of electricity to cover the needs of the country. In the
interim, we will closely monitor the activities of the independent power producers to rationalize
the budgetary transfers and increase access as well as the quality of electricity services through
EDH and other supply chains. New investments are planned, including for the rehabilitation of
Peligre dam and plant and the construction of a new water electricity plant in the southern
region.
25.
Strengthening the country’s resilience to natural shocks is critical to protect growth
and overcome poverty. We will work closely with the World Bank and other international
partners to further strengthen our national risk and disaster management system (NRDMS).
Financial sector development
26.
We will continue to improve financial intermediation in support of the growth
agenda. With the credit-to-GDP ratio remaining low by regional standards, we anticipate credit
to the private sector to grow faster than the economy in the coming years. While the banking
sector is relatively sound and quite profitable, we will further strengthen its resilience through an
update of the financial legislation on regulation and supervision. We are also exploring ways to
increase lending to SMEs and to regulate the fast growing microfinance industry. Furthermore,
the expected passage by Parliament of an insurance law and the setting up of a regulatory

48

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

HAITI

authority will provide the impetus for economic growth, trade and consumption. In relation to
the latter, we are taking steps to create a private credit bureau. A continued strengthening of the
operations of the Partial Credit Guarantee Fund will at the same time contribute to expand
financial intermediation. In this connection, we welcome the selection of the country as a pilot
case for enhanced surveillance of financial systems of LICs, as called for by the Executive Board of
the IMF. This will help us outline a reform agenda to further develop Haiti’s financial sector.
External debt management
27.
We will continue our debt management reform agenda in 2013. Action will be taken
on both the legal and institutional sides. The expected adoption in 2013 by Parliament of the law
related to the administrative reorganization of the Ministry of Economy and Finance will open the
way for the creation of a Directorate General of Treasury that will have authority over the new
debt unit that will take over the authority of the current Directorate of Debt with fully operational
middle and back office functions. On the legal side, we have completed the work on the draft
public debt law which we intend to submit to Parliament when it reconvenes in January 2013. We
will also complete work on a medium-term debt strategy. In the interim, we will continue
exercising caution in the use of PetroCaribe resources to limit them to growth-enhancing
investment projects and resort only to concessional financing to maintain debt sustainability.
Safeguard assessments and AML/CFT
28.
We will continue to implement the recommendations of the January 2010
Safeguards assessment follow-up mission. Work is under way to (i) adopt the IFRS, including
the establishment of a special committee to monitor its implementation and (ii) reconstitute the
Investment Committee as an independent oversight body and appointing a compliance officer to
monitor observation of investment guidelines.
29.
We are committed to ensure compliance of our AML/CFT legal framework with FATF
standards. We have submitted a revised draft law to Parliament for adoption. This law enhances
compliance with the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF) standards. We have also
made headway in the implementation of critical aspects of the AML/CFT framework, particularly
in the context of combating corruption, countering tax evasion, preventing financial sector abuse,
and improving identification of citizens. These measures include the publication by the Central
Bank of two decisions and guidelines that will establish mechanisms and procedures that are in
line with the new law on banks and other financial institutions (passed by Parliament on May
14th, 2012), and help financial institutions (i) properly identify their customers and fund
beneficiaries and (ii) prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism.
Social policies
30.
The government is continuing to make progress in strengthening its social policies
and protection mechanisms of the vulnerable segments of the population. In the aftermath
of recent ad hoc initiatives launched recently in the education and health sectors and in addition

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

49

HAITI

to the cash program to help women with children, we are now working on a comprehensive and
a coherent institutional framework to protect the most vulnerable segments of the population
and combat extreme poverty. This work will benefit from the ongoing social and demographic
surveys, including two household surveys, a survey on living standards, a joint demographic and
health survey, and a multi-indicator cluster survey. The completion of these surveys is expected
for the first quarter of 2013, and this will pave the way for producing a comprehensive strategy
by mid-2013. A census, supported by donors, is expected to be launched by IHSI.
Program monitoring
31.
Our program will be monitored using the definitions, data sources, and frequency
of monitoring set out in the accompanying revised TMU. The government will make available
to Fund staff all data appropriately reconciled and on a timely basis, as specified in the TMU.
Table 1 shows the quantitative performance criteria for monitoring program execution in
2011/12 and 2012/2013. Structural benchmarks, with corresponding dates and status of
implementation are identified in Tables 2a and 2b. Structural conditionality for the remainder of
the program, including new dates for the implementation of the four benchmarks outstanding
are in Table 2c. It is proposed to reschedule to end-March 2013 (from End-March 2012) the two
benchmarks on (i) strengthening the debt unit with fully operational middle and back offices
functions; and (ii) submission to Parliament of a public debt law. The sixth review under the ECF
arrangement, assessing end-March 2013 performance criteria, is expected to be completed by
mid-July 2013.

ATTACHMENT 2. TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING–UPDATE
1.
Haiti’s performance under the program supported by the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) will
be assessed on the basis of the observance of quantitative performance criteria as well as
compliance with structural benchmarks. This Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU)
defines the quantitative performance criteria, specification of certain structural benchmarks, and
indicative targets for the period September, 2010-September, 2013, specified in Tables 1 and 2 of
the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP). It also lays down the monitoring and
reporting requirements.
Institutional Definitions
2.
Central government. The central government comprises the presidency, prime minister’s
office, parliament, national courts, treasury, line ministries and “organismes déconcentrés.” It
includes expenditures financed directly by foreign donors through ministerial accounts (comptes
courants).
3.
Non-financial public sector. The non-financial public sector includes the central government
plus non-budgetary autonomous organizations, local governments and public sector enterprises
(enterprises and agencies in which the government holds a controlling stake of more than
50 percent of the shares).
4.
Total public sector. The total public sector comprises the non-financial public sector and the
central bank, the Bank of the Republic of Haiti (BRH).
Quantitative targets
Net BRH Credit to the Non-Financial Public Sector
5.
Net BRH credit to the non-financial public sector equals net central bank credit to the central
government plus net central bank credit to the rest of the non-financial public sector.
6.
The change in net BRH credit to the central government is defined as, and will be measured
using:

Change in net domestic credit to the central government from the BRH according to
Table 10R of the BRH.

Change in the stock of project accounts (“Comptes de projets”) included in Table 10R of the
BRH will be excluded from the change in net domestic credit to the central government as defined
above.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

55

HAITI


Change in the stock of Special Accounts (“Comptes spéciaux”) and seized values (“Valeurs
saisies UCREF”) included in Table 10R of the BRH will be excluded from the change in net domestic
credit to the central government as defined above. 1
7.
The change in net central bank credit to the rest of the non-financial public sector, is defined
as, and will be measured using:
a. Change in “créances nettes sur le secteur public” (i.e, net credit to the non-financial public
sector) minus the change in “créances nettes sur l'état” (i.e. net credit to the central government),
according to table 10R of the BRH.
8.

The changes will be measured on a cumulative basis from the stock at end September 2009.

A.

Net Domestic Financing to the Central Government

9.
Net domestic financing to the central government will comprise the change in net banking
sector credit to the central government (defined below) plus the change in nonbank financing which
includes amortization, counterpart funds,2 and the net issuance of Treasury bills and other
government securities by the central government to non-banks. Net domestic banking sector credit
to the central government is defined as, and will be measured, using:
a. The change in the stock of net domestic credit to the central government from the BRH
according to Table 10R of the BRH, plus, the change in the stock of net domestic credit of the
central government from domestic banks according to Table 20R of the BRH, which will include the
net issuance of treasury bills and other government securities by the central government for
government financing purposes. Securities issued for the recapitalization of the BRH are excluded
from this definition.
b. The change in the stock of project accounts (“Comptes de projets”), as defined in 6.b above, will
be excluded from the change in net domestic banking sector credit to the Central Government.
c.

The change in the total stock of Special Accounts (“Comptes Spéciaux”) and seized values

(“Valeurs Saisies UCREF”), as defined in 6.c above, will be excluded from the change in net domestic
banking sector credit to the Central Government.
1

Special Accounts (“Comptes Spéciaux”) refer to U.S. dollar-denominated central government sight deposits at the
BRH. The balance of these accounts increases with the proceeds of the sales of in-kind aid (in the form of wheat,
maize, rice, etc.) received by the Haitian government; these proceeds are earmarked to finance specific projects and
cannot be used by the Central Government without the explicit authorization of respective donors.

2

Counterpart funds are proceeds from sales of grants received in kind.

56

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

HAITI

10.

The changes will be measured on a cumulative basis from the stock at end-September 2009.

B.

Net International Reserves

11.

The change in net international reserves will be measured using:

a. Change in net foreign assets (“Réserves de change nettes” of the BRH Table 10R);3
b. Minus the change in foreign currency deposits of commercial banks at the BRH (“Dépôts à vue
en dollars U.S. et en Euros des BCM à la BRH”, and the “CAM transfer” of the BRH Table 10R).
c.

Minus the change in the stock of project accounts (“Comptes de projets”) as defined in 6.b

above.
d. Minus the change in the stock of Special Accounts (“Comptes Spéciaux”) in dollars and Euros
(and excluding gourdes), and seized values (“Valeurs Saisies UCREF”), the latter as defined in 6.c
above.
e. Plus the change in the stock of the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) allocation (“Allocations DTS”)
from the BRH Table 10R.
12.
Data will be expressed in U.S. dollar terms and valued at the corresponding end-period
market exchange rate from the BRH Table 10R.
13.
For definition purposes, net international reserves (NIR) are the difference between the
BRH’s gross foreign assets (comprising monetary gold, all claims on nonresidents, SDR holdings, and
BRH claims in foreign currency on domestic financial institutions) and reserve liabilities (including
liabilities to nonresidents of one-year maturity or less, use of Fund credit, and excluding the full SDR
allocation, and trust funds). Swaps in foreign currency with domestic financial institutions and
pledged or otherwise encumbered reserve assets are excluded from NIR.
14.

The changes will be measured on a cumulative basis from the stock at end-September 2009.

C.

Net Domestic Assets of the BRH

15.

The change in net domestic assets of the BRH is defined as, and will be measured using:

3

Letters of credit and guarantee (“Lettres de crédit” and “Lettres de garantie”) are reported in Table 10R as part of

BRH foreign liabilities (“Engagements extérieurs”), and therefore are already netted out of NIR.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

57

HAITI

a. The change in base money (program definition according to Section I. below);
b. Minus the change in the U.S. dollar amount of net international reserves (program definition
according to section C above), converted into gourdes at the program exchange rate.
16.
The program definition of net domestic assets of the BRH will use a program exchange rate
of G 40.0 per U.S. dollar for the period June 2010- March 2013.
17.

The changes will be measured on a cumulative basis from the stock at end-September 2009.

D.

PetroCaribe-Related Funds

18.
As of October 2012, the outstanding balance of Petro Caribe funds totaled
334 million dollars held at the BNC state bank.
19.
The authorities are planning to channel new PetroCaribe/ALBA-related inflows through a
binational Venezuela-Haiti corporation, the creation of which is well advanced.4 Until the statutes of
the new societé mixte are published in the “Journal Officiel” (Le Moniteur), PetroCaribe-related
inflows will continue to constitute direct external debt of the central government. These resources
are under the direct control of the central government, and, for program purposes, will be fully
reflected in the fiscal tables underpinning the program. They will be treated as budget support
loans, whose proceeds are partly or entirely deposited in government accounts in the banking
system (PetroCaribe deposits). Spending from PetroCaribe resources (up to US$400 million in FY
2012), financed with a drawdown of PetroCaribe deposits in the banking system, will also be fully
reflected in program tables.
20.
Following ratification of the societé mixte, the annual budgets of the company will be
published on the MEF website before the beginning of the fiscal year. Audited annual financial
statements will be published within six months of the end of each financial year.

E.

Non Concessional Public Sector External and Foreign-Currency Denominated Debt

21.
The definition of debt comprises all forms of debt, including loans, suppliers’ credits, and
leases, that constitute current, i.e. not contingent liabilities, which are created under a contractual
arrangement through the provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or services,
and which require the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets (including
currency) or services, at some point in the future, as set forth in point 9 of IMF Executive Board
Decision No. 6230-(79/140), as amended by Executive Board Decision No. 14416-(09/91) of August
31, 2009.

4

ALBA refers to “Alternativa Boliviarana de las Americas”.

58

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

HAITI

22.
A ceiling applies to the contracting and guaranteeing by the public sector of new non
concessional debt in foreign currency with original maturities of one year of more. The ceiling
applies to debt and commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not yet been
received. This covers private debt for which official guarantees have been extended and which,
therefore, constitute a contingent liability of the public sector.
23.
For program purposes, the guarantee of a debt arises from any explicit legal obligation of
the public sector to service a debt in the event of nonpayment by the debtor (involving payments in
cash or in kind).
24.
For program purposes, a debt is concessional if it includes a grant element of at least 35
percent, calculated as follows: the grant element of a debt is the difference between the present
value (PV) of debt and its nominal value, expressed as a percentage of the nominal value of the
debt.5 The PV of debt at the time of its contracting is calculated by discounting the future stream of
payments of debt service due on this debt, based on the currency specific commercial interest
reference rates (CIRRs) as laid out by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD).6 For a debt with a maturity of at least 15 years, the ten-year-average CIRR will be used to
calculate the PV of debt and hence, its grant element. For debt with maturity of less than 15 years,
the six-month average CIRR will be used. To both the ten-year and six-month averages, the same
margin for differing repayment periods as those used by the OECD need to be added (0.75 percent
for repayment periods of less than
15 years, 1 percent for 15 to 19 years, 1.15 percent for 20 to 29 years, and 1.25 percent for
30 years or more).
25.
Excluded from the ceiling are short-term import-related credits, rescheduling arrangements,
borrowing from the Fund, non-resident purchases of treasury bills, and guarantees for the electricity
sector in the form of letters of credit.
26.
The ceilings for contracting and guaranteeing of non concessional debt by the total public
sector (as defined in paragraph 4) will be set at US$ thirty-three million continuously throughout the
program period.

F.

Arrears of the Central Government

27.
External payment arrears are defined as overdue payments (principal and interest) to nonresidents on debt contracted and guaranteed by the central government, and will be defined
according to the terms of indebtedness of each creditor. The criterion of zero accumulation of
external arrears will be monitored on a continuous basis.

5

The grant element calculator can be found at http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/conc/calculator/default.aspx.

6

The grant element calculations will take into account all aspects of the loan agreement, including maturity, grace
period, payment schedule, upfront commissions, and management fees.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

59

HAITI

28.
Domestic arrears of the central government are defined to include: (i) any bill that has been
received by a spending ministry from a supplier for goods and services delivered (and verified) and
for which payment has not been made within 90 days after the due date of payment; (ii) wage,
salary, and other payment to government employees, including direct and indirect allowances, that
were due to be paid in a given month but remained unpaid on the 30th of the following month; and
(iii) interest or principal obligations which remain unpaid 30 days after the due date of payment. This
definition excludes changes in the stock of arrears on account of interest, penalties and valuation
changes.

G.

Base Money

29.

The change in base money is defined as, and will be measured using:

a. The change in the stock of currency in circulation from Table 10R of the BRH.
b. The change in the stock of reserve deposits of commercial banks at the BRH, from Table 10R,
using gourde sight deposits of commercial banks (dépôts a vue en gourdes des BCM a la BRH) and
cash-in-vault of commercial banks (encaisses des BCM).
30.

The changes will be measured on a cumulative basis from the stock at end-September 2009.

H.

Poverty-Reducing Expenditures

31.
The growth in poverty reducing expenditure will be measured as the sum of domesticallyfinanced spending for the Ministries in charge of agriculture, health, and education. This will be a
flow measured on a cumulative basis from end-September 2009.
Quarterly Adjustments
32.

The quarterly performance criteria and indicative targets will be adjusted as indicated below:

I.

Adjustment for Domestic Arrears Accumulation

33.
The ceilings for net BRH credit to the central government and the net domestic banking
sector credit to the central government will be adjusted downwards for the amount of outstanding
domestic arrears accumulation.

J.

Adjustment for PetroCaribe-related Inflows

34.
Until the bi-national company expected to administer PetroCaribe-related funds is legally
established, any drawdown of PetroCaribe-related deposits will be considered as central
government spending for program purposes.
35.
The ceiling for net domestic credit to the central government will include movements in
PetroCaribe accounts in the banking system and will be adjusted for the difference between the

60

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

HAITI

actual stock of PetroCaribe deposits in the banking system and programmed stock of these deposits
in the banking system. The ceilings for net BRH credit to the central government, on BRH net
domestic assets, and the floor for NIR will also include movements in PetroCaribe accounts at the
BRH. They will be adjusted for the difference between the actual stock of PetroCaribe deposits at the
BRH and the programmed stock of these deposits at the BRH. The adjustor will be calculated on a
cumulative basis from October 1, 2009.

K.

Adjustment for Budgetary Cash Grants in Second Half of FY2012

36.
The performance criteria ceilings on BRH net credit to the central government, net domestic
financing to the government, and on BRH net domestic assets, and the floor on NIR reflect expected
budgetary donor grants of the equivalent of G4.7 billion (about
$114 million) during FY2012 (USA, $13 million, France $22 million, Spain $22 million, World Bank $27
million, and IDB $25 million). For FY2013, expected budgetary donor grants total
$80 million, including IDB $30 million, IDA$20 million, France $13 million, and Spain $7 million. If
actual grant inflows are lower (higher) than programmed, these performance criteria ceilings will be
adjusted upward (downward), and the performance criterion floor will be adjusted downward
(upward), by the amount of the difference between actual and programmed inflows.
37.

The adjuster will be calculated on a cumulative basis from October 1, 2009.

Clarification of Structural Conditionality

L.

Fiscal Sector

38.
As specified in Tables 2a and 2b, the publications of the following items related to
benchmarks will continue over the program period: 1a, 2a, 2b, 2c, 3a, 3b, and 2h. Publication should
occur on the specified regular basis (i.e. monthly or quarterly), with no gaps or unjustified delays.
39.
The structural benchmark on raising government revenue will involve designing and
implementing monitorable performance indicators for DGI and AGD (by end-December 2011). These
should include detailed information by industry (AGD) and taxpayer segment (DGI) and a set of
ratios to verify “tax effort” and efficiency, in line with TA recommendations. The reports should be
published monthly on the MEF website.
40.
The structural benchmark related to the establishment of a fiscal policy unit within the MEF
(end-September 2012) will require the creation of a separate service within the MEF tasked
exclusively with analyzing fiscal measures and simulating their impact on budget balances and the
economy as a whole. The perimeter of this unit should be clearly delimited within the MEF, by
appropriate written communication of the Minister or the Director General (to be shared with the
IMF) nominating the officer in charge of the unit, its staffing and its duties.
41.
The structural benchmark related to putting in place within the Directorate General of Taxes
a unit in charge of medium enterprises (end-September 2012) will require an official act (to be
shared with the IMF) setting up a separate unit within the DGI tasked with dealing with medium
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

61

HAITI

taxpayers, which will follow and streamline the administrative issues related to this segment of
taxpayers. Adequate staffing and office space should be provided to this unit and the act
establishing the unit should include the nomination of the person in charge of it and its immediate
aides.
42.
The structural benchmark related to the closing of dormant accounts and the establishing of
a list of all account of used by public entities (end-June 2012) entails compiling a census of accounts
both at the Central Bank and in commercial banks, and the creation of a permanent set of rules
governing the closing of dormant accounts (both list and set of rules to be shared with the IMF).
These would include time lags since last activity, threshold on balances and rules on how the sums
should be transferred to the Treasury.
43.
The structural benchmark on strengthening the debt unit (end-March 2013) will require
permanently providing adequate office space and staffing to such unit; nominating the officer in
charge of it and setting up its tasks with an official communication from the Minister or the Director
General (to be shared with the IMF); the MEF should, by coordination of its services, produce annual
debt sustainability analyses and make them available to the Fund, all MEF services, the BRH and the
MPCE.
44.
The structural benchmark on submitting a public debt law (end-March 2013) will require
transmission to Parliament (and sharing with the IMF) of a draft debt law in line with international
standards and with the recommendations of development partners’ TA.
45.
The new structural benchmark on reducing the number of domestically-funded imprest
accounts to three by ministry or institutions (one for revenue collection, one for capital spending,
one for other transactions, including current spending) and granting signature power on these
accounts to public accountants appointed by the MEF (end-March 2013) will imply the identification
of all the accounts as well as the names of the officials currently authorized to sign. On this basis, the
authorities will reduce the number of accounts as specified in the benchmark and provide signature
power to public accountants designated by the ministry of finance.
46.
The new structural benchmark on rolling-out, for all ministries, the GL-software in the offices
of the government accountants, and starting to record projects and imprest accounts expenditure
when they are effectively paid and not any more when the replenishment of the account is made
(end-March 2013) requires providing to all ministries a copy of the software and ensuring it is
adequately installed. It also requires a follow up on the recording of expenditure at payment level.

M.

Monetary Policy and Financial Sector

47.
The benchmark on strengthening exchange rate management will involve the development
of an exchange rate management strategy also encompassing reform of the foreign exchange
market by end September 2012.

Exchange Arrangement
Haiti’s de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. It was previously classified as “managed float”
in the old classification system through end-April 2008, at which the new classification system
became effective placing Haiti in the “floating” category. Prior to the earthquake, the gourde was on
a depreciating trend against the US dollar and remained within a narrow band since April 1, 2008.
Consequently, from April 1, 2008 to January 10, 2010, the de facto IMF classification has been
retrospectively reclassified to a crawl-like arrangement, effective April 1, 2008. During the period
after the earthquake, it was changed to “other managed” for a few months but then reclassified back
to “crawl-like” again.
The change from a fixed to managed floating regime took place in January 1990. Haiti's exchange
system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions. Since September 1991, all transactions have taken place at the free (interbank) market
rate.

Safeguards Assessment
An update safeguards assessment was concluded in January 2011. The assessment noted that
despite the serious setback resulting from the earthquake, elements of the safeguards framework
within the central bank remain in place. However, the safeguards assessment also concluded that
new vulnerabilities emerged, particularly, in the areas of governance, external audit and reserves
management. In order to address these vulnerabilities, the safeguards assessment recommended
rotation of the external auditors, as well the adoption of a formal selection policy in the area of
external audit. The assessment recommended the adoption of a global reserves management policy
and guidelines, to cover both reserves managed internally as well as reserves managed externally.
Other recommendations aim to strengthen the oversight bodies including through the
reconstitution of the Investment Committee, and the appointment of an independent Compliance
Officer.

Article IV Consultation
The last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on July 21, 2010. Haiti is on a
24-month cycle. The political crisis triggered by the resignation of the prime minister in late
February 2012 delayed the 2012 Article IV consultation.

RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of October 2012)
As Haiti’s largest multilateral donor, with an uninterrupted presence for 50 years, the IDB has a
strong commitment to the people and Government of Haiti. Consequently, the IDB has mobilized
unprecedented financial and human resources to respond to the multiple needs of the country after
the earthquake of January 12th, 2010. In the aftermath of the shock, the Bank engaged extensively
with the Government and other donors in humanitarian relief efforts, reconstruction and
rehabilitation activities, as well as the delivery of basic social services.
The Bank also assumed additional responsibilities beyond the financing of key recovery and
development investments, including support for sector-wide plans and active roles in the design and
implementation of the earthquake recovery institutional mechanisms such as the Haiti
Reconstruction Fund (HRF), for which it acts as one of three Partner Entities.
The Bank is uniquely positioned to support the Government’s Action Plan for National Recovery and
Reconstruction. In order to identify priority sectors and focus its resources, the Bank and the GOH
carried out a comprehensive sector analysis of its project pipeline, past experience and areas of
comparative advantage, relationships with key GOH and other international and Haitian
stakeholders, as well as the Bank’s comparative strength and reputation with respect to other
donors.
Key Developments since the Earthquake
In the months following the earthquake, the IDB Board of Governors also agreed to cancel Haiti’s
outstanding debt with the Bank, which at US$479 million constituted about 40% of the
Government’s external liabilities. The IDB Governors also agreed to convert the undisbursed portion
of loans, totaling some US$186 million into grants, thereby freeing up public resources for critical
investments. These decisions were preceded by the 2009 E-HIPC/MDRI initiative when the IDB
granted some US$511 million in debt relief, clearing the way for the Government to undertake vital
public investments.
The Bank also pledged to provide Haiti more than US$2.3 billion in new grants for the 2010-2020
period to fund its recovery efforts and long-term development plans. This decision sealed the Bank’s
long term commitment with Haiti’s reconstruction plan. These resources will finance investments
vital for Haiti’s post-earthquake recovery, to tackle extreme poverty and inequality, and to establish
the platform for long term economic growth as well as institutional and social development.
On the basis of an analysis of the most critical areas of support for recovery and development, as
well as consultations with the GOH, the Bank focuses its projects on six sector programmatic areas:
8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

HAITI

education, transport, water and sanitation, energy, agriculture, and private sector development.
These are areas where the Bank has a track record in project design and implementation,
established teams in the field and headquarters and where it can contribute greatest value-added
and have solid relationships with relevant executing agencies.
Since the earthquake, the Bank has approved 22 operations totaling US$650 million as follows:
US$30 million for temporary housing, US$15 million for emergency report to the cholera outbreak,
$112 million in budget support, US$42 million for investments in the agriculture sector, US$15
million for water and sanitation for Port-au-Prince, US$31 million for private sector development,
US$34 million for investment in the energy sector, US$105 million for the infrastructure of the
Caracol Industrial Park, US$162 million for transport infrastructure, US$100 million for education,
and US$3 million for an e-government platform.
The close collaboration of the Bank’s enhanced field presence with Haitian executing agencies has
improved absorptive capacity. In 2009 disbursements reached US$127 million. In 2010, despite the
impact of the earthquake, disbursements reached a Bank record for Haiti of US$177 million, a level
maintained in 2011 with US$175 million.
Portfolio Indicators
As of October 2012 the IDB’s active portfolio consisted of 34 investment projects for a total of
US$1.05 billion, of which 55% has already disbursed.
The IDB has a comprehensive program in key strategic sectors, such as transport (US$352 million or
34% of the portfolio), agriculture (US$181 million or 17%) water and sanitation (US$103 million or
10% of the portfolio), education (US$100 million or 10%), and private sector development (US$136
million or 13%).
The Technical Cooperation (TC) portfolio has been an important complement to the Bank’s
operational program. As of October 2012, the TC program consists of 52 operations totaling US$29
million.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of December 2012)
The World Bank and the IFC have jointly prepared a FY2013-2014 Interim Strategy Note (ISN)
aligned with Government priorities, as expressed in the 2010 Action Plan for National Recovery and
Development of Haiti and the Government Program approved by Parliament in May 2012. The ISN
was discussed by the Bank’s Board on September 27, 2012. The strategy has four main pillars: (i)
reducing vulnerability and increasing resilience; (ii) sustainable reconstruction; (iii) building human
capital; and (iv) promoting inclusive growth. The strategy also aims to strengthen governance and
government capacity. The resources and activities to be implemented in the context of the Interim
Strategy support Haiti’s transition from the immediate recovery following the 2010 earthquake to
longer-term reconstruction and development.
Since 2010 the WBG has committed $378m million for Haiti under various projects and programs
financed by the International Development Association (IDA) and more than $148 million from trust
funds (including $90 million from the Haiti Reconstruction Fund, $22 million from the Education for
All Fast-Track Initiative Catalytic Fund, and $10 million from the Global Agriculture and Food
Security Program, to name the largest). In July 2011, IDA provided a special allocation of $500
million from its Crisis Response Window to Haiti for the FY2012-2014 period, $295 million of which
has been made available to the Government of Haiti to date. All IDA and trust fund assistance has
been provided to Haiti in grant form since 2005.
The World Bank portfolio consists of 15 active projects, with substantial investments in
infrastructure, disaster risk management (DRM), education, energy, housing, community-driven
development (CDD), and agriculture. In FY2013-2014 new IDA projects are envisioned to support
regional development, invest in health service delivery and systems, and provide budget support in
the framework of the IMF program. The World Bank collaborates with the IFC in Energy, Finance,
and to develop Integrated Economic Zones for the facilitation of private sector investment. Further
joint activities are planned in DRM, Mining, and Private Sector Development. The World Bank works
closely with major donors including Canada, the United States, France, Spain, Brazil, the EU and IDB
in many areas, including Public Sector Management, Education, Energy, Housing and Health.
Close collaboration with the IMF is critical to the World Bank Group’s objective to help strengthen
Haiti’s public financial management systems, enhance public spending oversight, and improve the
financial viability of the electricity sector, including the reduction of public transfers over time. These
objectives are supported by IDA financial resources. End September 2012, the World Bank’s Board of
Executive Directors approved: (i) a $90 million Rebuilding Energy Infrastructure and Access project;
and (ii) $35 million Additional Financing operation for the Infrastructure and Institutions Emergency
Recovery project, aimed at strengthening public sector management, while continuing to support
debris management, the rehabilitation of roads and the installation of aviation safety equipment. In
late FY13 the Board of Directors is expected to consider a $20 million Development Policy
Operation. This is expected to be co-financed by contributions from Spain and France to the Haiti
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

HAITI

Reconstruction Fund in the amount of US$20 million, and aims to strengthen economic governance,
the public procurement framework, and underpin reconstruction and growth.
In addition, since 2010, the Bank has provided technical assistance to improve accounting and
auditing practices, nutritional security, and social safety nets, including support for the first
comprehensive household income and expenditure survey since 2001. Over the FY2013-2014
period, the Bank will provide technical assistance on governance, poverty measurement, energy,

With a committed portfolio of $55million to date, IFC has supported and made possible some of the
flagship private sector investments of the last decade in Haiti, financing first-time access to mobile
telephony in the country (DIGICEL), investing in the local financial sector (SOGEBANK) and financing
E-Power, the first Independent Power Producer with an internationally tendered Purchase Power
Agreement in Haiti. IFC has also helped the Government structure the partial privatization of the
national telecom operator, which led to the largest private investment in the country, a US$100m
investment over 3 years by Vietnamese company VIETTEL.
Since the earthquake, IFC has supported key job-creation activities in the garment (CODEVI, 6,500
workers today), mining (EURASIAN), hospitality (OASIS Hotel), and financial sectors (Capital Bank
Trade Line). Recent catalytic investments include Private Equity (LEOPARD Capital) and Clean Water
distribution (DLO Haiti). IFC has also significantly stepped-up its advisory effort in critical areas such
as investment climate, access to finance, and access to skills.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of December 27, 2012
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has serious shortcomings that severely hamper surveillance. Most affected areas are: national
accounts, fiscal data, and external sector statistics.
National Accounts: Notwithstanding improvement in recent years, weaknesses remain in the quality of data. The
Haitian statistical system was severely affected by the January 2010 earthquake and is still suffering from the aftermath
of the earthquake with limited administrative capacity. As a result, limited progress has been made by the authorities
in implementing the recommendations of the 2009 IMF-CARTAC mission. In particular, the rebasing of the national
accounts—initially expected to be accomplished during 2011 as recommended by the 2009 mission–has been
postponed. Constant price GDP data are, therefore, still being published using a base year of 1986/87, which does not
reflect adequately the structural economic changes resulted from the various civil conflicts and natural disasters Haiti
has experienced over the recent decades and thus introduced major uncertainty in policy analysis. Equally problematic
are estimates of the informal sector (growing sector in Haiti). Also, the production of quarterly GDP data would be
highly desirable for program monitoring purposes.
Prices and Labor Statistics: CPI is compiled by the Haitian Institute of statistics on information which is based on the
2000 household survey structure, and using 2004 as the reference year. The index follows a Laspeyres methodology
and comprises 287 products. No labor statistics are disseminated.
Government Finance Statistics: Staff receives data from the Ministry of Finance in the format of a monthly “Table of
Government Financial Operations” (TOFE) for program monitoring and surveillance. The national presentation of the
data suffers from weaknesses, including limited coverage, high aggregation, misclassifications, and the non-reporting
of major categories such as net lending, financing and debt. There is a need to improve the timeliness of publication of
accounts of public enterprises, as well as of the accounts of the nonfinancial public sector. The reporting of budgetary
expenditures, especially on the ministerial discretionary accounts should be improved to increase transparency.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Continuous work on monetary statistics has helped to improve the sectorization
and classification of accounts in the analytical balance sheets of the Bank of the Republic of Haiti (BRH) and
commercial banks. However, there is a need to both expand institutional coverage of MFS to include credit and saving
unions into the depository corporations’ survey, and improve the timeliness of the reported data to the Fund.
External sector statistics: The compilation system suffers from deficiencies with the scope, source data, and
timeliness of essential data. In addition, large errors and omissions over the recent periods suggest insufficient
coverage of current and financial accounts transactions. Special attention should be given to customs data coverage as
well as the coverage and classification of the large post-earthquake private inflows, including NGOs and official
humanitarian aid. A staff of the Central Bank of Haiti attended the 2012 balance of payments statistics course in
Washington.

III. Reporting to STA

Haiti currently does not report monthly or annual fiscal data to STA for publication in the International Financial
Statistics (IFS) or in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) respectively. Haiti reports annual IIP and
quarterly balance of payments data to STA. Currently, 2010 IIP data and Q3 2011 balance of payments data are
disseminated in the IFS.

Haiti has been selected to be one of the pilot cases for enhanced surveillance of financial
systems, called for by the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Executive Board in May
2012. The Board stressed the need to widen the scope of financial sector surveillance in low-income
countries (LICs) in Article IV consultations to better account for the interplay between financial
deepening, macro-stability and the effectiveness of monetary policy, in line with the recommendation of
the 2011 Triennial Surveillance Review.

areas. The insurance industry is relatively small with penetration well below regional average. A deeper
financial sector will be critical for a broad-based and inclusive growth
1

This study has been undertaken as part of the 2012 Article IV consultation with Haiti. Following
up on the last Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) conducted in 2008, the current
review presents a description of Haiti’s financial system, assesses its soundness and vulnerabilities, and
identifies some impediments to financial deepening. The note covers banks, financial cooperatives,
microfinance institutions, insurance, housing and remittances. Other issues, such as consumer protection,
financial literacy, as well as leasing, factoring and agricultural finance are topics for further research. The
review lays the ground for an FSAP to be conducted, specifically with the need to look in depth into
implementation of the recent reforms in the financial sector.
The results of the study are limited by data availability, particularly on financial cooperatives and
microfinance institutions, insurance, and remittances, improving which is a prerequisite for the
formulation of appropriate policies to consolidate and deepen the financial sector.

OVERVIEW OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
1.
Haiti has a small financial sector with banks playing a dominant role. The sector consists of
commercial banks, credit unions, financial cooperatives (FCs), microfinance institutions (MFIs); and other
nonbank financial institutions (insurance companies, pension funds) (Table 3). Banks dominate the financial
sector in Haiti in terms of assets and volume of loans and deposits, but play a more limited role in financial
inclusion. According to the WB Global Financial Inclusion Database (FINDEX) survey, 2 22 percent of the
persons over 15 years of age interviewed in Haiti’s in 2011 had a deposit account with a formal financial
institution. This level is comparable to the survey results of level of LIC countries, but about half of the level
reached by the average Latin American country. About 8 percent of respondents to the FINDEX survey
reported having a loan with a financial institution.
2.
Haiti’s banking system is relatively concentrated and lacks competition. The banking system
includes nine banks, two public, five domestic private banks, and two foreign banks. Three banks control
more than 80 percent of total assets as well as of total deposits. Most banks lend to less than three
thousand clients, reflecting weaknesses in the legal framework, and a weak collateral system, with difficulty
in obtaining land titles (Table 5). This reflects also the structure of the economy characterized by a few large
well-known firms and a multitude of smaller firms, many of which operate in the informal sector, whose
financial information is harder to obtain and credit risk harder to assess.
3.
Foreign banks play a very limited role In Haiti. Their share of total lending was 7.3 percent in
September 2012, much lower than the 50 percent market share generally observed in emerging markets
and developing countries.3 In comparison, in the ECCU, foreign banks provide about 60 percent of all loans
to the private sector. Foreign banks in Haiti tend to be niche players, and have few spillovers to the
development and efficiency of the domestic banking system, suggesting some threshold effect.4
4.
Microfinance institutions (MFIs) and Financial Cooperatives (FCs) are growing fast and are
important players in providing financial services to the lower to mid-income segment of the
population, particularly in rural areas. These institutions are playing a key role in increasing financial
inclusiveness in the country; they already serve a similar number of depositors as the banks, and provide
loans to a much larger share of the population. Information about customers, as well as about the supply
and demand of financial services to the lower to mid income segments is fragmented and scarce.

Box 1. Haiti: Macroeconomic Challenges of a Shallow Financial System1
The transmission mechanism of monetary policy usually operates through four channels:



The interest rate channel: through the impact on liquidity conditions and real interest rates.



The assets channel: through the effect on stock market values and asset prices.



The exchange rate channel: works through the impact of monetary developments on the
exchange rate and aggregate demand and supply.



The credit or banking lending channel: through the response of credit aggregates and lending
rates to change in policy instruments

These four channels have been undermined in Haiti because of the country’s low level of financial
intermediation, the absence of both a stock market and a secondary market for government securities,
high dollarization and limited flexibility in the exchange rate, and structural excess liquidity in the
banking system.
The shallow domestic debt markets can constrain fiscal policy through several channels:



Increasing uncertainties and costs of funds. Countries with shallow government securities
markets are more vulnerable to changes in the availability of foreign financing and donor
flows, which in turn makes formulation of government budget and financing more uncertain,
particularly for long-run public investment projects. This is particularly costly for Haiti, given
the need for infrastructure investment in energy, water, transportation. Also, the absence of a
secondary market may increase government debt servicing costs and result in a higher
liquidity premium for government securities.



Limiting scope for counter-cyclical fiscal policy. Haiti, like other countries in the Caribbean, is
highly vulnerable to external shocks and frequent natural disasters. Hence, counter-cyclical
fiscal policy and the government’s ability to finance large deficits in response to external
shocks and/or natural disasters are very important. However, theoretical and empirical studies
suggest that countries with shallow financial systems such as Haiti tend to have pro-cyclical
fiscal policies. Calderon and Schmidt-Hebbel (2008), using a large sample of developed and
developing countries, found that poor institutions or lack of access to international and
domestic credit markets hinder the conduct of countercyclical fiscal policies.
The lack of financial depth constrains fiscal policy in a way that can overturn standard Keynesian
fiscal policy prescriptions. When a country faces quantitative financial constraints on its
borrowing, higher government spending may crowd out private investment.

5.
The insurance industry is relatively small and plays a very limited role. Until very recently, the
insurance sector was largely unregulated and unsupervised and, therefore, financial information is not
reported to the supervisor, making it difficult to assess its size and growth. The insurance sector currently
comprises nine non-life insurers and two life insurers. Property and casualty policies are the most prevalent
in the market, and life insurance products are very limited.
6.
Overall, the financial system plays an increasing but limited role in supporting much needed
economic growth. This reflects a broad range of development challenges, including significant
weaknesses in the legal and institutional frameworks, the fragile security situation, and limited competition
between banks, poor governance, and the absence of a functioning credit registry. The result has been a
relatively low level of credit compared to other low and middle income countries and limited access to
credit. The 2012-13 World Economic Forum report ranks Haiti’s financial market development 141 out of
144 countries.
7.
A deeper financial sector will be critical to sustain broad-based and inclusive growth and
build a better Haiti. Sustainable credit growth and subsequent financial sector deepening increase longterm economic growth.5 The transmission channels include improvement in the allocation of capital, better
risk sharing, pooling of savings and raising the efficiency of financial intermediation. By easing financial
constraints, increased bank lending can contribute to higher investment and consumption and ultimately a
higher standard of living (Box 1).

Obstacles inherent to the business climate, in
particular the lack of protection of creditors' rights, tend
to reinforce banks’ reluctance to take risks and increase
lending. Banks' involvement in financing the economy is
also constrained by delays in creating or operationalizing the
necessary information databases, such as a credit bureau, a
centralized registry of bad debts, and a central registry of
corporate balance sheets. Other factors that hamper
financial intermediation include the limited scope of
mechanisms for guaranteeing collateral and delays in
developing electronic financial services.

Sources: BRH Banking Supervision Reports; and IMF estimates

10.
Removal of the impediments to the banking sector development is urgent to meet Haiti’s
large infrastructure and other development needs. On the demand side, the scale of infrastructure
investment needed in Haiti is very significant. There is growing demand to replace or expand roads, ports,
airports, electrical grids, and telecommunication networks, as well as housing, schools, hospitals, water
supply, and sanitation. On the supply side, there is room for further increase in credit to the private sector.
Credit to the private sector represents less than 50 percent of deposits and available liquidity in the banking
system. With liquidity historically very high, especially excess reserves in the banking system, a key
constraint to access to finance appears to be poor banking intermediation.
11.
Nevertheless, a deeper banking system, while essential, could also pose a number of
challenges for the economy. Boosting credit growth may entail risks that can be grouped into two
categories: (i) the emergence or worsening of macroeconomic imbalances (macro risk); and (ii) risks to
financial sector stability owing to deteriorating bank asset quality (credit risk). A rapid expansion of bank
credit to the private sector affect macro stability by stimulating aggregate demand compared to potential
output and by creating overheating pressures, as bank lending fuels consumption and import demand. In
addition, during periods of rapid credit growth, risk assessment may also suffer due to the vast amount of
new loans extended. Lending booms can facilitate “ever-greening”, when new loans are used to service
existing debt. At the same time, banks may neglect to further diversify their loan portfolios in an
environment in which they can service existing clients. And finally, the perceived risk of loans may be
underestimated during lending booms because the risk assessments are based on the current strong
economy and rising values of underlying collateral.6 Thus, any expansion in credit should be monitored
closely to limit risks to the macroeconomic situation and financial system.

Box 2. Haiti: Credit Growth: Excessive or “Catching up?”
The ongoing rapid credit growth in Haiti reflects a mix of supply-and demand-side factors. On the supply
side, domestic liquidity boosted banks’ ability to fund loans while continued macroeconomic stability over recent
years contributed to improve confidence and encourage a sharp increase in local currency loans. Econometric
analysis aims at identifying whether there is an indication of excess credit growth in Haiti. We apply the
methodology most widely used in the literature to identify a credit boom, namely examining deviations of credit-toGDP from its statistically measured long-term trend.
The long-term trend of credit in Haiti is identified by applying an HP filter on the level of credit-to-GDP and
real credit. Once the trend is determined, the actual level of each series is compared to the trend and a “deviation”
is derived. Next, this “deviation” is compared to a threshold of 1.5 standard errors of the “deviation”, which covers 90
percent of the credit cycle episodes. A credit boom is then identified when the “deviation” is above the threshold.
Our sample covers the data from 1955 to 2012 on an annual basis.
The results of the application of the long-term trend approach show that credit-to-GDP and real credit
exhibit slight positive “deviation” of the actual series from their long-term trends starting in 2011 and are
slightly above the thresholds in 2012. While the deviations are minor to date, they signal the possibility that credit
growth could be becoming excessive. Although these results should be treated with caution given the limitations of
the HP filter methodology, rapid credit growth in Haiti requires heightened attention to the credit market
developments and financial indicators on the side of the policy makers.

B. Banking Sector Regulation and Supervision
12.
A number of important improvements have taken place in the legal and regulatory
environment in Haiti. The Haitian supervisory framework is based on the core principles of Basel I. The
CAMEL (Capital, Asset, Management, Earning, and Liquidity) approach has been used to analyze and
monitor the risk profile of the supervised institutions. The supervisory works are conducted through an on
and off-site unit. The latter ensures that the banks are in compliance with the applicable rules and
prudential norms analyzing on a regular basis the regulatory reports submitted by the banks and
discussing relevant issues with their key personnel. The on-site unit performs a more detailed annual
analysis of the financial information, management and compliance of the banks.
13.
A new law on banking and other financial institutions was enacted in May 2012. The law
makes provision for the Central Bank to regulate and supervise five new categories of financial institutions:
investment corporations; factoring institutions; credit card companies; fiduciary institutions and
development financial institutions. An ad hoc committee has been put in place to adapt the currently
applicable prudential norms to the provisions of the new law and to put in place required rules and
regulations for the newly regulated financial institutions. The new law has reinforced the power of the
Central Bank to deal with problem banks by allowing direct intervention in case of a potential crisis or a
bank run. The law also gives better protection to the bank supervisors while performing their duties. In
addition, according to the new law foreign banks can no longer operate through their branches but
through subsidiaries and must adopt the same fiscal year as local banks.
14.
New circulars pertaining to money laundering were enacted by the Central Bank in June
2012. They require the banks to put in place prevention and compliance programs for anti-money
laundering. These circulars are mainly inspired by the 40+9 recommendations of FATF and particularly take
into account the recommendations of 2008 World Bank AML Evaluations of Haiti.
15.
Leasing sector development has become of the areas of focus of the financial regulators. The
Central Bank has been recently working with other authorities to create a legal and regulatory framework
that can back up a strong leasing sector in Haiti in order to increase access to finance for SMEs considered
to be the backbone of the Haitian economy.
16.
Regulations on credit concentration have been significantly improved. Three limits have been
placed on the loan portfolio of the banking system: (i) a maximum ratio of 10% is applied individually to
loans granted to connected parties with regard to regulatory capital; (ii) a maximum ratio of 20% is applied
to loans granted to each related party but not connected to the bank; (iii) a maximum ratio of 25 % of total
banking loan portfolio is applied to loans granted to each sector.

industry at 16 percent, and real estate at 14
percent. Few loans have been granted to the
agricultural sector, although it represents a
quarter of the economy. The banking system
lends only to a few large and well-established
firms and lending to SMEs is limited.

While declining, the share of credit in dollars remains high. The ratio of credit in dollars to total
credit rose from 12 percent in 1996 to 57 percent in 2008. Despite a gradual reduction as the
macroeconomy improved credit in dollars remains among the highest in Latin America, at 42 percent in
2012. The decline in dollar credit has been compensated by a strong rebound in gourde-denominated
credit. Between 2008 and 2012, credit in dollars has increased by 22 percent while credit in local currency
has more than doubled (up by 124 percent), reflecting continued macroeconomic stability and recent
decisions by the Central Bank to eliminate the requirement to keep in gourdes 30 percent of the reserves
for dollar deposits. However, liquidity and exchange rate risks related to the high financial dollarization
appear manageable in the near-term. Current prudential regulations prevent banks’ net open foreign
exchange position from exceeding 2 percent of equity, and the three systemic banks in Haiti have more

assets than liabilities in foreign currency. However, banks’ potential exposures to indirect credit risk may
require closer oversight, although anecdotal evidence suggests that commercial banks in Haiti tend to
grant dollar loans mainly to larger commercial entities that derive most of their income in US dollars.

Box 3. Haiti: SME Financing
Resources potentially available for credit to SMEs are significant in Haiti. Existing sources of formal SME
financing include commercial banks’ SME credit departments; micro-finance institution (MFIs); financial
cooperatives (FCs) IFIs and NGOs. Loans are extended up to 5 years, at rates varying between 12 to 50
percent per year. Overall local deposits in the banking system represent the equivalent of $ 3.5 billion, with
loans at about $ 1.2 billion. Therefore there is ample liquidity in the banking sector which could be
potentially allocated for SME financing. There are, nevertheless, several bottlenecks that need to be
addressed.
Measures to enhance SME financing
The Government, financial system and development agencies need to work together, in order to advance
the SME agenda and liberate SME financing in Haiti. Banks, FCs and MFIs need to continue putting emphasis
and focus on SME financing, with more financial, organizational and human resources.
Policy Actions
Maintain monetary and fiscal policies conducive to economic growth and low inflation.
Maintain political stability and create economic policy certainty so that SMEs can plan over the shortmedium term (1-3 years).
Information Provision
Introduce a fully functional Credit Registry.
Extend the National Identity program to facilitate access to credit as well as the implementation of
compliance programs by financial institutions.
Conduct a national census of MSMEs, both urban and rural, and identify/formalize enterprises to map SME
activity nation-wide and attack the issue of poor data availability.
Training
Organize short-term training seminars for both start-up entrepreneurs and established SMEs.
Introduce business/financial literacy and entrepreneurship courses in secondary and university curriculums.
Organize short and medium-term training programs for SME credit officers of banks, MFIs, and credit unions
in both urban and rural segments (banks and MFIs should work on increasing core SME competencies,
simplifying forms/applications, and reducing turnaround).
Guarantees
Promote the use of guarantee funds for co-insurance with insurance companies of SME stocks and
equipment.
Reinforce access to insurance with the introduction of fire-fighting capacities in both Port-au-Prince and
provincial cities.
Collateral
Continue work on the use of movable assets as collateral; accelerate secure transaction reforms and improve
mechanisms of re-possession. Reduce the time required and fees for the registration of leased assets and
equipment liens (collateral registry.
Take necessary measures to facilitate the use of land as collateral also for MSME loans (land titling, cadastre
etc.)
Funding
Use donor funds to leverage local funds through guarantee mechanisms, particularly for start-up SMEs, for
agricultural/rural lending and for quasi-equity and equity participations in SMEs; centralize donor efforts and
avoid having various financing/guarantee programs that risk confusion and a loss of efficiency.

D. Banking System Policy Recommendations
21.
A number of areas for improvement in the regulatory and supervisory framework have
been identified.
a.

Continuing making progress on the 2008 FSAP recommendations and ensure effective
implementation of the new banking law.

b. Focusing on establishing a credit registry, a centralized registry of security collateral, a land registry
and deposit insurance scheme.
c.

Establishing explicit rules and regulation pertaining to corporate governance and consolidated
supervision of financial groups and/or financial conglomerates require regulatory attention.

d. Improving risk focus of the supervision.
e.

Upgrading IT infrastructure allowing for automated data collection and the production of key riskfocused statistics.

f.

Continuing stimulating competition in the banking system.

This review did not assess in –depth quality of the banking regulations per se, including the conduct of
stress testing and on-site supervision, an area of importance for the next FSAP.

FINANCIAL COOPERATIVES AND MICROFINANCE
INSTITUTIONS7
A. Economic Relevance and Recent Trends
22.
Financial Cooperatives (FCs) and Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) play a strategic role for
economic growth and financial inclusiveness. According to market8 estimates, the potential demand for
microcredit in Haiti could reach up to 1.7 million households. In addition, the donor organizations
estimated that there are approximately 375,000 microenterprises and 10,000 small and medium-sized

7

Information about these institutions is limited and not fully reliable. This report took into consideration selected
figures and general trends observed from the “Recensement de L’Industrie de la Microfinance en Haiti – Anne 20102011” (USAID / HIFIVE, 2012). It is important to note that there are significant differences between the numbers
obtained from USAID and BRH for different reasons. For example, the results of the USAID study were obtained from
a sampling and inference methodology, which had to use as a starting point an outdated census of institutions.
Some of these institutions in this census might no longer exist. Secondly, BRH collects information from part of the
sector (85 credit unions and 14 microfinance institutions), but there are other institutions that do not report to the
financial authorities. In general, although the numbers should be analyzed with caution, the general trends of this
report were confirmed by different stakeholders.

businesses.9Demand for microcredit contributes significantly to job creation and is not being fully served by
the formal banking system, due to low and unstable incomes, lack of quality collateral and high levels of
informality. In contrast, the authorities estimate that there are approximately 300 credit unions in the
country, only 85 of which are formally licensed. In addition, only 14 microfinance institutions provide
financial services to the MSMEs and unbanked population (bank subsidiaries and NGOs).
23.
FCs and MFIs report rapid growth rates, reaching a similar number of depositors as banks,
but with a significantly larger number of borrowers. Accounting for about 17.5 percent of banks’ total
gross loan portfolio, these organizations grew much faster than banks in 2011. The microcredit portfolio
increased by 46 percent – 2.7 times the Latin American average - reaching gourds 10.6 billion in 2011. FCs
and MFIs serve a similar number of depositors as the banks but a much larger number of borrowers
(286,000 versus 12,500). The clear orientation of FCs and MFIs to serve low to mid income customers is
reflected in the average size of loans and deposits, which are significantly smaller than those provided by
banks.
24.
FCs and MFIs play a particularly important role in rural areas. The formal banking system is
concentrated in Port-au-Prince, where 57 percent of its 157 branches operate. In contrast, 80 percent of
more than 400 branches of FCs and MFIs are located outside of Haiti’s capital. FCs and MFIs operating in
rural areas are in most cases small entities, often with only one branch.10

In contrast to the many small FCs and MFIs, the larger entities have better information and
accounting systems and appear to be profitable and well capitalized. According to the USAID study,11
thirteen larger FCs reported a ROE of 20.6 percent, while small FCs reported a negative ROE, driven by the
lack of economies of scale, high cost of capital and low productivity ratios. A similar situation is found
among the MFIs. In contrast to the many small and rural FCs and MFIs, larger entities also benefit from
existing technical assistance programs.

B. Concerns and Challenges for the Growth of the Sector
26.
MFIs are currently not regulated by financial authorities. The sector’s outreach among lower
income segments and rapid growth should be closely monitored by the authorities, as most of them have
yet to achieve operational self-sufficiency. The absence of a regulatory framework for MFIs is particularly
worrisome, as some of these institutions are taking deposits from large numbers of low-income customers,
who could be severely hurt and left unprotected, if these institutions fail.
27.
Although FCs are formally regulated, the existing legal framework needs to be revised to
ensure proper oversight of a large number of heterogeneous entities. Following the collapse in 2001
12
of many so-called “credit cooperatives” that were disguised pyramid like schemes, a Law for Savings and
Credit Cooperatives was issued in July 2002. This Law established, for the first time the BRH as the
prudential supervisor for cooperatives, while maintaining the prerogatives of the Conseil National des
Coopératives (CNC) license these entities. However, the processes between these two agencies are not well
coordinated, creating, according to BRH, significant delays for the registration of FCs. In addition, to certain
extent, the collection of financial information is delegated to the existing federation, which also monitors
non-licensed credit unions, but which does not have powers to intervene. In practice, BRH is obtaining
financial information from a small number of FCs, members of the Le Levier and Desjardins networks, as the
majority of these entities is not licensed(the total number is not known). BRH performs on-site supervision
of the group of FCs known to have a delicate financial position.
28.
The inadequate management of smaller cooperatives, in a context of rapid growth,
increases the urgency for a stronger legal framework. In addition to poor financial ratios, a significant
number of small FCs lack sound financial management and credit processes. According to the assessment
conducted by USAID, 53 percent of the FCs required improvements in financial management, while 76
percent were categorized as having deficient loan origination and management processes.

C. Recent Developments in Regulation
29.
A proposal to modernize the Law for Cooperatives has been developed as well as a draft
Law for Microfinance, but they are yet to be submitted to Parliament. Over the last two years, the
financial authorities, with technical support from the Canadian Development Agency (CIDA), have worked
on a proposal to modernize the 2002 Law for Savings and Credit Cooperatives, which has not been
presented to Parliament yet. In addition, a draft Law for Microfinance Institutions was prepared with
11

12

It is estimated that depositors lost USD 200 million in fraudulent schemes that operated disguised as cooperatives.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

HAITI

support from the French Development Agency (AFD) to establish a regulatory framework, which is in the
process of consultation. According to some MFIs, the current draft Law does not recognize joint-liability as
a relevant guarantee for lending13. This gap should be addressed as joint – liability lending methodologies,
such as solidarity, mutual and community groups (banque communnautaire, groupe solidaire and mutual
solidarite) are common in Haiti.

D. Policy Recommendations
30.

For the long-term development of the microfinance and cooperative sector, the
Government of Haiti should consider:
a.

Acceleration of the approval of the revised Law for Cooperatives, aiming to simplify the licensing
process (by leaving it in the hands of BRH), improving the faculties of BRH to intervene in failing
institutions,14 establishing prudential and reporting requirements commensurate to the size of
each FC15 and increasing the transparency of information about the sector.

b. Acceleration of the approval process for the Law for MFIs and establish a regulatory framework,
differentiating between deposit-taking institutions and those which do not mobilize deposits and
including provisions on the use of joint-liability as a collateral and provisions for consumer
protection.
c.

Conducting a census of FCs and MFIs to better understand the sector. Develop an action plan to
expand the collection and improve the quality of financial information about registered FCs and
MFIs.

d. Conducting a study of options to promote the consolidation of small financial cooperatives, as a
way to achieve scale and soundness that could translate into lower cost and a broader palette of
services for the final client.
e.

Facilitation of access of qualifying FCs and MFIs to the financial infrastructure. If minimum
standards are met, at least the largest FCs and MFI should be able to participate in the payments
system to be able to provide a wider range of services. Entities with qualifying information systems
should also participate in the credit registry that is currently being set up by BRH. Their
incorporation would contribute significantly to enhance the soundness and to deepen the financial
system as a whole, especially as the vast majority of borrowers are currently served by FCs and
MFIs.

13

The draft Microfinance Law was not available to the team.

14

Currently, intervention and closure of a failing institution involves both BRH and CNC.

15

The draft of the Cooperative Law was not available to the team. Given the heterogeneity of the FC sector, a revised
Law should also ensure, following international best practice, that applicable regulations and reporting requirements
are commensurate to the size of each cooperative and that supervision, especially of the smaller FCs, is properly
delegated to qualified institutions, while larger FCs are supervised directly by the BRH.

INSURANCE
A. Economic Relevance and Recent Trends and Challenges
31.
Until very recently, the insurance sector in Haiti was largely unregulated and unsupervised.
The sector has been regulated by a 1981 law that does not contain any prudential requirements apart from
licensing and reporting. Financial statements are not reported to the supervisor and are not published. As a
result, it is difficult to assess the size of the insurance sector which currently comprises nine non-life
insurers, and two life insurances. Axco reports estimate gross premiums at about 0.5 percent of GDP, which
is low compared to an average of 2-3 percent in Latin America, suggesting the potential for growth.
Property and casualty policies are the most prevalent in the market, and life insurance products are very
limited.
32.
The 2010 earthquake accelerated the need for reform. Although the Haitian insurance sector
assumed the bulk of its obligations following the earthquake, mostly due to reinsurance (it is estimated that
reinsurers covered 75 percent of claims), some claims have not been paid. The earthquake highlighted the
lack of transparency of the sector, and the need to regulate and supervise it adequately to ensure that
insurers will be able to meet their future obligations. The MEF has embarked on an extensive reform to
overhaul the insurance regulatory framework, and has drafted two bills which are in the process of being
submitted to Parliament (Loi Cadre sur l’Assurance and Loi sur l’Organisme Autonome de Supervision et de
Controle des Assurances). The draft bills set up prudential requirements for insurance companies, in line
with international standards, and establish a dedicated independent supervisor. A consultation process on
the insurance bills has taken place involving the industry, under a specific working group supported by the
Presidential Council (GTA – Groupe de Travail sur les Assurances).
33.
Without insurance, the private sector cannot adequately develop. The 2010 earthquake
increased the demand for insurance products, but at the same time, premiums have significantly increased
(mostly under the cost of reinsurance), limiting the affordability of such products. The constrained
development of the insurance market is a hindrance to private sector growth and the availability of credit.
Most bank loans in Haiti require insurance prior to being granted. This is particularly the case for mortgage
loans, which require both property and casualty insurance on the house, and life insurance on the
borrower. Housing finance is a key area for reconstruction, but cannot develop without insurance. A proper
regulation and supervision of the insurance sector would enhance transparency, attract new investments
and increase competition in the sector, facilitating affordability and the provision of new services16.
Initiatives are under way to develop new insurance products such as micro-insurance, which make the
regulation and supervision of the sector an urgent priority to ensure a sound development.
34.
The MEF has also taken steps to begin effective supervision of the insurance sector. In
August 2012, a unit was set up to oversee insurance within the MEF. Four staff have been assigned to the

16

It is important to note however that the current wording of the bills makes it very restrictive for foreign branches to
provide services in Haiti, given that they would be required to post the same minimum capital (cautionnement) as
local companies. International best practices usually do not have such requirements because branches are not
standalone entities, and they usually provide niche services that cannot be provided by local firms.

unit, and have received training. In December 2012, a guideline on reporting was completed after
consultation with the industry, and the MEF requested the industry to submit their financial statements by
early 2013. These efforts are supported by a FIRST (Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening Initiative)
Grant managed by the World Bank to strengthen insurance regulation and supervision, and support the
establishment of the new insurance supervisor envisaged in the draft laws with the preparation of
guidelines, examination manuals and training.

B. Policy Recommendations
35.
For the long-term development of the insurance sector, the Government of Haiti should
consider:
a.

Working towards a rapid approval of the insurance bills by Parliament, to give legitimacy to the
new insurance supervisor and clarify prudential rules for the industry;

b. Completing the reporting process in cooperation with the industry: the MEF has requested the
financial statements of the industry by early January. This process is key to (i) assess the situation of
the sector and its capacity to face future natural disasters, (ii) build up supervisory capacity on the
analysis of financial statements, (iii) prepare new regulations, and (iv) define actions to strengthen
and consolidate the sector. Cooperation of the industry will be essential in the process;
c.

Building-up supervisory capacity and processes: this includes appointing the Board and Managing
Director of the Supervisor once the law is approved, securing the increase in permanent staff for
the unit and an office building, training the staff and drafting guidelines and manuals;
Once the supervisory authority (OASCA) is established, preparing an action plan to supervise public
insurers such as ONA, OAVCT and OFATMA.

HOUSING FINANCE
A.

Economic Relevance and Recent Trends and Challenges

36.
The mortgage system in Haiti is very small, with residential mortgage loans accounting for
17
roughly 1 percent of GDP, the size of the housing finance system in Haiti is similar to those of countries
within the same income range, such as Malawi (0.5 percent), Uganda (1.1 percent), and Kenya (2.5 percent).
When compared to countries in the region, Haiti’s housing finance system is however relatively small with
the same indicator for the Dominican Republic’s being 4.2 percent, for Guatemala 5.9 percent and for
18
Bolivia 6.6 percent . In 2011, it was estimated that the country had 650 outstanding mortgage loans.
Financing for the development and construction of rental housing is similarly restricted.

17

This figure would be 2.4 percent if commercial mortgage loans were to be included.

18

Based on estimated averages, home mortgage loans accounted for 6.8 percent of GDP in Latin America and the
Caribbean.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

HAITI

37.
In January 2010, the 7.0 magnitude earthquake devastated the capital and economic center
of Haiti, aggravating the long-existing housing deficit. According to the government, Haiti needs to
build 500,000 new homes to address current housing needs and future demand over the next decade.
Housing finance – whether mortgage or microfinance - should play a critical role in the country’s long-term
reconstruction. The Post Disaster Needs Assessment estimated damages to the housing sector in the order
of USD 2.3 billion, while programmed contributions by donors are estimated at USD 200 million. The
banking system, at the same time, holds USD 1.8 billion in liquid assets, which could be mobilized if the
right conditions and incentives were available.
38.
While all nine commercial banks offer mortgage products, the three largest providers hold
roughly 67 percent of home mortgage loans. Sogebel, the only specialized mortgage bank in Haiti, had
the largest market participation with 29 percent. In terms of commercial mortgage loans, three banks
concentrate roughly 90 percent and the largest provider, Unibank, 56 percent.
39.
Low and informal incomes, limited savings and lack of land titles are significant demand
side constraints for the expansion of formal housing finance. Banks only serve households who have
land and property titles and formal proof of income, which reduces the pool of qualifying borrowers
significantly, as few properties have titles and informal employment is predominant.
40.
On the other side, current loan terms limit the affordability of banks’ mortgage loans to a
small segment of the population. On average, down-payment requirements are 30 percent, interest rates
on adjustable rate loans are 10 to 12 percent and maturities typically 7 to 10 years. Banks require a debt-toincome ratio of usually only up to 20 percent and households have to secure three monthly payments in
advance, while upfront fees and mortgage costs (related to mortgage taxes, mortgage registration fees,
insurance costs and bank fees) are relatively high19.

19

Mortgage taxes were recently reduced in the new Banking Law.

20

21

HAITI

41.
MFIs and FCs are slowly introducing short-term housing microfinance products with flexible
collateral requirements that are adequate to the needs of low to mid income customers. MFIs and FCs are
challenged by the short-term nature of their funding base, the high credit risk and high transaction costs
related to small size of the loans, which push interest rates up. In addition, these institutions lack the
technical expertise needed for the sound provision of longer-term loans for housing and home
improvements. More recently, IFC and USAID have provided technical assistance for the development of
housing microfinance products as well as liquidity funding for some FCs and MFIs. Under these
circumstances, FCs and MFIs can be expected to play in the short term a growing role in financing home
improvements and expansion, before taking on, at a later stage, mortgage lending.
42.
The Government and donor agencies have tried to increase the supply of housing loans
through a variety of measures. In 2011, the Government launched a mortgage program, Kay Pam,
targeting civil servants and other salaried workers. In 2012, the program had only 29 active clients with
outstanding loans in the amount of USD 3.3 million, with an average loan size of USD 115,000. The small
uptake is attributed to potential borrowers’ lack of proper land titles, the structure of the subsidy program,
as well as to the absence of adequate savings mechanisms for housing. In addition, right after the
earthquake, the BRH eliminated reserve requirements on resources raised in Gourdes to finance housing
and increased the allowable sector concentration ratio from 25 to 50 percent, as a way to encourage banks
to increase mortgage lending. In the absence of a functioning supply of loans for housing, the
Government of Haiti and donors have made available large amounts of grant funds to subsidize home
reconstruction and repair. In addition, donors are providing technical assistance to financial institutions and
supporting the emergence of partial credit guarantee schemes.20
43.
While these measures have contributed to increasing the mortgage loan portfolios, such
growth is from a very low level. Significant impediments to the expansion of mortgage portfolios
remain. The participation of public banks has contributed to large part of the loan growth, with BPH and
BNC focusing on the middle class. Besides the shortcomings mentioned above, mortgage lending is
constrained by inadequate financial risk management tools i.e. by the absence of a credit bureau, lengthy
foreclosure procedures, the absence of interest rate risk management tools (other than adjustable rate
mortgages which place the risk on the client) which will hamper expansion of the sector.

B. Policy Recommendations
44.
For the long-term development of the housing finance system, the Government of Haiti
should consider:
a.

Establishing the necessary conditions to guarantee property and land rights, such as: a modern
property registration system and reforms of the legal framework to enforce property rights; the
creation of a modern physical land cadastre; the development of an affordable system for

20

The BRH has supported the establishment of a partial credit guarantee fund that is managed by FDI, which targets
productive MSMEs and housing. In addition, USAID expanded the scope of DCA guarantees to include housing.

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

HAITI

registration of titles and mortgages; and the definition of property valuation standards and
methods.
b. More direct measures to stimulate mortgage lending by banks to unlock the available liquidity in
the banking system for housing purposes.21 Credit risk is one of the main deterrents to mortgage
lending. Government could improve the credit information system, and stimulate the development
of mortgage insurance for all or for a subgroup of loans or borrowers. Current general loan
portfolio guarantees are an initial attempt, but may require adaptation. Additional measures
should address existing shortcomings in foreclosure procedures and other mechanisms to manage
risks.
c.

Addressing high transaction costs of mortgage lending. These are another main constraint and the
GOH should consider adjustments to mortgage taxes and fees to incentivize lending while
broadening the base on which they are levied. In addition, taxes and controls on rental housing
should be reviewed as they are significant constraints to the development of a rental market.

d. Developing well designed household subsidy system. If linked to credit, this could contribute to a
more inclusive housing finance system by enhancing the affordability of households and increasing
banks’ interest in mortgage lending to middle and lower middle income households.22 Downpayment and monthly mortgage payment assistance, could leverage both household and financial
sector resources for the housing sector and reduce total subsidy amounts per housing solution.
Such subsidy programs should be designed in such a way that lenders make the lending decisions
and operate on market principles. Procedures should be simple and transparent and programs
should be well monitored. Such programs could also contribute to expand the formal housing
stock and improve disaster resilience. A review of experience gained in the implementation of the
current subsidy programs on home reconstruction and repair could provide valuable lessons to
develop and implement a modern incentive scheme for home improvement and acquisition are
important.
e.

Housing finance and micro mortgage products provided by FCs and MFIs could play an important
role, but should be closely monitored. Unlike banks, FCs and MFIs are interested in expanding the
provision of housing microfinance. However, their interest rates are rather high, ranging from 20 to
30 percent, and are not calculated in a standard way. While competition and economies of scale
may help drive costs down, regulations are needed to establish a APR disclosure, as well as
appropriate consumer protection programs. In addition, FCs and MFIs will require access to longerterm funds to be able to grant longer-term housing loans.

21

While the banking system is currently highly liquid, the authorities should also initiate activities to promote the
development of capital markets in order to mobilize the resources for housing finance that will be needed in the
longer term.

22

Past experience has demonstrated that supply-side subsidies have been captured by housing suppliers and that
other forms of subsidies, such as interest rates subsidies, negatively distort market prices. If well designed and market
oriented, an incentive system could potentially unlock the market of home improvements and acquisitions of new
houses for middle and lower income segments. In addition, the design of such system could help address other
policy issues, such as disaster resilience and adherence to building codes.

REMITTANCES
A. Economic Relevance and Recent Trends and Challenges
45.
Over the last decade, remittances have represented an important and consistent source of
income for Haiti. According to the IMF’s estimates, in 2012 the country received approximately USD 1.6
billion in remittances, which accounted roughly for 19 percent of the Haiti’s GDP, surpassing the
participation of other sources of incomes, such as foreign aid and foreign direct investment. This number
could be considerably larger if the informal remittances were taken into account.23 On average, between
2005 and 2010, the inflows of remittances represented 22 percent of GDP, which is the highest
participation in the region. Similarly, the savings of the Haitian diaspora USD 3.7 billion or 57 percent of the
GDP, is among the highest in the region and could be further leveraged to support the reconstruction of
housing and infrastructure as well as social projects.24
46.
Remittances could provide a substantial source for financial deepening if channeled through
the financial system. If they increased savings rather than consumption, the deposit base would be
strengthened and the maturities extended, therefore stimulating sustained credit growth. In addition, the
development impact of remittances would increase if they were leveraged to increase access to additional
financial services and to raise financing for infrastructure and other development projects.
47.
Aside of being an important source of funding for the financial system, remittances are an
important financial service for large segments of the population than can be leveraged to increase
access to finance. Promoting dedicated financial products, that could, for instance, facilitate access to
loans for housing by the senders and/or recipients of remittances could contribute to deepen the financial
sector, while simultaneously spurring economic growth.
48.
According to the IADB, more than a third of the Haiti’s adults received regular remittance
payments and the majority of recipients strongly rely on this source of income. It is estimated that, on
average, remittances accounted for 60 percent of the income of households receiving remittances.25 The
World Bank estimated that 55 percent of remittance-receiving households do not have any other income
and that 27 percent of recipient households earn less than USD 500 a year. Most Haitian remittance
recipients spend the transfers to address basic needs, such as food and clothing. However, a significant
amount of recipients also invest part of the remittances in education, savings, health care, housing and
business, but are constrained by the limited offer of public and private services.22

23

It is estimated that informal remittances could account for roughly 30 percent of received remittances (Orozco,
2010).

In 2010, the stock of Haitian emigrants reached one million. The top destinations are: USA (45 percent), DR (45
percent), Canada (5 percent), France (3 percent), and other (2 percent) (Orozco and Burgess,2010).

The United States - Haiti corridor is the largest remittances’ corridor. In 2011, more than 77
percent of the inflows of remittances were sent from the United States, according to BRH’s statistics. Thus,
Haiti is vulnerable to the US economic situation, especially to its unemployment rate. In 2009, in the midst
of the financial crisis, inflows of remittances flattened for the first time. Other corridors include: France (6
percent), Canada (6 percent), DR (2 percent), and others (8 percent).
50.
The corridor Dominican Republic - Haiti is reported to provide only three percent of the
reported remittance volume but it is likely to be considerably larger. With an estimated number of
450,000 migrants, the Dominican Republic is a significant destination for Haitian migrants. The total volume
of remittances coming from the Dominican Republic is estimated to be considerably larger that the
reported three percent, as it is responsible for most of the informal remittances that enter the country. It is
estimated that nearly 54 percent of remittances inflows from the Dominican Republic are sent to rural
areas, while roughly 23 percent are sent to the capital and other urban areas (23 percent each).22
51.
The high level of informality in the Dominican Republic – Haiti corridor limits the availability
of data, while raising concerns about the security of transactions and the protection of consumers.
According to industry experts, the main reasons behind higher levels of informality in DR-Haiti corridor are
geographic proximity, lower amounts per transaction, the undocumented status of migrants and the
existence of informal networks in rural areas in the Dominican Republic -Haiti corridor. Informality is not as
high in the US - Haiti corridor due to its nature and the number of companies in the market, which has
helped push costs down. In addition, the average reported transaction amounts are lower in the Dominican
Republic - Haiti corridor. According to the latest information available on formal remittance flows, the
average remittance transaction from the US to Haiti was USD 120, and in the Dominican Republic - Haiti
corridor, USD 70. Informal remittances from the Dominican Republic are likely to be smaller than this
amount.
52.
The differences between the corridors are explained by different migration patterns. The
Haitian Diaspora in the Dominican Republic mainly consists by Haitians living in border areas, working
predominantly in sugar cane, the service industry and in the informal economy.26 The number of the mostly
undocumented immigrants looking for work in the Dominican Republic increased significantly since the
2010 Earthquake. On the other hand, in general, the Haitian Diaspora in the US has a better financial
situation due to the higher level of formal education of many of the Haitian emigrants and better income
opportunities.27. Another difference between the US and the Dominican Republic corridors is the profile of
the recipients: Haitians in the US are sending money to their dependents: husband/wife (30 percent),
parents (22 percent) and children (24 percent); while the beneficiaries of remittances from the Dominican
republic are largely the parents (52 percent).

26

Of note, there are roughly 6,500 of Haitian students in the Dominican Republic who rely on remittances from Haiti
to pay for tuition and living costs, see: “Encuesta sobre gastos de estudiantes extranjeros en la Republica
Dominicana” (Banco Central de la Republica Dominicana, 2012).

27

Initially, Haitian migrants into the US were mainly upper and middle class families, whose economic interests were
at risk due to the uncertain political and economic scenario. After the 1970s, the demographic profile of emigrants
has changed significantly with a substantial amount of poor and less educated refugees arriving.

Money transfer operators (MTOs) are the primary formal remittance service providers
(RSPs). There are only seven RSPs partnering with 134 payout institutions to offer 411 payment locations.
The market is highly concentrated with Western Union holding 48 percent of the payment points. With 30
percent of the payout locations, banks are the largest payer type. The network of MFIs (15 percent) is
particularly important for reaching recipients living in more remote areas as 96 percent of their payout
locations are located outside Port-au-Prince.

B. Policy Recommendations
a.

Promoting competition in the market would be an important step to help reduce the costs of
remittances and to improve the security of transactions. Over the last year, the average cost of
sending funds to Haiti has decreased from USD 7.7 to 5.7 between the third quarter of 2011 and
2012. However, compared to other countries in the Caribbean and Central America, Haiti still has
one of the highest remittance fees.

b. Assessing the impact of a recent remittance tax on remittances flows and considering alternatives
to the current flat fee. A flat fee (such as the USD 1.5 tax on remittances from the Haitian Diaspora
established in June 2011) could have negative implications for smaller transactions. In addition to
reducing household income, a remittance tax usually reduces incentives to send remittances, drives
resources underground and impedes efforts to link remittances to financial inclusion.
c.

Studying in depth the structure and operation of the Haiti – Dominican Republic remittance
corridor to better understand its characteristics and to design a strategy for its formalization. Based
on the results on this analysis, the Government could establish mechanisms to issue licenses to
sound providers and define appropriate policy measures and communication campaigns to deal
with any problems.

d. Assessing the legal and regulatory framework of remittances in Haiti could contribute to improve
transparency, competition and financial inclusion. The Law on Money Laundering, amended in
2008, and the new Banking Law of 2012 include provisions on AML, which improved the quality of
information collected, IT systems and internal controls. However, the quality of information and
transparency still need to be further improved. In addition, only recently, credit unions started
providing remittance services.28 Given the broad branch network of credit unions and MFIs as well
as the potential for financial inclusion, the Government should consider creating a mechanism to
encourage credit unions and MFIs expand the offer of the remittance services. As done in many
other countries, an in-depth review of all legal statutes concerning remittances (including
AML/CFT), could help develop a coherent regulatory framework.

28

In September 2011, 7 credit unions affiliated with Le Levier started a remittances pilot, through 15 service points,
with the International Remittances Network (IRnet®), a platform owned and operated by the World Council of Credit
Unions (WOCCU).

SUMMARY OF THE POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
54.
In summary, the main findings of the study are: (i) banks dominate the financial sector in Haiti
in terms of assets and volume of loans and deposits, but play a limited role in financial inclusion, lending to
few sectors and clients; (ii) a significant part of the nonbank system is not regulated and information on
their activity is scarce; (iii) microfinance institutions (MFIs) and Financial Cooperatives (FCs) are growing fast
and are playing a key role in increasing financial inclusiveness, particularly in the rural areas; and (iv) the
insurance sector and the housing finance system are relatively limited. Accordingly, key recommendations
are to: (i) assess that the existing banking legislation is up-to-date, implemented, and adequately enforced;
(ii) put in place the needed legislation and framework for the nonbank system; (iii) and address the lack of
information on the nonbank system. Several recommendations could be implemented through an update
of the 2008 FSAP.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Haiti
On March 11, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Haiti.11
Background
Significant progress has been made since the January 2010 earthquake to safeguard
macroeconomic stability. Inflation remains in the single digits, although it has picked up to
7.6 percent in December, reflecting primarily higher international food prices and reduced
domestic food supply caused by Hurricanes Isaac and Sandy. The external position has
strengthened, with gross international reserves reaching $2.2 billion (6 months of imports)
at end-December 2012. Haiti’s debt situation has significantly improved owing to additional
debt relief from major partners (including the Fund) after the January 2010 earthquake.
However, the pace of the reconstruction and economic recovery has been slow, due to
weak administrative and absorptive capacity, persistent socio-political tensions, difficult
security situation, and a weak business environment. In addition, the country remains
highly vulnerable to exogenous shocks. After contracting by 5.4 percent in FY2010
following the earthquake, economic activity expanded by 5.6 percent in real terms in
FY2011. However real GDP growth slowed markedly to 2.8 percent in FY2012, reflecting a
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

spring drought, the impact of Hurricane Isaac, and delays in implementing key public
investment projects.
The recovery is expected to be firmer in FY2013 and medium-term prospects are
promising, albeit with serious downside risks. Growth is projected to accelerate to 6.5
percent in 2013, assuming a pickup in reconstruction and a rebound in agriculture. Inflation
should remain stable, in the mid-single digits. In the medium term, maturing ongoing
agricultural and industrial projects and persistence in efforts to improve the business
environment will help sustain growth and strengthen the external position. However, a
worsening in global economic conditions, continued weak capacity, heightened domestic
political and social tensions- fueled by pervasive poverty and lack of progress in improving
living standards- and natural disasters could impede the fragile recovery and constrain
Haiti’s growth prospects.
Executive Board Assessment
The Executive Directors commended the authorities’ continued commitment to prudent
policies despite the challenging domestic environment and exogenous shocks. Inflation has
remained in single digits, the external position has strengthened, and the country’s debt
situation has improved. However, Haiti remains extremely vulnerable to natural disasters;
reconstruction and economic recovery from the 2010 earthquake has been slow; and the
country’s growth and development challenges are daunting. Directors encouraged the
authorities to take full advantage of external support to improve administrative and
absorptive capacity, accelerate the reconstruction, and sustain the recovery while
safeguarding macroeconomic stability.
Directors underscored that fiscal space for poverty-related and growth-enhancing spending
should be secured through increasing revenue and containing current spending. They
called for additional reforms to further strengthen revenue administration, reduce tax
expenditures, and expand the tax base, including the adoption of a VAT system. Efforts are
also needed to further strengthen social safety nets and to increase investment in health
and education. Directors welcomed recent progress in enhancing public financial
management, in particular towards the establishment of a treasury single account. They
stressed the importance of continued efforts to strengthen budget formulation, execution,
transparency and reporting, and improve controls.
Directors noted that improving the execution rate of public investment is critical to build the
necessary infrastructure that would unlock the country’s growth potential. They urged the
authorities to work closely with donors to improve project preparation and management,
while ensuring the overall quality of public investment. Many Directors also stressed the
importance of better coordination and harmonization of procedures amongst donors, and
closer alignment of external assistance with Haiti’s domestic priorities. A few Directors

3

considered that competition from NGOs in hiring experienced professionals could
potentially negatively impact public sector capacity.
Directors endorsed the current neutral stance of monetary policy but encouraged the
authorities to keep price inflation in check. Further improvements in liquidity management,
financial market deepening, market-based operations, and reducing dollarization will help
strengthen monetary transmission mechanisms. Directors also emphasized that moving
towards greater exchange rate flexibility, together with efforts to deepen the foreign
exchange market, would help absorb external shocks and increase monetary policy
effectiveness. In this regard, they welcomed the authorities’ commitment to move gradually
to single price foreign exchange auctions after deepening the interbank foreign exchange
market.
Directors underscored the importance of structural reforms to improve competitiveness,
enhance the business environment, and foster higher and inclusive growth. Efforts should
focus on streamlining regulations, removing infrastructure bottlenecks, strengthening
human capital and deepening financial intermediation. Directors commended the planned
energy sector reform. They looked forward to decisive implementation in order to lower the
high cost of electricity, improve the reliability and efficiency of energy supply, and reduce
the burden on the budget.
Directors noted that Haiti’s banking sector remains relatively sound and profitable. Recent
strong credit growth has been healthy, but will require close monitoring going forward.
Directors were encouraged by progress in implementing the 2008 Financial Sector
Assessment Program recommendations and regulating the microfinance and cooperative
sectors, and underscored the need to further improve the regulatory and supervisory
framework.

Statement by Mr. Nogueira Batista, Executive Director for Haiti, Ms. Florestal,
Government-Provided Advisor, and Mr. Robergeau, Government-Provided Advisor
March 11, 2013
1. During the period under review Haiti suffered two new natural disasters (a hurricane
and a spring drought). Although there have been significant improvements in disaster
preparedness and risk management, the country remains very vulnerable to these
shocks. Scarce public resources had to be reallocated to emergency responses,
including those related to spikes in cholera infection. Damages in the agricultural
sector led to significant material losses with ensuing pressures on imports and prices.
The deceleration of exports and the shrinking of agricultural output led to a slowdown
in GDP growth.
2. GDP continued to grow, albeit modestly, in per capita terms. Inflation spiked but
remained at single digits. Gross liquid international reserves were considerably
strengthened and reached the equivalent of six months of imports at end 2012. The
authorities have managed to maintain macroeconomic stability and meet all
quantitative performance criteria under the ECF. Commendable progress was also
achieved on the structural reform agenda.
3. On behalf of our authorities, we would like to thank IMF staff and management for
the constructive dialogue and their continuous support particularly with the technical
assistance missions. We also commend staff for the set of excellent reports. Our
authorities are particularly pleased with the inclusion of Haiti in the pilot program of
financial sector reviews which they find to be a helpful addition to the Article IV
report.
Investment, growth and donor coordination
4. The authorities’ medium and long term goal is to achieve sustainable and inclusive
growth. In their strategy, the private sector needs to play a central role. Therefore, the
Government is determined to improve the business climate both by targeted measures
to remove bottlenecks and by maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment.
Reforms initiated to strengthen institutional capacity, scale up investments in human
capital, and build economic and social infrastructures should also have a positive
impact on private sector initiatives.
5. Key challenges for the implementation of the national development agenda include
securing reliable concessional resources and ensuring that donors’ assistance is
aligned with domestic priorities. A significant portion of the US$ 9.04 billion
reported to have been disbursed by the donor community since the earthquake of
2010 did not go through Haiti’s national budget. Moreover, much of the donor
resources did go through the budget financed projects that were not originally part of

2
the national action plan presented by the Government after the 2010 earthquake. The
channeling of donor resources through parallel structures that compete with public
institutions for funding and qualified personnel adds to Haiti’s development
challenges.
6. Donor-financed projects constitute the bulk of the public investment program (PIP)
and their alignment with national development goals remains crucial. This is one of
the key mandates of the newly created structure under the leadership of the Minister
of Planning and External Cooperation to replace the Interim Haiti Recovery
Commission. Greater coordination and harmonization of procedures within the donor
community would also be instrumental. Information on the sectoral distribution and
geographic location of externally financed operations and disbursements of
development partners needs to be made available to the Government on a timely
basis. There is no other way to make sure that scarce development resources are
efficiently allocated and integrated into the national development plan.
7. Haiti’s absorptive capacity is also weakened by the heterogeneity of donors’
procurement regulations and the multiplication of executing units. The time national
institutions, including line and coordinating ministries, spend receiving missions from
abroad, could have been more efficiently used in implementing the PIP and the
structural reform agenda.
8. Our authorities look forward to the streamlining and harmonization of donor
procedures and the increased reliance on Haiti’s rules and institutions in the use of
donor resources. At the same time, they are convinced that the difficulties faced by
the public sector in hiring and retaining experienced professionals are amplified by
the high salaries and fringe benefits offered by NGOs and international organizations.
The public sector cannot compete with these institutions under its human resource
management framework and financial constraints. With support from Canada and the
IDB, an action plan for reforming the public service, including through changes in the
salary scale, is being elaborated under the leadership of the Prime Minister’s office.
Taxes and fiscal administration
9. The staff report and the issues note summarize well the assessments and
recommendations of Fund technical assistance missions and other development
partners. Strengthening the organizational structure and administrative capacities of
the tax offices seems critical for attaining fiscal objectives and for improving the
quality of services offered to taxpayers. A significant step forward in this direction
was the launching of the e-declaration through which taxes can be declared online. It
is expected that by the end of the year the electronic liquidation of taxes will also be
possible. Also, an internationally renowned firm is being hired to support the Ministry
of Economy and Finance (MEF) in its efforts to strengthen the organizational
structure and administrative capacities of the tax offices.

3
10. The size of the informal economy in Haiti explains to a large extent the
preponderance of indirect taxation and makes comparisons with regional peers that
have mainly formal economies less relevant. Nonetheless, the authorities are
determined to enlarge the income tax base. A medium tax payer unit was recently
created to contribute to this end. Despite the comparatively low custom tariffs, fiscal
revenues depend largely on trade and are thus vulnerable to international demand and
price volatility. Reforms have been initiated to shift the burden of taxation to internal
sources of revenue. The transformation of the TCA (Taxe sur le Chiffres d’Affaires)
to a TVA (Taxe sur la Valeur Ajoutée) should also help. The timing of the official
launching of the TVA and its success will however hinge on the speed at which the
authorities are able to put in place an adequate information system in the fiscal
administration.
11. As Haiti complies with the requirements of CARICOM membership, including
adoption of the common external tariff (CET), increases in the average tariff rates are
expected. Staff observes that the overall impact on revenues is uncertain, given that
revenue losses would result from reduction or elimination of tariffs on imports from
CARICOM countries. However, since most of Haiti’s imports are presently coming
from countries such as the US and the Dominican Republic, we expect that the net
effect on fiscal revenues of aligning the country’s tariffs with those of CARICOM
will probably be positive, at least in the short-term.
12. Tax expenditures have reached alarming levels. The authorities started to tackle this
problem through a two-pronged approach: first by ensuring that NGOs and
international institutions comply with legislation and, second, by limiting or
eliminating certain exemptions and exonerations, including to firms executing
contracts for the public sector. The Executive Order of August 2012 underscores the
obligations and duties of those who are granted tax exemptions and seeks to ensure
that beneficiaries participate in the realization of national development plans.
Energy sector
13. The Haitian authorities remain mindful that an orderly reduction of the Treasury’s
subsidies to the public utility company Electricité d’Haïti (EDH) is imperative. With
the ensuing savings, fiscal space will be generated for social expenditures and the
funding of job creation and growth enhancing projects. However, they are also
conscious that the strengthening of EDH’s financial situation and production capacity
will occur only gradually. Hence, the government adopted a set of measures to phaseout the subsidies and achieve sustainable financial soundness at EDH. The phasing
out of budget transfers to EDH has been initiated with a target date of 2016 for
complete elimination. An MOU was also signed between EDH and the MEF at end2012. It includes a commitment by the management of the electric company to
present a financial sustainability plan by end-March 2013 on which an agreement will
have to be reached by the end of the year.

4
14. A delegate minister for energy was appointed with a specific mandate that includes
the responsibility of overseeing the sector and preparing a financial recovery program
and an investment master plan that addresses EDH’s financing needs. However, the
Ministry of Public Works continues to be the lead oversight institution for the
electricity sector.
15. Additionally, to enhance transparency, equity and control over the operations of the
independent power producers (IPPs), long-distance power metersthat allow EDH to
monitor the quantity of electricity produced and consumed, have been installed at five
out of a total of six IPP plants. A standard contract is also being drafted by EDH
management with a view of harmonizing the terms of the agreements with all six IPPs
by the end of 2013.
16. The involvement of the external firm Tetratech in the reform of EDH, subsequent to
an agreement with the development partners, represents a valuable step. Success
depends on an effective cooperation between donors, EDH and the authorities.
Financial sector
17. Several reforms have already been initiated to enhance access to credit. Many
challenges remain including completing legislative changes such as the Law on
Financial Cooperatives (FCs) and the Bill for Microfinance Institutions (MFIs). A top
priority of the BRH's regulatory agenda is the drafting of a law to cover financial
leasing and factoring. In addition, with support from the World Bank and IDB, a
credit bureau will be launched soon.
18. Our authorities welcome the policy recommendations for the long-term development
of the microfinance and cooperative sectors. They are determined to establish a
regulatory framework commensurate with the needs and diversity of the current
players. The microfinance and cooperative sectors are preponderant in the rural areas.
Their presence and active involvement in financing productive activities make them
central to the financial inclusion agenda. FCs and MFIs meeting minimum IT and
regulatory requirements will also have access to the credit bureau.
19. The authorities recognize the need to address the problem of insufficient information
on the nonbank financial sector. They intend to hasten the process of drafting and
approving regulation covering the sector. The informal sector of the economy relies
mostly on microfinance provided by nonbank institutions. As informality is
progressively reduced, the need for timely availability of quality data will become
more pressing.

5
Remittances
20. The Haitian authorities are fully cognizant of the importance of remittances in
providing a reliable source of income for the most vulnerable. They welcome
recommendations to strengthen the regulatory framework, promote competition in the
money transfer market, reduce costs and secure transactions. As mentioned in the
staff report, a flat fee on remittance flows was introduced about a year ago.
Preliminary data compiled by the Central Bank since the introduction of the measure
do not show evidence of negative effects either on the number of transactions or on
the total amount. Hence, suggestions to consider alternatives to the current flat fee
appear somewhat premature.
21. The issues note on the financial sector also calls for an in-depth study of the structure
and operation of the Haiti-Dominican Republic corridor in the flow of remittances.
The Haitian authorities are of the view that such a project would gain from being
conducted jointly by the central banks of the respective countries. In addition, given
the importance of the US-Haiti and France-Haiti corridors, the authorities are more
inclined to start with the assessment of these channels and derive adequate lessons to
be applied to support financial inclusion.
Monetary, credit and exchange rate policy
22. The Central Bank has maintained the accommodative stance adopted since the
earthquake, leaving interest rates on its paper unchanged since January 2011.
However, with 12-month inflation above 7 percent, the Central Bank slightly
tightened the monetary policy stance, raising banks' reserve requirement ratios by 5
percentage points to a maximum of 34 and 39 percent on liabilities in local and
foreign currency, respectively. This measure became effective on February 1st, 2013.
23. The Central Bank is committed to move gradually towards greater exchange rate
flexibility. Despite the recent increase in the volume of transactions, the foreign
exchange market remains quite shallow and constrained, given the small number of
players. The Central Bank considers the expansion and modernization of the foreign
exchange market a prerequisite to the establishment of a single price foreign
exchange auction system. Ongoing TA and the Fund’s support will be instrumental in
deciding on the appropriate sequencing of measures for the change in auction type.
NGOs and exporters already hold frequent free auctions to allocate foreign currency
to local banks in a wholesale-like market.
Conclusion
24. The building and reconstruction of economic and social infrastructure offer enormous
business opportunities which are being seized by some investors as attested by the
continuation of growth in FDI last year. Going forward, domestically financed capital

6
investment is to be allocated primarily to projects that will upgrade the stock of
infrastructure and foster private sector investments. Transformational projects, those
that can change the dynamics of development in Haiti, require the mobilization of
important resources. Thus, the use of Private Public Partnerships (PPP) is a useful
complement to the conventional sources of development finance. Our authorities
would welcome technical support for the finalization of a consistent framework for
PPPs.
