STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 10, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Setting: Namibia’s positive growth record over the years has raised overall incomes and
led to positive economic outcomes. However, growth has not translated into sufficient
job creation contributing to persistently high unemployment and income inequality.
Outlook and risks: Real GDP growth is expected to moderate to 4 percent in 2013 from
5 percent in 2012 reflecting weak global demand for exports partially offset by solid
growth in domestic demand. The uncertain global environment and a possible delay in
finalizing negotiations for the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the European
Union are key risks.
Policy mix: Given the peg to the South African rand, staff urges the authorities to
return to fiscal prudence through greater expenditure control. In case of more adverse
shifts in the global economic environment than currently anticipated, staff advocates for
allowing the automatic stabilizers to operate on the revenue side.
Medium-term: With an uncertain external environment, staff recommends the
authorities pursue a “growth-friendly” fiscal consolidation reining in unproductive
current spending, while protecting growth-promoting capital spending. Staff welcomes
efforts by the government to look into ways to steer a gradual reduction of the wage bill
which would improve labor market outcomes. Measures to enhance domestic revenue
mobilization would help balance the fiscal consolidation strategy.
Financial stability and inclusion: The government’s emphasis on enhancing financial
inclusion, while preserving the stability of the financial system, is appropriate. Although
the level of household indebtedness has stabilized, it remains elevated. Thus, staff
commends the authorities for initiatives taken to strengthen their surveillance of the
financial sector and thereby help minimize the associated vulnerabilities.
Growth and diversification: Achieving higher growth would require a set of efficiencydriven reforms to reinvigorate productivity drivers. Delivering good outcomes on policies
for greater diversification would require supportive measures to liberalize the service
sectors and reduce the domestic regulatory burden for firms.
Past advice: There is broad agreement between the Fund and the authorities on
macroeconomic policy and structural reform priorities. The authorities also view the
Fund as a valuable partner for their capacity building efforts.

SETTING, CURRENT CONDITIONS, OUTLOOK, AND
RISKS
A. The Long-Term Setting
1.
Namibia’s economic performance in the last
decade has been strong. Real GDP growth
outperformed the average for its small middle-income
(SMIC) peers in sub-Saharan Africa. The rebound from
the 2009 global financial crisis was also quick and
strong and growth outpaced the global average for the
last two to three years.
2.
At the same time, the economy continues to
face enormous socio economic development and
structural challenges, amidst high unemployment
and income inequality.1 These socio-economic
challenges are multidimensional, but three stand out:


Dual economy. At independence in 1990, Namibia
inherited a dual economy with the four interrelated
challenges of low economic growth, a high rate of
poverty, inequitable distribution of wealth and
income, and high unemployment. On the one hand,
a highly productive capital-intensive mining sector
generates GDP growth but creates fewer jobs; on
the other hand, most of the population particularly
those in the north, depend on subsistence
agriculture.

Namibia’s official unemployment rate was at 27.4 percent at end-2012. In addition, GDP per capita and scores on
UN Human Development Indicators are also weaker than its peers’ median (small middle income countries).

also lost ground on its rankings in the Global Competitiveness Index of 2012/13—Namibia
ranked 92nd out of 144, lower than the ranking of 83rd, it achieved in 2011/12 in part due to its
educational outcomes.2
3.
Securing sustained higher growth, creating jobs and reducing inequality are the
government’s key policy priorities. In this context, with the government pushing a “Growth at
Home” strategy, the 4th National Development Plan (NDP 4) identified the following economic
sectors as priorities: (i) logistics, (ii) tourism, (iii) manufacturing, and (iv) agriculture. The 10-year
Namibia Financial Sector Strategy (NFSS) launched in 2012 serves as the blue print to enhance
financial inclusion.
4.
Political economy context: Many analysts expect the 2014 presidential elections to be
smooth. The candidate from the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), the party in
power since independence, was selected in November 2012 through an internal democratic process.

B. Current Conditions
5.
Although the Namibian economy bounced back strongly from the 2008—09 global
financial crisis, since then growth has continued to soften—reflecting a combination of weak
net external demand and solid contribution from domestic demand (Figure 1).


Output growth slowed from about 5¾ percent in 2011 to 5 percent in 2012. This moderation
reflected a combination of decelerating net external demand partly offset by a solid contribution
from domestic demand. From the expenditure side of GDP, domestic demand was relatively
strong in 2012, with private consumption and investment growing by about 4.5 and 1.1 percent
respectively in real terms, while net external demand declined by 0.6 percent.



Preliminary official data suggest the moderation in growth continued in the first half of 2013,
reflecting weak global demand for exports, which more than offset the solid growth in the
nonmineral sector most notably in retail trade.3 The impact of severe drought to some extent
weakened economic activity in the agriculture sector.

6.
Favorable credit conditions supported domestic demand growth (Figure 1). As
elsewhere, interest rates and by extension costs of borrowing in Namibia are at historically low levels.
Credit extension to households grew by 14 and 13 percent in 2012 and in the first half 2013, and
household indebtedness remained elevated at 84.7 percent as of June 2013. Corporate debt levels

2

These indicators should be interpreted with caution due to a limited number of respondents, a limited geographical
coverage, and standardized assumptions on business constraints and information availability.
3

It is worth noting, however, that the quarterly production side GDP data for Namibia is not comprehensive, and is
based on a sample of sectoral performance that is not usually a perfect predictor of the annual GDP outturn.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NAMIBIA

also grew about 18 percent as of June 2013, reflecting the increase in new foreign borrowing and a
weaker exchange rate, albeit from a relatively low base compared to household debt.4
7.
Notwithstanding the fiscal over performance in FY2012/13, the underlying FY2013/14
budget measures on the whole aimed to spur domestic demand. The fiscal outturn in FY2012/13
was significantly better than expected, the overall deficit was 0.3 percent compared to 3.9 percent
projected in the original budget. This is mainly due to savings in capital spending driven by under
execution of the government’s Targeted Intervention Program for Employment and Economic
Growth (TIPEEG)5, and stronger-than-expected revenue performance (including receipts from the
Southern Africa Customs Union (SACU) ). However, the fiscal stance in FY2013/14 is expansionary
(Table 2b) and the budget announced measures to boost private consumption in the form of
reduction in individual income tax rates and changes in the thresholds. The gradual alignment of
corporate tax rates also aims to spur domestic private investment.
8.
Reflecting the fiscal withdrawal in 2012/13, the current account deficit narrowed in
2012 (Figure 1). The current account deficit

The rise in corporate foreign borrowing reflects the increased in short-term loans by resident banks and long term
loans acquired by companies mainly in the mining and to a lesser extent the fishing sectors particularly in the first
quarter of 2013.
5

The Targeted Intervention Program for Employment and Economic Growth (TIPEEG), launched in FY2011/12 and
extends to FY2013/14 with a target to create 104,000 direct and indirect jobs between 2011 and 2014.
6

Namibia’s net portfolio investment has been traditionally negative (except in 2011 when Namibia issued a
Eurobond), with most of the activity taking place on the balance sheets of resident non-banks who tend to add to
their portfolio investments abroad and are allowed to invest 70 percent of their assets abroad. With this background,
2012 was arguably a good year because the net portfolio balance was less negative than in earlier years (except in
2011) in both dollar terms and percent of GDP.

C. Outlook and Risks
10.

Outlook

Output: Staff projects that real GDP will grow by 4.3 percent in 2013 with strong nonmineral GDP
growth and an anemic mining sector (Table 3). Growth is expected to pick up slightly to 4.5 percent
by 2016 supported by the strong construction sector owing to a planned public housing program
and recovery in the mining sector through the full-capacity production of the Husab uranium mine.
External position: The current account deficit is expected to widen in the next two years before
narrowing in 2016. The widening is mainly due to the FDI funded construction imports related to the
Husab uranium mining project. The deficit is expected to narrow starting from 2016, supported by
the public sector savings generated by the planned fiscal consolidation, recovery in diamond
demand, and the phasing down of the construction stage of the Husab uranium mine.
11.

Risks

There are significant downside risks to the near-term outlook, both from global spillovers and
domestic developments. The main near-term risks to output relate to the uncertain external
environment, protracted economic and financial volatility especially for emerging markets, as well as
lower than anticipated growth in emerging markets, which could constrain export demand (see
staff’s risk assessment matrix (RAM). A global oil shock would also affect Namibia’s terms of trade,
worsen the current account and ultimately economic activity as Namibia is a net oil importer. Policy
uncertainty in South Africa can also affect Namibia through the monetary exchange rate peg link. In
addition, a delay in finalizing negotiations of the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the
European Union could pose additional risks to nonmineral exports, such as beef, grape, and fish
products (Appendix III).

There are some medium-term fiscal and external risks both through a protracted low global growth
and the uncertainties surrounding future SACU revenues.7 A protracted period of slower European
growth could generate negative spillovers through trade linkages as a large share of Namibia’s total
exports—mainly diamonds, uranium, beef, unrefined copper and fish—are destined for Europe.
Namibia’s growth prospects are further clouded by the challenges posed by high levels of
unemployment, poverty and inequality. These challenges require the need to create stronger
engines of more inclusive growth.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The authorities largely agreed with the staff’s assessment of recent economic developments, outlook,
and prospects but emphasized that Namibia’s growth remains above the world average. They
acknowledged the need to pursue a “growth-friendly” fiscal consolidation plan and contain the size of
wage bill in a manner that gives priority to job creation and reduce inequality. This year’s consultation
focused on four main themes: (i) responding to inward spillovers from the current global downturn and
policy uncertainty in South Africa; (ii) rebuilding fiscal policy buffers: prudent fiscal and wage policies
to strengthen external sustainability and reduce unemployment; (iii) promoting financial inclusion and
stability; and (iv) reinvigorating growth and enhancing export diversification.

A. Policy Theme 1: Near-Term Macroeconomic Policies and Global
Spillovers
12.

Near-term macroeconomic policy stance



Fiscal policy: In staff’s view, given the exchange rate peg, the FY2013/14 budget did not
sufficiently build on the gains made in improving the underlying fiscal position in FY 2012/13.
Staff reiterated the need to unwind the TIPEEG in FY 2013/14 as originally planned, which will
pave the way for returning to fiscal prudence. Staff welcomed the emphasis in the FY2013/14
budget to strengthen public financial management and rationalize loss-making state-owned
enterprises (SOE) and reduce their perpectual dependency on the public finances. These efforts
should pave the way for a smooth transition to a comprehensive medium-term fiscal
consolidation strategy.



The authorities broadly concurred with staff on the need to rein in current spending. They
emphasized their efforts in improving the efficiency of public spending through the
strengthening of public financial management and the other active reform agenda outlined in
the FY 2013/14 budget. On TIPEEG, the authorities explained that it represents a repackaging of
existing projects under the line ministries’ pipeline, instead of a newly-designed public

employment program. These projects will likely proceed after the TIPEEG program ends.8 The
Ministry of Finance (MoF) and the SOE Governing Council are conducting a joint study, that they
consider as high priority, to assess compliance of SOEs with the SOE Act’s requirements which
should pave the way to reduce their dependency on the budget.
13.

Managing global spillovers



Namibia is highly exposed to global risks mainly through trade channels (Appendix II).
Trade linkages are important as they affect export receipts that determine sustainable levels of
imports and fiscal spending. Discussion with various agencies suggest that while economic
spillovers from South Africa warrant close monitoring, the direct spillovers would likely not be
that large, in part because most of Namibia’s export go to other major trading partners
including Europe and the United States. External vulnerabilities remain contained, but would
benefit from additional reserve coverage to provide further support to the peg.



If further adverse temporary global spillovers beyond the staff’s baseline scenario lead to
a decline in export commodity prices and a significant loss of revenues, staff advised the
authorities to allow the automatic stabilizers to work on the revenue side.9 This implies that
the government should refrain from taking tax measures to compensate for the associated loss
in mineral revenues or reducing expenditures to meet the government’s budget deficit target.
Although this will delay the medium term consolidation path envisaged under the FY2013/14
budget, in staff’s view, it should not undermine medium-term fiscal or debt sustainability given
the temporary nature of the shock (Table 1 and debt sustainability annex).10



The authorities noted the staff’s view about the potential global spillovers to Namibia,
including developments in South Africa that warrant close monitoring. They reiterated that
Namibia’s exports destinations are relatively diversified. Additionaly, the funding base of banks
is largely domestic, and post 2015, mineral exports are expected to increase upon the
completion of the new Swakop Uranium mine, which is expected to become the second largest
uranium mine in the world. The authorities do not expect major effects on Namibia’s mining
sector from large demonstration for wage increases in South Africa’s mines, as Namibia’s
industrial relations tend to be less confrontational. However, there would be significant impact
on business and economic activity if the recurring labor strikes were to disrupt the supply of
goods from South Africa to Namibia. On vulnerabilities, they noted that Namibia has gained
fiscal space given the achievement of a balanced budget in FY2012/13 and the relatively low
debt level.

8

The authorities expect that some of these projects would be financed by public private partnerships (PPP) going
forward.
9

Namibia does not have automatic stabilizers on the expenditure side.

10

Namibia’s debt ratio has been historically low and is expected to remain within the authorities’ announced target
of 35 percent of GDP over the medium term (see the DSA annex which uses the Fund’s new template for market
access countries).

Staff recommends that the authorities articulate a “growth-friendly” medium term fiscal
consolidation strategy. This should aim to rein in current spending (wages and transfers and
subsidies to SOEs) while preserving productive capital and infrastructure spending in a low
growth environment. Staff advises the government to aim to achieve a broadly balanced fiscal
position by 2015/16 mainly through reducing current spending to help rebuild reserves to an
adequate level combined with measures to reduce tax expenditures. Given the fixed exchange
rate regime and the fact that Namibia remains susceptible to global shocks and outward
spillovers amplified by an open capital account and lower buffers, beyond stabilizing the debt
level, Namibia needs to rebuild its reserves buffer. The gap between Namibia‘s reserves holdings
and its adequate level is expected to widen in the future, with unchanged policies. Therefore, a
more ambitious fiscal effort beyond the authorities‘ MTEF would be advisable, through a
balanced budget by FY2015/16.11



The authorities broadly concurred with staff on the need to rein in the current spending
and to improve the quality of public spending, while supporting development needs. They
affirmed their medium-term fiscal consolidation efforts and noted that government transfers to
SOEs include funding for infrastructure projects, which should be viewed favorably from a
broader national development perspective. As parts of effort to strengthen public financial
management, the authorities explained their plan to improve the tender system by creating a

plan to introduce changes in the mode of appointment of Tender Board members and the

The contribution of revenue mobilization to fiscal consolidation



In staff’s view, broadening the tax base should be an integral pillar of a balanced
medium-term fiscal consolidation process. Staff recommends the rebalancing of
revenue-raising and expenditure-cutting measures by complementing the measures in the
budget with policies that increase the domestic tax base. Staff also recommends integrating tax
expenditure quantifications (forgone tax revenues arising from granting tax incentives) into the
budget process.



The authorities concurred that expenditure restraint will be supported by efforts to
broaden the revenue base and improve revenue administration. They noted the significant
progress in building the capacity of the Large Taxpayer Unit (LTU) and the plan to establish an
autonomous revenue agency in the next three to four years, which would modernize revenue
collection and improve domestic revenue generation. The authorities also noted that the
effective tax rates on the mining sector are quite high. The revenue office has also resorted to
active third party collection for outstanding tax arrears. A good standing certificate is still a
requirement for tender purposes. A tax arrears project has also been constituted under the
project office, focusing on collection of the 800 highest tax debt cases.

The authorities questioned the staff’s
approach of looking at the impact of fiscal
policy on labor market outcomes, and
highlighted the challenges they face in
dealing with wages and public employment in an environment of relatively high unemployment.
On the wage bill, they questioned the notion of a wage premium in government wages over
those of the private sector, however conceded that if such a premium were to exist, it would be
largely concentrated at the lower end of the wage ladder, while the middle and senior civil
servants earn relatively lower wages compared with their private sector and SOEs peers. They
noted that efforts by the government in the past to outsource the work by low-skilled civil
servants have not been generally successful. The authorities emphasized their medium-term
fiscal consolidation efforts such as the plans by the department of public servants management
located at the Prime Minister’s office to link civil servants’ pay with performance (Table 1).
Beyond this, they had to allow an increase in employment in the education and health sectors
which are priority sectors in their national development strategy.

Greater Financial Inclusion



Financial sector
Financial indicators. Namibia’s banking system is profitable
and well-capitalized with relatively low nonperforming loans
(Table 8). However, potential sources of vulnerability to
financial stability exist through the large concentration of the
loan book in mortgages and the short-term maturity of
deposits in the banking system. The nonbanking sector has
grown significantly in recent years and its asset size is now
about 140 percent of GDP.
Household indebtedness. Available data published by the
Bank of Namibia (BoN) suggests household debt to
disposable income remains elevated at just above 80 percent.
Households (some of which include public sector employees),
also now take unsecured loans (with direct deduction of the
payments from their wages), albeit from a low base, to finance
both consumption and in some cases investment spending.
There is also a concern that a return to high interest rates
from the current historical low rates could adversely affect
households’ ability to repay their mortgages.

Balancing financial inclusion and financial stability.
The 2011–21 Namibia Financial Sector Strategy is sound and
strikes an appropriate balance between financial inclusion and
stability. Staff welcomes the recently launched pro-poor
financial product, such as basic bank account with low or no
fees. One major concern, however, is that an increase in
financial access without sufficient safeguards, could
potentially undermine financial stability. Staff’s analysis using
bank-level data for MICs in the region that was presented to
the authorities, suggests that increasing financial access
through encouraging household savings accounts and
improving small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) access
to financing enhances financial stability. In contrast, on the
lending side, increasing household borrowing can pose
potential risks to financial stability.14

Staff commends the authorities for taking measures to bolster the surveillance system
for monitoring financial sector risk. These include the following:


Macroprudential tools: Staff supports the BoN’s plans to use macroprudential measures
including the loan-to-value ratio to address increasing credit risk from household lending and
commends its high quality financial stability reports. While at this stage, household
indebtedness does not pose imminent risks to macroeconomic and financial stability, in the
absence of macroprudential and other measures to contain such risks, it could eventually give
rise to systemic effects that would require macroeconomic adjustments.



National credit bureaus: Staff also commends BoN’s ongoing work to introduce regulations for
credit bureaus by end-2013. Thus, over time, screening of borrowers will improve.



Enhancing financial literacy and consumer education on household borrowing: Staff
welcomes the consumer Financial Literacy Initiative (FLI) in the NFSS, which serves as a national
platform for financial education of the general population.



Close monitoring of developments in the property market: Staff also welcomes ongoing work
by the BoN to strengthen its monitoring of the property market. The government plans to
consider public private partnerships (PPP) as a vehicle to help municipalities service land and
thereby ease the restrictions on availability of serviced land, which could moderate property
price increases.

19.
Further measures to strengthen their surveillance framework and minimize the
vulnerabilities in the financial sector include the following:


A study of households’ balance sheets: Staff sees merit in carrying out a comprehensive
assessment of households’ borrowing, disposable income, and investment activities and
monitoring them on a regular basis. Staff also believes that close cooperation between the BoN,
Namibia Statistical Agency (NSA) and the nonbank regulatory agency (NAMFISA) should help
facilitate the compilation of such statistics.



Judicious use of pro-poor products for enhancing financial inclusion: Staff advocates for
promoting stability friendly financial inclusion through savings-oriented instead of excessive
consumption-oriented financial inclusion. Such measures could include reducing financing
constraints for SMEs engaged in productive projects (including through the SME Bank that was
licensed in December 2012) and helping poor households cope with external shocks through
breaking up liquidity constraints. These measures should also avoid excessive build-up of
household debt that will only lead to debt-distressed households and thus undermine the
authorities’ broader development agenda on enhancing more inclusive growth.



Reducing the maturity mismatch in the banking system: Historically, these deposits have
been broadly stable, as most of them represent nonbank financial corporations’ liabilities on
account of contractual savings from pension and life insurance policies. This said, staff

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NAMIBIA

recommends that the authorities take measures to encourage banks to reduce the maturity
mismatch on a gradual basis such as those envisaged in Basel III.


While Namibia has taken some steps towards improving its AML/CFT regime, staff
encourages the authorities to take further measures in line with the agreed action plan with
FATF, as part of their ongoing efforts to strengthen financial stability.

20.
The authorities broadly concurred with the assessment and emphasis on efforts to
closely monitor the pace of household borrowing including borrowing within and outside the
banking system. The BoN continues to closely monitoring trends in the property market,
household lending and risks to financial stability as regularly published in their Financial Stability
Report (FSR). The BoN and NAMFISA are also preparing regulations governing credit bureaus. In
addition, with NAMFISA, the government has gone through an exercise to overhaul and modernize
the regulatory regime governing the nonbank financial sector. Beyond these efforts, regular
meetings are held between the Chief Executive Officer of NAMFISA, the Minister of Finance and the
Governor as well as the meeting of the Financial Stability Committee to discuss cross-cutting issues
for the financial sector.

D. Policy Theme 4: Reinvigorating Growth, Enhancing Inclusion and
Promoting Economic Diversification
21.

Enhancing growth and export diversification



Namibia’s positive growth record over the years has delivered good economic outcomes.
However, based on an analysis conducted by staff (SM/13/22), growth has also become less
inclusive in recent years. Staff and the authorities agree that going forward Namibia’s growth
would have to rely less on fiscal stimulus and more on efficiency and innovation driven growth,
underpinned by private sector development to boost economy-wide productivity.



Boosting potential growth would require a set of reform-oriented, innovative policies to
reinvigorate total factor productivity.15 These

require supportive measures to liberalize the
service sectors, reduce the domestic regulatory burden for firms and improve the processs for
approving work permits for high-skilled labor.



The coverage of Namibia’s social protection programs has increased significantly since
2001; however, the effectiveness of the social protection schemes has fallen short of
expectations. While some of the social protection programs such as social pension and
disability grants have played a poverty-reduction role, the poverty impact of some other
programs has been less than hoped for. The sharp increase in the number of recipients, in
particular in response to HIV/AIDS pandemic, reflect aggressive government outreach
throughout the country, especially in the north-central region. Namibia could achieve much
better success in reducing poverty if it targeted the poor directly.16 Therefore, enhancing the
efficiency and sustainability of the social safety nets would require simplifying the existing
schemes to remove overlaps and making them more targeted which is in line with the
government’s current policy intentions.



The authorities are aware of the economy’s long-term structural challenges. NDP4
emphasized the government’s intention to reinvigorate reforms and lay the foundations for
greater private sector development in Namibia. They noted their on-going re-assessment of the
Export Processing Zones (EPZ) policies given their limited economic impact to date, while
focusing on targeted programs that would leverage on the value chains of businesses (either
manufacturing or the provision of international trade services). Their current strategy involves
developing commodity-based value chains to enhance growth and economic diversification.
This strategy (“Growth at Home”) also involves a comprehensive review that aims to improve the
investment climate, the ease of doing business, support SMEs and pursue deeper economic
integration.

Namibia has made considerable progress towards achieving universal primary education, but continues to battle
with high repetition and drop-out rates, and low attendance and survival rates in primary education.

E. Other Surveillance Issues
22.
Data quality is broadly adequate for surverillance, although there is room for
improvement. Staff welcomes the steady progress being made by the Namibia Statistical Agency
(NSA) and commends the recent rebasing of the country’s consumer price statistics. Staff also
commends the NSA for its good work on strengthening the quality of labor market statistics for
Namibia. Such efforts would also help the government to monitor the impact and progress made
from its ongoing policies for reducing the unemployment rate. That said, challenges remain in
ensuring consistency between the quarterly and annual data for GDP and the compilation of
expenditure side of the national accounts. Staff supports the authorities’ request for further Fund
support in the areas of capacity building, including through technical assistance. Finally, in line with
some of its upper-middle income country peers, staff urges the Namibian authorities to work
toward a medium-term goal of subscribing to the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard.

STAFF APPRAISAL
23.
Namibia has made impressive strides in economic development since gaining
independence in 1990. The positive growth record in recent years has raised overall incomes and
delivered good economic outcomes.
24.
However, the solid growth has not led to sufficient job creation and lower inequality.
The government remains the largest employer in the economy and TIPEEG is yet to put a significant
dent on the high level of structural unemployment.
25.
The 4th National Development Plan (NDP4) serves as the authorities’ blueprint for
structural transformation. Staff welcomes a tightly focused NPD4 that emphasizes returning to
high and sustained growth, reducing income inequality and enhancing job creation through reforms
that lay the foundation for greater private sector development.
26.
The period ahead will require a delicate balancing act in the implementation of
macroeconomic policies because of global spillovers and domestic policy developments. The
uncertain global environment especially for emerging markets and a possible delay in finalizing
negotiations of the EPA with the EU are key risks. In a more adverse global scenario than
anticipated, the authorities should allow the automatic stabilizers to work on the revenue side and
avoid discretionary fiscal measures to support domestic demand.
27.
Staff recommends that the government pursue a “growth-friendly” medium-term
fiscal consolidation strategy. This should aim to rein in current spending (wages and transfers and
subsidies to SOEs) while preserving growth-promoting capital. Staff welcomes plans by the
department of public servants management to link civil servants’ pay with performance. Staff also
commends the measures being put in place by the government to improve domestic revenue
generation which bodes well for a balanced fiscal consolidation. Staff advocates for a broadly
balanced fiscal position by FY2015/16 to help rebuild the fiscal and reserve buffers.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

NAMIBIA

28.
Staff commends the sense of urgency shown by the government to address the state
of finances of the State-owned enterprises (SOEs). Speedy implementation of SOE performance
agreements is needed to put them on a financially viable footing.
29.
The government’s emphasis on enhancing greater financial inclusion through its
financial sector strategy, while preserving the stability of the financial system, is appropriate.
While the level of household indebtedness has stabilized, it remains elevated. In staff’s view, this in
itself does not pose imminent risk to macroeconomic and financial stability. Staff commends the
authorities for the initiatives taken to strengthen their surveillance of the financial sector.
30.
Achieving sustainable growth would require a set of reform-oriented innovative
policies to reinvigorate productivity growth. These include increasing the quality of public
spending, improving the business environment, implementing supportive measures to liberalize the
service sectors, reducing the domestic regulatory burden on firms and the skill mismatch in the
labor market. Staff commends the authorities’ efforts to strengthen public financial management
including bringing Namibia’s procurement system in line with international standards.
31.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Namibia take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Sources: Country authorities and Fund staff estimates and projections.
1/ "Overall balance" includes externally financed project spending (except for roads) that is not channeled through the state account.
2/ The improvement in the overall balance in 2014/15 is due to higher-then-projected SACU revenue, which at the time of this report is still yet to be approved by the Council of Ministers.
Without this windfall the deficit would have been 4.1 percent of GDP.
Note: Staff's fiscal numbers may differ from the authorities' numbers due to the difference in classification. Staff records “Return of capital from lending and equity
participation” as a net lending, while authorities record it as non-tax revenue. Also, staff adds to the expenditure the loans borrowed outside the budget for specific projects.

Overall balance 1/ 2/
Overall balance excluding grants
Overall balance excluding cyclical component of SACU revenue
Primary balance

Sources: Country authorities and Fund staff estimates and projections.
1/ "Overall balance" includes externally financed project spending (except for roads) that is not channeled through the state account.
2/ The improvement in the overall balance in 2014/15 is due to higher-then-projected SACU revenue, which at the time of this report is still yet to be approved by the Council of Ministers.
Without this windfall the deficit would have been 4.1 percent of GDP.
Note: Staff's fiscal numbers may differ from the authorities' numbers due to the difference in classification. Staff records “Return of capital from lending and equity participation” as a net
lending, while authorities record it as non-tax revenue. Also, staff adds to the expenditure the loans borrowed outside the budget for specific projects.

Appendix I. External Stability and Exchange Rate Assessment1
1.
Context: Namibia’s external position remains broadly sound. The Namibian dollar has
depreciated in real terms in line with the South African rand since mid-2011 (Figure 1). Namibia’s
imports come to a large extent from South Africa The real effective depreciation of the Namibian
dollar has helped with competitiveness and reduced external vulnerabilities,2 while the FDI-funded
development of the Swakop uranium mine would temporarily tend to increase the current account
deficit, a process that has arguably started this year.
2.
As in South Africa and many other sub-Saharan African economies, the Namibian
current account balance worsened after the global financial crisis. From consistent surpluses
that peaked in 2006, its current account turned into a moderate deficit expected to reach
5.5 percent of GDP in 2013. An analysis of the components shows that the deterioration clearly
reflects an increase in imports in percent of GDP, while current account revenue (including exports
and SACU transfers) declined to its 2001–04 average from its high level on the eve of the global
financial crisis. A saving-investment decomposition suggests the main driver in the decline after the
global crisis has been a reduction in the national saving rate, both in the private and public sectors
with the latter reflecting the ongoing expansionary fiscal stance.

Other indicators for competitiveness appear to broadly support this point such as wage-based proxies and recent
trends in export performance (including export market shares). Although data availability prevents a proper analysis
of the competitiveness based on Namibia’s unit labor cost REER, the sparse wage data suggests that Namibian wages
have increased significantly less than currency depreciation. Nevertheless, Namibia needs to pay close attention to
wage developments, especially in the public sector, which could unduly influence those in the private sector, eroding
external competitiveness.

3.
Competitiveness indicators for Namibia give mixed results. On the one hand, Namibia’s
dollar has depreciated in real effective terms in line with the South Africa rand becoming more
undervalued than its long-run average and levels predicted from empirical time series models, as
computed by the CGER exercise. On the other hand, Namibia’s current account balance is more
negative than those that would be predicted by panel estimates from macroeconomic
developments or that would stabilize the large and positive net external position.

Current Account Balance

4.
Indicators based on the current account suggest mild overvaluation. The macrobalance
approach suggests that by mid-2013 the Namibian dollar would need to depreciate by 2.6 percent
to take the current account level to its norm. The macroeconomic balance approach calculates the
difference between the current account balance projected over the medium term at prevailing
exchange rates, and a reference current account balance estimated with Namibian variables and
parameters from a panel regression for emerging and developing economies. In turn, the external
sustainability approach suggests the Namibian dollar would need to depreciate by 9.4 percent to
stabilize Namibia’s net open position at about 20 percent of GDP.

5.
Nevertheless, reduced form equilibrium real exchange rate analysis suggests a mild
undervaluation. Namibia’s real exchange rate, as computed by the IMF’s Information Notice
System database, has been more appreciated than its 15-year moving average since October 2012.
By July 2013, the degree of undervaluation measured this way was 10 percent. The real exchange
rate is also undervalued, but to a lower degree, with respect to the level predicted by a panel
regression based on macroeconomic fundamentals.
6.
Taken together, overall the analysis suggests a slight overvaluation of the Namibian
dollar from a medium-term perspective. Its current level would seem to help contain offsetting
pressures for a wider current account deficit and the expansionary fiscal stance.
7.
Moreover, non-price or qualitative indicators of competitiveness suggest Namibia
performs well relative to its peers. Namibia has better institutions, more developed financial
markets, and labor market efficiency than other middle-income countries. However, the country lags
behind peer countries in health and primary education. These indicators suggest that overall
Namibia needs to prioritize investment in health and primary education and diversify its export base
and further expand its markets.

Appendix II. Managing Inward Global Spillovers1
1.
Context: Namibia is highly exposed to global risks as a resource intensive and highly
open economy. The linkages have been documented in earlier consultations and previous and
ongoing research (Canales Kriljenko, Gwenhamo, and Thomas, 2013; IMF, 2012; and Basdesvant and
others, forthcoming). Global developments that affect world growth and financial conditions filter
into real developments in Namibia, although domestic policies (especially fiscal) and domestic
shocks have a significant impact on the final outcome. More than half of Namibia’s exports—mainly
diamonds, uranium ore, beef, unrefined copper, and fish—are destined for Europe, the United States,
and Japan. Although coming from a low base, China and India are also becoming important trading
partners.
2.
Global financial conditions affect Namibia mainly through the monetary link to South
Africa. Although Namibia is not an emerging market, its monetary conditions respond to global
financial developments as if it were. The link is through the peg of the Namibian dollar to the South
African rand, one of the most financially integrated emerging-markets. The widespread operation of
South African financial firms in the country plays a supporting role. More recently, a reassessment of
risk in South Africa has also spilled over to the real value of the Namibian dollar.
3.
South Africa has strong ties with other countries in the region, including its partners
in the Southern African Customs Union (SACU)—Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, and Swaziland
(BLNS). Thus, it is reasonable to expect that South Africa’s business cycle and its long-term growth
rate will affect its neighbors. While there are multiple linkages (trade, investment, financial,
institutional) that appear plausible, formal econometric analysis has found their net spillover impact
to be statistically insignificant. This reflects that Namibia’s trade linkage with South Africa is mainly
on the import side. South Africa appears to channel global economy shocks to the regional economy,
rather than directly affecting countries in the region.2 Overall, a possible explanation is that the
multiple spillover channels operate in ways that offset each other, so their net impact is relatively
small.3 Thus, once global developments and domestic policies are considered, South Africa does not
seem to contribute much to the Namibian growth.
4.
Consistent with this evidence, the ongoing global slowdown has spilled over into
Namibia, although their effect remains contained. High frequency indicators based on a limited
sample suggest the economy decelerated sharply in the second quarter through the indirect effect of
lower export demand from trading partners and falling commodity prices, especially uranium. The
worse terms of trade deterioration has tended to widen the current account deficit. The currency

A bulk of Namibia’s exports goes to countries other than South Africa. See also Canales Kriljenko, Gwenhamo, and
Thomas, 2013, IMF Working Paper, WP/13/31 (Washington: International Monetary Fund).
3

This explanation is based on ongoing work by staff in the IMF African Department’s Southern II Division
(Olivier Basdevant, Andrew Jonelis, Borislava Mircheva, Slavi Slavov) on the impact of the growth slowdown in South
Africa on Namibia and other SACU members.

depreciation would tend to encourage exports and discourage imports at the margin, which would
help contain the impact on the current account.
5.
The global outlook remains broadly
favorable although not as much as earlier envisaged
and subject to downside risks. Fund staff has
identified an array of global risks that could adversely
affect developments in Namibia (see risk assessment
matrix). A further slowdown in advanced economies and
emerging markets would likely spill over to Namibia
through trade linkages. This would tend to lower growth
prospects, lead to a decline in commodity prices, widen
the current account deficit, and put pressure on fiscal
finances. Global developments can also filter into
Namibia on the financial side, albeit indirectly through
South Africa.

6.
Staff simulations (using both country-specific VAR and the Fund’s GIMF) suggest that
global spillovers to Namibia would be limited and short-lived in adverse scenarios beyond the
baseline. The adverse scenarios are based on a selected set of external risks in the Risk Assessment
Matrix. Namibia’s output growth would be lower by 1–1½ percentage points than the baseline, and
the impact would dissipate in about one year. The transmission works mainly through the trade
channel as lower global demand for diamonds results in a decline in Namibia’s diamond exports. The
resulting limited and transitory spillover impact reflects the storable nature of diamonds that allows
adjustment of inventories, and also stems from the transitory impact of the initial shocks on the
global economy. Thus, external vulnerabilities remain broadly contained, but would benefit from
additional reserve coverage to provide further support for the exchange rate peg.4
7.
In light of the assessment that global spillovers to Namibia would be limited and
short-lived, staff believes that in the event of such an adverse scenario beyond the baseline, an
appropriate response would be to let the automatic stabilizers work on the revenue side.
Namibia does not have automatic stabilizers on the expenditure side. Pursuing more active
discretionary fiscal stimulus measures would not be recommended owing to the need to rebuild the
fiscal policy buffers and the likelihood that the effect of fiscal expansion would leak abroad through
imports in a highly open economy like Namibia.

4

This is based on staff’s detailed assessment of reserve adequacy early this year which used multiple methodologies
for assessing the optimal level of reserves for all the seven small middle-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa
(SM/13/22).

Appendix III. Namibia’s Negotiations for an Economic
Partnership Agreement1
1.
Context: For more than a decade, the European Union (EU) has been negotiating trade
agreements known as Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) with the Africa, the Caribbean, and
the Pacific Group of States (ACP). The EU and ACP are committed to signing EPAs between the EU
and regional groups of ACP countries, rather than bilaterally. Namibia is negotiating as part of the
“SADC” group.2
2.
The benefit of an EPA for Namibia: The European Union has historically been the biggest
buyer of Namibia’s exports. Fish, meat, and grapes generally account for 20–30 percent of the EU’s
imports from Namibia, but are where most market access would be lost if an EPA was not signed.
3.
Recent status of the negotiation: The EU signed interim EPAs with Botswana, Lesotho,
Mozambique, and Swaziland in 2009. The agreement has not been ratified yet. Namibia initiated the
interim EPA but did not sign in 2009 and continues to seek changes to its provisions. As part of the
negotiations Namibia was accorded duty free access, but if the EPA negotiations were to fail
Namibian firms will lose preferential access to the EU and face MFN tariffs.
4.
The negotiation issues: The EU and Namibia have resolved most negotiating issues.
However, two major issues remain unresolved: (i) Policy space, namely the use of export taxes, infantindustry protection, and other trade restrictions that are central elements of Namibia’s industrial
policy; (ii) Rules of origin for fish: EU trade agreements use territorial waters (within 12 miles of land)
as a criterion for determining the country of origin for fish imports. Namibia is seeking derogation
for fish (especially tuna) caught within the 200-mile exclusive economic zone. Outstanding
differences on safeguard measures applied to agricultural trade also remain, along with rules of
origin for goods made with raw materials imported from outside the SADC EPA group, geographical
indications, and trade-related issues (competition policy, government procurement, investment).
Potential economic impact: Using trade data for 2006 and comparing tariff rates faced in the EU
market by Namibia and its competitors, the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) estimated that
Namibian export revenue from fish, meat, and grapes would be reduced by €45.15 million a year.3
Namibia’s meat industry would likely be hurt the worst. Namibia would not be competitive with
South America, Australia, and New Zealand at most-favored nation (MFN) rates. The EU imposes
MFN tariffs of 7.5–22 percent on fish, with rates varying according to species and type of processing.
Namibia presently has a slight preference margin over most competitors, including South Africa.
Grape exports will also suffer, but perhaps not to the same extent.

SADC includes five SACU members plus Angola and Mozambique. It should be noted that most SADC members are
negotiating EPAs as part of other groupings.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. The
authorities provide core monthly data to the Fund with a lag of one to two months, except for the
national accounts and international trade data, which are reported quarterly and annually with
longer lags. The authorities completed the 2009/10 National Household Income and Expenditure
Survey (HIES) which allowed the re-estimated of the Gini coefficients. The Namibia Statistics Agency
(NSA) was recently transformed into a fully autonomous agency in order to enhance the
government’s capacity to collect and compile high quality statistics.
National Accounts: National accounts estimation has not kept pace with changes to the structure
of the economy. The authorities are in progress of rebasing the outdated national accounts base
year (currently 2004). Seasonally adjusted quarterly national accounts (QNA) estimate, at 2004
constant prices are disseminated on the NSA’s website, though there is a need to improve the
existing source data. Plans by NSA to produce current price QNA are progressing well. The NSA is
also assessing the integration of VAT data in the national accounts compilation framework. The
National Accounts are produced bi-annually and is revised for the latest three years. Major revisions
for back years such as correcting of errors and altering the economic structure to reflect current
economic situations is filtered in but at longer intervals.
Price Statistics: The NSA recently published the rebased consumer price index. This index provides
a better presentation of the spending patterns of the citizens and their experience of inflation. The
new CPI weights, introduced in the December 2012 index, are derived primarily from the Namibia
Statistics Agency’s 2009/10 Household Income and Expenditure Survey. Data on the labor market,
including labor force, employment, and wages are not regularly collected, which impedes the
analysis of labor market development. The authorities are now carrying out regular annual labor
force surveys.
Government Finance Statistics: Annual budgetary central government data by fiscal year; which
are reported on a cash basis in the GFSM 2001 format, are reasonably complete, despite some gaps
in term of details. No fiscal statistics are compiled for extra budgetary institutions, consolidated
central government, or consolidated general government.
Monetary and Finance Statistics: Monthly monetary statistics for the Bank of Namibia (BoN) and
the other depository corporations (ODCs) are reported on a regular basis, although there is room to
improve the timeliness of reporting, particularly with regard to BoN data. Beginning in April 2002,
data are based on standardized report forms, which accord with the concepts and definition of the
Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual.

Balance of Payment and International Investment Position Statistics and External Debt: Since
2001, the BoN has been reporting the balance of payments data on a quarterly basis with a lag of
one quarter. Those data are subject to substantial revisions. The methodology underlying the
balance of payments is consistent with the fifth edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payment Manual.
There is room to improve the compilation of the BOP statistics most notably on the large errors and
omissions. The international investment position (IIP) data are compiled quarterly with a lag of one
quarter. The BoN has focused its work to improve the compilation of capital and financial
transaction and IIP statistics. However, further work is needed to expand the coverage of the IIP and
restate the IIP in a format that will allow for comparison with the balance of payments statistics.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Namibia has participated in the GDDS since late 2002. A ROSC (Data Module) was published in 2002
and updated in 2005.
III. Reporting to STA
The MOF reports on a regular basis annual data for publication in the Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook. Work on establishing monthly reporting of high frequency data is still in progress.
The BoN report monetary and financial statistics to STA regularly. Balance of payments and
international investment position data are published in International Financial Statistics (IFS) and in
the Balance of Payments Yearbook.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITYANALYSIS

and Ranil Salgado

Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2013
consultation with Namibia

NAMIBIA

MEDIUM TERM PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
Namibia’s public debt remains low, although it has risen significantly since the global financial crisis
in 2008–09. Although extremely low by international standards, the central government debt
roughly doubled in nominal terms since the crisis, rising from 16 percent of GDP in 2009 to an
estimated 29 percent of GDP by 2013.
The composition of public debt bears little exchange rate risk as most of the Namibian public debt is
denominated in domestic currency or in South African rand, to which the Namibian dollar is pegged.
In particular, about 70 percent of public debt takes the form of government bills and bonds, which
has helped with the government’s objective of developing the domestic capital market. Treasury
bonds (known as internal registered stock or government bonds) maturing between 2014 and
2030 currently make up 53 percent of the government’s domestic debt. Treasury bills make up the
balance of domestic debt, and are issued in tenors of 91, 182, 273 and 364-days, with the 364-days
accounting for 48 percent of total T-bills (as of December 2012).
On foreign debt, Namibia has issued two sovereign bonds; namely the US-dollar denominated
Eurobond of US$500 million on October 2011, and the R850 million South African Rand
denominated bond on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in November 2012, both with 10-years
tenure. Accessing the international bond market has served to diversify Namibia’s money market
base.
Under the staff’s baseline scenario, gross public debt would reach 35 percent of GDP by 2018/19
(Table 1). This assumes continuing fiscal consolidation, with the primary deficit averaging about
1.7 percent of GDP during 2013/14–18/19. Given uncertainty surrounding economic growth, the
government plans to utilize a combination of spending restraint, revenue management, and deficit
financing options to stabilize debt and avoid systematic erosion of fiscal space.
Figure 1 shows two alternative scenarios:


Public debt would be lower than in the baseline if for the next five years, macroeconomic
variables on their average level over the last decade in Namibia. The debt-to-GDP ratio would
stabilize at a lower level because the fiscal balance and growth would be higher on average.



Public debt would be much higher than in the baseline if the primary fiscal deficit remains
constant at its 2013/14 level (3.5 percent of GDP) throughout the medium-term. In this case, the
planned fiscal consolidation does not taken place and public debt would exceed 45 percent of
GDP.

MEDIUM-TERM EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
Namibia’s gross external debt remains moderate at about 40 percent of GDP, although it has almost
doubled since 2008. The US$500 million Eurobond issued in 2011 and the R850 million issued on
the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in 2012 occupy the biggest share, followed by multilateral and
bilateral loans for the rest. Original maturities of these loans range from 9 to 50 years, most with
10-year grace periods. About 90 percent of the loans are at fixed interest rates (ranging from zero to
4.27 percent).
Under the baseline, Namibia’s gross external debt is projected to decline gradually from about
40 percent of GDP in 2013 to about 30 percent of GDP in 2018 (Table 2). Improvements in current
account balances should support a reduction in the external debt ratio, as the new Swakop uranium
mine reaches full production by 2017, uranium prices increase from their recent lows improving the
terms of trade, and the planned fiscal consolidation takes place.
An alternative scenario suggests that if key debt-creating variables went back to their historical
levels, Namibia’s external debt would end up at about half the baseline line by the end of the
forecasting period (Figure 2).
Simulations suggest that Namibia’s external debt-to-GDP ratio is particularly sensitive to a current
account shock, real depreciation shock, and a combination shock of deterioration in real interest
rate, growth rate, and current account balance. On its own, Namibia’s external debt does not appear
to be particularly sensitive to a shock in interest rates and growth.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Namibia

On January 29, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Namibia without a meeting.2
Namibia’s real GDP grew by a healthy 5 percent in 2012. Preliminary data for the first half of
2013 suggest that growth has moderated; the slowdown reflects weak global demand for exports,
which more than offset the solid growth in the nonmineral sector, most notably in retail trade. At
end-October 2013 inflation stood slightly below 5 percent.
The fiscal outturn in the FY2012/13 (starting April) was significantly better than targeted; the
overall deficit was 0.3 percent compared to 3.9 percent projected in the original budget. The
strong performance reflects revenue over performance and some under-execution in capital
spending.
Reflecting the fiscal withdrawal in FY2012/13, the current account deficit narrowed to
2.6 percent of GDP in 2012 from 3.5 percent in 2011. This outcome was driven mainly by an
increase in official transfers in the form of higher-than-projected Southern African Customs
Union (SACU) revenues, and savings made in capital spending. Despite the narrowing of the
current account deficit, the official reserves coverage stood at just 3 months of imports at
end-2012.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.
2

Article IV consultations are concluded without a Board meeting when the following conditions apply: (i) there are
no acute or significant risks, or general policy issues requiring Board discussion; (ii) policies or circumstances are
unlikely to have significant regional or global impact; (iii) in the event a parallel program review is being completed,
it is also being completed on a lapse-of-time basis; and (iv) the use of Fund resources is not under discussion or
anticipated.”

Namibia’s banking system is highly profitable and well-capitalized, with relatively low
nonperforming loans. Favorable credit conditions also supported domestic demand growth in
recent years. The 2011–21 Namibia Financial Sector Strategy (NFSS) is sound and strikes an
appropriate balance between financial inclusion and stability. The Bank of Namibia’s semiannual Financial Stability Reports have also rightly focused on the challenges that could emanate
from the high household indebtedness and recommended appropriate policy responses to
minimize the associated risks.
Staff projects that output growth would further moderate to about 4 percent in 2013. Mineral
exports will likely remain subdued on account of weak external demand with growth slowing in
Namibia’s major trading partners. However, this factor would be partly offset by strong domestic
demand growth emanating from the recent income tax reform, along with the fiscal expansion
targeted in the FY2013/14 budget. The nonmineral sector, in particular construction, is expected
to further rebound in the second half of 2013, on account of the development of the Swakop
Uranium mine, which is expected to become the second largest uranium mine in the world.
The main near-term risks relate to the fragile and uncertain external environment, especially for
emerging markets, which could constrain export demand. Further deterioration of the euro-area
economies may generate significant negative spillovers through trade linkages as a large share of
Namibia’s total exports—mainly diamonds, uranium, beef, unrefined copper and fish—are
destined for Europe. In addition, a delay in finalizing negotiation of Economic Partnership
Agreement (EPA) with the European Union may bring additional risks to some nonmineral
exports.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2013 Article IV consultation with Namibia, Executive directors endorsed
staff’s appraisal, as follows:
Namibia has made impressive strides in economic development since gaining independence in
1990. The positive growth record in recent years has raised overall incomes and delivered good
economic outcomes.
However, the solid growth has not led to sufficient job creation and lower inequality. The
government remains the largest employer in the economy and TIPEEG is yet to put a significant
dent on the high level of structural unemployment.
The 4th National Development Plan (NDP4) serves as the authorities’ blueprint for structural
transformation. Staff welcomes a tightly focused NPD4 that emphasizes returning to high and
sustained growth, reducing income inequality and enhancing job creation through reforms that
lay the foundation for greater private sector development.

3

The period ahead will require a delicate balancing act in the implementation of macroeconomic
policies because of global spillovers and domestic policy developments. The uncertain global
environment especially for emerging markets and a possible delay in finalizing negotiations of
the EPA with the EU are key risks. In a more adverse global scenario than anticipated, the
authorities should allow the automatic stabilizers to work on the revenue side and avoid
discretionary fiscal measures to support domestic demand.
Staff recommends that the government pursue a “growth-friendly” medium-term fiscal
consolidation strategy. This should aim to rein in current spending (wages and transfers and
subsidies to SOEs) while preserving growth-promoting capital. Staff welcomes plans by the
department of public servants management to link civil servants’ pay with performance. Staff
also commends the measures being put in place by the government to improve domestic revenue
generation which bodes well for a balanced fiscal consolidation. Staff advocates for a broadly
balanced fiscal position by FY2015/16 to help rebuild the fiscal and reserve buffers.
Staff commends the sense of urgency shown by the government to address the state of finances
of the State-owned enterprises (SOEs). Speedy implementation of SOE performance agreements
is needed to put them on a financially viable footing.
The government’s emphasis on enhancing greater financial inclusion through its financial sector
strategy, while preserving the stability of the financial system, is appropriate. While the level of
household indebtedness has stabilized, it remains elevated. In staff’s view, this in itself does not
pose imminent risk to macroeconomic and financial stability. Staff commends the authorities for
the initiatives taken to strengthen their surveillance of the financial sector.
Achieving sustainable growth would require a set of reform-oriented innovative policies to
reinvigorate productivity growth. These include increasing the quality of public spending,
improving the business environment, implementing supportive measures to liberalize the service
sectors, reducing the domestic regulatory burden on firms and the skill mismatch in the labor
market. Staff commends the authorities’ efforts to strengthen public financial management
including bringing Namibia’s procurement system in line with international standards.
