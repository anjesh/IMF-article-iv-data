December 7, 2009


Consultation and team. The 2009 Article IV consultation discussions with Bhutan were
held in Thimphu during October 15−27, 2009. The staff team included Ms. Ramakrishnan
(head), Ms. Topalova, and Mr. Guo (all APD). Mr. Krishnan (Senior Advisor, OED)
participated in the policy discussions. The team met with Prime Minister Thinley, Royal
Monetary Authority Managing Director Tenzin, Minister of Finance Norbu, other senior
officials, and private sector and donor representatives.



Context of past surveillance. Bhutan is on a 24-month consultation cycle. In line with
past advice, the authorities have taken measures to reduce excess liquidity in the banking
system, strengthened prudential regulations by establishing limits on sectoral exposures,
done groundwork for the issuance of T-bills and competition in the financial sector,
maintained current fiscal surpluses, and improved data collection and dissemination.
Constructive dialogue is ongoing through technical assistance in fiscal, monetary, and
statistical areas.



Exchange rate system. Since its introduction in 1974, the ngultrum has been pegged to the
Indian rupee at par. Bhutan continues to avail of transitional arrangements under Article
XIV, Section 2. Bhutan also maintains exchange restrictions subject to Fund approval
under Article VIII, Section 2(a).



Economic statistics. Data collection has improved and its provision is broadly adequate
for surveillance. The authorities are also on track to subscribe to the IMF’s General Data
Dissemination Standards, which would help increase data transparency. Some
shortcomings continue, such as the long lags in the availability of fiscal and monetary data.
Large errors and omissions in the external sector also preclude a more accurate assessment
of external flows.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Political and economic background: Bhutan’s historic transformation into a constitutional
monarchy was successfully completed in July 2008. With prudent economic management and
strong donor support, the 9th Plan achieved many successes including strong growth,
hydropower sector development, poverty reduction, and improved social indicators. The
ongoing 10th Plan has a broad-ranging development agenda to lower poverty through, inter alia,
hydropower, industrial, and private sector development.
Outlook and risks: Growth is expected to average about 6½ percent in the medium term, with
hydropower being the key contributor. Inflation is likely to continue to trace India’s consumer
prices, averaging about 6 percent. The risks are broadly balanced: faster private sector growth
could result in higher productivity but debt sustainability and financial sector vulnerabilities are
downside risks.
Fiscal and debt sustainability issues: With the sharp rise in the 2009/10 budget deficit,
spending prioritization with a near-term tightening bias is needed to avoid stoking excess
demand. In the medium term, revenue expansion and prudent expenditure planning are needed
to limit domestic debt buildup. Although the debt sustainability analysis indicates that most of
the indicative thresholds are breached, staff deem the risk of distress as moderate given several
mitigating factors, including the concentration of debt in commercially viable hydropower
projects.
Monetary and financial sector: It was agreed that the monetary stance needs to be consistent
with the exchange rate peg. Stepped up issuance of RMA- or the forthcoming T-bills at marketdriven rates should help mop up the remaining excess liquidity and improve monetary
transmission. Strengthening banking sector supervision is critical given the jump in nonperforming loans and the entry of new banks.
External sector: The one-to-one peg of the Bhutanese ngultrum to the Indian rupee remains
appropriate and the exchange rate level is broadly in equilibrium. There are recurring pressures
on the Indian rupee reserves due to mismatches in rupee inflows and outflows, and the two
credit lines with India play a useful role in easing these shortfalls. Adopting clear guidelines for
reserve management to align the currency composition of reserves with external liabilities and
import demand is also important.
Private sector development. Providing job opportunities for the projected large increase in the
labor force requires measures to improve the skills and employability of the labor force. To
improve the mix of financing available to the private sector, donor-supported SME-lending
schemes could be considered. A commercial paper market to facilitate transparent intercorporate borrowing would also help expand the pool of lenders.

I. BACKDROP
1.
Bhutan’s historic transformation into a constitutional monarchy was
successfully completed in July 2008. Elections for the upper house took place in December
2007 and elections for the 47-member lower house were held in March 2008. On July 18,
2008, the new parliament formally adopted the Constitution, completing the transition
process to a parliamentary democracy.
2.
Bhutan’s economic performance has been strong over the last several years.
Rapid growth has been supported by prudent economic management, sustained donor
support, and the smooth political transition.1 The 9th Plan (2002-2007) achieved many
successes, including rising national income,

increasing electricity generation capacity by 10,000 MW by 2020.3 The challenge is to
achieve these goals while sustaining Bhutan’s macroeconomic stability.
II. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Economic growth has been robust and inflation mostly stable. During the 9th
Plan, real GDP growth averaged about 9½ percent, as economic output was substantially
boosted by the hydropower sector. After the spike in growth in 2006/07 and 2007/08, fuelled
by the commissioning of the Tala hydropower station (Figure 1), the rate of economic
expansion decelerated in 2008/09 to an estimated 5.7 percent, reflecting the high base effect
and constant electricity production. Given Bhutan’s limited exposure to global financial
markets and the concentration of electricity exports to India, the economic impact of the

Bhutan’s development partners, including the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, have helped
Bhutan achieve its 9th Plan goals with wide-ranging lending and non-lending programs, particularly in the areas
of fiscal and public financial management, infrastructure expansion, financial sector development, and overall
capacity building (Informational Annexes II and III provide more details).

The 10th Five Year Plan was approved by the Executive Boards of the IMF and the World Bank in April 2009
as Bhutan’s Poverty Reduction Strategy paper.

Reports No. 07/349 and No. 07/350.

global financial crisis was small and limited to the tourism sector and a few manufacturing
industries (Box 1). With strong trade ties with India, inflation has been consistent with
India’s consumer price index (CPI) developments— the 9th Plan period’s average inflation
rate was about 5 percent, although it increased subsequently reflecting the increase in food
and fuel prices in 2008.

Supported by the fiscal anchor to contain current spending below domestic
revenue, the government has coped with volatility in both revenue and expenditure.
Despite the uncertainty arising from foreign aid flows, a small current operating surplus
(excluding grants) and an overall deficit of 2.7 percent of GDP were achieved in the 9th Plan
period (Figure 2). The provisional estimates for 2008/09 also indicate an overall fiscal
surplus. The 2009/10 budget, however, envisages a sharp increase in the fiscal deficit to 7.6
percent of GDP (and a significant reduction in the current operating surplus). This
deterioration in the overall fiscal position relative to the provisional 2008/09 outturn reflects
a sharp increase in current spending (due to the 35 percent hike in civil servants’ wages (Box
2) and higher expenditure on goods and services), a jump in capital spending, and stagnant
domestic revenue.4 Thus, domestic financing is budgeted to climb to 7.1 percent of GDP,
from an estimate of close to zero in 2008/09.

5.
Substantial aid flows have resulted
in balance of payments surpluses and foreign
exchange reserves accumulation. Bhutan’s
large and volatile trade deficits arising from
hydropower-related imports have been offset by
sizeable foreign aid inflows, leading to overall
balance of payments surpluses averaging about
7 percent of GDP over the last 4 years. These
surpluses have resulted in an accumulation of

Box 1: Bhutan’s Cross-country Linkages
Bhutan has extensive economic linkages with India, while trade with the rest of the world
remains limited. As a small, land-locked country with only the border with India easily
accessible, Bhutan naturally has much closer economic ties with India than any other country.
Bhutan imports a significant fraction of consumption and investment goods from India. In
combination with a dual-currency system, in which the ngultrum is pegged at par to the Indian
rupee, CPI in Bhutan tracks price development in India closely. The hydropower sector—the
driver of Bhutan’s strong economic growth—relies almost entirely on India for both export
market and financing. Overall, India accounts for more than 90 percent of Bhutan’s exports and
75 percent of imports. While Bhutan will integrate more into the world economy, especially if
WTO accession is achieved, India is likely to remain its dominant economic partner.
The central role of the hydropower sector and increasing electricity demand imply that
Bhutan is largely shielded from global economic fluctuations, including those of India.
Electricity exports to India are about 50 percent of Bhutan’s gross exports. The remainder are
mostly re-exports and processing trade that have little value-added from Bhutan. Electricity
shortage in India combined with negotiated long-term tariffs have secured a stable export market
for Bhutan’s hydropower sector. It has been, therefore, possible for Bhutan’s economic growth to
remain strong amid the global crisis.
Bhutan, nevertheless, has not been fully immune to the global crisis as evidenced by the
tourism sector and some manufacturing industries. Tourism had experienced over 30 percent
average annual growth between 2005 and 2008. By June 2009, however, the number of tourists
decreased 7.3 percent and tourism receipts dropped more than 10 percent. The steel and ferroalloy industries, which take advantage of cheap energy in Bhutan and had flourished during the
commodity boom, also suffered considerable losses when commodity prices tumbled. As a result,
financial institutions that had extended loans to these industries incurred considerable NPLs.
Fortunately, the spillover from the crisis appears to be limited to these two sectors and the impact
on the overall economy remains small.
Heavy reliance on external financing makes Bhutan vulnerable to a slowdown of capital
inflows. Bhutan’s hydropower projects are mostly financed by grants and loans from the
Government of India. Other capital expenditures are also supported predominantly by grants from
donor countries and international organizations, which have financed on average 35 percent of
Bhutan’s annual budget over the last five years, especially capital expenditure. While these
official inflows are generally stable and secure, Bhutan’s development agenda would be curtailed,
the envisaged hydropower projects may need to be delayed, and fast economic growth could
temporarily come to a halt if foreign aid falls short.
Moreover, volatile disbursements of foreign aid and lack of sufficient clarity about mediumterm donor commitment also complicate Bhutan’s fiscal and monetary management. The
overall fiscal balance and international reserves have experienced considerable swings, in part due
to mismatch between disbursements of foreign grants and loans and actual expenditure. The
absence of a clear commitment from the donor community over a 3-5 year horizon also renders it
harder for the authorities to determine the resource envelope and improve the implementation of
medium-term budget planning.

7
Box 2. Wage Developments and Issues
There have been three major wage hikes for civil servants since 2005. Civil servant pay was raised by
45 percent in 2005, followed by a further average 10 percent increase in 2006, and most recently, an acrossthe-board 35 percent wage increase in the form of allowance effective January 1, 2009. Similar to the latest
hike, the first two pay hikes also appear to have coincided with revenue cycles associated with hydropower
projects—Chukha tariffs were revised in 2005 and Tala came on stream in 2006. Meanwhile, a scarcity
allowance has been introduced in the remuneration of professionals and technicians on the government payroll
for whom there is a deemed shortage, and the allowance was increased by 45 percent in 2007.
Past pay revisions, while significant and infrequent, were in line with economic growth and inflation.
Nominal wage bill for civil servants increased by about 50 percent between 2004/05 and 2007/08, and
nominal GDP grew by more than 55 percent during the same period. As a result, government expenditure on
wages and salaries as a share of GDP dropped to 6.8 percent in 2007/08 from 7.2 percent in 2004/05.
The increase in 2009 may cause temporary pressures on the budget. The intent was, according to the First
Pay Commission report, to attract, retain and motivate the professionals, and to continuously raise the
professionalism and efficiency of the bureaucracy. Staff projects the government to spend 9.2 percent of GDP
on wages and salaries in the current fiscal year, 2.1 percentage points higher than the average in the last
decade, and to remain elevated as a share of GDP in the next few years.

and 570 percent in 20 African countries reported in a World Bank survey.1 The pay and allowances of
Bhutan’s corporate sector, among which most high performing companies are government-owned entities that
have monopoly power, are about 15 percent higher than comparable civil service positions. However,
compared to the median level of 53 low-income and lower-middle-income countries, Bhutan spent 1.4 percent
of GDP more on wages and salaries during 2000–2008. The recent wage hike is projected to increase public
expenditure on wages and salaries by another 1.3 percent of GDP in the next five years. But as a share of total
government outlays, Bhutan spent a smaller fraction on wages and salaries compared to the same group,
reflecting a large overall government spending agenda under the 9th and 10th five-year plans, much of which is
capital expenditures that are aimed to improve infrastructure.
Also, Bhutan’s wage structure is overly compressed. The compression ratio of civil servant wages is at 7,
far less than the normal threshold of 12, implying an overly compressed structure. A moderate income level
and a compressed structure could imply underpaid high-skilled workers in the government and overpaid lowskilled workers.

Measures taken by the Royal Monetary Authority (RMA) have contributed to
lowering excess liquidity. The banking system’s excess liquidity is about 7.2 percent of
assets—significantly lower than the 25 percent
in June 2006 (Figure 3). The reduction was

7.
With rapid credit growth, financial sector vulnerabilities are on the rise. Credit
growth averaged about 30 percent over the last decade, and now there are signs of
deteriorating asset quality. Banks’ non-performing loans (NPLs) more than doubled to 18
percent of total loans between December 2008 and June 2009, reflecting the impact of
volatile commodity prices on select manufacturing industries.7 Moreover, credit is

Bhutan’s additional SDR allocation was entirely used to build its reserve cushion.

6

Bhutan has two rupee credit lines with India—one with State Bank of India for Rs. 4 billion at 9.2 percent
interest rate, and the other with the Government of India for Rs. 3 billion at 5 percent interest rate.
7

The setting up of ferro-alloy and steel industries, which take advantage of Bhutan’s lower electricity prices,
along the Indian border has raised considerably banks’ exposure to these sectors. As these industries were
adversely affected by the decline in commodity prices, banks’ NPLs rose in tandem. The contribution of these
industries to the whole economy, however, is small.

9
concentrated in personal loans, construction, trade and manufacturing.8 Banks also have
maturity mismatches due to the long term-structure of these loans and the short-term
corporate deposits that dominate the funding base.
III. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
8.
Bhutan’s growth outlook remains bright. Real GDP growth for the remainder of
th
the 10 Plan period is projected to be about 6½ percent: the hydropower sector remains the
key driver given the planned expansion in electricity generation capacity.9 In the construction
phase, the projects will boost growth via the construction and services sector; once on stream,
they will contribute through power generation. Inflation is expected to continue to trace
India’s CPI, averaging about 6 percent for the remaining years of the 10th Plan period. As in
previous hydropower cycles, the current account deficit is estimated to widen significantly
over the medium term, as new hydropower projects begin; however, adequate external
financing is likely to result in overall surpluses and adequate international reserve cover.

The risks to this outlook are broadly balanced. On the upside, faster private
sector growth, including in the tourism sector, could result in higher productivity and growth
without inflationary pressures. On the downside, however, achieving the goals of the 10th
Plan is subject to potential overheating due to spillovers from the hydropower and
development spending as well as rapid credit growth, financial sector vulnerabilities, and
concerns about debt sustainability. The authorities agreed with the overall outlook and are
mindful of these constraints. They also stressed that tourism is likely to be a strong growth
sector—Bhutan lags in tourist numbers relative to its peer group, and the government is
pursuing policies for its development.

The RMA’s prudential regulations require a 30 percent ceiling on exposure to any single sector.

The earthquake in September 2009 disrupted the lives of many households and the price tab for reconstruction
is estimated to be about 4 percent of GDP. However, given limited disruption in economic activity from the
earthquake, it is unlikely to have a significant growth impact.

IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
10.
Against this background, discussions and recommendations focused on: (i)
fiscal challenges including the near-term policy stance and debt sustainability; (ii) liquidity
management in the banking sector and financial sector vulnerabilities; (iii) international
reserve management; and (iv) private sector development. There was broad agreement
between the staff and authorities on the main policy issues and recommendations.
A. Fiscal Policy and Debt Sustainability
11.
Careful fiscal management with a near-term tightening bias is necessary to
ensure macroeconomic stability. The budgeted fiscal deficit for 2009/10 exceeds the
government’s implicit policy to limit the deficit to under 5 percent of GDP. Though staff
projects that the actual outturn may be substantially lower than budgeted,10 a sharp deficit
increase risks stoking excess demand given the already strong economic growth, and putting
further pressure on rupee reserves. Thus, vigilance in fiscal policy and spending prioritization
are critical, especially in light of the additional spending needed for reconstruction following
the series of natural disasters in 2009—the estimated cost of the September earthquake alone
is Nu. 2.5 billion (about 4 percent of GDP). The authorities noted that the political transition
to democracy is creating spending pressures, but agreed that spending prioritization was
needed given the resource constraints and their commitment to maintain a surplus on the
current domestic balance. They, however, also noted their past track record of spending: only
about 80 percent of their budgeted capital expenditure is typically spent because of
implementation capacity constraints. This pattern is likely to continue in the near term, even
though steps are being taken to ensure better budget execution.

10

Staff projects the 2009/10 deficit to be 3.3 percent of GDP: capital spending is expected to reach 90 percent
of the budgeted amount (slightly more than historical outturns); implementation capacity constraints are likely
to require resource reallocation from development to earthquake-related reconstruction projects. Also, the
Small Development Projects grant from India—which is pending finalization of the project list—is expected to
materialize.

11
12.
In the medium term, the challenge is to limit domestic financing while
pursuing the 10th Plan goals. While the anchor to contain current spending at or below
domestic revenue provides important fiscal restraints, both revenue reforms and careful
expenditure planning are needed to limit domestic financing to avoid potentially crowding
out private investment and building-up the already high public debt. Staff recommended the
following medium term fiscal stance to ensure fiscal sustainability:.

Measures to maintain domestic revenue at about 22 percent of GDP are desirable.11
Tax base expansion, including the introduction of a value-added tax to replace the existing
sales tax, will contribute to better domestic revenue generation. Staff also stressed that tax
incentives for private sector development, if necessary, need to be designed to boost growth
and employment, while minimizing economic distortions and revenue losses.12

Keeping overall outlays (excluding net lending) at about 40 percent of GDP calls for
strengthened medium-term budgeting and expenditure smoothing. This includes avoiding
procyclical spending, especially on wages—civil service pay revisions in line with the
overall budgetary envelope would help avoid short-term fiscal pressures arising from ad hoc
adjustments. Weeding out low priority spending will also help create fiscal space for vital
expenditures necessary to achieve the development goals (e.g., health, education, and
infrastructure). Aligning these priorities with donor support is also needed to limit domestic
financing.

The above revenue and outlay targets combined with foreign grants of about 13½
percent of GDP and external borrowing of 3½ percent of GDP per year, which have already
been committed by foreign donors, could limit domestic financing to about 2 percent of GDP
over the medium term. Such a medium term fiscal stance would prevent substantial build-up
in domestic public debt and leave sufficient resources for private sector investment.
13.
The authorities are keenly aware of the need to expand the revenue base and
limit domestic debt. They are working on measures to broaden the sales tax base, rationalize
indirect tax rates, and improve tax administration. Harmonization of personal, business and
corporate income tax rates is also under consideration. On wages, however, they consider
linking wage increase to specific parameters as limiting their flexibility on the timing of the
pay raises. They also noted that very little domestic borrowing actually materializes in
11

Despite tax reforms, Bhutan’s revenue-to-GDP ratio is projected to remain flat over the medium term as the
increase in non-hydropower sector revenues is offset by the decline in hydropower sector-related revenues. In
particular, (i) no new power sector projects are expected to come on stream over this period; (ii) both income
tax and dividend payments from hydropower projects are fixed in nominal terms and thus decline as share of
GDP; and (iii) other revenue—the bulk of which are receipts for making interest payments on power sector
loans and fixed in nominal terms—also decrease as a percent of GDP.
12

For example, investment focused incentives such as investment tax credits or accelerated depreciation are
more effective than targeted tax holidays to specific sectors.

12
Bhutan relative to the budget due to underexecution of capital spending. However, they also
agreed that this is not cause for complacency given the rising spending pressures.
14.
There was agreement that stronger fiscal management requires better cash
management and improved implementation of the multi-year budgetary framework.
The planned issuance of T-bills will help tide over temporary cash shortfalls arising from the
timing and seasonality of tax and non-tax receipts and of foreign aid disbursements. Its
successful implementation, however, requires developing a cash forecasting framework
based on comprehensive and high-frequency data on government’s cash inflows and
outflows. Over the medium term, the multi-year budgetary framework could be enhanced by
continued efforts to update and analyze in a timely manner the Budget Policy and Fiscal
Framework Statement. Better donor coordination, including expanded organization capacity
in the government, would also help achieve greater predictability of financial flows.
15.
The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) shows that most indicative debt
thresholds are breached, although several factors mitigate the risk of distress. Based on
the joint IMF-World Bank DSA, the present value of public debt is projected to peak at about
130 percent of GDP in 2014/15—of which external debt is 120 percent of GDP—before
resuming a steady downward path. These levels, based on Bhutan’s LIC-DSA thresholds,
would indicate a high risk of debt distress. However, there are strong mitigating factors: the
concentration of debt in commercially viable hydropower projects, Bhutan’s strong project
implementation track record, high level of foreign reserves, and the close ties with India—its
main debtor—help lower the risk to a moderate level.13 Nevertheless, under these
circumstances, staff noted that a cautious and gradual approach to allowing external
commercial borrowing may be necessary to avoid exacerbating the external debt situation.
B. Monetary and Financial Sector Policies
16.
The RMA agreed that monetary policy consistency with the rupee peg is
critical for economic stability. Staff urged adjustments to the monetary conditions to avoid
an overly loose monetary stance and to ensure that interest rates are more aligned with those
in India. For now, interest spreads with India are consistent with historical levels, although
this comes from India’s interest rate cuts in response to the financial crisis rather than
increases in the RMA’s discount bill rate. Thus, vigilance and close monitoring of monetary
developments are needed, particularly if monetary stance in India shifts due to rising inflation
or if there is significant pressure on Bhutan’s net foreign reserves.14

13

Bhutan maintains close economic and political ties with India, which has been both the main provider of
financing for hydropower projects and the main consumer of the electricity produced. The two countries are in a
continuous dialogue on the financial and technical aspects of the projects, thus mitigating commercial risks.
14

Net foreign reserves are the gross foreign reserves minus the amount drawn from the two rupee credit lines.

13
17.
The authorities are taking steps to manage liquidity to strengthen monetary
transmission, reduce excess liquidity, and improve financial sector resource allocation.

The RMA agreed with staff that stepped up issuance of RMA- or T-bills is necessary
to absorb the remaining excess liquidity, and noted that the impending government T-bill
issuance with market-driven interest rates will be used for that purpose.15 They also noted
that as new banks enter (see below) and attract some of the deposits in the already existing
banks, excess liquidity in the financial sector should decline. As for monetary policy
transmission, the authorities expect the discount rate on the T-bill to be an effective signal of
the policy rate and to help guide deposit rates. Moreover, the planned creation of a repo
facility would facilitate moving toward market-based lending rates. Staff also urged
implementing a liquidity monitoring and forecasting framework, for which better
coordination with the government is needed to keep close track of cash flows.

The authorities also agreed that developing a formal interbank market could reduce
the inefficiencies arising from the ongoing mismatch between supply and demand of funds
across financial institutions and strengthen financial intermediation. The availability of Tbills for use as collateral for interbank transactions should help develop such a market and
redistribute liquidity among the financial institutions.
18.
Safeguarding financial sector stability is a top priority. Staff supported the
imminent entry of new financial institutions—they will bring in much needed competition,
improve financial intermediation and quality of services, and help develop an interbank
market.16 However, there is also a risk that credit might grow even faster as banks compete,
potentially compromising asset quality. With credit risk already being the biggest banking
sector risk (Box 3 provides a sensitivity analysis of the two existing banks), strengthening
supervision and procedures to safeguard credit quality are critical. A strong risk management
process is important to identify, evaluate, monitor, and control risks from bank operations—
including credit risk—and assess banks’ overall capital adequacy in the context of such risks.
More efficient financial information disclosure, including the planned automation of off-site
supervision would also help. Licensing for new financial institutions should include an
assessment of ownership and governance. The authorities agreed that supervision had to be
enhanced to ensure financial sector stability. They, however, also noted that they expect
significant improvement in loan performance by year end as the extended loan grace periods
terminate for the adversely affected manufacturers and loan servicing starts again. Moreover,
15

The RMA normally issues 91-day bills. In October 2009, 30-day bills were issued on a one-time basis at a
discount rate of 4.5 percent due to delays in the planned issuance of the T-bills. The monthly auctioning of the
91-day T-bills will replace the current RMA bills. A cost-sharing arrangement with the government will be
introduced, whereby the latter will bear the interest cost on T-bills issued for meeting fiscal resource gaps.
16

In-principle approvals to three banks and one insurance company were made in December 2008. The latter
was issued a license in August 2009; licenses for two banks are expected to be approved early next year.

14
the seasonality of NPLs in Bhutan combined with the resurgence of commodity prices would
also help moderate the risk of high NPLs.
C. External Sector Issues
19.
The authorities agreed with the assessment that the exchange rate is broadly in
equilibrium, and the ngultrum’s parity with the Indian rupee is appropriate. Given the
strong economic ties with India, the peg has served Bhutan well in anchoring inflation
expectations, and the real exchange rate between the two countries has fluctuated within a
narrow band (Box 4). Staff advised appropriate adjustments to broader macroeconomic
policies to avoid undue pressures on the exchange rate and overall reserves.
20.
The frequent pressure on rupee reserves is a concern to the authorities, despite
the comfortable level of convertible currency reserves. The two rupee credit lines play a
useful role in addressing short-term mismatches in rupee inflows and outflows and lowering
associated vulnerabilities. Even though rupee inflows are expected to rise from the
hydropower projects in the pipeline, staff stressed that an appropriate macroeconomic policy
stance is essential to avoid inducing discretionary rupee outflows. Diversifying exports to
enhance rupee inflows beyond the hydropower sector, and close monitoring of rupee flows
would also help. More generally, staff encouraged adopting clear guidelines for reserve
management to actively align the currency composition of reserves with external liabilities
and import demand, specify portfolio performance benchmarks, and revisit the use of 12month import coverage as the numeraire for reserve adequacy.
21.
On the plans for trade liberalization, Bhutan is at an advanced stage of the WTO
accession process. The authorities informed that a decision on WTO accession could be taken
in 2010. On the tariff structure, the authorities are working on rationalizing the number of
slabs, which will reduce the incentives for misclassification of goods by importers.17
22.
The authorities continue to be concerned about the likely outflow of
convertible currency reserves if they were to accept the obligations under Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4. The authorities reiterated that continued quantity restrictions on current
transactions were needed since Bhutan’s international reserves were built on unpredictable
aid flows rather than export receipts, and liberalization of current account transactions could

17

The current tariff structure has 8 slabs ranging from 0 to 100 percent. Most imported goods are in the 5, 10
and 20 percent slabs.

15

Box 3. Banking Sector Sensitivity Analysis
Managing credit risks is a significant challenge. Loans account for about 50 percent of total assets in the
banking system. Loan quality sharply deteriorated in 2009—NPLs have more than doubled to 17.9 percent of
total loans by June 2009. Of the total NPLs, nearly 80 percent are classified as substandard. More than a quarter
of the NPLs arise from the manufacturing sector largely because of the impact of lower commodity prices on a
few industries (ferro-alloy and steel); tourism and construction add an additional 18 percent each.
To assess the impact of this risk, staff and the RMA ran sensitivity tests to examine their impact on key
banking system soundness indicators. A stress-testing framework was applied to the two banks. Several
scenarios were chosen to test for systemic weakness, including: (i) a 50 percent increase in NPLs proportional to
existing (baseline) NPLs (scenario 1); (ii) a 100 percent increase in NPLs proportional to the baseline NPLs
(scenario 2); (iii) 30 percent of performing loans (PLs) in the manufacturing sector turning into NPLs, and
10 percent turning to NPLs in the construction, tourism, and personal loan sectors (scenario 3); and (iv) ngultrum
appreciation by 20 percent vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar (scenario 4). The baseline risk-weighted capital adequacy
ratio (CAR) for the banking system at end-June 2009 was 14.5 percent.
The main results of the sensitivity analysis are:

Credit risk remains the main risk faced by Bhutanese banks, particularly in light of the recent surge of
NPLs due to exposure to the noted manufacturing industries, fast loan growth and concentration of credit in a
few sectors. The CAR could drop as much as 11 percentage points for one bank and 10.2 percentage points for
the banking system as a whole under the most extreme scenario. Overall, if the NPLs continue to rise at the pace
experienced since December 2008 or if the risks under the third scenario materialize, at least one bank would
become undercapitalized and fall below the prudential minimum.

Bank 2 is more vulnerable to the credit and exchange rate risks. Its CAR could decline substantially if
NPLs rise in construction and personal loans given its higher exposure to these sectors, and if the exchange rate
appreciates given its larger positive net open position. Also, Bank 2 has a much lower buffer stock of capital and
is thereby more vulnerable to adverse shocks.

Potential contagion between the banks (or in the financial sector more generally) is limited by the low
level of interbank lending. However, confidence effects could spread risks from one institution to the rest of the
financial system. Liquidity risks in the banking system are also low given the large role that deposits play as a
funding source and the limited competition, although this could change with the entry of new banks.

These results are subject to caveats. The estimated decline in the CAR and increase in NPL ratio would be
larger if the required provisioning on the additional NPLs is higher. On the upside, the seasonality of NPLs in
Bhutan indicates that NPLs may come down quite significantly by year end and the resurgence of commodity
prices may help recover some of NPLs to the steel and ferro-alloy industries. High collaterals may also alleviate
losses associated with NPLs.

16

Box 4. Exchange Rate Assessment

The one-to-one peg with the Indian rupee has served Bhutan well and remains
appropriate. The strong link to the rupee has moderated Bhutan’s inflation, averaging
just over 4 percent annually since 1999. It has also anchored confidence in the ngultrum,
helping to keep interest rates relatively low, and has facilitated Bhutan’s trade relations
with India.


Potential real appreciation associated with wage increases in a fast-growing
economy is of a lesser concern in the case of Bhutan. The upward pressure on real wage
could be muted by the fact that 23 percent of the population is still under the poverty
line and 74 percent of the population remains in rural areas. Efforts to enhance private
sector efficiency and to achieve productivity gains will also serve to contain inflation in
the non-tradable sector.

17
quickly deplete their foreign exchange reserves as imports shift from India to third
countries.18 Staff noted that as the level of foreign exchange reserves increases, the
authorities could undertake gradual easing and eventually eliminate the restrictions, in line
with past recommendations of IMF technical assistance in this area.
D. Employment and Private Sector Development
23.
Given the expected large increase in the labor force over the next 4–5 years,
the authorities recognize that private sector development is key for further job
creation.19,20

There is a major shortage of skilled labor in Bhutan, and several measures are already
underway to improve the skills and employability of the labor force. Additional measures,
such as improving vocational training quality, expanding training programs, and enhancing
labor market information sharing to match job seekers and employers will help promote the
employment of local labor and encourage seeking employment in the private sector.

The financing mix available to the private sector could also be strengthened. The two
commercial banks are currently the main sources of funding for the private sector. This is a
constraint for some smaller businesses whose access to credit is curtailed by rigid collateral
requirements and complex procedures. Financing for larger corporates, on the other hand, is
limited by the single borrower prudential limits. While the small size of the banking system
could be a constraining factor, the impending entry of new banks and greater competition
should help improve credit access. The recent creation of the Credit Information Bureau
should also help reduce information asymmetries between lenders and borrowers. Staff also
encouraged greater public education on the existing credit schemes for entrepreneurial
development, and further developing donor-supported SME-lending schemes. Also, taking
steps to develop inter-corporate borrowing via a commercial paper market, with an adequate
supporting legal framework, would help improve transparent access to funds, particularly for
larger businesses, by increasing the pool of lenders. Easing restrictions on foreign direct
18

Bhutan maintains exchange restrictions in connection with (i) the availability of foreign exchange for travel,
invisibles, and private transfers; (ii) foreign exchange balancing requirements on remittances of income from
FDI; and (iii) the availability of foreign exchange for importers who are not able to provide the identity of the
seller. Changes to Bhutan’s import licensing rules in 2005, which introduced new foreign exchange balancing
requirements for certain imports gave rise to exchange restrictions subject to Fund approval under Article VIII,
Section 2(a).

19

Estimates of the labor force increase range between 70,000 and 90,000 over the next 3-5 years (the total labor
force, based on the 2006 Labor Force Survey, is about 230,000).

20

The government’s draft Economic Development Policy (under discussion by Parliament) aims to create a
framework for strong private sector development, including promoting entrepreneurship, generating
employment, diversifying exports, and enhancing economic self-reliance.

18
investment, in particular relaxing the foreign exchange balancing requirement, would also
help attract stable investment.21
E. Staff Appraisal
24.
Anchored by hydropower sector development, Bhutan’s strong growth
performance has been supported by prudent economic management, firm donor
support, and political stability. The 9th Plan succeeded in lowering poverty, raising per
capita income, and improving social indicators. The 10th Plan builds on these successes with
a wide-ranging development agenda, including further poverty reduction through industrial,
private sector, and infrastructure development. The challenge is to achieve these goals while
maintaining economic and financial stability.
25.
The challenges for fiscal policy are to avoid overheating pressures and ensure
debt sustainability. The sharp deterioration in the budgeted 2009/10 fiscal position,
combined with rapid private sector credit growth, risks fueling excess demand and pressuring
rupee reserves. Thus, spending prioritization with a tightening bias is needed, especially as
the reconstruction plan stemming from the recent earthquake, and its financing, solidify.
Also, despite a history of low domestic financing, spending pressures on the new government
are high and require an expansion in the revenue base and careful planning of expenditures.
Despite breaching most LIC-DSA thresholds over the medium term, external debt is
projected to return to a steady downward path after peaking in 2014/15. Given the
concentration of debt in commercially viable hydropower projects, Bhutan’s strong track
record of project implementation, committed donor support and its high level of foreign
reserves, staffs’ assessment is that the external debt dynamics continue to be subject to a
moderate risk of distress.
26.
Aligning monetary policy with the peg with the Indian rupee and
strengthening financial sector supervision are both necessary for economic stability.
Developments in India’s interest rates and consumer prices need to be carefully monitored
and Bhutan’s interest rates appropriately adjusted to avoid policy mismatches and
unwarranted pressures on rupee reserves. Active liquidity management, facilitated by
periodic T-bill issuance at market-driven interest rates, would aid monetary transmission.
The impending entry of new financial institutions—a much needed development—should
also help improve liquidity distribution. But the new banks could also trigger further credit
growth which, in combination with the high NPLs and credit risks in the banking sector,
requires strengthened financial sector supervision to avoid deepening financial sector
vulnerabilities.

21

The foreign exchange balancing requirement restricts the ability of foreign investors to remit profits unless
the foreign exchange earnings of their investments in Bhutan more than cover their remittance amount.

19
27.
Adopting clear guidelines for reserve management would help improve the
currency composition of reserves. While the rupee credit lines with India are helpful to
overcome the periodic pressures on rupee reserves, it is also important to adopt clear reserve
management guidelines that harmonize currency composition of reserves with external
liabilities and import demand. Expanding non-hydropower exports to India would also help
increase rupee receipts.
28.
A vibrant private sector is essential for job creation. Providing employment
opportunities for the projected large increase in the labor force requires developing skill sets
that match the job opportunities. To reduce the dependence on the civil service as the
preferred employer, an enabling environment for private sector development is essential.
Improving private sector’s access to finance where needed, including through a commercial
paper market for inter-corporate borrowing, would facilitate such development.
29.
Staff recommends eliminating the restrictions subject to approval under
Article VIII, and removing restrictions maintained under Article XIV as soon as the
balance of payments position permits. Staff does not recommend approval of the
restrictions subject to Fund approval under Article VIII as the authorities have not provided a
timeframe for the removal of these restrictions. With the expected improvement in the
convertible currency position, eliminating these restrictions should be feasible. However,
given the volatile and unpredictable nature of these flows, a more gradual approach would be
needed.
30.

It is recommended that Bhutan remain on a 24-month Article IV consultation cycle.

Bhutan is an IDA-only country, and qualifies for 100 percent credits for FY10 and FY11. In
FY09, Bhutan borrowed from IDA in a mix of 55 percent credits and 45 percent grants. In FY10,
Bhutan exceeded the IDA Gross National Income per capita operational cutoff for the third year
in a row, and has become a “gap” country. “Gap” countries receive IDA on hardened terms and
are not eligible for grants, regardless of results of Debt Sustainability Analyses. Bhutan’s
original IDA 15 allocation for FY10 and FY11 was about SDR8.3 million in each year.
However, in FY09, Bhutan had the option of cumulatively frontloading up to 80 percent of its
overall IDA15 indicative allocation for FY09-11, and chose to frontload about SDR 5.7 million,
to add to its FY09 allocation of SDR8.0 million. Because of frontloading in FY09, Bhutan is left
with a final IDA15 allocation of SDR8.3 million for FY10 and an indicative IDA 15 allocation
of SDR2.1 million for FY11.

World Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy
The 2005 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the FY06-09 period aligned with Bhutan’s
distinctive vision of Gross National Happiness and the priorities and goals of the Ninth
Five-Year Plan (9FYP) (2002/03–2007/08, extended by one year). The National Assembly
finalized the Tenth Five-Year Plan (10FYP) (2008/09–2012/13) in January 2009. This is also the
RGoB’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. The strategic priorities for the 10FYP are: (i)
vitalizing industry; (ii) strengthening national spatial planning; (iii) synergizing rural-urban
development; (iv) expanding strategic infrastructure; (v) investing in human capital; and (vi)
fostering an enabling environment through good governance. A new Country Assistance Strategy
for FY10-14, aligned with the 10FYP, is currently under preparation for presentation to the
Bank’s Board in the fourth quarter of FY10. The new CAS is likely to focus on fostering private
sector development by improving the policy environment and facilitating employment
opportunities, and social infrastructure development by expanding access to and improving the
quality of infrastracture (roads, urban, and ICT) in an environmentally sustainable manner.
Lending Program
During the IDA 14 cycle, covering F06-08, more than SDR32 million in grants were committed
to Bhutan. The IDA 14 allocation financed: (i) a US$15 million First Development Policy
Grant approved in May 2006; (ii) a US$10 million Second Rural Access Roads Project
approved in April 2007; (iii) a US$12 million Second Development Policy Grant approved in
June 2007; (iv) a US$8 million Private Sector Development Project approved in June 2007; (v)
a US$1.5 million Institutional Capacity Building Project for Procurement approved in June
2008; and (vi) US$1.5 million in additional financing to the Education Development Project.
The following operations have been approved or are under preparation during the IDA 15 cycle,
covering FY09-11.


The Board approved the US$20.22 million Development Policy Financing for
Institutional Strengthening in May 2009. The overarching objectives of the operation
are to strengthen institutions to: (a) promote good governance through sound fiscal and
public financial management and procurement, and strong accountability institutions; (b)
foster dynamic labor markets, ensure skills match, and generate employment; and (c)
expand access to infrastructure in an environmentally sustainable manner.



A proposed Second Urban Development Project is currently scheduled for delivery to
the Bank’s Board in the fourth quarter of FY10. The proposed project development
objectives are to: (a) support Bhutan’s municipal reform program to achieve a more
decentralized and accountable urban local government system, starting in Thimphu and
Phuentsholing; and (b) improve infrastructure services in northern Thimphu where no
formal services are currently available. The first objective supports the RGoB’s
municipal reform agenda and helps implement the Bhutan Municipal Act of 2007 through

6
technical assistance, policy support, training programs, and studies. The second objective
addresses an urgent need for serviced urban land in rapidly growing Thimphu City, in
view of the substantial migrant population settling there.
In addition, the First Development Policy Credit is under preparation, expected to be delivered
to the Bank’s Board in early-FY11. This is designed as the first in a new programmatic series of
budgetary operations, in support of the RGoB’s medium term reform agenda as articulated in the
10FYP. In addition, the RGoB continues to implement projects with IDA financing to expand the
rural access road network, and to improve education and health outcomes.
Nonlending Program
The Bank provides analytical and advisory services, aiming to help the Government build
capacity in the areas of macroeconomic and fiscal analysis, public expenditure management,
financial management, procurement, private sector development, statistics, and education
quality. During FY06-08, the Bank approved several grants supporting these efforts. A US$7.66
million Sustainable Land Management Project, and a US$2.5 million National Influenza
Preparedness and Response Project were both financed from global trust funds. A Trust Fund
for Statistical Capacity Building (US$250,000) was approved in FY07. Institutional
Development Fund (IDF) Grants to support Introduction of Multi-Year Rolling Budgets
(US$330,000), Improving Public Financial Management (US$290,000), and Strengthening
Institution Capacity for Implementation of Environmental Safeguards (US$400,000)
became effective in this period.
The Bank approved a new grant for Bhutan in FY09.


A US$484,000 IDF Grant for Strengthening of the Public Procurement Policy
Division was approved in April 2009. The development objective of this Grant is to put
in place the foundations for the creation of a professional and efficient center of
excellence within government that can manage the public procurement function in
Bhutan on a sustainable basis. The RGoB approved the creation of the Public
Procurement Policy Division (PPPD) under the Department of National Properties,
Ministry of Finance, in August 2008. This newly created division needs to be
strengthened so that it can start fulfilling its mandates, and the Grant will provide
assistance in this respect.

International Finance Corporation (IFC)
Since the Kingdom of Bhutan joined IFC as a member country in 2003, IFC has made
investments in high-end tourism infrastructure and global trade finance support to local banks.
IFC continues to assess investment potential for IFC in the following areas: education, telecom,
hydropower, and financial markets. In addition, IFC has provided advisory services in areas to
improve the investment climate, strengthen the financial sector, and help promote the role of

7
SMEs in private sector development. Below are summaries of IFC Investment and Advisory
activities in Bhutan.
IFC Investment Services
As on August 31, 2009, IFC has US$8.2 million of senior debt outstanding in one tourism
project in Bhutan. IFC is committed to the development of the financial sector of Bhutan. To
demonstrate the same, IFC has extended lines of trade guarantee under the Global Trade Finance
Program (GTFP) to both the banks operating in the country presently, namely Bank of Bhutan
(BoB) and Bhutan National Bank (BNB). IFC is keen to explore further opportunities including
participation in equity. With respect to IFC’s exposure limits for Bhutan, it has further room
available allowing up to about US$25 million of additional investment in Bhutan.
IFC Advisory Services
Since 2003, South Asia Enterprise Development Facility (SEDF), which is managed by IFC
Advisory Services in South Asia in partnership with DFID and NORAD, has been delivering
advisory services focused on improving existing banks’ operations and the banking infrastructure
and improving the investment climate by creating transparent and efficient regimes for both
domestic and foreign investors to encourage job creation. In addition, IFC Infrastructure
Advisory has been and will continue to explore opportunities to advise the RGoB on bankable
PPP options to involve private sector in infrastructure projects being considered.
Access to Finance (A2F) Program
SEDF has provided training programs targeting senior officials of the Royal Monetary Authority
(RMA) and other senior bankers from leading financial institutions such as Bank of Bhutan
(BOB), Bhutan National Bank (BNB), Bhutan Development Finance Corporation Ltd. (BDFC),
and Royal Insurance Corporation of Bhutan (RICB). In addition, SEDF has provided advisory
services to BoB and BNB on their risk management, IT strategy, and long-term strategies; both
of these banks are at various stages of implementing the recommendations from this advisory
work. SEDF, in close coordination with WB, prepared the RMA's nationwide Electronic Funds
Transfer Clearing System Strategy paper; it is envisaged that WB under its PSD program will
use this strategy to implement the required financial infrastructure (e.g., hardware and software
procurement, installation and setup). Furthermore, SEDF has explored with local financial
institutions the possibility to introduce Sustainable Energy Finance (SEF) in Bhutan.
Investment Climate (IC) Program
SEDF assisted the Royal Government of Bhutan (RGoB) in reviewing the FDI Policy and
welcomed improved clarity and attractiveness of the proposed regime. In addition, SEDF
assisted RGoB with optimization of the company registration process, and now is working to

8
improve efficiency of business entry including enterprise registration and obtaining permits to
start operations. SEDF and the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MoEA) are drafting the Enterprise
Act, as well as work with inter-ministerial working group to compile the inventory of sectoral
clearances and assess possibilities for streamlining through one-stop-shop solutions.
Furthermore, SEDF will work with WB PSD to undertake an Investment Climate Assessment
(ICA) survey of enterprises in order to inform private sector strategy and future IC initiatives.
Infrastructure Program
IFC Advisory Services has conducted an operational and financial diagnostic review of Drukair,
the national airline, and has presented an assessment of various strategic options that the
Government shareholder should consider for the airline to achieve its overarching objectives of
air connectivity and sustainable commercial operations. In addition, SEDF, at RGoB’s request,
undertook a Preliminary Assessment of two sites located in southern Bhutan proposed for
development of industrial estates or potential Special Economic Zones (SEZ).

III. BHUTAN—RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
Bhutan became a member in 1982 and ADB began its lending operations to the country in
1983. Bhutan is classified under group “A” with full access to ADF and 80 percent
cost-sharing limit for project financing.
Consistent with the highest priorities identified in Bhutan’s National Poverty Reduction and
ADB’s Country Strategy and Program (CSP) approved in September 2005, the CSP has
two strategic thrusts: (i) lending assistance focused on transport, power (including rural
electrification), urban development, and financial and private sector development; and
(ii) nonlending assistance for capacity building for sustainable development.
The CSP is being implemented in coordination with other development partners to avoid
duplication. Examples include ADB’s rural electrification loans following the Rural
Electrification Master Plan developed with assistance from the Government of Japan.
Similarly, development partners are using the Road Sector Master Plan developed with ADB
assistance. ADB has maintained close cooperation with other multilateral and bilateral
funding agencies in capacity building.
The indicative cumulative value for the period 2010−2012 is $45 million. One grant project
on rural electrification using a multitranche financing facility has been programmed for 2010
with its second subproject programmed for 2011. A rural road infrastructure project is on the
pipeline for 2012. A nonlending program with a cumulative value of $5.1 million has been
programmed for 2010−2012.

IV. BHUTAN —STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
As of November 15, 2009
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but broadly adequate for surveillance. Most affected areas are:
national accounts, balance of payments, and fiscal data.
National Accounts: The accuracy and reliability of the data are affected by inadequate source data. Key
shortcomings include heavy reliance on production data collected by line ministries, which often lack quality
control, long lags in providing estimates, large revisions of historical data and, in certain cases, ad hoc
estimation procedures. Lack of reliable data on expenditure components hampers estimation of national savings
and domestic investment. The key factors contributing to the data deficiency are the shortage of qualified
personnel and facilities. The National Statistical Bureau (NSB) is also constrained by the absence of a Statistics
Act. The March 2004 Multisector Statistics Mission assisted the authorities in preparing metadata and plans for
improving the macroeconomic statistics and sociodemographic indicators.
Price statistics: Starting in 2004, the consumer price index (CPI) is compiled on a quarterly basis, the number
of commodity prices has been greatly expanded, and the geographical scope broadened.

Government finance statistics: Despite recent improvements in the quality of government finance statistics
(GFS), the fiscal data are subject to frequent and substantial revisions, particularly in the expenditure area. The
compilation and dissemination of budget execution data and GFS are very limited. Only annual budget
execution data are compiled and disseminated, but with a long lag. No GFS are disseminated nationally.
Sub-annual data on budget execution are not available. There are inconsistencies between the fiscal and
monetary data with regard to bank financing, stemming from differences in the definition of government.

Monetary statistics: While monetary statistics are generally consistent with the Fund’s guidelines, there is
room for improvement in a number of areas, specifically: (i) the valuation of financial assets is based on
purchase price while market or market-price equivalents would be preferable; (ii) to avoid misclassifications, a
list of government units and nonfinancial public enterprises should be prepared and shared with the reporting
financial institutions; (iii) the monetary accounts for the RMA and other deposits money banks should be
published in the Monthly Statistical Bulletin. The authorities and STA are working to improve the timeliness of
data reporting to STA to be in line with national publications.

Balance of payments: Despite recent improvements, external statistics continue to be affected by
shortcomings. These include (i) limited coverage of transactions leading to estimation of key data, (ii)
compilation of trade data on a calendar year basis, while other external transactions are compiled on a fiscal
year basis. Consequently, errors and omissions in the balance of payments presentations are large and preclude
a more accurate assessment of external flows.
Building on the technical assistance mission in January-February 2005, a mission in June 2009, in conjunction
with the RMA, developed a plan for improvement in balance of payments statistics. It includes a quarterly
business survey, improved estimation methods, and increased timeliness. The RMA advised that they plan to
compile quarterly balance of payments data in the future. Bhutan began supplying balance of payments data for
publication in IFS in June 2007.

Dissemination System (GDDS) in 2010.

BHUTAN
Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis 20091
Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association
Approved by Laura Papi and Dhaneshwar Ghura (IMF)
Carlos Primo Braga and Ernesto May (IDA)
December 7, 2009
Bhutan’s external and public debt dynamics are analyzed within the IMF-World Bank Debt
Sustainability Framework for Low Income Countries (LIC-DSA).2 Bhutan’s rapid
hydropower development will lead to a substantial buildup of external debt, with debt ratios
breaching some of the country-specific LIC-DSA indicative thresholds. However, given the
commercial viability of the hydropower projects, Bhutan’s strong track record of project
implementation, committed donor support and its high level of international reserves, staff’s
assessment is that the external debt dynamics continue to be subject to a moderate risk of
distress. Nevertheless, the results of the DSA underscore the importance of containing
domestically financed fiscal deficits and sustaining economic growth going forward to
ensure a declining debt profile.
I. BACKGROUND
1.
Bhutan’s public and publicly guaranteed debt declined to 69 percent of GDP at
end 2008/09, 19 percentage points of GDP below its 2003/04 peak.3’4 The sharp decline in
public debt was driven by the completion of the Tala hydropower project that was financed
1

This DSA was prepared jointly by the IMF and the World Bank, in consultation with the Asian Development
Bank, and in accordance with the Debt Sustainability Framework for low-income countries approved by the
Executive Boards of the IMF and the IDA. The data underlying the analysis are from the Bhutanese authorities and
IMF and World Bank staff estimates.

See “Debt Sustainability in Low-Income Countries: Proposals for an Operational Framework and Policy
Implications” (http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/sustain/2004/020304.htm), “Debt Sustainability in LowIncome Countries: Further Considerations on an Operational Framework and Policy Implications”
(http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/sustain/2004/091004.htm) and reference to “Staff Guidance Note on the
Application of the Joint Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries.”

Public debt does not include state-owned enterprise debt, with the exception of hydropower projects loans and
the purchase of one aircraft for state-owned Druk Air in 2004/05.

by India, which boosted economic output by 20 percent in 2007, and by the onset of the
repayment of the associated rupee debt. Reflecting the favorable fiscal outturns in recent
years, domestic debt, all denominated in local currency and held by domestic financial
institutions, has also declined.5 External debt, which accounts for more than 97 percent of
total public debt, continues to be dominated by the mostly Indian rupee-denominated
hydropower sector debt (36 percent of GDP and 54 percent of external debt). Convertible
currency debt, accounting for 44 percent of external debt, declined to 29 percent of GDP.6
The actual outturn of public debt indicators for 2007/08 and 2008/09 was slightly more
favorable than projected in the previous DSA, as better than expected fiscal balances
compensated for the more rapid accumulation in rupee debt and the downward revision of
historical nominal GDP figures.

II. UNDERLYING DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS ASSUMPTIONS
2.
Under the baseline scenario, Bhutan pursues its planned expansion in its power
generation capacity.7 In addition to the Punatsangchu I and Dagachu projects, included in
the 2007 DSA, the baseline scenario incorporates two new hydropower projects,
Punatsangchu II and Mangdechu.8 Both projects will be financed by the Government of India

5

Domestic debt data compiled by the Royal Government of Bhutan include fixed rate debt relating to the
purchase of one airplane for state-owned Druk Air in 2004/05, amounting to about half of total domestic debt.
6

Convertible currency debt mainly comprises loans from multilateral institutions, including $9½ million
commercial debt extended by the IFC, making all external debt public or publicly guaranteed.
7

The new hydropower development policy of Bhutan outlines 10 potential hydropower projects, which would
quintuple Bhutan’s power generation capacity by adding further 10,000 MW of installed capacity by 2020 out
of the estimated potential capacity of 23,760 MW. However, since most of these projects are at early stages of
conception, they are not included in the projections.
8

Puna II’s power generation capacity will be 992 MW, while Mangdechu’s will be 672 MW. The financing
terms for both projects are yet to be finalized, however they are expected to be similar to Puna I’s with
30 percent grants, and 70 percent loan in Indian rupees at 11 percent interest rate from the GOI . Debt service
will begin after the commissioning of the projects and will continue for 12 years. Similar to Tala and Puna I, the
interest payments accumulated during construction are expected to be repaid after the project completion
without being capitalized.

3
(GOI) through a combination of loans and grants.9 The intergovernmental agreements are
expected to be finalized and signed by end-2009 and project disbursements to begin in
2009/10. Repayments will start after the projects come on stream in 2019. External financing
for non-hydropower sector activities is expected to remain predominantly from multilateral
and bilateral donors at concessional terms.

The hydropower sector will also govern the rest of the economy as summarized
by the following key baseline macroeconomic assumptions.


Real sector: Similar to the spike in real GDP when Tala was commissioned in
2006/07, Puna I, Mangdechu and Puna II will substantially boost economic growth as
they come on stream in 2016/17, 2018/19 and 2019/20, respectively. In the interim,
growth will be supported by the hydropower construction activities and the
commissioning of Dagachu in 2013/14. Real growth excluding hydropower-related
activity is projected to hover between 5-6 percent. Inflation is expected to remain in
line with price developments in India, with the ngultrum pegged to the Indian rupee.



Fiscal sector: Upon completion, the hydropower projects will boost the domestic
revenue-to-GDP ratio, which also benefits from a gradual broadening of the tax base
and improvement in tax administration.10 External budgetary aid, on the other hand, is

9

Although strictly speaking the financing of hydropower projects is non-concessional (i.e., below the usual
35% grant element for LICs), there is a certain level of concessionality stemming from the grant portion of
financing and the exemption from payment of interest during construction. In addition, as discussed in footnote
11, a higher discount rate to calculate the present value of the rupee loans may be appropriate in view of the
higher inflation and risk-free long-term interest rates in India, which would further raise the grant element of
these loans.
10

Measures to broaden the tax base and improve administration include rationalizing sales and customs tax
rates, broadening the sales tax base and eventually introducing the VAT. Further domestic revenue
improvements could be achieved by harmonizing the direct income tax rates and limiting tax holidays.

projected to decline sharply as a share of GDP as Bhutan’s per capita income rises.
On average, the overall fiscal deficit remains broadly balanced over the long term.


External sector: The current account is projected to deteriorate over the medium term
due to Tala’s debt service and the higher import demand associated with the
construction phase of the new hydropower projects. In the long run, as electricity
exports more than quadruple, the power sector contributes to balance of payment
surpluses.

III. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
A. Baseline
4.
Bhutan’s external debt will continue to trace the cycles of the hydropower
sector. The PV of external debt as a share of GDP is projected to rise by 47 percentage
points between 2009/10 and 2014/15 as disbursements for new hydropower projects pick
up.11 The debt ratios remain above the LIC-DSA indicative threshold for strong policy
performance countries until 2022/23 for the PV of external debt to GDP, and until 2017/18–
2019/20 for the PV of external debt as a share of exports and revenue.12 The commissioning
of the new hydropower projects, which also marks the start of the debt repayment, puts the
debt ratios on a steady downward trajectory.
5.
The debt service-to-export ratio is expected to remain below the indicative
thresholds for the entire projection period. The debt service-to-revenue ratio may
11

The PV of external debt is calculated assuming the standard discount rate of 4 percent for both rupee and
convertible currency debt. Using a discount rate for rupee denominated debt of 11.25 percent in view of the
higher inflation and risk-free long-term interest rates in India, lowers the various PV of debt ratios substantially:
the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio peaks at 89 percent, while the PV of debt-to-revenue ratio peaks at 430 percent in
2014/15. The PV of debt-to-exports ratio remains below the indicative threshold.

12

Bhutan, with an average 2006-08 Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index of 3.86, is
currently classified as a strong performer with regard to its policies and institutions. The indicative thresholds
for strong performers are 50, 200 and 300 for the PV of debt in percent of GDP, exports, and revenue
respectively, and 25 and 35 for debt service in percent of exports and revenue.

5
temporarily breach the indicative threshold as Puna II and Mangdechu’s debt service begins;
however, it is expected to remain below the threshold for the rest of the projection period.
The high level of foreign reserves, projected to average 10 months of imports and 50 percent
of GDP over the period when indicative thresholds are breached (i.e. 2009/10-2023/24),
provides further cushion in the unlikely event of debt repayment difficulties.
B. Sensitivity Analysis
6.
Bhutan’s external debt profile is sustainable under most alternative scenarios.
While the debt ratios are most vulnerable to exchange rate and export growth shocks, as well
as unfavorable financing terms, under almost all alternative scenarios considered the debt
ratios decline over time, and eventually fall below the thresholds. In case of a 30 percent
nominal depreciation in 2009/10, the PV of debt rises to more than 170 percent of GDP and
835 percent of revenue. The debt service-to-revenue ratio is also negatively impacted.
However, the exchange rate shock overestimates Bhutan's debt vulnerability since a large
share of Bhutan's receipts are in Indian rupees which act as a natural hedge to the rupeedenominated debt.13 The export growth shock and higher financing terms for new public
sector borrowing also increase the various debt ratios.
IV. PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
A. Baseline
7.
The baseline public debt dynamics follows closely that of the external debt. The
public debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to rise until the commissioning of the new hydropower
projects and then rapidly decline until it reaches 32 percent of GDP by end 2029/30. In light
of Bhutan’s strong economic performance, external financing is projected to shrink as a share
of GDP, making room for domestic financial markets to play a larger role in financing the
development agenda. Domestic debt is projected to reach about 11 percent of GDP by
2015/16 and be contained below that level as share of GDP for the remainder of the
projection period.
B. Sensitivity Analysis
8.
The public debt ratios remain on a declining path over the long term under
various stress tests. Not surprisingly, given the large share of external debt in total public
debt and the analysis above, overall public debt is most vulnerable to shocks to the exchange
rate. A one time depreciation results in an upward shift in the various public debt indicators
without affecting the shape of the debt indicators’ path. However, the sensitivity analysis
suggests that under a historical scenario, public sector debt will rise and remain at an elevated
13

Staff estimates that rupee denominated revenues will account for more than 40 percent of the non-grant fiscal
revenue over the projection period.

6
level over the long-term. This scenario, which assumes a constant primary deficit of 2.2
percent of GDP (compared to the projected primary surplus of 3.8 percent of GDP over the
20 year period), underscores the importance of containing fiscal deficits to ensure the
sustainability of public debt.
V. STAFF ASSESSMENT
9.
The assessment made in the 2007 IMF/World Bank Joint DSA—that Bhutan’s
debt dynamics are sustainable but subject to a moderate risk of distress—still holds.


The addition of the two new hydropower projects leads to a substantial build-up in
external debt, relative to the analysis in the 2007 DSA. The policy-related LIC-DSA
thresholds are breached for several of the indicators and remain breached for a longer
period of time compared to the previous analysis. However, the additional projects
bring strong economic dividends, boosting average real GDP growth and exports.
Real GDP growth and growth of exports of goods and services are projected to
average 6.2 percent and 11.2 percent respectively over 2013/14-2027/28, compared to
5.2 percent and 8.6 percent in the 2007 IMF/World Bank Joint DSA.14 Moreover,
despite the large increase in the stock of debt, the addition of the new hydropower
projects does not bring in substantial vulnerabilities with regards to debt servicing.

1/ Period averages are shown for years except for hydro projects commissioning.

Furthermore, the mitigating factors that were highlighted in the 2007 assessment
remain valid, namely:

Focusing on the average growth over a 20 year period, which appears little affected by the addition of the new
hydropower projects, understates the economic impact of these projects. At commissioning, these projects will
generate large spikes in real GDP growth, boost incomes and exports; however, with generation capacity fixed,
the impact on growth after commissioning will be limited.

7
 Bhutan has a strong track record of project implementation as detailed in the 2007
DSA suggesting that the new hydropower projects are subject to low implementation
risk.
 The new hydropower projects are commercially viable. Puna I is expected to have
smaller real costs of construction than Tala for a larger generation capacity, leading to
a higher internal rate of return. Similarly Puna II and Mangdechu are expected to
have a solid internal rate of return of about 11-14 percent.
 Bhutan maintains close economic and political ties with India which mitigate the
commercial risks of these projects. India has been both the main provider of financing
for hydropower projects and the main consumer of the projects’ output. Going
forward, India’s favorable economic outlook and its sizeable power deficit will
continue to support the demand for Bhutan’s hydropower. This is reflected in India’s
commitment to developing 10,000 MW of hydropower in Bhutan by the year 2020
and its pledge of Rs 100 billion support over the 10th Plan Period.

1/ The most extreme stress test is the test that yields the highest ratio in 2019/20. In figure b. it
corresponds to a One-time depreciation shock; in c. to a Exports shock; in d. to a One-time depreciation
shock; in e. to a Exports shock and in figure f. to a One-time depreciation shock
2/ The shape of the grant element of new borrowing reflects the composition of new loans. Under the
standard DSA assumptions, rupee debt appears nonconcessional since its interest rate of 11 percent
exceeds the 4 percent discount rate. Thus, until 2018/19, when
rupee disbursements dominate external financing, the grant element seems low. However, it
starts rising once the rupee financed hydropower projects are completed, and concessional
loans from multilateral and bilateral development partners take stage.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline, while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the
baseline. This shock is applied only to non-rupee new borrowing.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level
after the shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 30, 2009

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation
with Bhutan
On December 15, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Bhutan.1
Background
Bhutan’s smooth historic transformation into a parliamentary democracy completed in
July 2008, together with prudent economic management, strong donor support, and
hydropower sector development delivered an average growth of 9½ percent during the
9th Five Year Plan. Poverty declined to 23 percent and various social indicators
improved. The global financial turmoil’s economic impact was small due to Bhutan’s
limited global integration; adverse effects were felt in tourism and select manufacturing
industries exposed to the decline in commodity prices. Consistent with the strong trade
ties with India, inflation has been tracking developments in India’s consumer prices,
averaging 5 percent in the 9th Plan period and just above 7 percent in 2008/09. The
10th Plan (2008−2013) builds on the successes of the 9th Plan and is pursuing a wideranging development agenda to further reduce poverty by promoting industrial, regional,
private sector, hydropower, and infrastructure development.
Fiscal policy has been anchored by keeping current spending below domestic revenue.
Despite the volatility in both revenue and expenditure arising partly from uncertainty in
foreign aid flows, a small current operating surplus (excluding grants) and an overall
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings
up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

deficit of 2.7 percent of GDP were achieved in the 9th Plan period. For 2008/09,
provisional numbers indicate a surplus in both measures. There is, however, a sharp
increase in the deficit to 7.6 percent of GDP in the 2009/10 budget, due to increases in
current spending (including the 35 percent wage hike for civil servants from January
2009 and increases in spending on goods and services), a rise in capital spending, and
stagnant domestic revenue. As a result, domestic financing is projected to rise to more
than 7 percent of GDP in 2009/10 compared with close to zero in the previous year.
Bhutan’s large and volatile trade deficits have been offset by sizeable foreign aid flows,
resulting in a balance of payments (BOP) surplus and reserve accumulation. The BOP
surplus has averaged about 8 percent of GDP over the last few years and international
reserves stand at about $758 million. However, the composition of reserves between
convertible currencies and Indian rupees is highly skewed towards the former; this is a
concern as high development spending, rapid credit growth, and hydropower-related
imports are fueling rupee demand. The two rupee credit lines with India have helped tide
over rupee shortfalls arising from mismatches between rupee inflows and outflows.
Excess liquidity in the banking system has been substantially reduced because of
measures taken by the Royal Monetary Authority (RMA). The RMA increased the cash
reserve requirement from 13 percent to 18 percent during 2007/08, hiked the RMA
discount rate from 3½ to 6 percent, and increased the volume of RMA discount bills. An
increase in credit by the bank where excess liquidity has historically resided and the
sweeping of government accounts by the RMA also contributed to reducing the excess
liquidity.
With rapid credit growth—averaging about 30 percent over the last decade—banks’
asset quality is now showing signs of vulnerability. The capital base remains adequate;
but non-performing loans have doubled between December 2008 and June 2009 to
18 percent, reflecting the impact of volatile commodity prices on the ferrous-alloy and
steel industries. Credit is also concentrated in a few sectors and financial sector
vulnerabilities arise from asset-liability mismatches.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for the strong economic performance
anchored by hydropower sector development, and supported by prudent economic
management, firm donor support, and political stability. Directors welcomed the
successes of the 9th Plan, including lowering poverty, raising per capita income, and
improving social indicators. They noted the comprehensive development agenda of the
10th Plan, and considered the challenge was to achieve the Plan goals while
maintaining economic and financial stability.
Directors considered the main fiscal challenges were to avoid overheating pressures
and ensure debt sustainability. They noted that the sharp deterioration in the budgeted
2009/10 fiscal position, combined with rapid private sector credit growth, risked fueling

3
excess demand and pressuring rupee reserves. Directors stressed the need for
spending prioritization with a tightening bias in the short term, and an expansion in the
revenue base and careful planning of expenditures over the medium term. Noting the
concentration of external debt in commercially viable hydropower projects and Bhutan’s
strong track record of project implementation, Directors concluded that Bhutan’s risk of
external debt distress remains moderate.
Directors agreed that aligning monetary policy with the peg with the Indian rupee and
strengthening financial sector supervision are both necessary for economic stability.
Developments in India’s interest rates and consumer prices need to be carefully
monitored and Bhutan’s interest rates appropriately adjusted to avoid policy mismatches
and unwarranted pressures on rupee reserves. They also noted that active liquidity
management, facilitated by periodic T-bill issuance at market-driven interest rates, would
aid monetary transmission. Directors welcomed the impending entry of new financial
institutions, which should also help improve liquidity distribution. But they emphasized
that the new banks could also trigger further credit growth which, in combination with the
high NPLs and credit risks in the banking sector, calls for strengthened financial sector
supervision to avoid deepening financial sector vulnerabilities.
Directors underscored the importance of adopting clear guidelines for reserve
management to help improve the currency composition of reserves. While the rupee
credit lines with India are helpful to overcome the periodic pressures on rupee reserves,
it is also important to adopt clear reserve management guidelines that harmonize
currency composition of reserves with external liabilities and import demand. They noted
that expanding non-hydropower exports to India would also help boost rupee receipts.
Directors supported developing a vibrant private sector for job creation. Providing
employment opportunities for the projected large increase in the labor force would
require developing skill sets that match the job opportunities. Moreover, to reduce the
dependence on the civil service as the preferred employer, an enabling environment for
private sector development is essential. Directors noted that improving private sector’s
access to finance where needed, including through a commercial paper market for intercorporate borrowing, would facilitate such development.
Directors encouraged the authorities to eliminate the restrictions subject to approval
under Article VIII, and remove restrictions maintained under Article XIV as soon as the
balance of payments position permits.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or
countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with
member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring,
and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements. PINs are
also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by
the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat Reader to view
