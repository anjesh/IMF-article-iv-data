STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 9, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context: The U.S. economic recovery remains modest but is gaining ground, supported
by a rebound in the housing market, still easy financial conditions, and a boost to
household net worth from higher house and stock prices. These factors are helping to
offset the impact of strong fiscal adjustment on consumer spending. But the economy is
still far from normal conditions, with high unemployment and a large negative output
gap.
Fiscal Policy: The fiscal consolidation should be more balanced and gradual. The
automatic spending cuts (sequester) not only reduce growth in the short term but could
also undermine potential in the medium term through indiscriminate cuts to education
and infrastructure. They should be replaced with back-loaded entitlement savings and
new revenues. Even though the fiscal deficit is declining rapidly, approving a plan to
restore long-run fiscal sustainability remains a priority. Early action is needed for
measures that slow entitlement spending, as their effects build gradually over time.
Monetary Policy: Given the still-large output gap and well-anchored inflation
expectations, the highly accommodative monetary policy stance is appropriate. While
unwinding monetary policy accommodation is likely to present challenges, including for
financial stability, the Fed has a range of tools to help manage the exit. Effective
communication and careful timing will be critical to avoid disruptions, for both the
United States and other countries.
Financial Outlook and Reforms: The protracted period of low interest rates may have
raised vulnerabilities in the financial sector, which warrant close monitoring. While
progress on financial reform has been made, reforms need to be completed in a number
of areas. Domestic reforms should be coordinated with the global financial reform
agenda, as this would help to reduce fragmentation of the global financial regulatory
landscape.

BACKDROP: STILL A MODEST RECOVERY BUT WITH
SOME BRIGHT SPOTS
1.
The U.S. recovery has remained tepid, but underlying fundamentals have been steadily
improving. Last year’s modest growth of 2.2 percent reflects legacy effects from the financial crisis,
continued fiscal consolidation, a weak external environment, and temporary effects of extreme
weather-related events. The economy grew at an annual rate of 1.8 percent in the first quarter of
2013, held down by sharp cuts in public spending, and recent economic indicators suggest that
growth has remained weak in the second quarter of the year. These developments notwithstanding,
the nature of the recovery appears to be changing:


The housing sector has improved significantly. House prices have sharply rebounded, and, as
of May, were about 10 percent above their level a year ago (but still 20 percent below the precrisis peak in nominal terms). While the increase was broad-based nationally, house prices have
generally increased the most in regions where their decline had been the strongest, suggesting
that prices are catching up after the collapse experienced during the Great Recession.
Residential construction has recently grown at a double-digit pace, contributing 0.3 percentage
points (pp) to growth last year, but the level of activity—2½ percent of GDP in 2012—remains
well below its long-term average of 4½ percent.



Household balance sheets strengthened
(see Box 1). In addition to house prices, stock
prices also increased sharply—the stock
market reached a 5-year high in May.
Together with continued progress in
reducing debt, this contributed to a further
improvement in household net worth (Chart).

200 thousand over the first half of 2013, up
from 180 thousand in the previous six
months. The unemployment rate continued to fall from its October 2009 peak of 10 percent to
7.6 percent in June 2013, although much of the improvement reflects lower labor force
participation. The drop in participation can be partly explained by demographic and other longterm trends, but cyclical factors have also played a role, with the share of discouraged workers
significantly above pre-recession levels at 2.7 percent of the working age population.
Meanwhile, long-term unemployment remains close to 40 percent of total unemployment,
about twice the level before the crisis.

The Fed continued to use innovative tools to further ease the monetary policy stance.



After the expiration of “Operation Twist” in December 2012, the Fed announced open-ended
outright purchases of long-term Treasuries at an initial pace of $45 billion a month. These
purchases were in addition to open-ended purchases of mortgage backed securities (MBS) at a
pace of $40 billion a month, which began in September 2012.



At the December 2012 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the Fed also
switched from a date- to a threshold-based forward guidance for the policy rate. Specifically, the
Fed committed to keeping the federal funds rate close to zero at least as long as the
unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent, inflation projected 1–2 years ahead is not above
2½ percent, and longer-term inflation expectations remain well-anchored. The highly
accommodative monetary policy stance has provided key support to the recovery. Based on
staff estimates, the lower long-term yields from unconventional policies resulted in a stimulus
equivalent to a federal funds rate easing (in a setting unconstrained by the zero bound) of
roughly 250 basis points as of end-2012.

With the economic recovery gradually proceeding, the Fed has recently indicated that,

meeting, the Fed noted that if the recent gains in labor market were to continue and the economy
were to pick up in the next quarters, then it would be appropriate to begin scaling back asset
purchases later in 2013 and end them in the middle of 2014. It also noted that such actions would
amount to slowing the pace of further accommodation, rather than tightening the monetary policy
stance. Financial markets have reacted by moving forward their expectations about the start of the
tightening cycle (Chart). As of early July 2013, market expectations are for the tapering of the Large
Scale Asset Purchase (LSAP) program to begin sometime before year-end, and for the first policy
rate increase to occur in late 2014, while the large majority of FOMC members expect such increase
to occur during 2015.

5.
Despite tightening somewhat recently,
financial conditions remain accommodative. As of
early July 2013, stock prices were up over 14 percent
since end-2012. Risk spreads have narrowed through
mid-May, as markets became more optimistic about
growth prospects and global policy actions removed
key tail risks. Bank lending attitudes have continued to
ease in all market segments, although credit
conditions remained relatively tight for mortgages
and, to a smaller extent, small and medium enterprises
(SMEs) (see Selected Issues Chapter 4). Financial
conditions have tightened since May after investors
started pricing in an earlier tightening of monetary
policy. As of early July, long-term Treasury yields had
risen about 100 bps from their trough in May (Chart),
with emerging market currencies, stock markets, and
bond markets experiencing a sizable correction. Still,
financial conditions in the United States remain looser
than 12 months ago (Chart).
6.
Favorable financial conditions and stronger
balance sheets helped private domestic demand
weather both the fiscal-cliff related uncertainty
in late 2012 and the fiscal adjustment so far in
2013. Despite the expiration of the payroll tax cut
and other fiscal policy measures, private
consumption expenditure (PCE) continued to grow
in the first 5 months of 2013 at about the same pace
as in 2012 (1.8 percent, from 1.9 percent during
2012), supported by lower gasoline prices, higher
payrolls, and rising net worth (Chart). In particular,
staff estimates that the 25 percentage points
increase in the household net worth-to-income ratio

(SAAR) in 2013:Q1. Helped by elevated corporate profitability, business fixed investment (particularly
in equipment and software) continued to grow solidly in 2012, but slowed somewhat in 2013.
7.
Inflation has declined sharply in 2013, although expectations remain well anchored
around the Fed’s target. Headline (12-month) CPI inflation slowed to 1.4 percent (year on year)
through May 2013, and core CPI has decelerated to 1.7 percent, from 2.3 percent in May 2012. The
core PCE price index—the Fed’s preferred measure of underlying inflation—increased only
1.1 percent (year on year) in April 2013, a historical low and well below the Fed’s 2 percent target for
longer-run inflation. While to a certain extent the recent deceleration in inflation reflects transitory

Despite a weak external environment, the external trade deficit contracted, reflecting
in particular continuing increases in domestic oil and natural gas production. The non-oil trade
deficit was little changed in 2012 relative to the year before (at about 2.9 percent of GDP), with
slower growth of both imports and exports—the latter reflecting weaker growth in a number of
major trading partners. By contrast, the oil trade deficit decreased to 1.9 percent of GDP in 2012
from 2.2 percent in 2011, in part due to the sharp increase in the domestic production of oil and gas
extracted through non-conventional techniques. The current account deficit declined to 2.8 percent
of GDP in 2012 (from 3 percent of GDP in 2011). While the net international investment position
(NIIP) deteriorated to about 25 percent of GDP, the investment income balance remained positive
during 2012, at around 1½ percent of GDP.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
9.
Growth is expected to remain slow in 2013, before accelerating in 2014. After the
policy-induced soft patch in the first half of this year, activity should gradually pick up in the second
half, with annual average growth for 2013 projected at 1.7 percent, accelerating to 2.7 percent in
2014. The unemployment rate is projected to remain broadly stable during 2013, but to post more
significant decreases in 2014. As the transitory factors that have contributed to lower inflation over
the past year dissipate, inflation is expected to regain some momentum but to remain subdued
given the still wide output gap, with the PCE index below the Fed’s longer-run 2 percent objective
over the next two years. This central scenario rests on the following main assumptions:


Fiscal policy will be a significant drag on growth in 2013, but less so in 2014. The general
government is projected to subtract between 1½ and 1¾ pp from growth this year, in part due
to the continuing implementation of automatic spending cuts and tax increases. The debt
ceiling, which will likely become binding again in the fall, is assumed to be raised without any
disruption to the U.S. and the global economy.



Monetary policy will remain accommodative. Purchases of long-term Treasury bonds and agency
MBS are projected to continue at the current pace through late this year, and then to be scaled
back gradually over the course of 2014. Policy rates are assumed to remain near zero until early
2016, consistent with staff’s macroeconomic forecast. The term premium embedded in longterm Treasury rates is assumed to increase gradually, responding in an orderly fashion to the
Fed’s announcements about the evolution of its asset purchases, contributing to higher longterm yields.



Private domestic demand will continue its recovery from the depth of the Great Recession. Despite
the recent tightening, credit conditions are expected to remain accommodative, as the U.S.
banking sector is generally well capitalized and highly liquid and financing conditions in
securities markets continue to be favorable. Residential investment should continue its recovery
toward levels consistent with trend household



Export growth is projected to remain subdued during 2013 but to pick up somewhat thereafter, in
line with the gradual recovery of global demand projected in the July 2013 World Economic
Outlook (WEO).

10.
Risks to the outlook are still tilted to the downside, although less so than last year (see
the Risk Assessment Matrix in Annex I). Among downside risks are the following:


Private domestic demand could lose some of its recent momentum. In particular, the drag
from fiscal policy could turn out to be greater than expected in our baseline scenario, especially
if the sequester and higher payroll taxes were to have a stronger-than-expected effect on
consumption. Also, lower increases in house prices amid tight mortgage conditions could slow
household deleveraging and delay its positive spillovers to consumption, particularly if the
recent increase in mortgage rates were to continue. A failure to raise the debt ceiling in a timely
fashion would have severe domestic and global repercussions, although the threat of
exceptionally high costs limits the risk of policy slippage in this area.



A worsening of the euro area debt crisis would weigh on U.S. growth. Investor concerns
about adjustment fatigue, political uncertainty, and insufficient euro area-wide backstops can
cause financial stress to reemerge in the euro area periphery. In such a scenario, the U.S. would
be affected through both trade and financial channels, including higher risk aversion and a
stronger U.S. dollar amid safe-haven capital inflows—staff estimates that a 300 bps increase in
the euro area periphery spreads would reduce U.S. output by about ¾ pp during the first year.
The April 2013 WEO has also considered a more benign scenario in which the euro area escapes
the worst of the crisis, but remains stuck in a low growth environment. The spillovers to the
United States would be more limited in this case, with U.S. output lower by about ¼ percent
after two years.

11.
The recovery could also be hurt by a faster-than-projected increase in interest rates—
which would also pose risks to global growth. While it is difficult to see expectations of future
policy rates being revised durably upward in the absence of a faster recovery, there are a few
scenarios where long-term rates could potentially increase more than currently anticipated without
a stronger recovery.


Initial steps taken by the Fed to normalize monetary policy conditions could result in an abrupt
increase in the term premium, should investors rush to offload their Treasury holdings to avoid
greater capital losses down the road. The increase in market turbulence since late May is
illustrative in this regard. The term premium can experience a sharp increase from staff’s
baseline path in the presence of higher uncertainty over the monetary policy stance and
elevated financial market volatility (Selected Issues Chapter 5). Staff simulations using the IMF
Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal (GIMF) model suggest that a 50 bps term premium shock
could lead to an output loss of between ¼ and ½ percent in the United States over two years
depending on its persistence. The international spillovers could be substantial if the spike in
rates were to lead to renewed concerns about global growth, higher global risk aversion, and a

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED STATES

sudden reversal of capital flows to emerging markets, and higher volatility in global financial
markets.


Increased signs of financial market exuberance could also induce a faster normalization of
interest rates than currently projected. There are a few signs that the protracted period of low
interest rates may have led to a weakening in underwriting standards and a rise in balance sheet
leverage, particularly in the corporate credit sector, as well as increased duration, credit, and
liquidity risks in an effort to compensate for diminished returns in the current environment (see
the April 2013 Global Financial Stability Report). To the extent these risks become less
manageable, or unable to be contained through tighter regulation or macroprudential policies,
the Fed might need to reassess the benefits derived from its LSAP program, potentially curtailing
or ceasing asset purchases sooner than anticipated.



A pick-up in inflation expectations could push long term interest rates higher and/or force the
Fed to respond by bringing forward the tightening cycle. With inflation expectations continuing
to be well anchored, however, the probability of an inflation scare in the near term appears quite
low, and may be considered more as a medium-term risk (especially if potential output turned
out to be much lower than estimated). The April 2013 WEO considers a scenario where inflation
pressures start to build in 2014 as U.S. excess capacity is lower than in the baseline. With the Fed
beginning to tighten in 2014, GDP growth in 2016 would be about 2 percentage points lower
than in staff’s baseline.



Over the medium term, lack of further progress on fiscal consolidation could lead to higher
sovereign risk premia. Based on the April 2013 WEO, a 200 bps increase in the sovereign risk
premium would subtract between 1½ and 2½ pp from GDP growth over two years. As
emphasized in the 2013 Spillover Report, such developments would have severe repercussions
on global financial markets, and could lower global growth almost by a similar amount.

12.
There are also upside risks to staff’s baseline scenario. A faster housing market recovery
may jumpstart a virtuous cycle of easier financial conditions, stronger investment, higher wealth
accumulation and consumer demand. In particular, easier mortgage conditions could unleash pentup demand for housing from new households. In

over two years. Also, lower uncertainty and prospects for a faster recovery of consumer demand
could induce businesses to shift more aggressively from cash hoarding towards real investment. In
the medium term, advances in the extraction of oil and gas from unconventional sources could
boost growth more than anticipated, especially if lower domestic energy prices were to significantly
boost the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing (Box 2 and Selected Issues Chapter II).

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Discussions focused on policies to support the recovery, reduce emerging vulnerabilities, and
address key medium-term challenges. In particular, the discussion centered on the appropriate
pace, timing, and composition of fiscal consolidation; the appropriate monetary policy stance, side
effects of unconventional monetary policies, and challenges related to the monetary policy exit; the
merit of additional measures to unclog the housing markets and reduce the risks from persistently
high long-term unemployment; the progress made in the reform of financial regulation, as well as
issues related to the international coordination of regulatory reforms.

A. Outlook
13.
Staff and the authorities broadly concurred
on their views about the economic outlook, with
some differences in particular on medium-term
forecasts for long-term U.S. Treasury bond yields.
The authorities’ projections (as reflected in the FY2014
federal budget proposal) assume that GDP growth
will reach 2.3 percent this year, somewhat above the
1.7 percent projected by staff, in part due to different
assumptions regarding fiscal withdrawal but also the
recent downward revision of GDP growth in 2013:Q1,
which is reflected only in staff’s forecast. Both staff
and authorities expect growth to pick up from 2014,
and views on the medium term have greatly
converged since the last Article IV (Chart). That said,
notable differences remain in terms of the interest
rate forecast, with staff expecting the 10-year
Treasury rate to increase to about 5¾ percent in the
medium term (about 1 pp above the authorities’
forecasts), as policy interest rates gradually return to
more neutral levels and Treasury yields (so far
compressed by strong safe haven flows and Fed
purchases) price a modest penalty for the much

acknowledging significant uncertainty in projecting medium-term interest rates, the authorities
argued that there is no evidence of a “debt penalty” in current market rates, and over the medium
term the Administration’s budget plan would place the debt ratio on a downward path anyway.

B. Fiscal Policy
14.
There was broad consensus between the authorities and staff that the pace of fiscal
consolidation was too fast this year. Staff noted that its projected 2½ percent of GDP reduction of
the general government structural primary deficit is too high given the fragile recovery and limited
room for monetary policy offset; a deficit reduction of some 1 percentage point of GDP would have
been more appropriate. The authorities noted that the Administration’s budget proposal was
consistent with the staff’s recommendation, but

raising the pace of fiscal consolidation (Chart).1
15.
The authorities felt that the main short-term priority is to replace the sequester with a
back-loaded set of revenue-raising and targeted expenditure-saving policies, although
prospects for Congressional action remain unclear. Staff agreed, noting that the indiscriminate
expenditure cuts not only exert a heavy toll on growth in the short term (reducing this year’s growth
by some ½ percentage points of GDP), but could also reduce medium-term potential growth by
reducing infrastructure, science, and education spending. Moreover, the reduction falls heavily on
discretionary spending while failing to address entitlement programs, the key drivers of deficits over
the longer term. The authorities broadly concurred with this assessment and clarified that from
FY2014 onward, the cuts required by the sequester—if still in place—would be implemented
through caps on aggregate spending, thus providing some flexibility to reallocate funds and protect
priority expenditures. Staff agreed with the authorities that measures to boost infrastructure
investment, adopt training programs targeted at long-term unemployed, and support the housing
market recovery remain desirable at this stage of the economic cycle.

Some of the strength was likely due to cyclical and one-off factors such as shifting of tax payments in anticipation
of higher marginal tax rates from January 2013.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

16.
Staff expressed concerns that, despite the substantial deficit reduction in recent years,
the U.S. fiscal position remains unsustainable over the long term. The general government
deficit has more than halved from over 13 percent of GDP in 2009 to a projected 5.9 percent of GDP
in 2013. In the staff’s baseline scenario, the budget deficit will continue to shrink over the next few
years due to a cyclical rebound in revenues, savings from legislated measures, and lower defense
spending. Gross general government debt would peak at around 110 percent of GDP and start
declining in 2015, also thanks to the favorable interest rate-growth differential reflecting still-low
interest rates and a pickup in the pace of recovery. However, staff projects that the impact of
population aging and health care costs on spending and the gradual normalization of interest rates
would cause the budget deficit to widen and put the ratio of public debt to GDP again on an
upward path—and from a relatively high starting point (Panel Figure 5). In particular, absent
additional reforms, spending on major federal health care programs and Social Security is expected
to increase by about 2 percentage points over the next decade, while higher interest rates would
increase net interest outlays almost by another 2 percentage points over the same period. Staff
suggested that placing the debt ratio firmly on a downward path would require a general
government structural primary surplus of about 1 percent of GDP—implying an additional mediumterm fiscal adjustment of about 2 percentage points of GDP, as the staff’s current projections point
to a general government primary deficit of 1 percent of GDP in 2022 (Table).

17.
The authorities recognized the existence of long-term fiscal challenges but argued
that a smaller fiscal adjustment would be needed. They underscored their commitment to place
the debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward path, and highlighted that the latest budget proposal
identifies measures to move the federal government primary deficit into a surplus of over 1 percent
of GDP in FY2023. This would be sufficient to place the federal debt to GDP ratio on a downward
path under the authorities’ macroeconomic assumptions (which, as noted earlier, feature lower
interest rates on Treasury bonds relative to staff’s assumptions).
18.
Staff stressed that adopting a medium-term fiscal plan while slowing the pace of
short-run fiscal adjustment would also help sustain global growth and favor the rebalancing
of global demand and the reduction of global imbalances over the medium term—together
with efforts to increase domestic demand in surplus countries, as highlighted in the G-20 Mutual
Assessment Process. Less fiscal withdrawal in the short run would allow for a more balanced policy
mix by partly relieving monetary policy of its burden of supporting the recovery. In turn, this would
support U.S. growth and generate more favorable outward spillovers while reducing the risks to U.S.
and global financial stability from a prolonged period of low interest rates. It would also help
contain the risk of a future disruptive rise in long-term interest rates on U.S. Treasuries, which would
have severe domestic and global repercussions. The authorities broadly concurred with these views.
19.
Staff and authorities agreed that a medium-term fiscal consolidation plan should
entail both lower growth in entitlement spending and higher revenues.2 In staff’s view, new
revenues could be raised through a fundamental tax reform which would simplify the tax code and
broaden the tax base through a reduction in exemptions and deductions, as well as through the
introduction of a value added tax (VAT) and a carbon tax (Table). The authorities noted that their
attention focused on broadening the tax base, and there were no plans for proposing a carbon tax
or VAT. There was agreement that spending measures would be needed to curb the growth in
public health care and pension outlays. Authorities noted that some measures along these lines,
including health care savings and the re-indexation of public pensions to the chained CPI, are
proposed in the Administration’s budget for FY2014, but staff underscored that additional action
would be needed to contain the steady growth in mandatory spending as a share of the economy.
In staff’s view, early legislative action is important in order to generate meaningful savings in
entitlement spending during the next decade, given the very gradual pace at which such savings
accrue. The authorities acknowledged the need for further measures to deal with long-run budget
challenges, but noted that, with much progress already achieved in deficit reduction, their adoption
did not need to be rushed. They also noted that, given the still substantial differences in views in
Congress on the appropriate fiscal consolidation strategy, they would likely be adopted gradually as
the political consensus builds on various policies.

20.
Staff discussed with the authorities the outlook for health care spending—the key
driver of long-term budget deficits. The implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is
proceeding, but the law has faced implementation challenges in light of its sheer complexity as
well as last year’s Supreme Court ruling which made the Medicaid expansion optional for the
states. The authorities pointed to early evidence from several states suggesting that the insurance
premia offered to individuals through online insurance exchanges are going to be substantially
lower than initially projected, highlighting the potential benefits of greater transparency and
competitive pressures in curbing health care costs. 8.0

to additional measures such as cutting healthrelated tax expenditures (amounting to some

risks from underfunded entitlements. Balanced
budget rules have kept the consolidated state and local deficit at around 1 percent of GDP, with the
debt ratio under 25 percent of GDP. Borrowing conditions for state and local issuers have remained
broadly stable, despite sizeable medium-term risks from pension underfunding (estimated in a wide
range of $1–4 trillion) and health care costs, and recent high-profile cases of municipal financial
distress. Historically, municipal bankruptcies have been rare, with defaults characterized by high
recovery rates for investors. Staff stressed that given rapidly rising revenues, it is now time to rebuild
buffers while making further progress on reducing unfunded liabilities, especially from the pension
systems. The authorities expressed optimism that last year’s decision by the Governmental
Accounting Standards Board (GASB) to require the use of riskless discount rate for unfunded
pension liabilities could further incentivize state and local governments to address the problem, by
providing a more accurate estimate of the size of the unfunded liabilities. The state and local
budgetary frameworks could also be enhanced and made less pro-cyclical.3

C. Monetary Policy
22.
While the highly accommodative monetary policy stance continues to provide
essential support to the economic recovery, staff emphasized the need to carefully assess its
financial stability implications. The changes in the size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s
balance sheet—together with forward guidance—have helped to overcome the challenges to
monetary policy arising from the zero lower bound. While the macroeconomic benefits of asset
purchases continue to outweigh the costs, staff expressed concerns that a long period of
exceptionally low interest rates may entail potential unintended consequences for domestic financial
stability, such as by spurring financial market froth, and complicate the macro-policy environment in
some emerging markets. However, staff and the authorities agreed that a premature withdrawal of
monetary stimulus to address these risks could slow the recovery and eventually prolong the period
3
See Chapter VII of IMF Country Report 11/202. The state and local governments should start making actuariallysound contributions to their entitlement systems, continue their push toward more risk sharing, streamline benefits
when warranted, and avoid bets for resurrection through high risk/high return strategies. Rainy day funds could be
allowed to accumulate beyond the prerecession levels to limit pro-cyclicality and consideration could be given to
saving revenue over-performance from highly cyclical revenues such as capital gains taxes.

16

of low rates, thus exacerbating financial stability risks. The authorities noted that they had enhanced
their monitoring of such risks, and that they may consider making more use of macroprudential
measures to address them if they were to become more tangible.
23.
The exit from unconventional monetary accommodation is likely to entail a number of
challenges.


Potential for abrupt, sustained moves in long-term interest rates and financial market volatility.
Staff emphasized that expectations of a tapering or end of the Fed’s asset purchases could
trigger a sharper-than-expected sell-off of fixed-income assets, as investors seek to avoid larger
capital losses in the future (Selected Issues Chapter 5), with repercussions for global capital
flows, emerging market currencies, and asset markets. While effective forward guidance can give
the market some time to adjust, a smooth and gradual upward shift in the yield curve might be
difficult to engineer, and there could be periods of higher volatility when longer yields jump
sharply—as recent events suggest. The authorities acknowledged these challenges, but also
argued that, compared to the past, the toolkit at their disposal is broader and their
communication policy is better able to respond to unexpectedly large increases in long-term
rates. The authorities also stressed that the macro conditions underpinning a potential rise in
long-term rates are an important consideration. For instance, higher interest rates owing to a
rise in inflation premia would be an adverse outcome, but they agreed with staff that this is a
low-risk scenario at this juncture given that inflation expectations are well-anchored and recent
data point to subdued price pressures. By contrast, if the rise in long-term rates occurs in the
context of a recovery in domestic demand, then the risk of adverse spillovers would be expected
to be lower. Further, the authorities expressed some skepticism about long-lasting negative
effects of a rise in U.S long-term rates on emerging markets, given the rise in structurallyoriented capital inflows to these economies as well as their improved domestic fundamentals.



Managing short-term rates. Until excess reserves are substantially reduced, the Fed’s ability to
target the federal funds rate may be impaired. The Fed’s main operational rate at present is the
Interest on Excess Reserves (IOER). But its transmission to other market rates is less certain,
owing to the large volume of excess reserves and the segmented nature of U.S. money markets
(some cash-rich institutions, like the Government-Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs), do not have
access to interest-earning facilities at the Fed). This notwithstanding, the authorities were
confident that increasing the IOER, combined with draining excess reserves, would be sufficient
to drive up short-term interest rates. They stressed the range of tools available, including term
deposits and reverse repos (with an extended set of counterparties), should enable a large
volume of reserves to be drained. Staff noted that using the IOER also raises a governance issue,
since its level is decided by the Federal Reserve Board, rather than the FOMC, but the authorities
stressed the intention to closely coordinate policies.



Losses to the Fed. As the interest on excess reserves rises with policy tightening, the Fed would
incur larger costs on its liabilities but there will be no change in the coupons on its securities
portfolio—increasing the potential for negative cash flow (losses) to appear on the balance
sheet. Furthermore, rising long-term interest rates would reduce the value of long-term
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

UNITED STATES

securities held in the Fed portfolio. While any losses should be judged in the context of the
extraordinary profits which have accrued and been remitted to Treasury over the past few years,
it is quite conceivable that losses could give rise to political pressure. The authorities were
conscious that reduced remittances in the future may lead to some political backlash, and said
they were seeking to be transparent and clear about the longer-term evolution of the Fed
balance sheet to forestall future concerns.
24.
The authorities underscored that their approach to exit from QE would not be a
predetermined, mechanical process and that communication would play a key role. Instead,
they expect to carefully assess the economic outlook and adjust the pace and composition of
purchases over time accordingly. Both staff and the authorities agreed that effective communication
will be critical. In the event that domestic conditions deteriorate or global financial turmoil
intensifies, staff suggested that the Fed could provide further stimulus by adjusting the asset
purchase program. The authorities agreed, noting that if the recovery were to slow, or the inflation
outlook were to prove more subdued than currently expected, the Fed could extend asset
purchases, while if the economic recovery were to accelerate, the pace of purchases could be
trimmed more quickly. The authorities emphasized that reducing the pace of purchases implied a
slower pace of adding monetary accommodation, and not a withdrawal of accommodation. They
continued to expect a considerable period to elapse between the end of asset purchases and the
first increase in the federal funds rate. The threshold-based forward guidance would continue to
inform the FOMC’s decision on the timing of that increase. They viewed the increase in long-run
yields from their lows in May 2013 as a reflection of increased optimism on the economic recovery,
realignment in markets participants’ views regarding the Fed’s reaction function, and the effects of
market dynamics as investors adjusted their portfolios in light of these developments.

D. Housing Policy
25.
The authorities noted that policies to support the housing market have contributed to
the recent recovery. Accommodative monetary policy, including purchases of MBS, has set the
stage for a revival of the housing market by

remediation efforts.4 Efforts are underway to enhance these programs, in particular to increase the
public’s awareness of HARP options and to increase HAMP loan modifications through a streamlined
modification process. The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB) has recently introduced a
qualified mortgage (QM) standard that will take effect in January 2014 and is expected to reduce
regulatory uncertainty by clarifying a lender’s obligation to determine the borrower's ability to
repay. Work is still ongoing on the qualified residential mortgage (QRM) standard, which will set the
standards that mortgages must meet to be exempt from the risk retention rules mandated by the
Dodd-Frank Act.
26.
Staff welcomed progress, but argued that there is still room for policies to support the
housing market recovery. Despite the recent rebound in house prices and market activity, the
legacy of the housing boom and bust (including continued foreclosure activity, the still large
number of distressed loans, and continued tight access to mortgage credit for some households) is
expected to weigh on the recovery. The number of households that are “underwater” on their
mortgages (i.e., estimated to owe more than what their homes are worth), while declining, is still
elevated: more than 10 million homeowners, representing about 20 percent of all mortgages.
Mortgage originations for new purchases have also remained subdued, increasing by only 5 percent
year-on-year in 2013:Q1, even as mortgage rates have been at their historic lows. In addition, house
prices and sales have been boosted, perhaps temporarily, by strong investor demand in some
markets. Staff was pleased to see the recent extension of the government-backed housing programs
and saw value in extending them in a few areas, including letting the refinancing program cover
loans not guaranteed by the GSEs. The authorities said that they were continuing to evaluate HARP
expansion, noting that loan modifications and refinancing are preferred over foreclosures and short
sales in addressing the remaining stock of distressed loans. Staff stressed the need to expeditiously
complete regulations requiring banks to retain part of mortgage risk on their balance sheet
(finalizing QRM standards). It also noted that a number of other frictions appear to make lenders
more cautious than normal and could require policy intervention. For example, lenders remain
concerned about “put back risk”—the risk that they will be required to repurchase defaulted loans
from the GSEs. The authorities agreed that mortgage conditions remain relatively tight, but noted
that regulatory uncertainty is being lifted, including through the finalization and clarification of
standards on qualified mortgages, and current conditions could in some cases reflect excess caution
by market participants.
27.
With a housing market recovery underway, staff and the authorities agreed on the
importance of gradually reducing the dominant role of the GSEs in the mortgage market.
Currently, the GSEs (such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) and Ginnie Mae account for nearly all
issuance of mortgage-backed securities, up from about 45 percent prior to the crisis, also reflecting
the fact that—with only households with high credit scores effectively able to get mortgages—
almost all new mortgages meet the “conforming loan” standards required by the GSEs. The

The state attorneys general and the federal government settlement with major banks in February 2012 resolved
claims about improper foreclosures and abuses in loan servicing, providing as much as $25 billion in relief to
distressed borrowers and in payments to states and the federal government.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

UNITED STATES

authorities noted that efforts were underway to encourage the return of private capital to the
mortgage market. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has recently increased the fees
charged by the GSEs to guarantee securitized loans, issued plans to develop a more modern
securitization platform to be placed outside of the domain of the GSEs and announced that GSE
loan purchases will be limited to loans that follow the QM standard. Staff noted that additional
measures could involve further increases in guarantee fees and lower thresholds for conforming
loans, with the authorities noting that the latter measure would require congressional action. At the
same time, staff and authorities agreed that progress in this direction needs to be gradual and take
into account the potential for possible negative consequences on the nascent housing market
recovery. In regard to staff’s suggestion for an early adoption of a fully articulated medium-term
strategy to gradually reduce the footprint of the GSEs, the authorities noted that there was growing
bipartisan convergence on the issue and that the FHFA had scope to spur the transition process
towards one of the long-run structures of the market envisaged by the Treasury’s 2011 White Paper,
given the many common elements among those structures.5

E. Challenges Facing the Labor Market
28.
Staff and authorities discussed the extent to which the decline in labor force
participation over the past few years is cyclical or structural. If some or most of this decline is
cyclical, then the fall in the unemployment rate would overstate the improvement in the labor
market, something the Fed would need to take into account in its decisions on monetary policy
tightening. The authorities noted that it is very difficult to quantify the relative contribution of trend
versus cyclical determinants of labor supply. While there is clearly a cyclical component in declining
labor force participation (as well as underutilization of labor), they considered that there was also an
important structural component driven by demographic factors (the aging of the baby-boom
generation). In light of this, they expect participation to remain broadly constant for the next couple
of years, with a cyclical rebound offsetting the trend decline. Staff broadly agreed with this view, but
expects participation to rise temporarily over the next

portfolios and for a move towards a public utility model with a clear separation of their responsibility for social

29.
Staff and authorities also agreed that policy action is still needed to avoid the risk that
long-term unemployment turns structural. Despite having decreased over the past year (to
2.8 percent of the labor force in May 2012 from 3½ percent a year before), the long-term
unemployment rate remains high. As a result, the risk remains of human capital loss and reduced
attachment to the labor force, which in turn could lead to lower potential GDP output. The
authorities stressed the importance of policies to support the recovery in aggregate demand to
forestall this important risk. In addition, they emphasized a number of labor market initiatives. First,
the extension of emergency unemployment benefits for 2013 will serve as a social safety net and
facilitate the skills matching process. Second, a number of ongoing policies—including training and
employment programs that serve dislocated workers, low-income adults, and disadvantaged
youth—will be maintained. Finally, additional measures were proposed in the FY2014 President
budget, including reforms to the “Reemployment Now Program” to help unemployment insurance
claimants get back to work more quickly, and a $12.5 billion allocation to the “Pathways Back to
Work Fund,” helping low-income workers remain in the labor force and gain new skills.
30.
In line with previous advice, staff argued for a stronger emphasis on active labor
market policies. Staff noted that training and support for job search have shown to improve the
prospects of long-term unemployed workers, but that resources for these types of programs
continue to be lower in the United States than other OECD countries. Staff welcomed the
authorities’ efforts to strengthen human capital and skill formation, in particular the programs
addressed to make college affordable to students from lower-income families, as well as those
designed to provide training to workers in skills needed in advanced manufacturing and other
emerging sectors. Efforts to strengthen the link between the education system—particularly
community colleges—and employers, including through apprenticeships, would also help improve
labor market matching.

F. Financial Sector Conditions and Policies

The U.S. banking system has improved significantly over the last 12 months and looks
resilient to adverse shocks. The authorities noted that profitability continues to benefit from costcutting efforts, strong mortgage refinancing activity, and loan loss reserve releases. Asset quality is

32.
In regard to the nonbank financial sector, staff raised concerns about potential risks
arising in a low interest rate and low volatility environment:


Excessively loose conditions in corporate credit markets. Authorities agreed with staff that a
prolonged period of low interest rates could have adverse side effects in corporate credit
markets. Already, there is evidence of weaker loan standards, rising balance sheet leverage,
reduced protection from covenants, weaker quality of new issuances of corporate bonds and, in
some cases, less discriminate pricing of

regulators have issued guidance against
excessive risk-taking. At the same time, investors in these instruments tend to be unlevered,
reducing the potential for fire sales triggering negative feedback loops, and corporate bond
valuations are not tight relative to historical levels.



Rapid growth in mortgage Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). Authorities and staff agreed that
mortgage REITs—funds that invest primarily in agency MBS― pose a particular concern, given
their rapid expansion over the last couple of years, large exposure to long-dated and highly
concentrated assets, and heavy reliance on retail investment and short-term repo funding.

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED STATES

Increased oversight on these funds may be warranted, given their inherent vulnerability to
prepayment and interest rate risk and susceptibility to funding pressure. Since the end of the
consultations in late May, the combination of higher long-term rates, wider MBS spreads, and
increased volatility have caused significant balance sheet losses and underperformance of REIT
shares. In turn, this has led to an increase in REITs' borrowing costs and cost of capital.
Meanwhile, their need to rebalance hedges as a result of the extension in the duration of their
portfolios has reinforced the rise in long-term rates.
Diminished margins and underfunding pressures for insurance companies and defined-benefit
pension funds. Staff expressed concern about the risk that structural underfunding and low
return on fixed income securities could lead defined-benefit public pension funds to search for
yield. Already, the weakest public pension

challenges for insurance companies: while
the industry has managed to lower its guaranteed rates by re-pricing and redesigning products,
the net yield earned on its investment portfolio has declined by more, narrowing investment
margins. Authorities said that they were closely monitoring the industry on concern that life
insurers may take on additional credit and liquidity risk in their investment portfolio to offset
margin compression. There is also the possibility that insurers may take additional risk on the
liabilities side of the balance sheet, such as by offering more aggressive incentives to
policyholders.

Staff welcomes the recent finalization of the rule implementing Basel III capital
requirements. The Federal Reserve in early July issued a final rule, coordinated with the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC),
implementing in the U.S. the Basel III regulatory capital reforms. The phase-in period for larger
institutions begins in January 2014, while for smaller banks it will begin in January 2015. The

In the private sector, the funding ratio of the 100 largest defined-benefit corporate pension plans decreased
modestly from 79 percent at end-2011 to 77 percent during 2012, owing to the record-low discount rates (Milliman
Inc., Pension Funding Study, March 2013). The rising tide of required pension contributions has been mitigated by
last year’s legislation that allows corporations to smooth the calculations of discount rates over a long horizon. A
number of corporations have attempted to reduce their exposure to pension-related risks, for example by offering
lump-sum payments to beneficiaries or shifting their pension liabilities to insurance companies.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED STATES

authorities indicated that proposed rules on Basel III liquidity standards are expected to be issued
later this year.
34.
Completing the implementation of the financial reform agenda remains essential to
mitigate systemic risk. Staff noted that key parts of the Dodd-Frank Act that were considered close
to be implemented during the last Article IV consultation had not yet been finalized. The authorities
emphasized that the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act gained momentum over the course of
2013, with a series of key rules expected to be finalized by year-end:


Regulation of the shadow banking system. The designation process of nonbank Systemically
Important Financial Institutions (SIFIs) has reached the final stage for a few firms. In regard to the
regulation of Money Market Mutual Funds (MMMFs), a critical area in the eyes of staff especially
given evidence of a pick-up in their risk profile within the low return environment, the SEC has
recently proposed rules following a recommendation by the FSOC.7 Staff sees the proposed
rules as a first step in addressing the remaining vulnerabilities. Authorities also pointed to the
progress made in reducing systemic risk in the tri-party repo market, particularly through
reducing the reliance on discretionary credit extended by the two clearing banks. Still, they
agreed with staff that more needs to be done to increase the resiliency of the settlement
process to a broker-dealer default and the risk of fire sales. More generally, staff underscored
the importance of data collection efforts on wholesale funding markets (including repo and
securities lending), along the lines of recent initiatives by the Treasury Department’s Office of
Financial Research (OFR) and the Federal Reserve.



Volcker rule. The authorities argued that the delay in finalizing the rule reflects the complex
coordination of the several regulatory agencies involved in writing the rules, the objective
difficulty in clarifying the distinction between market-making and proprietary trading, and
consideration of all comments received on the proposed rule. Staff emphasized the need to
minimize the effect of the rule on bond market liquidity, including negative international
spillovers. At the same time regulators would need to be mindful of the migration of risk to less
regulated financial institutions and the potential costs imposed on banks and corporates.8



Insurance regulation. Staff noted that, in line with the findings of the 2010 FSAP, the fragmented
regulatory structure, combined with a lack of timely and publicly-available data, might
complicate monitoring the build-up of risks in this sector. The authorities recognized that in the

7

On June 5 2013, the SEC has proposed that prime MMMFs (currently accounting for over 50 percent of assets under
management by money funds) be forced to let their share prices “float”. Funds that invest at least 80 percent of their
assets in cash or government debt would be exempt from the change, as would funds designated purely for retail
customers, which would be required to restrict withdrawals by any one customer to $1m per day. As an alternative,
prime funds could keep the stable $1 share price, but would be required to impose liquidity fees on withdrawals and
impose restrictions on withdrawals in times of stress. The SEC said it was considering whether to combine both
measures into a single reform package, and requested feedback as part of a 90-day public comment period.

These issues are discussed in Viñals et al., “Creating a Safer Financial System: Will the Volcker, Vickers, and Liikanen

UNITED STATES

absence of a national regulatory framework, strong coordination between state regulators and
federal authorities, including better data sharing, is important to ensure effective monitoring
and supervision, especially of large and complex insurance groups. For some of them, enhanced
supervision and regulation is likely to occur through their designation as nonbank SIFIs.9
35.
Staff underscored the importance of achieving greater international coordination
among national regulators and supervisors, as this would reduce fragmentation of the global
financial regulatory landscape, limit the scope for regulatory arbitrage, and reduce uncertainty and
compliance costs. Authorities agreed and argued that they strive to achieve coordination with other
jurisdictions whenever possible. At the same time, they emphasized that differences across national
financial systems justify some regulatory disparities. Furthermore, imposing stricter regulatory
domestic standards aims at reducing systemic risk both in the United States and globally, rather
than giving national institutions a competitive advantage, and should thus be seen as a “race to the
top.” The discussion focused on two specific areas:


Over-The-Counter (OTC) derivative markets reform. Authorities noted that many of the
commitments agreed to at the G-20 Pittsburgh Summit on OTC derivatives trading and clearing
had already been honored. Good progress has been made on the rules for trade execution and
reporting, and the movement to central clearing is progressing on schedule. Staff noted that the
reform will need to be implemented carefully to resolve conflicts and inconsistencies among
jurisdictions given the cross-border nature of OTC derivative markets.



Foreign Banking Organizations (FBOs). Authorities noted that the rule proposed by the Federal
Reserve in November 2012 (requiring FBOs to organize all their banks and nonbank subsidiaries
active in the United States into a U.S. intermediate holding company) was mandated by the
Dodd-Frank Act, and that it will strengthen the U.S. financial system by imposing to FBOs the
same capital and liquidity requirements applied to U.S. banks. Authorities also noted that the
U.S. banks abroad are generally subject to local regulatory standards and that the proposal is
consistent with the FDIC’s articulation of a “single point of entry” model, which they view as the
most efficient approach to the resolution of cross-border subsidiaries. Staff agreed that the rule
would enhance domestic financial stability, having flagged in the past potential risks arising
from investment banking activities by foreign banks, but encouraged the authorities to ensure
that it remains consistent with the Financial Stability Board key attributes of effective resolution
regimes and does not unduly add costs on internationally active banks.

36.
Authorities and staff agreed that strong macroprudential oversight and supervision of
the financial system remain essential to address emerging vulnerabilities. The authorities
argued that the FSOC has fostered a notable increase in inter-agency coordination, including
through information sharing and high frequency of meetings, as well as an enhanced focus on
systemic risk analysis, as shown in the FSOC annual report. The work of the OFR, including on

financial institutions that the FSOC intends to designate as systemically important.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

UNITED STATES

developing early indicators of systemic risk and increasing available data for monitoring financial
stability, especially on shadow banking and the insurance sector, was also important in this respect.
While recognizing that the establishment of the FSOC greatly improved coordination across U.S.
regulators and the monitoring of systemic risk, staff argued that it would be important to ensure
that FSOC recommendations can be implemented swiftly if needed. Staff also emphasized the need
to ensure adequate resources for the regulatory agencies to effectively monitor financial institutions
and markets.
37.
Staff discussed plans to improve access to information about who ultimately owns and
controls companies and trusts. In this respect, staff noted the lack of significant progress since the
last Financial Action Task Force mutual evaluation report of June 2006. Measures intended to help
prevent the abuse of legal persons and arrangements for financial crimes—including tax evasion—
have still not been implemented.10 Staff encouraged the authorities to proceed along these lines
expeditiously, and reinvigorate previously announced initiatives to require the collection of
information about beneficial ownership and control when companies are formed or beneficial
ownership or control changes, as this will likely be critical to ensure the effectiveness of the overall
framework. Authorities expect to issue regulations to strengthen and clarify financial institutions’
requirements to identify and verify the identity of the beneficial owners of legal entity customers, in
accordance with international standards.

G. The United States and the World Economy
38.
Staff argued that the U.S. external position is moderately weaker than implied by
medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. The current account deficit has been around
3 percent of GDP since 2009, and is projected by staff to remain broadly stable over the next few
years as higher imports are offset by lower oil prices and increased domestic energy production. As
interest rates return to more normal levels, the U.S. net international investment position is
projected to deteriorate slightly. In staff’s view, the U.S. dollar is mildly overvalued and the current
account deficit ½–1 percent of GDP larger than the level consistent with fundamentals and desirable
policies (see Box 3). Staff simulations suggest that gradual fiscal consolidation aiming for a general
government structural primary surplus of around 1 percent of GDP over the medium term, together
with some depreciation of the dollar (in a 0–10 percent range) and adjustment in partner countries’
policies geared towards global rebalancing, would result in the desirable strengthening of the
current account by ½–1 percent of GDP in the context of full employment.
39.
The authorities broadly agreed with the staff’s projection for the current account, the
external outlook and drivers of rebalancing. The current account deficit is expected to be
contained as the economy recovers, in part owing to lower energy imports (reflecting the boom in
10

There is no official estimate of U.S. tax evasion. The “net tax gap” (tax never collected) was assessed by the Internal
Revenue Service at roughly $385 billion in 2006. This estimate consists of non-filing, underreporting, and
underpayment but includes only a fraction of international tax evasion, a part of excise tax evasion, and excludes
evasion of the state and local taxes. The total tax gap could be in the region of $0.5 trillion.

UNITED STATES

unconventional energy production) and to remain below pre-crisis levels. As the global recovery
continues, the unwinding of “flight to safety” flows and currency appreciations in partner countries
may lead to some dollar depreciation, while the lower budget deficit is expected to have a positive
impact on external accounts. Demand from trading partners continues to be weak and the
authorities viewed possible adverse developments in Europe as the key external risk to the ongoing
domestic economic recovery. Authorities did not take a view on the appropriateness of the value of
the dollar, which they view as market determined. That said, they argued that the recent reduction in
global imbalances seems to reflect cyclical rather than structural factors and, looking forward, they
emphasized the importance of global rebalancing through pro-growth policies in trading partners
and currency appreciation in emerging markets with controlled exchange rates and current account
surpluses.
40.
Staff underscored the important spillovers to the rest of the world from policy actions
in the United States. As highlighted in the 2013 Spillover Report, recent policies, including
avoidance of the fiscal cliff and unconventional monetary policy accommodation in the United
States, have sustained growth and reduced tail risks, thus lowering uncertainty and financial stress.
However, a long period of exceptionally low interest rates has also complicated the macroeconomic
policy environment in some emerging markets. Unwinding monetary policy accommodation is likely
to present challenges and abrupt and sustained moves in long-term interest rates could result in
reversals of capital flows to emerging markets and higher market volatility, as suggested by the
market reaction to Fed communication in May–June of this year, concerning the timing of
unwinding asset purchases. A rapid increase in long-term rates could imply sharp capital outflows
from a number of countries, particularly those with higher risk profiles, as discussed in the 2013
Spillover Report. Authorities noted—and staff agreed—that any spillovers from monetary exit are
likely to depend on the conditions under which such exit takes place. Authorities also emphasized
that capital inflows to emerging markets generally reflect “pull” factors (including strong growth
prospects and more favorable macro economic conditions than in the past) rather than “push”
factors (including those related to unconventional monetary policies in the United States).
41.
The authorities’ trade policy agenda has become increasingly active, and they intend
to seek Trade Promotion Authority from Congress, which would ease the passage of trade
agreements. The agenda prioritizes the pursuit of both multilateral negotiations and plurilateral and
bilateral trade agreements—the potentially most important initiatives are the Trans Pacific
Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). Both agreements
could entail significant and lasting economic gains if negotiations are successful in reducing nontariff barriers and making regulatory policy more coherent. In doing so, they could also establish
higher-standard norms that will influence future multilateral agreements. At the same time, there is
a risk of a fragmentation of the global trading system in the event Free Trade Agreements become
closed and much deeper than multilateral agreements. With regard to multilateral negotiations at
the WTO, the authorities stressed the need to explore a package with measures related to trade
facilitation, as well as some agricultural and development issues, ahead of the Bali Ministerial
Meeting in December 2013. The Administration is also prioritizing the enforcement of WTO rulings

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

and trade agreements, particularly with the recent establishment of the Interagency Trade
Enforcement Center.

STAFF APPRAISAL
42.
The U.S. recovery has remained tepid, but improving underlying conditions bode well
for a gradual acceleration of growth. Last year’s sluggish growth reflected legacy effects from the
financial crisis, continued fiscal consolidation, a weak external environment, and temporary effects of
extreme weather-related events. However, the underlying recovery is gaining ground, supported by
a rebound in the housing market, a boost to household net worth from higher house and stock
prices, and—despite the recent tightening—still easy financial conditions. These factors are helping
to offset the negative growth impact of strong fiscal adjustment, although average growth is still
likely to be slower this year relative to 2012. The pace of recovery is projected to accelerate later this
year as the fiscal policy headwinds subside. Growth is also expected to benefit from continued
monetary accommodation, and further strengthening of the housing market and household balance
sheets.
43.
The fiscal deficit reduction in 2013 is excessively rapid and ill designed. In particular, the
automatic spending cuts (“sequester”) not only reduce growth in the short term, but indiscriminate
reductions in education, science, and infrastructure spending, if protracted, could also reduce
medium-term potential growth. These cuts should be replaced with a back-loaded mix of
entitlement savings and new revenues, along the lines of the Administration’s budget proposal. The
slower pace of deficit reduction would help the recovery at a time when monetary policy has limited
room to support it further.
44.
Despite the substantial deficit reduction achieved over the past several years, the
gradual normalization of interest rates and the impact of population aging and health care
costs on spending imply that public finances remain on an unsustainable path over the longer
term. The general government deficit has more than halved from over 13 percent of GDP in 2009 to
a projected 5.9 percent of GDP in 2013, and will continue to shrink over the next few years, partly as
revenues recover with faster economic growth. However, the longer-term debt profile remains
unsustainable. Despite the slowdown in growth rates over the past few years, spending on major
health care programs and Social Security is expected to increase by close to 2 percentage points of
GDP over the next decade. Staff projects a similar increase over the same period for net interest
outlays, as interest rates gradually return to neutral levels. These factors would cause the budget
deficit to widen and put the ratio of public debt to GDP again on an upward path—and from a
relatively high starting point.
45.
Together with a slower pace of deficit reduction in the short term, the authorities
should promptly adopt a comprehensive and back-loaded plan entailing lower growth in
entitlement spending and higher revenues. New revenues could be raised through a fundamental
tax reform which would simplify the tax code and broaden the tax base through a reduction in
exemptions and deductions, as well as through the introduction of a carbon tax and a value added

28

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED STATES

tax. Spending measures would need to curb the growth in public health care and pensions outlays—
and early legislative action is important in order to generate meaningful savings in these areas
during the next decade, given the very gradual pace at which such savings accrue. Some measures
along these lines, including health care savings and the re-indexation of public pensions to the
chained CPI, are proposed in the Administration’s budget for FY2014, but additional action would be
needed to contain the steady growth in mandatory spending as a share of the economy. Overall,
reaching over the longer term a primary surplus for the general government of about 1 percent of
GDP (compared to a primary deficit of around 1 percent in staff’s baseline projection) would put the
debt ratio firmly on a downward path.
46.
Implementing this fiscal strategy would help global growth in the short run and favor
the rebalancing of global demand and the reduction of global imbalances over the medium
term—together with efforts to increase domestic demand in surplus countries, as highlighted in the
G-20 Mutual Assessment Process. In the short run, it would partly relieve monetary policy of its
burden of supporting the recovery, reducing the risks to U.S. and global financial stability from a
prolonged period of low interest rates. This more balanced policy mix would support U.S. growth,
with more favorable outward spillovers. In the medium run, it would help contain the future rise in
long-term interest rates, thus promoting growth, as well as reduce the risk of turmoil in the Treasury
market, which would have severe domestic and global repercussions.
47.
While the macroeconomic benefits of asset purchases continue for now to outweigh
the costs, the Fed should continue its preparations for a smooth exit. The highly
accommodative monetary policy stance has provided important support to the U.S. and global
economic recovery, and under staff’s growth projections a continuation of large-scale purchases
through end-2013 is warranted. However, a long period of exceptionally low interest rates may
entail potential unintended consequences for domestic financial stability and has complicated the
macro-policy environment in some emerging markets. While the Fed has a range of tools to help
manage the exit from its current highly accommodative policy stance—including adjusting interest
on excess reserves and conducting reserve-draining operations with an expanded list of
counterparties—unwinding monetary policy accommodation is likely to present challenges. The
large volume of excess reserves and the segmented nature of U.S. money markets could affect the
pass-through of the policy rate to short-term market rates. At the same time, effective
communication on the exit strategy and a careful calibration of its timing will be critical for reducing
the risk of abrupt and sustained moves in long-term interest rates and excessive interest rate
volatility as the exit nears, which could have adverse global implications, including a reversal of
capital flows to emerging markets and higher international financial market volatility.
48.
Despite the improvements over the last 12 months, there is still room for policies to
support the housing market. The rebound of the housing sector has benefited from governmentbacked programs that facilitated refinancing and modification of loans under stress. As a stronger
housing market remains an essential component of the U.S. economic recovery, it would be
important to maintain those programs in place and extend their reach in a few areas, including an
extension of the refinancing program to loans not guaranteed by Government-Sponsored

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

29

UNITED STATES

Enterprises (GSEs). Certain key regulatory rules, such as the Qualified Mortgage rule, have been
issued. The finalization of remaining rules on risk retention would help to reduce uncertainty that
may have hampered mortgage origination, and favor the return of private capital to the housing
finance system. Moreover, as the housing market recovers, consideration should be given to the
adoption of a fully articulated medium-term strategy to gradually reduce the footprint of the GSEs.
49.
Persistent weak labor force participation rates and high levels of long-term
unemployment suggest there is room for active labor market policies to complement efforts
to boost domestic demand. These policies can include training and support for job search, as well
as efforts to strengthen the link between the education system—particularly community colleges—
and employers, including through apprenticeships. These efforts can help reduce the risk of human
capital losses which would lower potential growth for the U.S. economy.
50.
The U.S. banking system is healthier than last year, but emerging risks from
persistently low rates need to be carefully monitored. Banks have expanded their balance sheets,
increased loan books, and improved liquidity positions, while at the same time reducing the
riskiness of their portfolios. The quality and quantity of capital have been expanded, and the 2013
Fed stress tests and capital planning evaluations for the largest 18 U.S. banks suggest it would be
resilient to very severe shocks. That said, there are some incipient signs of rising exposure to both
interest rate and credit risk in regional banks that require increased vigilance, as low interest rates
squeeze interest margins.
51.
In a low interest rate environment, vulnerabilities may also be building in the nonbank
financial sector, with a rapid expansion of agency Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), weakening
underwriting standards in the leveraged loan market (covenant-lite loans issuance has returned to
pre-crisis levels), and higher credit and liquidity risks taken by pension funds and insurance
companies. Strong macroprudential oversight and supervision of the financial system remain
essential to address these emerging vulnerabilities.
52.
The regulatory architecture has been strengthened relative to the pre-crisis period, but
more remains to be done to increase the resilience of the U.S. financial system while reducing
the risk of international financial regulatory fragmentation. Staff welcomes the finalization of
the rule implementing Basel III capital requirements. Key items that remain on the agenda are
finalizing the designation of nonbank systemically-important financial institutions, further
strengthening of regulation of money market funds (the recent proposal by the Securities and
Exchange Commission being a useful first step), and reducing systemic risk in the tri-party repo
market. Close attention is also needed to ensure that the finalization and implementation of the
Volcker Rule take place in a manner that minimizes the effect of the rule on bond-market liquidity,
including importantly negative international spillovers. At the same time, regulators would need to
be mindful of the migration of risk to less regulated financial institutions. Notable progress has been
achieved with new rules on centralized clearing of OTC derivatives, in line with G-20 commitments.
These will need to be implemented carefully to resolve conflicts and inconsistencies among
jurisdictions given the cross-border nature of the OTC derivative markets. More generally, the
bolstering of regulatory policies to support financial stability should be coordinated with the global
30

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED STATES

financial reform agenda as this would reduce fragmentation of the global financial regulatory
landscape and limit uncertainty and the scope for regulatory arbitrage. This is particularly important
in light of the size and global role of the U.S. financial system.
53.
Over the medium term, a strengthening of the U.S. external position through some
improvement in the current account deficit, which has remained around 3 percent of GDP
since 2009, would be desirable. The current account deficit is expected to remain broadly stable
over the next few years as higher imports due to stronger domestic demand are offset by lower oil
prices and increased domestic energy production. Still, this would imply a further—if slow—
deterioration in the U.S. net international investment position, entailing over time higher interest
payments overseas. The mild dollar overvaluation could be unwound and the external position
strengthened through a gradual but sustained reduction in the budget deficit, accompanied by
some depreciation of the dollar and adjustment in partner countries’ policies geared towards global
rebalancing. This would allow for a desired strengthening of the U.S. current account balance by ½–
1 percent of GDP in the context of full employment.
54.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ renewed initiatives in trade, including their intention
to seek Trade Promotion Authority. The recent progress in promoting plurilateral and bilateral
trade agreements should contribute to growth, as they can lead to more open trade and deeper
forms of integration, including by addressing non-tariff measures. This progress should be
complemented by renewed efforts to advance the multilateral trade agenda.
55.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12month cycle.

One of the key reasons for the weak U.S. recovery has been the drawn-out process of household
balance sheet repair. In the aftermath of the Great Recession, balance sheets were weakened by the
bursting of the housing bubble and lower stock prices—household net worth fell sharply from over
650 percent of disposable income (DI) in 2007:Q1 to 485 percent in 2009:Q1. Households were also overindebted at the onset of the crisis, with the debt-to-income ratio peaking at around 135 percent of DI in
2007:Q3 compared with ratios around 100 percent in the early 2000s. Low net worth and over-indebtedness
led consumers to boost their savings, putting a drag on private consumption.
In the aggregate, household finances have improved substantially in recent years, but progress has
been uneven across segments of the population.

Household net worth recovered to 586 percent of disposable income by the end of 2013:Q1, slightly

wealth holdings (Carroll, Slacalek, Sommer,

2012). However, much of the recovery in asset 550 (Percent of disposable income)

values has been driven by higher stock market
wealth, that tends to boost private

consumption to a smaller degree than

housing wealth.



Aggregate debt has been reduced to about
110 percent of DI. During the severe financial
crises in the Nordic economies in the
1980s/1990s, household leverage eventually
came down to pre-bubble levels—the United
States has followed a similar trend so far.
Non-mortgage consumer credit growth has
picked up (partly reflecting a boom in
student loans), but credit conditions remain
tight in the crucial mortgage market. The
growing volume of student loans amidst stilldifficult labor market conditions also imply a
risk that future debt service will weigh on
consumption.

when economic prospects improve. In
addition, households which had precarious balance sheets before the crisis appeared to have made
limited progress in rebuilding net worth through active savings out of income as of 2011 (Celasun,
Cooper, Dagher, and Giri, 2012). In the absence of rapid house price appreciation and income gains,
these households may need to save more in the future.

Box 2. Unconventional Energy Boom and “Manufacturing Renaissance”
The United States is currently experiencing rapid growth in oil and gas production (Selected Issues

differ greatly among analysts, reflecting in part
different assessments of infrastructure bottlenecks, environmental risks, and regulatory constrains.
The energy boom has already had positive effects on the U.S. economy. The direct benefit from higher
oil and gas output is small given the low share of oil- and gas-related sectors in the U.S. economy (around
1½ percent of GDP)—mining contributed only 0.1 percentage point to real GDP growth last year. That said,
technological constraints on gas exports have helped to push the domestic price of natural gas well below
prices in other major markets, providing a competitive advantage to domestic industries and helping to
support consumer demand through lower utility prices. Over time, corporations could choose to relocate
some production to the United States, especially in the energy-intensive sectors such as petrochemical and
fertilizer industries, aluminum, and steel. Higher capital accumulation would help boost productivity and
potential output. U.S. companies could also benefit from exporting their technology for extracting
unconventional energy.
Indeed, some analysts have interpreted the
recent growth in durable-goods industries as a
sign of ”manufacturing renaissance” (Selected
Issues Chapter I). Besides lower domestic energy
prices, other supporting factors such as a weaker
exchange rate, volatile shipping costs, and increases
in emerging markets’ labor costs could support
steady increases in manufacturing output and
employment, beyond those that could be attributed
to just a cyclical rebound (although durable goods
manufacturing makes up just 6½ percent of GDP).

that the macroeconomic effects of
unconventional energy boom will remain positive for the United States but may be modest. Under the
baseline, the increase in real GDP level attributable to higher domestic energy production could be less than
1 percent after 10 years, although energy production growth has tended to surprise on the upside, and the
official production forecasts could prove too pessimistic. The boom could put some appreciation pressure
on the U.S. dollar, with the energy trade balance improving further, but the current account implications
appear ambiguous since the higher energy production will stimulate domestic consumption and investment.

Box 3. External Sector Developments and External Stability Assessment
During the past year, the dollar has remained broadly stable in real effective terms, generally
strengthening during periods of higher risk aversion
US Capital Flows, 2012Q2–2013Q1
(Billions of U.S. dollars)
and weakening as volatility declined.
Capital flows to and from the United States remain
well below pre-crisis levels. Net foreign purchases of
Treasury securities still account for the lion share of
inflows (Chart). Portfolio flows out of the United
States have picked up in late 2012 and early 2013,
while bank cross-border activity shows a continuation
of the post-crisis decline.

Under the External Balance Approach (EBA),
model estimates suggest that the cyclicallyadjusted current account deficit is about
1 percentage point of GDP weaker than the value
implied by medium-term fundamentals and
desirable policies.1

Similarly, CGER current account methodologies (such as the Macro Balance (MB) and External

estimates suggest a mild real exchange rate overvaluation.

The range of direct estimates of equilibrium real exchange rates is instead centered around zero,
reflecting primarily the dollar’s current weakness relative to its long-run average.

The United States has a fully open capital account, and vulnerabilities are limited by the dollar’s
status as a reserve currency and the United States’ role as a safe haven. The U.S. dollar reserve currency
status and safe haven motives boost foreign demand for U.S. Treasury securities during periods of market
turbulence even as U.S. overseas investments fall. Hence the outlook for capital flows in the U.S. will depend
on global financial stability and the pace of economic recovery, as well as on the outlook for the U.S.
economy and public finances. Risks to external stability could come from a decline in foreign demand for
U.S. debt securities (the bulk of U.S. external liabilities), driven for example by a protracted failure to restore
long-run fiscal sustainability. Still, given the dollar’s reserve currency status, current vulnerabilities are
limited.

Annex II. Public Sector Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
1.

Since 2011, Congress has legislated about $2.8 trillion in medium-term fiscal

consolidation measures.
a. The Budget Control Act enacted in August 2011 capped discretionary spending,
saving about $900 billion over 10 years relative to the CBO baseline.
b. Additional savings worth $1.2 trillion over 10 years were triggered by the failure of
the Congressional Committee on Deficit Reduction in November 2011. These cuts
took effect in March 2013 through cancellation of budget authority (“sequestration”)
in FY2013 and they will be executed through caps on appropriation levels in
FY2014–21.
c. The American Taxpayer Relief Act signed into law in January 2013 increased the top
ordinary income tax rate the tax rate on capital gains and dividends, phased out
personal exemptions, and limited itemized deductions for upper-income taxpayers,
raising $700 billion over 10 years relative to the CBO alternative baseline.
2.

Despite the substantial legislated savings in the pipeline, U.S. public finances

remain on an unsustainable trajectory. Under staff’s baseline projection which, in addition to
these budgetary savings, includes the savings from the drawdown of overseas contingency
operations and removal of emergency funding for disaster relief, the public debt ratio is put on
a downward path after 2014. However, the debt ratio starts rising again at the end of the
decade due to spending pressures from an aging population and excess cost growth in the
health care sector (even after taking into account the recent cost slowdown). Federal debt held
by the public is projected to increase from 73 percent of GDP at end-FY2012 to 77 percent of
GDP in FY2023, with general government gross debt at 109 percent of GDP in CY2022.
3.

The fiscal projections are being substantially improved by a favorable interest

rate-growth differential. Reflecting highly accommodative monetary policy and the safe
haven status of the United States, real interest rates have fallen well below GDP growth. As a
result, the debt-stabilizing primary balance is currently negative (Annex Table) and will remain
so over the standard 5-year DSA horizon despite the staff’s projection for a substantial increase
in Treasury yields over the medium term. In staff’s view, however, aiming for a medium-term
primary surplus of about 1 percent of GDP would be appropriate to put the public debt ratio
firmly on a downward path. As discussed in the April 2013 Fiscal Monitor, the targeted primary

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

49

UNITED STATES

surplus would need to be even higher in the long run to bring the debt ratio closer to the precrisis levels by 2030.
4.

The public debt dynamics are highly sensitive to growth and interest rate

assumptions. The analysis in Annex Figure suggests that the public debt dynamics are highly
sensitive to growth and interest rate assumptions, primarily reflecting the fact that the general
government debt ratio already exceeds 100 percent of GDP.

Payments Restrictions. The United States accepted Article VIII of the IMF's Articles of Agreement
and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions and multiple currency practices with the
exception of limited restrictions on certain payments and transfers imposed for security reasons. The
United States currently administers approximately 30 economic sanctions programs, which restrict
certain payments and transfers for transactions against particular foreign governments, entities, and

individuals. The United States administers sanctions programs relating to, inter alia, Burma, Cuba,
Iran, North Korea, and Sudan. Several other sanctions programs, including those relating to Côte
d’Ivoire, Liberia, Somalia, Syria, Western Balkans, and Zimbabwe are “list-based” programs, affecting
only members of certain government regimes and other individuals and entities whose activities
have been determined to threaten the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United
States. The United States also implements similar list-based sanctions programs against: narcotics
traffickers; terrorism-related governments, entities, and individuals; and proliferators of weapons of
mass destruction.
Article IV Consultation. The 2012 Article IV consultation was concluded in July 2012 and the Staff
Report was published as IMF Country Report No. 12/213. A fiscal ROSC was completed in the
context of the 2003 consultation. An FSAP involved two missions, during October 14–November 3,
2009 and February 17–March 12, 2010. The FSSA was discussed at the board, together with the 2010
Article IV Consultation, on July 26, 2010.
The 2013 Article IV discussions were conducted from May 6–May 17, 2013. Concluding meetings
with Chairman Bernanke of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and Treasury
Secretary Lew occurred on May 31st and June 12th, respectively. The Managing Director, Ms. Lagarde,
and WHD Director, Mr. Werner, participated in the concluding meetings. A press conference on the
consultation was held on June 14th, 2013. The team comprised Gian Maria Milesi-Ferretti (head),
Roberto Cardarelli, Martin Sommer, Francesco Columba, Gabriel Di Bella, Madelyn Estrada, Deniz
Igan, and Jarkko Turunen (all WHD); Chris Papageorgiou (SPR); Rebecca McCaughrin (MCM); and,
Tao Wu (ICD), with contributions from Steve Dawe and Emmanuel Mathias (LEG); Marshall Mills,
Katrin Elborgh-Woytek, Lars Engstrom, and Michele Ruta (SPR). Ms. Lundsager (Executive Director)
and Mr. Weiss (Advisor) attended some of the meetings. Outreach included discussions with
Congressional staff and think tanks. Unless an objection from the authorities of the United States is
received prior to the conclusion of the Board’s consideration, the document will be published.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Statistical Issues: Comprehensive economic data are available for the United States on a timely
basis. The quality, coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of U.S. economic data are adequate for
surveillance. Coverage of international capital flows in external sector statistics has been improved,
with the June 2007 releases of BOP and IIP data on financial derivatives. The United States has
subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and its metadata are posted on the
Dissemination Standard Bulletin Board (DSBB).

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on the United States
July 24, 2013
1.
This note reports on information that has become available since the staff report
(SM/13/197) was issued and does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Recent indicators point to a sharper than expected slowdown in economic
activity in the second quarter. This reflects weakness in inventory accumulation and net
exports as well as slower private consumption growth, as suggested by retail sales in June.
On a positive note, recent housing indicators (such as the homebuilders' survey) remain
relatively upbeat, despite the recent rise in mortgage rates, which has slowed refinancing
activity. Headline inflation picked up to 1.8 percent (y/y) in June, mainly due to an increase
in gasoline prices, while core inflation inched down to 1.6 percent.
3.
U.S. and global financial markets have somewhat stabilized after the correction
in June. In the United States, financial conditions have improved since early July, with
slightly lower long-term Treasury yields and mortgage rates, narrower risk spreads, higher
stock prices, a weaker dollar against most major currencies, and lower volatility. However,
trading liquidity remains low across a number of markets and outflows from long-term U.S.
and emerging market bond funds have continued, albeit at a slower pace. Global equity
markets have partly recovered the losses experienced since late May (on July 18, the MSCI
for emerging markets was still about 10 percent down relative to May), while emerging
market domestic government bond yields and external bond spreads have declined from their
peak in June. Second-quarter earnings for major U.S. financial institutions were mostly
above expectations, mainly driven by higher trading and investment banking revenues. In his
testimony to the House of Representatives on July 17, Chairman Bernanke appropriately
reiterated that the pace of asset purchases depends on the performance of the economy, and
that the current pace could be maintained for longer if financial conditions were judged to be
insufficiently accommodative.
4.
The Mid-Session Review (MSR) released by the Office of Budget and
Management (OMB) on July 8 confirms the progress in deficit reduction. OMB’s
projection of the federal deficit for FY2013 is now 4.7 percent of GDP, well below the
projection in the President’s Budget (6 percent), reflecting stronger-than-expected revenues,
a one-off payment from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,1 and the fact that the sequester is now
assumed to remain in place through FY2013. Growth projections were revised down (and are
1

The two companies had written down the value of deferred tax assets during the crisis, given the bleak outlook
for the housing market. In May 2013, they decided to reverse the write-downs as they returned to profitability.
This boosted the net worth of the companies and increased the dividends payable to the Treasury under the
bailout agreement. These payments (of about $85 billion) are included in the budget on a cash basis, but are not
included in staff’s estimates of the fiscal deficit which are on an accrual basis, in line with GFSM 2001.

2
now closer to staff projections), and this slightly increases the projected deficits in the outer
years.
5.
More progress was achieved on the financial reform agenda. On July 8 the
Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) designated two non-bank financial institutions,
American International Group (AIG), and GE Capital, as systemically important. Prudential
Financial has appealed the proposed designation by the FSOC. Markets’ reaction to the
designations has been fairly muted, with shares of the designated firms generally rising in
line with the broader equity market. On July 9, The Federal Reserve Board, the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued a
notice of proposed rulemaking that would introduce an enhanced supplementary leverage
ratio of 6 percent for the largest 8 U.S. banks. On July 11, the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission and European Union regulators announced an agreement on derivative
regulations which seeks to harmonize cross-border rules, by allowing swap market dealers
and participants to be subject only to the relevant rules of domestic authorities.
6.
The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) is scheduled to release a
comprehensive revision to the national income and product accounts on July 31st,
together with the first estimate of GDP growth in the second quarter of 2013.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 26, 2013

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with the United States
On July, 24, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the United States. 1
The U.S. recovery has remained tepid, with GDP growing at a modest 2.2 percent in 2012,
reflected legacy effects from the financial crisis, budget deficit reduction, a weak external
environment, and temporary effects of extreme weather-related events.
While policymakers in Congress averted the fiscal cliff at the beginning of 2013, the
expiration of the payroll tax cut and implementation of across-the-board spending cuts
(“sequester”) are weighing significantly on growth this year, with growth in the first quarter
of 2013 at 1.8 percent and indicators suggesting slower growth in the second quarter.
Despite these powerful headwinds, the nature of the recovery appears to be changing. In
particular, equity valuations have soared in 2013 and house prices have increased by more
than 10 percent over the last 12 months, strengthening household balance sheets and
supporting private demand. At the same time, residential construction has accelerated and
labor market conditions have improved. To a large extent this owes to very easy financial
conditions, with the Fed continuing to add monetary policy accommodation over the past
year. Financial conditions have somewhat tightened since mid-May 2013, after the Fed
indicated that its asset purchases could be scaled back later in the year, but still remain
extremely accommodative. While the rapid pace of fiscal consolidation is expected to keep
growth subdued at 1.7 percent in 2013, we expect economic activity to accelerate to
2.7 percent next year as the fiscal drag subsides and the negative legacies of the financial
crisis wane further. The unemployment rate is expected to remain broadly stable in 2013,
reflecting the pickup in the labor force participation as discouraged workers return to the
labor force, and to gradually fall in 2014. Inflation is expected to pick up somewhat but to

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary
is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summing ups can be found
here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2

remain below the Fed long-run objective of 2 percent, given the lingering slack in the
economy.
The risks to the outlook appear modestly tilted to the downside. Economic activity could be
lower than in our baseline scenario in the presence of a stronger-than-projected impact of
fiscal consolidation, a faster-than-expected increase in interest rates, a weaker external
environment, or higher structural unemployment. In contrast, the recovery could be stronger
than we anticipate if the rebound of the housing market were to ignite a positive feedback
loop between higher house prices, easier mortgage conditions, and stronger consumption and
investment.
With regard to policy actions, the Federal Reserve has appropriately indicated that it intends
to maintain a high degree of monetary policy accommodation for a considerable time after
the economy strengthens, and that the pace and composition of its asset purchases will
depend on the evolution of economic conditions. The administration’s budget proposal
envisages a gradual reduction in the budget deficit so as to put the public debt ratio on a
downward path, although political gridlock in Congress makes prospects for legislative
action unclear. U.S. banks’ health has improved significantly over the past 12 months, but
there are a few signs of emerging vulnerabilities in the financial sector from persistently low
interest rates. Further progress was made on strengthening financial regulation, including
introducing rules that adopt Basel III capital standards, designating two systemicallyimportant nonbank financial institutions, and proposing a reform of the money market mutual
funds industry.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the improvement in the underlying conditions of the
U.S. economy, which bodes well for a gradual acceleration of growth, while noting that the
balance of risks to the outlook remains tilted to the downside.
Directors generally concurred that the fiscal deficit reduction in 2013 is excessively rapid,
and that the automatic spending cuts (“the sequester”) not only reduce growth in the short
term but could also lower medium-term potential growth. They stressed the importance of
adopting a comprehensive and back-loaded medium-term plan entailing lower growth in
entitlement spending and higher revenues. Together with a slower pace of deficit reduction in
the short run, this fiscal strategy would help sustain global growth, place the U.S. fiscal
position on a sustainable path over the medium term, and support the reduction of global
imbalances. In this context, a few Directors also expressed concerns regarding the budgetary
process and saw room for improvement.
Directors broadly agreed that accommodative monetary policy continues to provide essential
support to the recovery, but cautioned that its financial stability implications should be

3

carefully assessed. They considered that a long period of exceptionally low interest rates
could potentially entail unintended consequences for domestic financial stability and has
complicated the macro-policy environment in some emerging markets. In this context,
Directors stressed that strong macro-prudential oversight and supervision of the financial
system remain essential.
Directors noted that the Federal Reserve has a range of tools to manage the normalization of
monetary policy, but that there are significant challenges involved in unwinding
accommodation, including risks of market reactions leading to excessive interest rate
volatility that could have adverse global implications. They stressed that effective
communication on the exit strategy and a careful calibration of its timing will be critical for
reducing these risks.
Directors welcomed the recent improvements in the housing and labor markets. They agreed
that the rebound of the housing market has benefited from monetary policy actions and
government-backed programs that facilitated refinancing and modification of loans under
stress. They saw room for policies that continue to support the housing market while
gradually reducing the dominant role of the government-sponsored enterprises. Directors also
agreed that the decline in labor force participation and high levels of long-term
unemployment suggest room for active labor market policies to complement efforts to boost
domestic demand.
Directors noted that while the U.S. banking system is healthier than last year, emerging
vulnerabilities and risks from persistently low rates in the financial sector need to be
carefully monitored. Directors welcomed the strengthening of the regulatory architecture
relative to the pre-crisis period, including through the adoption of Basel III capital rules.
They emphasized that completing the implementation of the financial reform agenda remains
essential to increase the resilience of the U.S. financial system, while at the same time
reducing the risk of regulatory fragmentation at the international level and minimizing
negative spillovers.
Directors noted that while the current account deficit has declined, the U.S. external position
remains weaker than justified by fundamentals and desirable policies. A gradual but
sustained reduction in the fiscal deficit, together with a strengthening of growth in partner
countries, would help achieve the desirable strengthening of the current account.
