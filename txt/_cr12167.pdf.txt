STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 21, 2012

AN AGENDA FOR REVIVING GROWTH
Italy and the Euro area crisis. The authorities have embarked on an ambitious agenda
to secure sustainability and promote growth. Despite these strong efforts, Italy remains
vulnerable to contagion from the euro area crisis, with spillover consequences for the
region and globally. Securing stability and reviving growth will require not only
maintaining the momentum for reforms in Italy, but also progress at the European level
in strengthening the currency union.
Outlook. The economy is expected to contract through the year due to fiscal
consolidation, tight financial conditions, and the global slowdown. The risks are on the
downside, stemming mainly from an intensification of the euro area crisis.
Closing the competitiveness gap. The difficult business environment, fragmented
labor market, and limited service competition have contributed to Italy’s weak growth
performance and loss in competitiveness. Without reforms to address these structural
gaps, potential growth will likely remain low over the medium term.
Structural reforms to revive growth. Comprehensive structural reforms are needed
to raise productivity and participation. Labor reforms should aim to bridge the gap
between permanent and temporary workers, reduce the tax wedge, and decentralize
wage setting. Accelerating product market reforms in the energy, local public, and
professional service sectors would drive down rents and lower the cost of business.
Growth-friendly fiscal consolidation. The government’s near-term fiscal plans are
ambitious and critical for sustainability, but more can be done over the medium term
to strengthen the fiscal outlook. To support growth, the composition of adjustment
should be rebalanced more towards expenditure cuts and lower taxes. The new
constitutional balanced budget rule provides an important tool for strengthening fiscal
discipline and policymaking.
A resilient financial system. With limited access to wholesale funding, Italian banks
continue to rely heavily on Eurosystem financial support. To remain resilient to the
downturn, banks need to maintain adequate capital and liquidity buffers. Steps to
reduce banks’ impaired loans would free up resources for new lending and support
corporate restructuring.

ITALY AND THE EURO AREA CRISIS
1.
The economy has been in recession since the middle of 2011. GDP contracted for a third
straight quarter, by 0.8 percent (q/q, s.a.) in Q1 2012. The contraction was led by sharp falls in
consumption and investment as concerns about the fiscal outlook and the euro area crisis
depressed confidence and tightened credit conditions (Figure 1). Exports also fell, along with the
slowdown in global demand, but net exports contributed positively to growth due to the sharp
import compression. Household real disposable income continued to decline in 2011, while
consumer sentiment fell below levels in 2008–09. The unemployment rate rose to 10.2 percent in
April 2012, its highest level in more than ten years, with youth unemployment at 35 percent.
2.
The Italian authorities have taken strong measures to stabilize the fiscal situation and
initiate structural reforms. Italy came under
700

down 10-year bond yields, with spreads dropping
below those of Spain by early March.
3.
Following a brief respite, Italian financial
markets came under pressure again in May. Concerns
over contagion from the euro area crisis and the
deepening recession have again pushed up 10-year
Italian sovereign spreads, by almost 150 bps since early
March. The government through mid June has issued
€237 billion in sovereign debt, completing more than
half of its financing for the year, but still faces sizeable
funding needs in the coming months. Italian equity
prices have performed poorly, down 17 percent for the
year through May.

markets and soaring funding costs, Italian banks have relied heavily on Eurosystem support,
accounting for nearly one-quarter of their total financing. Banks have made progress in raising
private capital to meet their EBA targets, but at a steep discount. Higher funding costs and tighter
lending standards, especially for smaller firms, have pushed up corporate borrowing rates, while
private sector credit has contracted by 0.8 percent from December through April (Box 1) .
5.
The external current account deficit has started to narrow, from 3½ percent of GDP
in 2010 to around 2¾ percent of GDP in the year to Q1 2012, as weak imports improved the trade
balance (Figure 2). Net foreign liabilities have been stable at around 20 percent of GDP, but with
around 37 percent of public debt held by non-residents, Italy remains vulnerable to changes in
market sentiment. Imbalances with the euro area payment system (Target 2) have widened over the
past year, as external outflows from the sovereign and banks have been offset by ECB support.
6.
The broad public and parliamentary support for Prime Minister Monti’s technocratic
government has weakened in recent months. The government’s approval ratings have fallen to
below 50 percent in the face of stiff resistance to the labor reform bill and the lengthy recession.
General elections will be held in April 2013, and Prime Minister Monti has declared he will not run,
raising questions by market analysts about the continuity of reforms beyond his term.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 1: What are the Factors Behind Deleveraging In Italy? 1/
Credit flows have stagnated since late last year, especially for small firms. Credit growth to
the non-financial private sector dropped from 3.5 percent (y/y) in November to 1.6 percent
(y/y) in April, mostly reflecting declines in non-financial corporate loans. The decline has been
most pronounced in lending to small firms whose growth fell from 0.4 percent (y/y) in
November to -4 percent (y/y) in March. Surveys conducted at the end of 2011 showed
significant tightening of lending conditions, similar to those after the Lehman bankruptcy,

owing to higher bank funding costs, though more 25

recent surveys indicate some improvement.

20
As in previous recessions, the slowdown in
credit partly reflects weak loan demand. The
slowdown in private sector credit so far seems in
line with those in previous recessions. Indeed,
three quarters since the start of the recession,
annual private credit growth has fallen by
3.3 percentage points, compared to declines of 6.5
and 4.7 percentage points respectively during
corresponding periods in the early 1990s and 2008–
09.
Nevertheless, supply constraints are also
playing a role and appear to have prevailed
over demand factors at the end of 2011.
Analysis based on bank lending surveys suggests
that growth in loan demand exceeded that of
credit supply by 0.5 percentage point in Q4 2011,
similar to that observed after the Lehman
bankruptcy.
In 2012, the situation has reversed with weak
demand now appearing to be the main factor
driving the decline in credit. After the LTRO and
other actions taken by policymakers to support
banks in early 2012, the situation reversed with
estimated demand for funds falling well short of
supply. The fall in corporate borrowing rates
observed in early 2012 is consistent with the notion
that weak demand, rather than supply constraints, is
driving credit developments.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT



Tight financial conditions. Bank deleveraging and the lagged impact of higher interest rates are
expected to weigh on business investment. The IMF’s April 2012 Global Financial Stability Report
(GFSR) sees higher funding costs and capital pressures on banks contributing to a 2¾ percent
contraction in private credit during 2012–13 (compared to positive growth of 3½ percent
during 2008–10). This is estimated to lower growth by 0.8 and 0.2 percentage points in 2012
and 2013, respectively.



Slowing exports. Real import growth in Italy’s trading partners, mainly in Europe, is expected to
slow sharply to 2 percent in 2012, from over 5 percent in 2011.

8.
The economy is expected to emerge from the recession in early 2013, led by a modest
pickup in exports. Reflecting growing demand

9.
Inflation will ease only gradually, as the impact of weak demand is partly offset by
higher indirect taxes. Annual HICP inflation was 3.5 percent (y/y) in May, and is projected to
remain above the euro area average in 2012–13 as a result of hikes in the VAT rate and indirect
taxes. Core inflation (excluding energy and seasonal food at constant taxes) was 1.4 percent (y/y) in
May and is expected to remain low, consistent with the widening output gap. Amidst high
unemployment, wages will likely increase at a slower rate than inflation, generating a moderate real
wage adjustment.
700

10.
The risks to the outlook are tilted to the
downside, stemming mainly from an intensification of
the euro area crisis. As highlighted in the Risk
Assessment Matrix, Italy is vulnerable to contagion from
the euro area crisis and financial distress. Despite the
significant consolidation, spreads on Italian sovereign
bonds remain elevated, and the annual volume of
maturing debt for the sovereign and banks is substantial.

Relative Likelihood of Risk in the Next 1-3 Years
(High, medium, or low)
Medium

 Italy is prone to contagion from the euro area

crisis and could experience a loss of investor
confidence in its debt sustainability.
 Lack of progress in strengthening the currency
union could undermine confidence in the firewall
and continued EU support.

Medium

 Increasing NPLs due to recession, especially from

the weak SME and construction sectors, would
erode banks’ capital base.
 The banking system is increasingly exposed to
the sovereign, hence vulnerable to market
valuations of sovereign debt.
 Banks could face funding pressure due to
spillover from the euro area, and/or from deposit
outflow, shortage of collateral, or debt rollover,
including at LTRO maturity.
Medium
 Change in political leadership or policy
complacency may weaken the implementation of
fiscal adjustment plans.
 Higher-than-expected fiscal multipliers could
lead to a sharper downturn, making it more difficult
to stabilize the debt ratio.
Medium
 Reform implementation may stall due to policy
complacency, unstable politics, or social opposition.
 The short-run effects of reform on growth and
employment may be less positive than anticipated
or medium-run effects may fail to fully materialize.
Low

 Geopolitical instability could trigger a large and
sustained oil price shock.

Expected Impact if Risk is Realized
(High, medium, or low)
High
 Given the large sovereign financing need and
debt burden, significantly higher funding costs
could exacerbate the debt dynamics.
 Funding pressures could create a negative
feedback loop, where spillovers to bank funding
and higher domestic interest rates hurt growth, and
weaken the sovereign further.
 A deeper downturn in the euro area could
jeopardize the export-led recovery.
High
 Bank deleveraging could lead to a credit crunch,
depressing activity and creating more NPLs.
 Further bank recapitalization from market
sources may be difficult to obtain and may trigger
contingent liabilities from government guarantees
of bank debt.
 Prospects for public capital support reinforce the
negative feedback loop between the sovereign and
the banks.
High

 Market concerns about medium-term debt

sustainability may intensify, thereby increasing
interest rates, further undermining sustainability.
 The stock of outstanding public payments could
increase.
Medium

 Insufficient reform may keep growth low for a

protracted period, undermining fiscal consolidation
and the capacity to address growing pressures
from an aging society.
 High youth and long-term unemployment could
have lasting consequences for growth.
Medium
 Higher oil prices would damage economic
activity. A $10 increase in the oil price could reduce
growth―via compression of domestic as well as
external demand―by up to 0.4 percentage points
in the first year.

The RAM shows events that could materially alter the baseline path--the scenario most likely to materialize in staff’s view.

combined with a protracted period of low growth in the area as a whole could lead to an
intensification of the crisis, pushing Italy back into a bad equilibrium, with higher sovereign yields,
declining activity, and rising public debt reinforcing each other. Other downside risks include a
larger contractionary impact from fiscal adjustment, a faster pace of deleveraging, and a sharp fall in
partner demand outside the euro area. On the other hand, slow progress in implementing fiscal and
structural reforms could also undermine confidence and growth. These risks are likely to be
correlated as euro area turmoil and a weaker growth outlook would raise funding pressures for both
banks and the sovereign. In a tail scenario of a significant increase in sovereign yields, doubts about
Italy’s fiscal outlook could have potentially large spillovers to the euro zone and the global
economy, including on account of Italy’s prominent position in global sovereign bond markets and
as a “gatekeeper” for shocks to and from core Europe and elsewhere (Box 2).
11.
On the upside, a more robust global recovery or faster progress in reforms could boost
sentiment and activity. This, coupled with continued liquidity support by the ECB that helps spur
bank lending, could lift growth and lower the fiscal deficit faster than in the baseline.

B. Closing the Competitiveness Gap over the Medium Term
12.
Over the medium term, low trend
productivity and an aging society are likely to
constrain Italy’s growth prospects. Growth is projected
to average 1 percent over 2014–17, as the recovery in
domestic demand closes the output gap. Growth will
eventually converge to the economy’s potential, which,
after accounting for weak productivity and slowing
investment and employment trends, is likely to remain
low at around ½ percent and lag behind that of other
advanced European economies.
13.
Weak productivity growth has contributed to
a widening competitiveness gap over the past
decade. Productivity growth has lagged behind wage
increases, resulting in a steady loss of competitiveness.
This is partly reflected in Italy’s weaker export
performance compared to the rest of Europe and decline
in global market share. Based on a range of
methodologies, staff estimates Italy’s real exchange rate
to be overvalued by 5–10 percent which is roughly
consistent with market views.3 The current account deficit
is projected to decline from 3¼ percent of GDP in 2011

ITALY

Box 2. Italy – Spillovers from a Potential Intensification of the Euro Area Crisis
Despite strong efforts to stabilize the fiscal position and implement growth-enhancing reform, Italy
remains vulnerable to an intensification of the euro area crisis. Shocks could propagate through Italy’s
sizeable trade and financial links with other euro area countries:






Trade. About 8 percent of Italy’s total exports is directed to the periphery (Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and
Spain), and 40 percent to the euro area. A steeper euro area recession could therefore delay an export-led
recovery in Italy.
Financial. Italian banks’ direct exposure to the periphery is relatively limited (2.4 percent of GDP) but that to
all euro area countries is considerable (25 percent of GDP), with the largest exposure to Germany and Austria.
Italian banks’ funding is also concentrated, with most interbank loans coming from Europe (4½ percent of
GDP) and primarily from Germany and France (3 percent of GDP combined). Non-European interbank funding
is relatively limited (less than 1 percent of GDP) and is mostly from the United States.
Official. Italy has also provided guarantees for funding to Greece, Ireland, and Portugal through the Greek
loan facility and the EFSF, amounting to around €35 billion (2.2 percent of GDP).

A euro area shock could lead to higher sovereign interest rates, tighter credit conditions and reduced trade,
triggering a deeper recession in Italy. In a severe downside scenario, spreads on Italian government bonds
could rise sharply, led mainly by an acceleration of sales by nonresidents. Banks could face mark-to-market losses
from their sovereign exposure (7 percent of total assets) as well as higher NPLs from the weaker economy, and
accelerate deleveraging. Additional ECB financing may be needed to supplement the liquidity from earlier LTROs
to cover maturing bank debt.
The spillovers from Italy to the euro area and beyond could be significant, highlighting the need for a
coordinated response to contain the crisis. Italy represents 17 percent of euro area GDP and accounts for
5 percent of the global stock of government bonds, and therefore occupies a central role in the global trading and
financial system. Staff cluster analysis of global trade and financial flows suggests that Italy is a “gatekeeper” not
only for core Europe—serving as conduit of shocks to and from Belgium, France, Germany, and the Netherlands—
but also for central- and southeastern Europe (CEESE) and other economies, especially those in the CIS and Middle
1
East. Given this gatekeeper role, Italy can serve as a propagator or a dampener of shocks, depending on the
country’s underlying vulnerabilities and policy response.

to 1½ percent of GDP by 2017, but will still be about 1 percentage point above the level consistent
with medium-term fundamentals and appropriate policies. Continued progress in implementing the
authorities’ medium-term fiscal plans and structural reform agenda will be key in narrowing the
current account and competitiveness gaps.

Authorities’ Views
14.
Compared to staff’s projections, the authorities expect the economy to recover earlier
during the second half of this year. Although the earthquakes in the North could adversely affect
Q2 GDP, its impact, as well as those from bad weather in the winter and tighter lending conditions,
is likely to ease and be offset by improving exports. They agreed that fiscal consolidation will weigh
on domestic demand but do not see the fiscal multiplier as having increased significantly in the
downturn, pointing to the resilience of household spending despite declining real disposable
incomes. The Ministry of Economy and Finance forecasts GDP to contract by 1.2 percent in 2012,
followed by a modest increase of 0.5 percent in 2013, but highlighted that the forecast depends very
much on the strength of the global recovery and the outlook for government bond yields. With a
faster pace of recovery than assumed by staff (but similar estimates of potential growth), the
authorities also project a smaller negative output gap in 2012–13.
15.
ECB liquidity support and other policy measures have prevented a large credit
contraction. The modest decline in lending since November last year was mainly to the corporate
sector and reflected both weak demand as well as supply constraints. Large banks reduced loans to
risky firms which were partly offset by an increase in lending by smaller banks. More recently, with
the LTRO and other supportive measures, lending standards have loosened, while interest rates on
loans have started to ease.
16.
Weak global demand and an intensification of the euro area crisis are seen as the main
downside risks to the outlook. Given sluggish domestic demand, a decline in global trade or
renewed financial turmoil would make Italy’s recovery more uncertain. Other risks include an erosion
in confidence should the reform momentum stall or political uncertainty rise. The construction
sector is likely to remain weak, but the risk of a significant housing price correction is low given the
modest run-up in prices and low household leverage. On the upside, stronger global demand could
speed up Italy’s recovery, given the depressed levels of capital spending.
17.
Structural reforms to improve productivity and competitiveness are essential for
lifting potential growth. Low productivity was the main factor behind Italy’s poor growth
performance, reflecting in part structural rigidities that had prevented the economy from adjusting
to the rapid pace of globalization and technology. The authorities noted that Italy has relatively low
external imbalances compared to other euro area countries and that exports have held up
reasonably well in recent years. Nevertheless, Italy has experienced a loss in competitiveness, which
if left unaddressed, will remain a drag on growth.

POLICY CHALLENGES FOR REVIVING GROWTH
18.
Reviving growth will require not only comprehensive reforms in Italy, but also
progress at the European level in strengthening the currency union. The authorities’ ambitious
and wide-ranging agenda appropriately aims to revive growth and restore dynamism to the
economy. The priority should continue to be on wide-ranging structural reforms to boost
productivity and labor participation, a supportive fiscal strategy that is both growth-friendly and
sustainable, and steps to promote a more dynamic and resilient banking system. At the same time,
progress at European level in creating a more integrated currency union with greater fiscal and
financial discipline and risk sharing, combined with further monetary easing and unconventional
measures as needed by the ECB, is crucial for securing stability and providing needed time for Italy’s
adjustment and reform efforts.

A. Structural Reforms to Revive Growth
19.
Maintaining the momentum for reform will be important to address stagnant
productivity and entrenched structural weaknesses. The difficult business environment,
fragmented labor market, and limited competition in services have contributed to the poor growth
performance and a loss in competitiveness. The high level of youth and long-term unemployment
risks creating a “lost generation” with lasting consequences for growth. Addressing these
weaknesses is a key priority for reviving growth and alleviating the social cost of the crisis.

Ease of Doing Business in Italy vs. OECD Average 1/2/

20.
The potential gains to growth from deeper structural reforms are substantial. IMF staff
estimates suggest that product and labor market reforms that bring Italy closer to OECD best
practices could increase the level of GDP by about 6 percent over the medium term and contribute
significantly to closing Italy’s competitiveness gap (Box 3). The government has embarked on
important reforms to deregulate the service sector and make the labor market more inclusive and
flexible, as well as strengthen the anti-corruption legal framework. Changes to the government’s
initial proposals on labor reform have highlighted the political challenges in advancing the structural
agenda. Accelerating these reforms, and locking in the necessary legislative and administrative
changes as soon as possible, would strengthen confidence and create momentum for further
reforms. Greater coordination at the EU level, especially in strengthening the single market for
energy, transportation, and services, would also support Italy’s efforts in these areas.
Repairing the Labor Market
21.
The labor market reform bill should be passed quickly to reduce uncertainty and
encourage new hires. The bill promotes open-ended and apprenticeship contracts for young
workers and makes unemployment insurance more universal. It also facilitates hiring by allowing
companies to lay off workers for economic reasons and reducing the cost of dismissal (Table 5).
Clarifying further the conditions for reinstatement via the judicial process would reduce uncertainty
and facilitate out-of-court settlements of dismissal disputes.

More is needed to bridge the gap between permanent and temporary workers,

Box 3: Impact of Structural Reforms on Growth and Competitiveness 1/
The impact of structural reforms in Italy is estimated using the IMF’s Global Integrated
Monetary and Fiscal model (Kumhof and others, 2010). In the model, staff considered: (i) product
market reforms which increase competition and productivity, especially in the non-tradable sector by
lowering the cost of doing business; and (ii) labor market reforms which boost labor participation and
increase efficiency by lowering adjustment costs and improving job matching. Most reforms are
assumed to be implemented over 2013–18, closing roughly half the gap with best practice cases
(based on the OECD for the labor market, and the rest of the euro area for the product market). In
addition, growth-enhancing fiscal reforms that would—in a deficit-neutral way—lower the labor tax
wedge and increase infrastructure spending are also considered.
The estimates suggest that a comprehensive package of product and labor market reforms could
raise the level of real GDP by 5¾ percent after 5 years and by 10½ percent in the long run. This
compares with the authorities’ estimate of

simultaneously. Combining fiscal reforms
could raise real GDP by an additional 3 percent after 5 years, with a shift from public transfers to
infrastructure investment having the highest growth impact in the long run. 2/
Comprehensive structural reforms could also contribute to closing Italy’s competitiveness gap.
Italy’s competitiveness gap (real exchange rate overvaluation) is estimated to be around 5–10 percent.
The simulations show that structural reforms could depreciate the real exchange rate by about
3 percent after 5 years and over 7 percent in a decade. Unit labor cost would decline by about
4½ percent after 5 years, as increased labor productivity would more than offset the increase in wages.
In the short run, the current account would deteriorate slightly reflecting higher investment relative to
private savings, but in the long run, would converge to zero and move slightly into surplus.
Staff’s estimates are consistent with other studies that also find potentially large positive effects
of structural reforms. OECD (2012) and Bouis and Duval (2011) find that closing the gap with best
practices could increase Italy’s per capita GDP by about 7 percent after 5 years and close to 15 percent
after a decade. Forni and others (2010) find that increasing competition in services sector in Italy could
raise real GDP by up to 11 percent in the long run. In a more ambitious reform scenario, the authorities
estimate that closing the gap in competition, entry barriers, and administrative costs with the best
performers in Europe could raise real GDP by a smaller 5 percent by 2020.

Although not captured in the model, the short-run impact of the reforms, especially in the labor market, can potentially be

others, 2012).

match wages to productivity. Greater differentiation of public wages across regions would
support private wage flexibility and employment, especially in the South.
Raising Productivity in Services
23.
Important progress is being made in overdue product market reforms. Parliament in
March passed a comprehensive liberalization package that covered network industries, fuel
distribution, local public services, transport, professional services, and infrastructure, and
strengthened the enforcement of competition rules. Administrative simplification reforms, which
should lower the cost of doing business were also approved (Table 5). Together, these measures,
when implemented, should help close Italy’s competitiveness gaps and boost growth potential over
the long term.
24.
In product markets, priority should be given
to accelerating reforms in the energy, local public,
and professional services sectors with the broadest
impact on growth. Services in Italy contribute over
70 percent of total value added, as in other advanced
economies, but its productivity has lagged behind.
Product market reforms to increase competition in
services can raise productivity by reducing business costs
and improving resource reallocation. The priorities are to:






Complete the planned ownership separation of gas
distribution and production in 2012. This would
improve competition and eventually help drive
down energy prices, which are among the highest in
the euro area.4
Accelerate the opening of professional orders, which
would strengthen competition and lower excessive
rents and costs for businesses and households.
Push forward on privatization, especially for local
public utilities, to enhance the efficiency and quality
of public services and lower their cost.

The price of electricity in Italy is 50 percent higher than the European average due to limited competition and
insufficient infrastructure in the gas sector coupled with Italy’s large reliance on gas in electricity production

Reforms in services, especially network industries, would benefit from wider EU
initiatives. These policies, as supported by the Italian government, could include developing a
broader internal energy market; removing barriers to infrastructure investment; developing a single
European transport area; and reducing the number of regulated professions in Europe. Simulation
results suggest that when product and labor market reforms in Italy are combined with wider euro
area structural reforms, the gains for Italy would increase.5
Helping Companies Grow
26.
Italian small and medium-size enterprises
(SMEs) are the cornerstone of the corporate
sector but face difficulties in growing. Compared
to the EU average, Italian SMEs account for a much
higher share of value added (71 percent versus
58 percent) and are concentrated among micro firms
with less than 10 workers. Small size and low
productivity are particularly evident in the trade and
tourism-related sectors. SMEs also suffer from excess
leverage, with debt-to-equity ratios
above 200 percent in 2010. Business startup and exit
rates in Italy are low, limiting the economy’s
flexibility and innovative capacity.

Improving access to financing and streamlining tax and other regulations would help
companies grow. Expanding risk-based—as opposed to collateral-based—lending would improve
SMEs’ access to credit, while developing further the venture capital and private equity industry
would expand the availability of risk capital. Recent initiatives to foster firm recapitalization, such as
the allowance for corporate equity, are welcome in this regard. In addition, reforms to promote
greater inward FDI (among the lowest in the OECD) would allow SMEs to benefit from the growth in
global supply chains and technology transfer.

0.3 percentage points annually). Nevertheless, more still needs to be done, especially in improving
the efficiency of the judicial system which would have wide-ranging benefits. For example, reducing
the lengthy period for civil trials (1,200 days on average in Italy versus 331 days in France) would
remove an important barrier to effective contract enforcement.
29.
The objective of the labor reform bill is to create a more inclusive and dynamic labor
market. The reforms seek to strike a balance between preserving firms’ flexibility and strengthening
the social safety net, especially for marginal workers. The authorities believe that the proposed limits
on compensation for economic dismissals would reduce significantly hiring uncertainty and the
incentive for using the judicial process. On the proposal for a more flexible open-ended contract
with phased-in protection over time, the authorities saw instead apprenticeship contracts as the
main entry point for young workers that would encourage firms to invest in training while
maintaining hiring flexibility.
30.
More is needed to raise the participation of women and match wages to productivity.
The government is keen to provide more financial incentives for hiring women and youth but faces a
tight budget constraint. Improving the welfare system for child and elderly care would also facilitate
the entry of women to the labor force. To promote wage decentralization, the government has
proposed to extend tax allowances for firm-level wage bargaining. Greater regional differentiation of
public sector wages across regions could support private wage flexibility but is seen as politically
challenging and would need to be tackled in the context of broader reform of the public sector.
31.
Product market reforms are entering the implementation phase. The government has
issued a decree on separating ownership in the gas sector and will issue parameters for setting
professional fees by end-July. The energy reforms should lower prices but the decline will likely be
gradual given Italy’s heavy dependence on gas for its energy needs. For transportation, the
authorities highlighted the creation of independent Transport Authorities as important for
promoting competition, especially at the local level. Although current conditions are not suited to
large-scale asset sales, the authorities remain committed to pursuing privatization and are working
on completing the inventory of public assets and exploring ways to improve their efficiency and
revenue generation capacity.
32.
Several initiatives are underway to improve the business environment and support
firms’ growth. The authorities saw the difficult regulatory environment and poor quality of public
services as key factors holding back firms’ growth. In this regard, the simplification reforms to
reduce administrative burden by streamlining information requirements, authorization procedures,
and the tax administration system should help firms grow. The government has also implemented
measures to facilitate SME financing, such as through government credit guarantees, allowances for
corporate equity to foster firm recapitalization, and tax incentives for venture capital. In June, as part
of the growth agenda, the government approved measures to provide tax incentives for
infrastructure and construction investment, expand debt instruments for non-listed firms, and
simplify procedures for business startups.

33.
Greater market integration at the European level would also support Italy’s reform
efforts. In particular, further opening of the gas distribution network at the EU level would allow
Italy to diversify its energy sources and create a more competitive market. Moving towards a transEuropean transportation network would generate economies of scale and drive down transport
costs in Italy. Greater use of the EU structural funds and EIB investment could also help meet
infrastructure needs.

B. Making Fiscal Consolidation More Growth-Friendly
34.
The government has enacted a series of fiscal adjustment and reform packages to
improve the budgetary position. The three packages, introduced in 2011, feature significant and
front-loaded consolidation; pension reforms to strengthen long-term sustainability; a modest shift
from direct to indirect taxes; higher taxes on wealth, especially property; and more aggressive action
against tax evasion (Box 4). Roughly two-thirds of the adjustment is revenue-based, adding to Italy’s
already-high tax burden, and relies mainly on hiking tax rates rather than broadening the base. The
government in April embarked on another spending review to identify expenditure cuts that would
replace the need to increase VAT rates in October. Also in April, the Parliament approved a structural
balanced budget rule in the constitution which is set to take effect in 2014 and legislated the
creation of a fiscal council.

As a result of these measures, the
primary surplus of the general government is
expected to rise to above 4 percent by 2013, the
highest in the euro area. The general government
met its 2011 deficit target of 3.9 percent of GDP,
and in 2012, the overall deficit is projected to
decline further to 2.6 percent of GDP.6 Based on
staff’s macroeconomic assumptions, the primary
balance would improve further from 3.0 percent of

Despite the improvement in the primary balance, the debt ratio is projected to decline
only gradually after 2013 and will remain vulnerable to adverse shocks. Based on staff
estimates, the structural surplus after 2013 is expected to ease slightly as the impact of higher

Box 4. The Authorities’ Fiscal Consolidation Packages
Between July and December 2011 the authorities legislated a series of fiscal packages. The
overarching objective was to support debt reduction, but some offsetting measures were included to
support growth, such as modest reductions in the taxation of labor and capital and support to local
transport and infrastructure. Ministries were allowed to rebalance the cuts to their budgets towards
the least productive expenditure areas, and the reductions in health expenditure will be underpinned
by policies to harmonize pharmaceutical spending and increase patient co-pay.

The fiscal packages also introduced additional pension reforms, which deliver both short-term
savings and also strengthen long-term sustainability. Key components include: (i) de-indexation of
high-level pensions; (ii) immediate extension of contributory system to previously grandfathered
workers; (iii) tightening of seniority pension rules; and (iv) an earlier rise in the pensionable age,
especially for women. The pension reforms are expected to generate savings of around 1.2 percent of
GDP annually during 2020–30.

dynamics vulnerable to adverse shocks (see Annex I). For example, a combined shock of a

38.
The fiscal adjustment this year and next is appropriate, but more should be done over
the medium-term to strengthen the fiscal outlook. The sizeable improvement in the structural
primary balance in 2012–13 will weigh heavily on growth but is critical for fiscal sustainability. The
increased focus on targeting a structural balance which adjusts for the economic cycle will allow
fiscal policy to remain flexible in a more severe downturn. To safeguard the recovery, the
government should identify and implement the needed expenditure cuts to avoid an increase in the
VAT rates later this year.
39.
Shifting further the composition of adjustment towards expenditure cuts and lower
taxes would better distribute the burden of adjustment and support growth. Cutting
government expenditure, such as the public sector wage bill or other items identified in the ongoing
spending review; reducing Italy’s sizeable tax expenditures (estimated at around 8 percent of GDP);
and stepping up efforts against tax evasion would create space for growth-supporting measures. 7
These measures could include: reducing the labor tax wedge to boost employment; raising the

Box 5: Shifts in the Investor Base for Italian Government Bonds 1/
After a long period of stability, foreign holdings of Italian government bonds declined
rapidly during the second half of 2011. The share of Italian government securities held by
foreigners increased steadily from 30 percent at the onset of the European Monetary Union to
over 51 percent in 2006 and remained stable until mid-2011. With the intensification of the
euro area crisis, the share of foreign holdings fell sharply to an estimated 37 percent, after
excluding securities purchased by the ECB through the Securities Market Program (SMP). 2/
Foreign banks and non-bank investors
contributed to the decline. Foreign banks’
exposure to Italy’s public sector fell by about
four percentage points from 12.4 percent in
June 2011 to 8.4 percent by year-end. Other
non-bank investors, primarily real money
investors, account for the remaining drop, from
38.7 to about 30 percent of total government
securities. Balance-of-payments figures for
Q1 2012 signal that non-residents continued to
reduce holdings of Italian medium- and longterm securities although for the first time in
several months, net purchases at maturities
shorter than one year were observed.
European Banking Authority (EBA) stress test
data suggest that foreign selling has been led
by European banks. A comparison of the latest
EBA stress test with that in December 2010
reveals a €33 billion drop in the holdings of Italian
public debt by foreign banks from €162billion in
Q4 2010 to €129 billion in Q3 2011 mainly in
positions in the trading book and in available for
sale (AFS) in the banking book. French, German,
and Dutch banks account for most of the decline.

SMP and Italian banks have filled in the void
left by non-residents. The estimated share of Italian sovereign bonds held by the Eurosystem
rose significantly, from 4.3 percent in June 2011 to an estimated (by staff) 10-12 percent in
February. Preliminary data suggest that domestic banks also become more active, purchasing
over €80 billion between November 2011 and April 2012, as LTRO-driven flows were invested in
government bonds. The rising “home bias” in the sovereign debt market has helped stabilize
the investor base in the short run, but may raise the risk of a tighter link between domestic
banks and the sovereign.

While the ECB does not disclose the country breakdown of the securities purchased through the SMP, a gross
approximation may be obtained by dividing the change in the holdings of the Bank of Italy―which had been fairly
stable before the extension of the SMP to Italy―by its share in the ECB’s capital (about 18 percent).

Box 6. Would a Fiscal Devaluation Work in Italy? 1/
A “fiscal devaluation” (FD) is a revenue-neutral shift from employer’s social contributions
toward value-added tax, meant to promote growth, employment, and exports. This shift should
reduce tax distortions and enhance growth. It should also raise the demand for labor by reducing labor
costs. In addition, the decline in the terms of trade should improve the trade balance.
Both simulation results and the limited empirical evidence suggest that the tax shift needs to be
sizeable to have a marked effect. For example, a shift on the order of two percent of GDP from social
security contributions (SSC) towards VAT would raise GDP and employment by 0.5–1.5 percent above
baseline after ten years (the impact may be stronger if both labor and capital taxes are cut, see Box 3).
The revenue shift could also increase net exports by at least 0.4 percent of GDP in the short-run (Table).

A FD may be particularly beneficial in Italy. The country presents four features that would greatly
enhance FD effectiveness: (i) a high tax wedge; (ii) strong wage rigidities; (iii) a moderate
competitiveness gap, and (iv) a fixed nominal exchange rate for much of its trade. Under these
conditions, FD can speed up the wage and real exchange rate adjustments needed to restore
competitiveness that otherwise may take a long time to come about.
Increasing VAT revenues should be achieved by reducing tax expenditures rather than raising
the standard rate. The Italian VAT rate is already high by international standards, and further increase
may exacerbate tax evasion and avoidance and reduce labor supply incentives. Raising 2 percent of
GDP from broadening the base would result in increasing Italy’s VAT efficiency to the OECD average.
The savings could be used to lower taxes on labor. Targeting the SSC cut at lower wage levels
would reduce the cost of the measure, while focusing the impact on those whose employment and
participation are low and more sensitive to tax considerations would enhance its effectiveness. In Italy,
the reduction in the SSC should primarily benefit low earners, women, and young workers.

41.
The new constitutional fiscal rule will be an important tool for strengthening fiscal
discipline and policymaking, if backed by sound institutions. The legislated fiscal council will be
important in assessing fiscal developments and improving accountability, and should be set up fully
independent in terms of staffing, funding, and work agenda. Adopting a binding multi-year
expenditure framework and merging the various spending reviews and assigning them a central role
in the budget process would also buttress the credibility of the fiscal rule.
42.
Plans to address the stock of outstanding public payments should proceed
expeditiously. Estimates of outstanding public payments, based largely on surveys, are around
5 percent of GDP and are likely concentrated at the subnational level.8 Completing quickly the
stocktaking exercise to determine the size of pending and overdue payments at the central and subnational levels, while enhancing public expenditure control and improving the reporting and
timeliness of public payments, would support the private sector and strengthen fiscal discipline and
accountability. The strategy to clear any overdue payments should be complemented by improved
coordination among all levels of government and continued incentives for fiscal prudence also at
the sub-national levels.
43.
The debt management strategy should seek to maintain the current maturity structure
of debt and diversify the investor base. The success of the recent placement of inflation-linked
bonds with retail investors underscores the potential for new sources of demand. The authorities
should also consider other channels such as syndications or private placements to ease pressures on
primary dealers. Moving to provide collateral for sovereign swap transactions would further
strengthen financial stability. Subsequent regular reporting of such transactions in government
accounts would enhance transparency. The authorities should also assess the scope to mobilize
public assets, including through privatization, to reduce rollover pressures and debt further.

Authorities’ Views
44.
The authorities stressed the importance of defining targets in structural terms to
protect the recovery. The government projects the overall deficit to decline further in 2012–13 but
fall short of a balanced budget due to the weaker outlook. In structural terms, however, the budget
is estimated to be in surplus by 0.6 percent of GDP in 2013 before gradually converging to overall
balance by 2016. The authorities remain committed to maintaining a structural balance as the
anchor under their fiscal rule. They also placed a high priority on enacting the needed spending cuts
to avoid raising the VAT rate in October.

8

In general, outstanding public payments are included in the fiscal deficit in GFS/ESA95, as spending is recorded in
accrual terms. These payments, however, are not included in the Maastricht general government debt figures, which
exclude commercial debt. An estimate of the stock of outstanding payments is featured in the GFS balance sheet of
the government under “Liabilities/other accounts payable.”

45.
Fiscal consolidation needs to be rebalanced to reduce taxes and unproductive
spending. The authorities viewed the spending reviews as crucial for identifying savings to lower tax
rates on labor and investment which they saw as too high. They are also considering ways to
broaden the tax base by reducing tax expenditures as part of their overall reform of the tax system.
They cautioned against expecting a large growth impact of further fiscal devaluation in light of
Italy’s mixed experience with earlier fiscal devaluations and the deep rigidities in the economy. They
also saw scope to mobilize public assets to generate revenue and reduce public debt. In June, the
government announced plans to sell shares in three state-owned companies to Cassa Depositi e
Prestiti for around €10 billion which would be used to reduce debt and accelerate delayed payments
to suppliers. A real estate fund will also be created to manage public asset disposal at all levels of
government.
46.
Work is focused on institutions to support the newly adopted balanced budget fiscal
rule. In particular, the authorities are considering the appropriate role of the fiscal council and ways
to ensure its independence. On the medium-term anchor in the fiscal rule, they did not see a strong
case for targeting a 1 percent of GDP structural surplus compared to the current structural balance.
They viewed their plans as sufficiently ambitious, with the debt ratio declining to 114½ percent of
GDP by 2015 and remaining robust to various shocks. Moreover, the structural overall balance
through 2015 would exceed the medium-term objectives and debt reduction target under the Fiscal
Compact. Although the constitutional amendment did not rule out a higher medium-term target,
they saw risks in changing the rule now and confusing the public about their fiscal plans.
47.
Addressing the stock of outstanding public payments to support local economies is a
high priority. Delayed public payments are not a new phenomenon in Italy, but are receiving
greater attention due to the economic difficulties of local suppliers. In response, the authorities have
embarked on a stocktaking exercise to assess the size of the outstanding payments and standardize
the certification of claims. They have also announced a strategy to allow firms to net off commercial
credits against unpaid taxes or obtain credit based on certified claims from financial institutions that
would be guaranteed by a state-backed fund.
48.
Public debt management will remain challenging given volatile market conditions. The
government successfully overcame the February-April “financing wall” after which sovereign funding
needs have eased sharply. Nevertheless, the annual financing need remains sizeable, with the
markets still focused on contagion risks from the rest of Europe in pushing up Italian yields. The
authorities agreed that a wider range of instruments would help diversify the investor base and were
planning another issuance of inflation-linked bonds to retail investors. The Treasury is also
considering the scope for providing collateral in swap transactions to enhance financial stability.

C. Building a More Dynamic and Resilient Financial System

(25 percent of total ECB financing), while available collateral net of haircuts was around €200 billion.
Total bank deposits have remained stable, increasing by 0.4 percent from December 2011 to
April 2012 (Figure 3). Non-resident deposits continued to decline (-20 percent (y/y) in April) which
has been offset by an increase in resident deposits (2 percent, y/y). Looking ahead, Italian banks will
need to roll over an estimated €140 billion in maturing debt in 2013, and without an improvement in
wholesale funding markets, will likely continue relying on ECB liquidity support to meet their
refinancing needs.

bolster term funding which allowed banks to issue securities to themselves, obtain a government guarantee, and
then discount the securities at the ECB for liquidity.

ITALY

with a decline in provisioning rates below the pre-crisis levels, imply increased vulnerability to the
contracting economy, especially the weaker SME and construction sectors. Banks in February agreed
to reintroduce a moratorium on SME loan repayments, but this may mask credit risks and delay
needed restructuring. At the same time, banks’ holding of government bonds has increased to over
7 percent of assets, compared to the 4 percent average for other euro area banking systems, raising
their exposure to sovereign risk.
52.
Insurance companies have also been affected by the weak market conditions. Life and
non-life insurers hold about €200 billion of Italian government debt, and have close crossshareholding ties with the banks. In 2011, they experienced a 12½ percent decline in premiums, and
an increase in surrenders. Recent legislation allowing insurers to forgo booking unrealized losses on
securities held as long-term investments (where they have non-distributable reserves) have shielded
insurers from price fluctuations, but market sentiment towards the sector remains weak, as indicated
by the 28 percent decline in share prices for the year through May.
53.
The corporate sector is also vulnerable to banking distress. While corporate debt as a
share of GDP is not particularly large compared to the European average, corporate leverage—
measured by the debt to equity ratio—is high and has risen steadily since the onset of the crisis.
Italian firms also have a large share of short-term debt (about 40 percent is of maturity less than one
year) and are heavily reliant on bank funding, leaving them vulnerable to interest and liquidity risk.
Firm profitability remains stagnant, and bankruptcies have grown steadily since end 2007.

Policy Issues and Staff Views
54.
Banks need to maintain adequate capital and liquidity buffers to remain resilient to
the downturn. The Bank of Italy (BoI) should continue to encourage large banks under the EBA to
meet their capital needs by raising equity, converting hybrid instruments into core capital, or
disposing of noncore assets, rather than cutting loans. To further enhance transparency, the BoI

30

should consider extending its stress tests to a larger set of institutions, including mid-sized banks,
and publish the results in its regular Financial Stability Reports. This would help market participants
assess banks’ capacity to withstand a slowdown and funding distress and anchor market discipline.10
Encouraging banks to improve their capacity to post eligible collateral at the BoI would facilitate
access to Eurosystem liquidity facilities.
55.
Reducing impaired loans would free up resources for new lending. Banks’ buildup of
impaired loans reflects both an inefficient legal process that delays loan write-offs and the flow of
new bad loans arising from the slowdown. The growing stock and slow pace of disposal have
constrained core profitability and tied up funding and capital. Supervisors should encourage banks
to develop strategies for selling, restructuring or writing down impaired loans to free up resources
for lending. The development of a market for restructuring distressed assets could be facilitated by
ensuring adequate bank provisioning and aligning more closely tax deductibility of loan loss
provisioning and write-offs.11 Streamlining bankruptcy procedures—which on average take more
than 8 years—and promoting more out-of-court workouts would provide stronger tools to address
impaired loans. Supervisors should also encourage banks to provision appropriately against loans
benefiting from the moratorium agreement on SMEs and take early action toward problem
borrowers.
56.
The crisis management framework should continue to evolve to address systemic risks.
The plan to broaden the resolution tool kit under the forthcoming EU Directive, including the
introduction of an ex-ante deposit insurance fund, is welcome. Looking ahead, broader backup
funding via pan-European mechanisms, including direct capital injections from EU institutions, could
make the resolution framework more robust.

Authorities’ Views
57.
Italian banks continue to benefit from their large and stable retail funding base, low
leverage, and traditional lending model which has limited exposures to risky assets. The
resilience of the system has also been supported by firm supervision and regulation. As a result,
Italian banks emerged relatively unscathed from the global financial crisis and have strengthened
their capital base without large-scale equity support from the government.
58.
Maintaining adequate capital and liquidity buffers remains essential. Supervisors saw
the large five Italian banks on track to meet their EBA capital requirements without resorting to
10

Using publicly available data, a scenario analysis by the staff that assumes a doubling in default rates on
outstanding loans in 2012–13 compared to staff’s baseline projections and an average increase in the coverage ratio
by 1 percentage point compared to 2011 would lower the average core tier 1 ratio for the 10 largest banking groups
to 7.1 percent from 8.7 percent at end-March 2012. Five banks would have a ratio below 7 percent, with one below
6 percent. Given data limitations, a similar scaling up exercise for the smaller banks was not possible.

11

Banks are limited to deducting loan loss provisions equivalent to 0.3–0.5 percent of their total loan portfolios, with
any excess carried over 9–18 years. This is likely to be a binding constraint as banks’ loan loss provision has averaged
around 0.8 percent of total loans and would rise during a recession.

excessive deleveraging. On liquidity, Italian banks still possess ample collateral to receive
Eurosystem financing should funding pressures re-emerge. Earlier delays in pledging collateral at
the Bank of Italy have been addressed and banks now need to strengthen their capacity to evaluate
their collateral. On extending stress tests to smaller banks, supervisors emphasized that they are
already undertaking several exercises to assess the soundness of the banking sector, and that the
results are published in the Bank of Italy’s Annual Report. They also stressed the need to coordinate
stress tests at the European level, starting with the EBA’s own exercise.
59.
The authorities cautioned against comparing impaired loan ratios in Italy with other
countries in Europe. They pointed out that the definition and coverage of NPLs varies widely across
the region and that disclosure in Italy, in some respects, is more stringent and transparent. The more
relevant figure is the flow of new impaired loans which in Italy has risen but remains within historical
averages. Moreover, although provisioning rates have declined from pre-crisis levels, these figures
do not include coverage from real estate and other guarantee collateral which provides an
important additional buffer for banks. The authorities considered the stock of “legacy” NPLs a
structural feature of the system, reflecting a slow and inefficient legal system that hinders disposals
of bad loans. The supervisory authorities recognized that the tax treatment for loan loss provisions
may serve as a disincentive for more aggressive write-downs, but not for provisions, which they
regulate closely. The tax authorities saw scope to clarify the rules on loan write-offs but pointed to
the continued benefit in smoothing the volatility of tax revenues.
60.
A market for distressed assets could support corporate restructuring but the timing is
important. They noted that a market for distressed assets had developed in the late 1990s as Italy
emerged from its deep recession and that more recently, a few banks had sold bad loans. However,
the amounts were very small and banks generally remain reluctant to sell due to the wide pricing
gap with their perceived recovery value. The authorities cautioned against pushing banks to sell bad
loans aggressively in a “fire sale” that would drive down asset prices and generate further losses.
Instead, they put the focus on improving the efficiency of the judicial system to allow banks to more
proactively restructure and assist their borrowers.
61.
The authorities have taken steps to strengthen supervision of insurers. Modifications to
the accounting treatment of government bonds were introduced to avoid excessive volatility in
balance sheets and contain pro-cyclicality, while at the same time safeguarding stability. They also
emphasized that the various agencies cooperate closely in supervising financial conglomerates that
are active both in the insurance and banking sectors.
62.
Supervisors continue to use preemptively crisis management procedures. Since 2009,
35 financial institutions have been placed under special administration procedures, up from 9 in the
previous three-year period. Two-thirds of the cases returned to normal operations, including after
merging. Pan-European financial support for public capital or deposit insurance could strengthen
the resolution framework but its credibility would depend on the size of resources available.

STAFF APPRAISAL
63.
Italy’s economy is expected to contract this year owing to tight financial conditions,
the global slowdown, and the needed fiscal consolidation. Absent shocks, the recovery will take
hold in early 2013, led by a modest pickup in exports, but will lag the rest of the region. The risks to
the outlook are on the downside, stemming mainly from an intensification of the euro area crisis.
64.
Progress at the European level in strengthening the currency union will be crucial for
securing stability. Despite the strong consolidation underway, Italy with its high level of public debt
remains vulnerable to contagion from the euro area crisis. A more integrated currency union with
greater fiscal and financial discipline and risk sharing, combined with further ECB support as needed,
would help secure stability and support Italy’s adjustment efforts.
65.
At the same time, maintaining the momentum for reform in Italy will be important to
address underlying structural weaknesses and revive growth. The difficult business environment,
fragmented labor market, and limited competition in services have contributed to the poor growth
performance and loss in competiveness. In the absence of comprehensive reforms, potential growth
over the medium term would remain low. To revive growth, the priority should be on
comprehensive structural reforms to boost productivity and labor participation, a supportive fiscal
strategy that is both growth-friendly and sustainable, and steps to promote a more dynamic and
resilient banking system.
66.
The gains to growth from deeper structural reforms could be substantial. The
government has embarked on important reforms to deregulate the service sector and make the
labor market more inclusive and flexible. Accelerating these reforms, and locking in the necessary
legislative and administrative changes, would strengthen confidence and create momentum for
further reforms.
67.
Labor reforms should aim to bridge the gap between permanent and temporary
workers, reduce the tax wedge, and decentralize wage setting. The labor market reform bill
should be passed quickly to reduce uncertainty and encourage new hires. Allowing for a more
flexible open-ended contract that gradually increases employment protection with tenure could
lower the cost of new hires, especially for young workers. Reducing the marginal tax rates for
married second-earners would help raise female labor participation, while greater use of firm-level
contracts would better match wages to flexibility.
68.
Product market reforms with the broadest impact on growth should be accelerated.
Completing the planned ownership separation in the gas sector this year would improve
competition, while accelerating the opening of professional orders will lower rents. A greater push
for privatization would improve the quality of public services and reduce costs. Increasing the
efficiency of the judicial system would also have wide-ranging benefits for lowering business costs
and strengthening other reforms.

69.
The fiscal adjustment this year and next is appropriate but its composition could be
made more growth-friendly. The sizeable adjustment in 2012–13 is critical for fiscal sustainability,
and the increased focus on targeting a structural balance will ensure flexibility in fiscal policy.
Shifting further the composition of adjustment towards lower taxes supported by expenditure cuts
would better distribute the burden of adjustment and help growth.
70.
Locking in prudent medium-term fiscal policies would further improve confidence. The
new constitutional fiscal rule will be an important tool for strengthening fiscal discipline and
policymaking. To create a buffer against future shocks, targeting a 1 percent of GDP structural
surplus from 2014 onwards as the medium-term anchor for the fiscal rule would put the debt ratio
on a more robust downward path. This could be achieved through further cuts to less productive
expenditure. The June 2012 plan to dispose of state assets to reduce debt is a positive first step and
should be followed by a more comprehensive program for privatization. The progress made in
pension reform will be important for securing long-term sustainability.
71.
Banks need to maintain adequate capital and liquidity buffers to remain resilient to
the downturn. The BoI should continue encouraging large banks to meet their capital needs by
raising equity or disposing of noncore assets, rather than cutting loans. Improving banks’ capacity to
post eligible collateral at the BoI would facilitate access to Eurosystem facilities. The BoI should
extend stress tests to a larger set of institutions and publish the results regularly to further enhance
transparency and discipline.
72.
Reducing impaired loans would free up resources for new lending. Ensuring adequate
bank provisioning and aligning more closely tax deductibility of loan loss provisioning and write-offs
could facilitate the development of a market for restructuring distressed assets. Improving the
efficiency of bankruptcy proceedings and out-of-court workouts would help banks more effectively
address impaired loans.
73.
It is recommended that the next Article IV Consultation take place on the standard 12month cycle.

ITALY

ANNEX I: DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Years of high debt and low growth have left Italy exposed to heightened concerns about the euro-area
crisis and the global outlook. Under staff forecasts, which include the authorities’ announced fiscal
plans, but with staff’s macroeconomic outlook, the debt-to-GDP ratio stabilizes in 2013 and remains
vulnerable to shocks.
Background


Sovereign yields. The current level of yields on Italian
debt is not unprecedented, with part of the rise in
spreads attributable to declining German bund-yields,
a clear departure from the first decade of the eurozone.

0.2 percent of GDP. The effective interest rate is
forecast to rise from 4.2 percent in 2011 to 4.6 percent in 2012. The government financing needs
are large, at about 30 percent of GDP in 2012, largely due to the rollover of existing debt.



Primary Surplus. Italy is also one of the
few euro-area countries running a primary
surplus and recent pension reforms have
significantly reduced the long-run impact
of aging on the fiscal accounts.

Scenario analysis


42

Baseline. Staff forecast that the debt-to-GDP ratio will peak at about 126.4 percent in 2013,
before declining to about 119 percent in 2017. Although spreads are assumed to moderate
from current levels, the effective interest rate is forecast to rise from 4.2 percent in 2011 to
5.3 percent in 2017. The structural primary balance improves with the implementation of the
authorities’ fiscal adjustment plans. Beyond 2015, the constitutional requirement for a balanced
budget provides a lower-bound for the structural overall balance.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ITALY

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Several additional scenarios are used to evaluate the sustainability of debt (see chart):


Structural surplus scenario. Staff recommends targeting a structural overall surplus of
1 percent of GDP from 2014 under the new fiscal rule. In this scenario, the structural primary
balance would improve to 6.7 percent of GDP and the debt-to-GDP ratio would drop to about

2/ Debt projections incorporate Italy’s planned contributions to the EFSF and the ESM, increasing debt by 2 percent of GDP in 2012.

116 percent by 2017. Spreads are assumed to tighten relative to the baseline.


Slow recovery scenario. A failure to implement domestic structural reforms, weak external
demand and tight credit conditions lead to a slower recovery compared to the baseline, with
medium-term real annual growth stagnating at 0.25 percent—the average annual growth rate
experienced over the last decade (average growth over 2013-17 would be flat). Low growth
weighs on the fiscal balance, with the primary surplus reaching only 4.2 percent of GDP by 2017.
The debt-ratio continues to rise, reaching 128 percent of GDP in 2017.



High interest rate scenario. Market concerns about medium-term debt sustainability intensify,
thereby increasing interest rates—spreads rise to about 580 bps from 2013. The government’s
interest bill reaches 8 percent of GDP by 2017, with an implicit average interest rate of
6.5 percent. Higher borrowing costs are passed on to the real economy, depressing growth. The
debt-to-GDP ratio approaches 130 percent by 2017, despite a sizeable structural primary
surplus. The same scenario is also applied using staff’s recommended fiscal stance (1 percent
structural surplus), which provides a greater buffer against the shock.



Policy slippage scenario. Reform fatigue weakens the implementation of fiscal adjustment
plans—starting in 2012, only 25 percent of the planned adjustment is undertaken. Short-term
growth improves relative to the baseline due to the reduced fiscal drag, although this is partially
offset by rising risk premia (25 basis points increase for each 1 percent of GDP slippage). The
debt-to-GDP ratio does not stabilize until 2017 at about 131 percent.

Deep recession and interest rate shock. This could potentially arise due to contagion from the
euro area crisis and slow progress in structural reforms. Annual GDP growth is 1 percentage

which boost labor participation and increase

Sensitivity analysis

The level of Italian debt-to-GDP is sensitive to
assumptions regarding the growth-interest
rate differential. Figure 2 shows a fan-chart of
the debt-to-GDP ratio using the staff forecast
for the primary balance and stochastic
simulations for real GDP growth and interest
rates. Given the sizeable primary surplus,
according to the simulations, there is
95 percent probability that the debt-to-GDP
ratio will remain below 130 percent in the
medium term.

For non-energy trade, Italy faces growing
global competition, due to an unfavorable
export structure. A breakdown of Italian exports
reveals a relative predominance of labor-intensive
and low-technology goods, similar to that of
many emerging-market economies where
competition is fiercer.
Italian trade is moving up the technology
ladder, but only slowly. There is some evidence
of restructuring within the manufacturing sector,
with a shift toward higher-quality goods that are
relatively sheltered from emerging-market
competition. But the ability of exporting firms to
adjust is constrained by the same structural
factors that have held back Italy’s economy-wide
potential.
The euro-area crisis has so far had only a
modest impact on Italian pricecompetitiveness trends. Since late 2009, the
CPI- and ULC-based real effective exchange rates
have depreciated by around 5 and 7 percent,
respectively, mostly reflecting the lower euro.
Within the eurozone, however, the pattern is less
compelling. Producer prices in Italy (excluding
construction) have increased by 10½ percent
since 2009; in line with German prices, but around
1 point below the euro-area average. Nominal
wages, on the other hand, have shown some
signs of easing, and have increased by only
3¼ percent in Italy, compared to around 5¼ and
4½ percent in Germany and the Euro area,
respectively.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Looking forward, improved competitiveness will depend closely on successful structural
reform. Labor-market rigidities and low productivity have resulted in a gradual deterioration of
Italy’s price competitiveness. In this context, staff assesses Italy’s real effective exchange rate to be
modestly overvalued by around 5–10 percent. This assessment stems from a range of CGER-style
methodologies,12 and is consistent with market views. Using standard trade elasticities, it is also
consistent with the new External Balances Assessment (EBA) approach, which finds that the
structural current account deficit is around 1–1½ percent of GDP above the level justified by
fundamentals and appropriate policies. Simulations suggest that full implementation of the
authorities’ reform agenda should close this competitiveness gap (see Box 3).

12

Under the Macroeconomic Balance, External Sustainability, and Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate approaches of the
Consultative Group on Exchange Rate Issues (CGER), the most recent overvaluation estimates for May 2012 are 10, 6
and 7 percent, respectively—largely unchanged from the 5-10 percent range from the Fall 2011 CGER round. See Lee
and others (2008), “Exchange Rate Assessments: CGER Methodologies” IMF Occasional Paper No. 261, and
Vitek (2012) “Exchange Rate Assessment Tools for Advanced, Emerging, and Developing Economies.”

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

APPENDIX I. ITALY: MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND AUTHORITIES’ RESPONSE
Fund Recommendations

Policy Actions
Fiscal Policy

Identify specific measures to achieve the nearbalanced budget by 2014

The authorities enacted three fiscal adjustment packages in 2011 and
identified the measures needed to balance the budget in structural terms
in 2013.

To achieve durable fiscal consolidation, improve the
efficiency of public expenditure and rationalize it
through periodic expenditure reviews

Consolidation remains mostly revenue-based. In April, the government
launched a new spending review to identify expenditure cuts.

Reduce substantially tax expenditure; simplify tax
system to support growth and reduce tax evasion

A comprehensive review of tax expenditure has been completed but there
has been little progress so far in reducing tax expenditure. A wider tax
reform is being discussed within the government which will include
simplification measures.

Accelerate further pension reforms

With the December 2011 fiscal package, further pension reforms to
strengthen long-term sustainability were introduced.

Strengthen further budgetary procedures

In April 2012, the parliament approved a structural balanced budget rule
in the constitution which is set to take effect in 2014 and legislated the
creation of a fiscal council.

Allow local authorities to tax all real estate properties;
integrate fiscal federalism reform with the fiscal
consolidation

Local tax on primary residence was re-introduced, as part of the
December 2011 fiscal package.
Financial Sector Policy

Further recapitalize banks and frontload
recapitalization

Banks have strengthened their capital position, even though progress
varies across institutions. Banking system core tier 1 ratio has increased
from 8.3 percent in 2010 to 9.3 percent in 2011, and further important
capital actions have taken place in 2012.

Introduce governance reforms in the banking system,
including in Banche Popolari and Fondazioni

Some measures to strengthen corporate governance in the banking
sector have been taken, most notably a law against interlocking directors
in financial institutions. Eligibility criteria for board members of Fondazioni
have been enhanced.

Further recapitalize or restructure enterprises;
ameliorate the reorganization and debt restructuring
frameworks

The authorities have taken measures to foster firms recapitalization,
including an allowance for corporate equity (ACE). A legal framework for
personal insolvency proceedings has been introduced to strengthen the
bankruptcy regime.
Structural Reforms

Implement further product market reforms to remove
impediments to competition, improve regulation and
give more powers to the Antitrust Authority, open up
further services and network industries, and reduce
public ownership

Comprehensive packages of liberalization and administrative
simplifications reforms were approved in 2012, in addition to measures in
2011. Reforms have strengthened the regulatory framework and powers
of the Antitrust Authority and aim at increasing competition and lowering
business costs. Progress on privatization has been limited, but plans to
sell shares in state-owned companies have recently been announced.

Implement policies to address labor market duality
and low participation rate; harmonize labor contracts
and legislation between protected and unprotected
workers; promote decentralized wage bargaining

In April 2011, the government submitted to the parliament a wide-ranging
labor market reform bill. The reform aims at making the labor market
more flexible and inclusive but more could be done to address duality
and increase participation. Progress on wage bargaining decentralization
(with one notable exception) has been limited.

Consider a national commission for growth

Current reforms do not envisage such commission.

ITALY

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. Italy’s economic database is comprehensive and of
generally high quality. Italy has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and
has posted the metadata on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB). Data are provided
to the Fund in a comprehensive manner (see Table 1). The authorities regularly publish a full range
of economic and financial data, as well as a calendar of dates for the main statistical releases. Italy is
also subject to the statistical requirements and timeliness and reporting standards of Eurostat and
the European Central Bank (ECB), and has adopted the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA95).
The shift to chain-weighted indices for national accounts has been largely completed over the
course of 2006.
A Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC)—Data Module (Country Report No.
02/234, 10/18/02) found Italy’s macroeconomic statistics to be of generally high quality, but also
identified some shortcomings that hindered an accurate and timely analysis of economic and
financial developments: (i) no statistical agency had the responsibility to compile and disseminate a
comprehensive statement of government finances, and a persistent difference had emerged
between the SGP-monitored fiscal deficit and the PSBR net of privatization receipts (discussed in
detail in the 2004 Staff Report); (ii) source data and/or statistical techniques could be strengthened
in several areas, most importantly, by raising response rates on the enterprise surveys used in the
national accounts and producer price index, making price collection for the consumer price index
more efficient, and improving the coverage of cross-border financial transactions; (iii) balance of
payments and government finance statistics could be closer aligned with the internationally
accepted methodological guidelines on concepts and definitions, scope, classification and
sectorization, and/or valuation; and (iv) resources were under pressure in some parts of the National
Institute of Statistics (Istat) in the face of the statistical requirements of the EU and the Euro area.
Despite some improvements in the national accounts, changes in inventories are derived as a
residual and lumped together with the statistical discrepancy thus hampering the economic analysis.
The Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes— Fiscal Transparency Module—Update
(Country Report No. 06/64, February 2006) found that some progress has been made vis-à-vis the
2003 ROSC update, especially toward strengthening the integrity of data. However, according to the
report a few issues remain outstanding. First, the transparency and timeliness of budget documents
should be improved; for example, key details underlying budgetary plans have typically been
available only well after the draft budget itself, hampering a proper assessment of fiscal plans.
Second, more information on financial transactions between the government and public enterprises
should be made available—this would also help address the discrepancies in fiscal balances
discussed above. Third, the general lack of data on the operations of larger nonstate entities where
the state is a shareholder, such as the road company, should be addressed. Finally, as public private
partnerships gain ground from the current low base, these operations and associated contingent
liabilities should be transparently recorded, including in budget documentation; and project
evaluation should be strengthened across all levels of government. Also on fiscal data, in recent
years progress has been made in reconciling the discrepancy between the cash-based net

borrowing requirement and the accrual budget deficit, and, as a result, the statistical discrepancy
has decreased in recent years. Furthermore, on-line access to main fiscal documents has improved
recently, and consolidated cash accounts of central government economic entities (such as the road
company, Anas) are reported in the quarterly cash reports (relazione trimestrale di cassa) of the
Ministry of Economy and Finance.

Statement by the Staff Representative on Italy
Executive Board Meeting
July 9, 2012
1.
This statement provides additional information on policy actions in Italy since the
Article IV mission complementing the staff report (SM/12/152). The additional information
does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Recent macroeconomic developments. Recent macroeconomic data point to
continued contraction in Q2 2012, in line with staff’s projections. The unemployment rate
came down from 10.2 percent in April to 10.1 percent in May, reflecting a 0.3 percent
increase in employment. However, retail sales fell significantly in April, bringing the annual
decline to about 7 percent, and business and consumer confidence indicators remained at low
levels through June.
3.
Bankruptcy and civil justice reforms and other growth measures. A decree law
on growth measures entered into effect on June 26. It includes modifications to the
bankruptcy regime, such as a new tax provision on deductibility of losses which would
facilitate financing of companies in distress. In civil justice, the decree aims to speed up the
judicial process by streamlining appeals procedures. In addition, the decree provides for
favorable tax treatment for project bonds to promote private-public partnerships, extends tax
incentives in infrastructure and construction, amends the VAT regime for real estate leases
and sales, and introduces new debt financing instruments for non-listed companies to
improve their access to capital markets.
4.
Bank recapitalization. On June 26, the Council of Ministers approved measures to
increase the capital base of Banca Monte dei Paschi (MPS), Italy’s third largest commercial
bank. The state support of up to €3.9 billion, which includes a replacement of €1.9 billion
provided in 2009, will help MPS meet the target of 9 percent core Tier 1 ratio as determined
by the European Banking Authority (EBA).
5.
Labor market reform. On June 27, the parliament approved the labor market reform
law, largely in line with the government’s proposal submitted in April. Among the
modifications introduced is the extension of tax incentives for firm-level bargaining, a
minimum remuneration for some temporary contracts, and some increase in flexibility for
firms to use temporary and apprenticeship contracts.

Statement by Arrigo Sadun, Executive Director for Italy
July 9, 2012
1. Recent Developments
Facing intensive pressure from financial markets as the European debt crisis intensified in
the middle of last year, Italy had no choice but to enact multiple rounds of austerity
measures that have impacted negatively growth and employment. Against this
background, the top priorities of the new government are achieving a lasting
consolidation of public finances and restoring growth by addressing its structural
weaknesses. The domestic strategy founds its necessary complement in relentless efforts
to promote an effective response to the debt crisis at the European level.
The structural reforms introduced in the past few months and those planned will produce
tangible benefits in the years ahead, but in the short term could hardly be expected to spur
aggregate demand. Economic activity continued to contract throughout the first quarter of
2012, while a modest recovery is expected in the second part of the year. The recovery
will be led by exports as domestic demand will continue to lag behind the business cycle.
Private consumption and investments should contribute positively to GDP growth in
2013 as the growth-dampening effects of the austerity measures wear off and real
disposable income recovers.
Inflation in the first half of the year was somewhat higher than the European average; this
reflected mostly the spike in energy prices and the increase in the VAT. However, core
inflation remains at 2.2 percent because of sluggish demand and restrains in wage rates.
Wages in the public sector have been frozen for the past two years and have been
significantly reduced for senior officers.
2. A Balanced Budget
On fiscal policy, the goal is to balance the budget in structural terms and to put the debt
on a declining path by 2013. The measures enacted in the last 12 months represent a
fiscal adjustment of about 5 percent of GDP and they aim to reduce the deficit from 3.9
percent in 2011 to 1.7 percent this year and to 0.5 percent in 2013. In structural terms, the
deficit is expected to decline from 3.6 percent in 2011 to 0.4 percent this year and to
achieve a surplus of 0.6 percent in 2013. The principle of a balanced budget has been
enshrined in the Italian Constitution, in line with the commitments undertaken in the
framework of the European Fiscal Compact.
In the short term, the bulk of the fiscal adjustment is taking place through tax increases;
however, efforts were made to make fiscal consolidation as growth friendly as possible.
Thus, the burden has been placed on consumption and property taxes. VAT rates were
increased and a real estate tax abolished by the previous governments has been reinstated.
Conversely, taxes have been reduced for companies hiring new employees and on capital
investments in order to support economic growth.

2

Further fiscal consolidation measures are expected through spending cuts; a
comprehensive spending review has been launched with the objectives of reducing the
overall level of government spending and improving its quality. The spending review
broadens the efforts made in the past few years to curb current expenditures. Wages in
the public sector have been frozen since 2010, while those of senior officials were cut by
10 percent.
3. Debt Reduction
Despite challenging economic conditions, the government remains firmly committed to
reducing public debt to a more manageable level through the achievement of consistent
primary surpluses. A structural primary surplus of more than 1 percent was reached last
year; this year, the authorities expect it to increase to well above 4 percent and to stabilize
around 6 percent from 2013 onward. Accordingly, the debt should start to decline as of
next year, one year ahead of the staff projections, and should reach the 114.4 percent
level by 2015. It would not be the first time that the country managed to reduce the debtto-GDP ratio despite very slow growth, thanks to sizeable primary surpluses. To
accelerate the path of debt reduction, the government is also looking at the possibility of
disposing of some of its most liquid assets, including stocks of state-owned companies.
New initiatives are also scheduled to establish companies, trusts, or real estate funds for
the development and sale of public real estate properties.
Obviously, its high debt level makes the country vulnerable to external shocks. However,
the debt sustainability is ensured even under the relatively pessimistic assumptions used
in the sensitivity analysis in the Stability Programme. In fact, assuming a 0.5 percent
reduction in GDP growth or higher interest rates of 100 b.p. with respect to the baseline,
the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to decline by 2014 at the latest. It would take rather
extreme assumptions such as the staff scenario of permanent no-growth and an increase
in interest rates of 100 b.p. to push the debt toward 140 percent of GDP.
4. The Spending Review
The need to frontload the fiscal adjustment has led to an increase in fiscal pressure;
however, in the medium term, the goal of reducing public debt will rely increasingly on
the reduction of current expenditure. Accordingly, the government has embarked on a
comprehensive spending review that aims to reduce the overall level of government
spending and to improve its quality, focusing on key areas. Thus, the previous approach
of imposing linear cuts across the board has been replaced by an analytical assessment of
needed resources. All areas of government spending are under review, with top priorities
identified in the budget of key central agencies and local governments.

3
5. The Reforms Agenda
Since the Reforms Agenda is supported by all major political forces, the government has
been able to move expeditiously on a wide range of areas, starting with the completion of
the Pension System reform. This will increase the retirement age to the highest level in
Europe and it will ensure its sustainability in the long term.
In June, Parliament approved a long-delayed reform of the labor market aimed at
increasing productivity, creating more jobs, and ultimately boosting growth. The reform
reduces some of the rigidities of the labor market as well as the disparities between overprotected traditional jobs and limited benefits for new entrants while providing for a
universal unemployment insurance system. It also provides greater flexibility to
employers to adjust working hours and employment levels according to the business
cycle. These changes are balanced by the introduction of a universal unemployment
insurance benefit to which all companies will contribute. Under the new scheme,
unemployment benefits will be extended to a much larger segment of the workforce,
including workers with relatively shorter tenures. The reform also introduces a faster,
out-of-court procedure to handle labor disputes in case of dismissal for economic or other
objective reasons.
The reform also strengthens active labor market policies by facilitating youngsters to
enter the labor force, by widening the use of apprenticeship contracts, and by retraining
those who have lost their jobs.
6. Restoring Growth and Competitiveness
Even before the global crisis hit hard the Italian economy, its performance had been
lagging behind those of other European countries for more than a decade, as a result of a
slow adjustment to the new international specialization of labor brought about by the
globalization and deep-seated structural rigidities. Economic activity was hampered by
deteriorated competitiveness and low productivity growth. The current government came
to power last winter with the double mandate of addressing the fiscal crisis with urgent
measures and of implementing long-delayed structural measures necessary in order to
boost both growth and employment. Some of the reforms that aim to streamline and
modernize the Pension, Judicial and Administrative Systems are also expected to improve
the efficiency of the economy. Specific measures to boost growth have recently been
submitted to Parliament in the so-called “Sviluppo Italia” package. These include
initiatives to improve the business environment (a reduction of the tax wedge on labor,
notably in the case of employment of women and young workers; the re-funding of the
guarantee fund for SMEs; the simplification of the incentives scheme for enterprises; the
redesign and extension of tax incentives on building renovations and energy efficiency
investments; and the introduction of substantial tax benefits for companies’
recapitalization).

4
A wide array of measures has been introduced to increase competition in key product and
services markets, including the liberalization of professional services, the distribution
sector, the transportation sector, and the network industries. Of particular importance are
the planned liberalizations in the energy sector with the breaking-up of the verticallyintegrated cartel in the gas and electricity sectors.
The government is seeking to expedite investment in key infrastructure projects by
facilitating the participation of private capital in public investment, by reducing the
administrative burden, and by coordinating regional programs co-financed by EU
structural funds. Furthermore, in order to ease the financial pressures of government
suppliers, measures have been taken to accelerate the disbursement of approved
payments.
7. The Financial Sector
Throughout the global and debt crisis, the Italian banking system has remained broadly
resilient, reflecting a sound business model (retail funding accounts for about 85 percent
of the total bank loans), prudent risk management practices, and effective supervision.
Italian banks faced the crisis without the over-extended leveraging of most of their peers
and without large exposure to inflated real estate markets or Program countries. However,
two recessions in three years and the intensification of the European debt crisis last
summer have taken their toll; access to wholesale markets deteriorated and funding costs
rose in the second half of last year. Credit growth declined and the quality of loans
worsened.
Funding pressures have eased considerably in recent months as result of the ECB LTRO
operations. For the 32 banking groups covered by the weekly liquidity monitoring by
Banca d’Italia, LTRO funding is sufficient to meet in full those bonds held by
institutional investors that come due in the next two years.
During 2011 Italian banks have significantly strengthened their capital base, mostly by
tapping private markets. For the five largest banking groups (covering about 70 percent
of total consolidated assets), the core tier 1 capital ratio increased from less than 6 percent
in 2007 to 9.5 percent by March 2012; this compares to an average of slightly above 10
percent for the euro area.
To meet the EBA Recommendations, four of the largest banks have strengthened their
capital position by about €15 billion by the end-June. Half of this amount has been raised
by the largest bank through the issuance of new equity; the rest by a combination of
measures, including asset disposal, retained earnings and, in one case, by issuing
recapitalization bonds subscribed by the government.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 10, 2012

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with Italy
On July 9, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Italy.1
Background
Italy’s economy entered recession in late 2011. GDP contracted for a third consecutive quarter,
by 0.8 percent quarter-on-quarter in Q1 2012, led by sharp falls in consumption and investment.
Exports also fell, along with the slowdown in global demand, but net exports contributed
positively to growth due to sharp import compression. Household real disposable income
continued to decline in 2011, and the unemployment rate reached 10.1 percent in May 2012,
with youth unemployment at 36 percent. The external current account deficit narrowed from
3½ percent of GDP in 2010 to around 2¾ percent of GDP in the year to Q1 2012. Inflation
increased to 2.9 percent in 2011, and further to 3.6 percent year-on-year in June mainly
because of non-core components.
The economy is expected to continue contracting through the year owing to tight financial
conditions, the global slowdown, and the needed fiscal consolidation. Absent shocks, the
recovery will take hold in early 2013, led by a modest pickup in exports, but will lag the rest of
the region. Inflation will ease only gradually, as the impact of weak demand is partly offset by
higher indirect taxes. The risks to the outlook are however on the downside, stemming mainly
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

from an intensification of the euro area crisis. Over the medium term, low trend productivity and
an aging society are likely to constrain Italy’s growth prospects. The steady loss in
competitiveness over the past decade, if remained unaddressed, will remain a drag on growth.
The overall fiscal deficit continued to improve from 4.5 percent of GDP in 2010 to 3.9 percent of
GDP in 2011, in line with the authorities’ target. In response to financial pressures in the second
half of 2011, the authorities enacted three fiscal consolidation packages, bringing the total
adjustment for 2012–14 to around 5 percent of GDP. As part of the consolidation, the pension
system was strengthened further. In April, the Parliament approved a structural balanced
budget rule in the constitution which is set to take effect in 2014 and legislated the creation of a
fiscal council. Also, in April, the government embarked on a new spending review to identify
expenditure cuts that would replace the need to increase VAT rates in October.
The financial turmoil has put banks under stress. Credit ratings for several banks were cut in
late 2011 and again in 2012, and remain on a negative outlook. With limited access to
wholesale markets and higher funding costs, Italian banks have relied heavily on Eurosystem
support. Banks have made progress in strengthening their capital positions and raising private
capital to meet their EBA targets. Gross impaired loans have risen to 11 percent in 2011, from
less than 6 percent before the crisis, and banks’ exposure to the sovereign has also increased.
Higher funding costs and tighter lending standards, especially for smaller firms, have pushed up
corporate borrowing rates.
The government has embarked on wide-ranging structural reforms to boost productivity and
potential growth. Important progress is being made in product market reforms. Parliament in
March passed a comprehensive liberalization package that covered key sectors and
strengthened the enforcement of competition rules. Administrative simplification reforms, which
should lower the cost of doing business, were also approved. Parliament has also passed a
labor market reform bill aimed at making the labor market more inclusive and flexible. The bill
promotes open-ended and apprenticeship contracts for young workers, makes unemployment
insurance more universal, and facilitates hiring by reducing the cost of dismissal. Progress has
also been made on strengthening the anti-corruption legal framework.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Italian authorities for launching an ambitious policy agenda
to secure fiscal sustainability and promote growth. The economic and financial situation
nevertheless remains challenging, with downside risks to the outlook. Directors emphasized the
importance of maintaining strong policies and the momentum for reforms. To revive growth,
priority should be given to raising productivity and labor participation, pursuing growth-friendly
fiscal consolidation, and promoting a more dynamic and resilient banking system. Sustained

3
implementation of this agenda needs to be supported by continued progress at the European
level in strengthening the currency union.
Directors acknowledged the important steps taken towards deregulating the service sector and
making the labor market more flexible and inclusive. They welcomed the passage of the labor
market reform bill which promotes open-ended contracts and makes unemployment insurance
more universal. Further action will be necessary to bridge the gap between permanent and
temporary workers, raise female labor participation, and better match wages to productivity via
greater wage setting decentralization. In the area of product markets, priority should be given to
accelerating reforms in the energy and services sectors. Directors also encouraged the
authorities to take steps to improve the investment climate and reduce the cost of doing
business. They welcomed efforts to enhance the efficiency of the judicial system.
Directors commended the authorities for initiating a sizeable fiscal adjustment. They welcomed
the increased focus on targeting a structural balance to ensure flexibility in fiscal policy.
Directors encouraged the authorities to rebalance the adjustment towards expenditure cuts and
lower taxes. The recently announced package of spending cuts is a step in the right direction.
Directors looked forward to the swift follow-up on the ongoing spending review to help reduce
the overall level of government spending and improve its quality. They saw scope for cutting the
public sector wage bill, reducing tax expenditures, and stepping up efforts against tax evasion.
This would create space for growth-supporting measures to reduce the labor tax wedge and
encourage investment.
Directors emphasized that locking in prudent medium-term policies to reduce the high level of
public debt would further improve confidence. They welcomed the important progress in the
pension reform, the introduction of a new constitutional structural balanced budget rule, and the
creation of the fiscal council. Directors saw the recent plan to sell public assets to reduce public
debt as a positive first step and stressed the need to pursue more comprehensive privatization.
Directors recognized the strengths of the Italian banking system but concurred that banks need
to maintain adequate capital and liquidity buffers to remain resilient to the downturn. They noted
that reducing impaired loans would free up resources for new lending and strengthen banks’
balance sheets. In this context, they saw scope for improving the efficiency of bankruptcy
proceedings and out-of-court workouts to support corporate restructuring.
