STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
December 30, 2011

KEY ISSUES
A gradual recovery is underway. Real GDP growth is recovering from a marked
slowdown in 2009. The slowdown reflected the impact of the global crisis as FDI inflows
slowed because a number of planned large projects were postponed on account of
funding difficulties. The recovery—led by activities in the construction, agriculture and
tourism sectors—is subject to downside risks stemming from the financial and economic
difficulties in Europe. A protracted recession in Europe (especially Portugal) would likely
dampen aid, FDI, and remittances to São Tomé & Príncipe, with adverse consequences
for growth.
Achieving macroeconomic stability remains a challenge. Recent increases in world
food and fuel prices rekindled inflation pressures and have left inflation at double digit
levels. The current outlook for nonfood commodity prices suggests that the inflation
pressures should recede. The authorities tightened fiscal policy in 2010 and 2011.
Further consolidation is needed to dampen domestic demand pressures in order to
safeguard international reserves and protect the exchange rate peg. The government’s
medium-term fiscal objective is to stabilize the domestic primary deficit at a level that
can be financed by non-debt creating means.
Possible repercussions from developments in Europe pose risks to financial
stability. The central bank has made good progress in strengthening the regulation and
supervision of banks. However, given a highly dollarized banking system, the peg to the
euro, and the country’s vulnerability to developments in Europe, the authorities must
remain vigilant to the likely impact of a growth slowdown or changes in the euro-dollar
exchange rate on banks’ balance sheets.
São Tomé & Príncipe remains at high risk of debt distress notwithstanding the
substantial debt relief it has received. A narrow export base, a high dependence on
imports and a heavy reliance on external financing render it highly vulnerable to external
shocks. The outlook improves with the onset of oil production in 2015. In view of
uncertainty about oil production the DSA includes a non-oil scenario under which
additional fiscal adjustment and lower external borrowing will be required to achieve a
sustainable debt-GDP path.
The authorities have made substantial strides in improving the investment climate.
The World Bank’s 2012 Doing Business Survey lists São Tomé & Príncipe among the top
four reformers world-wide in the last year. Further measures are needed to improve
basic infrastructure and to assure more reliable energy supply.

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

CONTEXT: GRADUAL RECOVERY, INFLATION
PRESSURES, AND HIGH RISK OF DEBT DISTRESS
1.
After a marked slowdown in 2009, a
gradual recovery in growth is underway in
São Tomé and Príncipe. From the early 2000s,
the prospect of finding oil attracted foreign
direct investment (FDI) and boosted growth.
After averaging an annual rate of over
6 percent during 2005–08, real GDP growth
slowed to 4 percent in 2009, reflecting the
impact of the global crisis on externallyfinanced investment projects (Figure 1).
Envisaged large-scale projects such as a deep
water port and a hotel were postponed
because of funding difficulties. However, other
projects are proceeding, including
rehabilitation works at the port and airport
(with funding from Angola). The recovery is led
by the construction, tourism, and agriculture
sectors.
2.
Recent increases in world food and
fuel prices have rekindled domestic
inflation pressures. Inflation has declined
substantially since 2008, but remains at
double-digit levels (Figure 1). A tightening of
fiscal and monetary policies in 2008 followed
by a decline in world food and oil prices
helped lower year-on-year inflation from a
peak of 37 percent in July 2008 to 11.5 percent
in June 2010. This downward trend was
reversed in the second half of 2010 by a
combination of drought, spending by political
parties ahead of elections and an upturn in
international food prices. Adjustment in the
domestic retail prices of petroleum products in
March 2011 kept upward pressure on prices.1

Prices of gasoline, diesel, and kerosene were
increased by 18 percent, 19 percent, and 33 percent,

(continued)

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Year-on-year inflation reached 17 percent in
July before retreating to 13.2 percent in
October.
3.
The authorities adopted a fixed
exchange rate regime—a conventional peg
to the euro—in January 2010 with the aim
of anchoring inflation expectations and
boosting investment and growth. An
agreement with Portugal that provides for a
credit line (if needed) and São Tomé &
Príncipe’s ECF-supported program have
provided a framework for implementing
policies to maintain the credibility of the peg.
4.
São Tomé & Príncipe remains at
high risk of debt distress, although it has
received substantial debt relief. São Tomé &
Príncipe reached the HIPC completion point in
March 2007 and benefitted from HIPC and
MDRI relief, which reduced the country’s
external debt by 70 percent. However, the debt
burden remains heavy especially in relation to
exports. A narrow export base and a high
dependence on imports render the country
vulnerable to external shocks. External
sustainability requires restraints on external
borrowing and reforms to expand exports and
boost growth.

respectively. The new prices still fall short of the taxinclusive break-even prices by 20 percent for gasoline,
12 percent for diesel, and 40 percent for kerosene.

The authorities expect oil
production to start in 2015 in the Joint
Development Zone (JDZ) shared with
Nigeria (Box 1). Production is expected in
Block 1 of the JDZ which was recently acquired

by the French company Total which is
extracting oil from an adjacent field located in
Nigerian territory. Activity in São Tomé &
Príncipe’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) is at
an earlier stage of development. Thus far, the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 5

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

country has received signature bonuses
amounting to US$49 million (43 percent of
GDP) in 2005 and US$29 million (20 percent of

GDP) in 2007, and expects to receive a further
US$26 million (about 9 percent of GDP) in
2012.

Box 1. Prospecting for Oil: Legal Framework and Activities to Date
For the purposes of oil and gas exploration, the authorities have divided the country (including its
international waters) into two zones: a Joint Development Zone (JDZ) covering a maritime area claimed by
São Tomé & Príncipe and Nigeria, and an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) controlled entirely by São Tomé &
Príncipe. An agreement signed in 2001 between the two countries established the JDZ and provides for the
joint exploration for hydrocarbons and for their development, with the countries sharing the associated
costs and revenues; Nigeria has a 60 percent share and São Tomé & Príncipe 40 percent.
The Fundamental Law on Petroleum Operations (2009) is the principal legislation that guides the granting of
licenses for the exploration and extraction of oil in São Tomé & Príncipe. Another key piece of legislation is
the Oil Revenue Law (2004) which guides the management of oil revenues. It established the National Oil
Account (NOA) into which all oil-related revenues (including signature bonuses) should be deposited. It also
sets limits on how much can be withdrawn from the NOA each year to fund the government budget.
Until oil production starts, annual withdrawals from the NOA for the budget are limited to 20 percent of the
balance at the end of the preceding year. Once oil production starts, the bulk of current revenues are to be
transferred into a sub-account of the NOA—the Permanent Fund of São Tomé & Príncipe. Resources in the
Permanent Fund are to be invested with a view to generating a permanent income stream for the NOA.
Thus far, there have been two licensing rounds of blocks in the JDZ and one round in the EEZ. Nine blocks
were offered in the JDZ out of which six have been allocated to successful bidders, and product sharing
contracts have been agreed with respect to five. In the EEZ, pre-emption awards of four blocks were made to
two companies ahead of the launch of the first licensing round in 2010. Seven blocks were offered for bids in
the EEZ of which one has been allocated to the sole successful bidder.

6.
A new Prime Minister and a new
President took office in 2010 and 2011,
respectively. A new government led by Prime
Minister Patrice Trovoada was sworn into
office in August 2010, following parliamentary
elections in which his party, which had been in
opposition before the elections, won 26 out of
the 55 seats. Mr. Manuel Pinto da Costa, the
first President after independence (he ruled
from 1975 to 1991), won the Presidential

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

election and was inaugurated in September
2011.
7.
Implementation of the main
recommendations of the last Article IV
consultation has been uneven (Box 2).
Executive Directors underscored the need for
fiscal adjustment to lower inflation and restore
financial stability, and they called for reforms
to improve the investment climate in order to
achieve sustained private-sector led growth.

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 2. São Tomé and Príncipe: Main Recommendations of the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Advice
Reduce the fiscal deficit as a
share of GDP

Status
Results have been mixed. The domestic primary deficit
increased in 2009 before resuming a downward path in 2010
and 2011.

Improve central bank liquidity
management

The BCSTP (central bank) does not yet have market-based
instruments for liquidity management. Before adopting the
exchange rate peg (January 2010), it actively used foreign
exchange operations to contain growth in base money. With
technical assistance from the Fund, the BCSTP has established
a liquidity management framework and has begun to monitor
liquidity conditions in the banking system. The authorities are
considering a proposal for introducing either treasury or
central bank bills as a liquidity management instrument.

Strengthen public debt
management

The government has submitted a draft bill to the National
Assembly that clarifies institutional responsibilities for public
debt management.

Improve the investment climate

Significant progress has been made, including establishment of
a “one-stop shop” to assist investors and the elimination of a
raft of licensing and minimum capital requirements for starting
a wide range of businesses.

8.
Performance under the ECFsupported program has been mixed. The
Executive Board approved a new three-year
ECF arrangement with São Tomé & Príncipe in
March 2009. The first review was completed in
February 2010. Completion of subsequent
reviews has been held up by a combination of
slippages against program targets (late-2009
and early 2010) and delay in completing a new
National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS).
There has been significant progress in
implementing structural reforms under the
program, although many measures took
longer to implement than programmed such
as the establishment of a credit reference
bureau. Reforms have also strengthened public
financial management (especially accounting
and treasury functions) and banking

supervision capacity in the central bank.
However, adoption of an automatic
adjustment mechanism for prices of petroleum
products has not yet been implemented
because of the authorities’ concern about
potential adverse social effects from removing
the implicit subsidies on these products. The
authorities expect to complete the new NPRS
in early 2012.
9.
Staff’s updated medium-term
macroeconomic outlook indicates lower
growth, wider current account deficits and
a more gradual disinflation path than
presented in the last staff report (text
table). The pace of the recovery in growth and
the evolution of the current account deficit
reflect the revised outlook for externally

financed public and private investments,
including expected disbursements from official
concessional loans from Angola, Portugal,
Nigeria, and Equatorial Guinea. FDI-financed
projects include construction of a fuel terminal,
and rehabilitation of the port and airport. The
outlook for inflation reflects a projected
decline in nonfuel commodity prices over the

medium term. The pace of the recovery is
subject to downside risks stemming from the
ongoing financial difficulties in Europe. A
protracted recession in Europe (especially in
Portugal) will likely dampen growth in São
Tomé & Príncipe through the aid, FDI, tourism
and remittances channels.

FISCAL CONSOLIDATION AND MACROECONOMIC
STABILITY
10.
With the adoption of a fixed
exchange rate regime, fiscal policy has
become the authorities’ principal
instrument for achieving sustainable
macroeconomic balances. After a slippage in
2009, fiscal performance improved in 2010 and
2011 (Figure 2). Following a sharp widening in
2009—mainly due to an increase in Treasuryfinanced capital expenditure—the domestic
primary deficit narrowed in 2010 on account of
increased revenues. Tax revenues rose by
2 percentage points of GDP, thanks mainly to
the payment of fuel tax arrears by the fuel
importing company (ENCO). On the spending
side, the government contained domestic
primary expenditure by curtailing spending on
Treasury-financed development projects and
on goods and services. In 2011, the domestic
primary deficit is estimated to have narrowed

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

further on account of continued expenditure
restraint.
11.
The overall budget deficit has
fluctuated widely, reflecting volatility in
project grants. Over the last three years,
facing shortfalls in project grants, the
authorities resorted to external concessional
loans to finance part of the public investment
program.
12.
Recent reforms have sought to
boost tax revenues. Specific measures
included a more progressive personal income
tax structure (2009), a simplification of the
corporate tax from multiple rates with a top
marginal rate of 45 percent to a single rate of
25 percent (2010), withholding of taxes on
service providers (2009), and strengthening tax
administration (e.g., increased audits and
stepped up collection of tax arrears). The

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

authorities argued that the recent changes in
direct taxes and their efforts to strengthen
revenue administration should be given more
time before their impact is assessed. At the
same time they indicated their determination
to continue strengthening revenue
administration in both the tax and customs
departments.

13.
Cross-arrears between the
government, the state-owned water and
electricity corporation (EMAE) and ENCO
remain a problem. During 2009 and 2010, the
government cleared its arrears to EMAE. This
helped EMAE to reduce its outstanding debt to
ENCO for fuel supplies, and enabled ENCO to
settle its arrears on fuel taxes to the Treasury.
However, in the first half of 2011, regional and
local governments accumulated 1.4 percent of
GDP in unpaid bills to EMAE in spite of
increased provisions for such payments in the
2011 budget. In turn, EMAE’s debt to ENCO for
unpaid fuel bills amounted to 4.7 percent of
GDP at end-June 2011. ENCO also
accumulated fuel tax arrears to the state in the
first half of 2011 amounting to 0.3 percent of
GDP. This is roughly equivalent to ENCO’s
accumulated net losses arising from the
difference between the administered retail

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

prices of petroleum products and the “real”
prices (reflecting import costs, taxes and
distribution margins).
14.
Staff urged the authorities to ensure
that regional and local governments clear
their arrears to EMAE in the second half of
2011. Staff suggested that portions of
transfers from the central government to
municipalities be redirected to settle the
outstanding utility bills. Failure to enforce a
hard budget constraint on the regional and
local authorities will likely lead to lower-thanexpected fuel tax revenues and a larger-thanplanned domestic primary deficit for 2011.
Staff also urged the authorities to make
realistic provisions for utility bills in the 2012
budget.
15.
Discussion of the 2012 budget was
cast in the government’s medium-term
objective of stabilizing the domestic
primary deficit at 2–3 percent of GDP. This
level of the deficit can be financed through
non-debt-creating means such as withdrawals
from the NOA and budget support grants.
Over the medium term, the government aims
to mobilize enough domestic revenues to at
least cover recurrent expenditures.
16.
The 2012 budget submitted to the
national assembly aims to lower the
domestic primary deficit to 3.2 percent of
GDP. This would be achieved by sustained
efforts to mobilize more domestic revenues by
enforcing compliance with the tax laws and
improving efficiency in customs and tax
administration. The government plans to
control spending by keeping the wage bill
fixed in real terms and prioritizing spending on
other goods and services and on transfers to
keep domestic primary expenditures in line
with available resources. The government
indicated that it would continue PFM reforms,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 9

with emphases on better monitoring and
reporting on budget execution and publication
of government accounts. The deficit for 2012 is

in line with available non-debt-creating
financing, including expected budget support
grants from the World Bank and Gabon.

Staff advised the government to
implement measures to make revenues
from import duties and fuel taxes more
robust. Noting the large role of Ministerial
discretion in the granting of exemptions from
import duties, staff urged the government to
become less generous in granting these
exemptions. The authorities said they would
undertake a thorough review of exemptions.
On fuel taxes, staff noted that more frequent
adjustment of retail prices in line with
movements in world prices would lower the
risk of fuel tax arrears. The government
informed staff that it is consulting ENCO with a
view to define a plan of action to promote
more flexibility in the pricing of petroleum
products and thus lower burdensome implicit
subsidies.

commercially viable. The strategy is informed
by a study by the World Bank and IFC and has
the following key elements: (i) strengthening
management (including the option of private
sector participation); (ii) enhancing bill
collection (e.g., through installation of pre-paid
meters); (iii) phased investments in production,
transmission and distribution; and (iv) bringing
tariffs gradually in line with costs. The
authorities stressed that that the investment
component is critical for addressing technical
inefficiencies that have led to huge losses
(equivalent to about 30 percent of power
generated) during the generation and
transmission process. The cost of
implementing the strategy is estimated at
about US$20 million over the medium term.

Against a backdrop of limited scope
for monetary policy and rapid credit
growth, the authorities are taking steps to
strengthen monetary management and the
supervision of banks. With technical
assistance from the Fund, the central bank has
adopted a liquidity management framework to
improve its monitoring and forecasting of
liquidity conditions. The BCSTP is also closely
monitoring financial soundness indicators to
better supervise banks.

21.
The central bank is taking measures
to de-dollarize the financial system. The
BCSTP has phased out its role in clearing
foreign currency checks, and changed the
regulations regarding commercial banks’
reserve requirements. Effective March 2010,
the BCSTP required commercial banks to hold
all reserve requirements in dobra, including
those related to foreign currency deposits. In
response to difficulties most banks had in
meeting the new requirement, the BCSTP
lowered the reserve requirements from
24.5 percent to 18 percent for dobra deposits
and to 21 percent for foreign currency
deposits. Banks are also now allowed to hold
reserve requirements in foreign currency for
up to 10 percent of foreign currency deposits.
22.
Growth in broad money in the last
few years has been driven by credit to the
private sector. Credit growth raised the
loan/deposit ratio from 70 percent in
December 2008 to 120 percent in June 2011.
As sources of domestic funding began to dry
up, commercial banks started using
nonresident foreign currency deposits to fund
new loans. There has been a deceleration in
credit expansion in 2011 which has translated
into slower growth in broad money. The
authorities noted that the automatic deposit of
salaries of civil servants into bank accounts
(from April 2009), increased capital
requirements and lower reserve requirements
allowed banks to increase their lending. They
saw credit growth as a sign of deepening
financial intermediation, and noted that banks
are reporting a significant decline in
nonperforming loans from almost 45 percent
of gross loans in 2006 to about 10 percent in
mid-2011. However, they concurred with staff
on the need to strengthen supervision,
including enforcing compliance with the
reserve requirements.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

23.
The pace of disinflation since the
introduction of the peg has been slower
than expected. The mission found no
evidence of second round effects in 2010 and
2011 associated with rising world food and
fuel prices. Given São Tomé & Príncipe’s heavy
reliance on imports—including for food and
other consumer goods—staff agreed with the
authorities that import costs are a major driver
of domestic price developments. The
authorities added that limited capacity and
frequent breakdowns of machinery at the port
have hindered the steady flow of consumer
goods imports, resulting in periodic shortages.
They noted that given the heavy weight of
food in the CPI basket (about 70 percent),
increased domestic production of food offered
the best hope of curtailing headline inflation in
the long run.
24.
The BCSTP is taking steps to
strengthen the regulation and supervision
of banks. Most banks are not making profits,
but their shareholders have been willing to
cover their losses and augment their capital.
The shareholders—mainly from Angola,
Nigerian, and Cameroon—appear willing to
accept the losses as the cost of maintaining a
foothold in São Tomé & Príncipe in
anticipation of a coming oil boom. All banks
have now complied with new minimum capital
requirements introduced in 2010 (Euros
3 million or US$5 million for commercial
banks, and US$7 million or the Euro equivalent
for investment banks). The BCSTP took over
management of a commercial bank in 2010
due to the bank’s failure to comply with the
new minimum capital requirements and
weaknesses in its management. The bank was
returned to its shareholders after meeting the
minimum capital requirement and changing
the management. The BCSTP has asked all
commercial banks to submit new business

plans for their operations in São Tomé &
Príncipe by end-December 2011. The central
bank plans to assess how realistic the business
plans are. In view of the risks to financial
stability posed by rapid credit growth and by
the country’s vulnerability to economic and
financial stress in Europe, staff welcomed the
BCSTP’s plans to complete on-site inspections
of all the existing seven commercial banks by
end-2012; so far, it has completed inspections
of three banks.
25.
São Tomé & Príncipe has been
placed on a list of non-cooperating
countries by the Financial Action Task Force
on Money Laundering (FATF). Although São

Tomé & Príncipe amended its Anti-Money
Laundering and Combating the Financing of
Terrorism (AML/CFT) law in 2010 in line with
the recommendations of the FATF, and has
established a Financial Intelligence Unit to
oversee implementation of the law, the FATF
decided that São Tomé & Príncipe has not
made enough progress in monitoring money
laundering activities in the country. The
authorities are seeking assistance from various
partners to help them get off the list. The Fund
has agreed to provide technical assistance in
early 2012, subject to the approval of the
Steering Committee of the AML/CFT Topical
Trust Fund.

TOWARD A SUSTAINABLE EXTERNAL POSITION
A. External Debt Sustainability
26.
An updated joint Fund-World Bank
DSA indicates that São Tomé & Príncipe
remains at high risk of debt distress.
Assistance under the HIPC Initiative and MDRI
reduced the burden of the country’s external
debt substantially. However, a narrow export
base, a high dependence on imports, and a
heavy reliance on external financing render it
highly vulnerable to external shocks. In the
baseline scenario, the outlook improves after
oil production starts in 2015. Because of
uncertainty about oil prospects, the DSA
includes an alternative no-oil scenario. Under
this scenario, debt levels breach the NPV of
debt-to export threshold significantly
throughout the projection period. A sizeable
additional fiscal adjustment (2 percent of GDP)
and lower external borrowing during 2013–15
would be required to achieve a sustainable
debt/GDP path. The fiscal adjustment is to be
achieved by reducing Treasury-financed capital
expenditures in 2013-14 and by expenditure

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

restraint in 2014-15. This results in slightly
lower growth than in the baseline. In order to
mitigate the risk of debt distress the staffs
recommended that the authorities rely mainly
on grants to finance the country’s
development program, accelerate reforms to
improve policy and institutional performance
(including debt management), and continue
reducing the cost of doing business to
enhance the prospects for sustaining high
non-oil growth.
27.
The authorities were in broad
agreement with the assumptions and
recommendations of the DSA. They
reiterated their commitment to rely mostly on
grants to finance the public investment
program (PIP). However, they stressed that
supporting growth and diversification required
mobilizing sufficient resources to implement
the PIP, and that to the extent that grant
financing is insufficient, some borrowing may
be inevitable. They indicated that any

borrowing would be on highly concessional
terms, with a grant element of at least

B. Exchange Rate Assessment and International Competitiveness
28.
Without oil, São Tomé & Príncipe’s
current account is unsustainable and staff
assesses the real exchange rate to be
somewhat overvalued. In the last few years,
FDI, oil signature bonuses, and concessional
loans have helped finance a large increase in
the current account deficit. These inflows have
financed higher imports of both investment
and consumer goods. Some FDI has helped
boost cocoa output and exports, but from a
very small base. The evolution of the real
exchange rate over the last two decades shows
a sharp real depreciation in the first half of the
1990s followed by mild fluctuations without a
clear trend, offering no clear indication of a
competitiveness problem associated with the
real exchange rate. CGER-type estimates of
real exchange rate misalignment produce
results that range from 37 percent
overvaluation to 20 percent undervaluation
(Appendix I). On balance, while quantitative
estimates are inconclusive, continuing high
inflation in São Tomé & Príncipe compared to
the euro area will lead to over-valuation of the
real exchange rate and loss of international
competitiveness,

29.
The authorities have made
substantial improvements in the investment
climate. The World Bank’s 2012 Doing
Business Survey (published in October 2011)
ranked São Tomé & Príncipe among the top
reformers in the past year. The areas that
improved the most were “starting a business”
and “paying taxes” in which São Tomé &
Príncipe moved up the rankings by 73 and
24 places, respectively. São Tomé & Príncipe’s
overall ranking improved from 174 to 163 out
of 183 countries. The authorities made starting
a business easier by establishing a one-stopshop for investors and eliminating a raft of
licensing and minimum capital requirements
for starting a wide range of businesses. Other
specific measures included reducing the time
required to process building permit
applications and lowering property transfer
taxes. The authorities highlighted the above
improvements in the discussions, but also
recognized that there is room to further
improve the investment climate, including
upgrading the country’s physical infrastructure
(e.g., port, airport, roads) and reforming the
energy sector.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

POVERTY REDUCTION, DATA, AND CAPACITY ISSUES
30.
The government expects to publish
a new National Poverty Reduction Strategy
(NPRS) in early 2012. The new strategy will
replace the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
formulated in 2002, which was updated in
2005 with a three-year Priority Action
Program (PAP, 2006-08). An assessment of
PAP implementation attributed the low rate of
execution of envisaged projects to political
instability (i.e., frequent changes in
government and re-organizations of
ministries), lower-than-expected levels of
external aid, and a lack of ownership of the
evaluation and monitoring framework by
sector ministries.3 The authorities indicated
that they want the new strategy to be fully
owned by a broad range of stakeholders.
31.
The main objectives of new NPRS
are expected to be similar to those of the
old PRSP. The authorities emphasized the
following key elements:


Maintaining macroeconomic stability
while increasing investment in
infrastructure in order to sustain
accelerated and broad-based economic
growth.



Promoting agriculture, fisheries and
tourism as the leading sectors for growth,
employment creation and poverty
reduction.



Improving the population’s access to
basic social services, including education
and health.



Combating corruption and improving the
governance of public institutions.

3

See 2008 Annual Progress Report on PRSP
Implementation.



Addressing issues of food security,
adaption to climate change, and
vulnerabilities to natural disasters.

32.
The NPRS will update São Tomé &
Príncipe’s poverty profile. A household
survey in 2001 estimated the incidence of
poverty in São Tomé & Príncipe at 54 percent.
The authorities noted that they have recently
secured technical assistance from the UNDP
for analyzing the results of a household
survey that was completed in 2010, and that
this work will form the basis for updating the
country’s poverty profile.
33.
Progress toward achieving the
Millennium Development Goals has been
mixed (Table 10). São Tomé & Príncipe is
advancing toward meeting the targets on
universal primary education, infant mortality,
and eradication of Malaria by 2015. The
authorities also expect significant progress in
combating HIV/AIDs and in achieving gender
equality. However, it is unlikely that the goal
of eradicating poverty and hunger will be met.
34.
São Tomé & Príncipe’s capacity for
macroeconomic management remains low.
The authorities are receiving help from several
partners to strengthen public financial
management (World Bank, IMF), tax and
customs administration (USA), banking
supervision (IMF), macro-fiscal analysis
(Portugal), central bank liquidity management
(IMF) and statistics (IMF). Technical assistance
from the Fund in FY2012 will include support
for capacity building in the areas of revenue
administration, AML/CFT, government finance
statistics, and balance of payments statistics.
35.
The data provided to staff are
broadly adequate for surveillance. However,
national accounts and external sector
statistics are very weak.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 17

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
Increased external financing from
regional sources has helped São Tomé &
Príncipe’s recovery from the impact of the
2008 global financial crisis. In particular,
investments in the port and airport by
Sonangol have partially made up for projects
that have been postponed on account of
funding difficulties faced by investors from
Europe. Also, concessional loans and grants
from neighboring countries have helped the
authorities implement their public investment
program. Nevertheless, because of continuing
strong trade and investment links with Europe,
São Tomé & Príncipe’s recovery is subject to
downside risks stemming from the ongoing
financial and economic difficulties in Europe.
37.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ 2012
budget proposals which build on progress
made in 2010 and 2011 in fiscal
consolidation. Fiscal consolidation to be
achieved by restraining lower priority
discretionary spending while continuing the
efforts to boost domestic revenue. Over the
medium term, staff recommends measures to
enhance domestic revenues and to break the
cycle of domestic cross arrears. Reduction in
exemptions from customs duties and adoption
of an automatic price adjustment mechanism
to pass through changes in world fuel prices to
retail prices would contribute to more robust
revenues. Breaking the cycle of cross arrears
will require realistic budgeting for the
government’s utility bills, imposing a hard
budget constraint on regional and local
governments, as well as reforms to make
EMAE a commercially viable entity.
38.
The authorities need to maintain
very prudent external borrowing policies to
mitigate the high risk of debt distress. The
authorities have accumulated substantial new
external debt in the last few years to make up

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

for lower-than-expected project grants. Staff
advised the government to slow down the
pace of new borrowing and instead rely mainly
on grants for financing the public investment
program. If the government must borrow, new
loans should be on highly concessional terms;
adherence to a grant element of at least
50 percent for new loans—a commitment by
the authorities under the ECF-supported
program—would help mitigate the risk of debt
distress.
39.
Continued rapid credit growth and
vulnerability to economic and financial
stress in Europe pose risks to international
reserves and financial stability. This calls for
heightened vigilance by the BCSTP. Staff
welcomes the central bank’s commitment to
strengthening monetary management and
banking supervision.
40.
The authorities are to be
commended for improving the investment
climate. Staff welcomes the progress achieved
in improving the legal framework—including
making it easier to start a business, dealing
with construction permits, and registering
property—and the steps taken to upgrade the
port and airport. Further progress is needed to
improve basic infrastructure and to assure
reliable energy supply in order to boost
growth in output and exports.
41.
It is proposed that the next Article
IV Consultation with São Tomé & Príncipe
takes place within 24 months, subject to the
decision on consultation cycles (Decision
No. 14747-(10/96), September 28, 2010).

Appendix I. São Tomé and Príncipe: Exchange Rate Assessment Using CGER
Methodologies
This Appendix1 presents the results of
assessments of São Tomé and Príncipe’s
exchange rate, based on the IMF’s Consultative
Group on Exchange Rate Issues (CGER)
methodologies. CGER applies three
approaches—macroeconomic balance,
external sustainability, and equilibrium real
exchange rate. The assessments focus on the
pre-oil era, using 2014 as the medium-term
reference period. Oil production—projected to
begin in 2015—is expected to support a large
improvement in the current account balance
and a sustainable debt trajectory (see DSA).
In summary, the various approaches deliver a
range of results from 13–37 percent
overvaluation to a 20 percent undervaluation.

Macroeconomic balance approach. In this
approach, an equilibrium current account
balance (“norm”) is estimated by relating the
current account balance to macroeconomic
fundamentals. Typical fundamentals include
fiscal balance, output growth, real income, oil
balance, demographics, trade openness and
productivity. Applying coefficients
estimated by CGER from two studies of lowand middle-income countries yields
current account norms for São Tomé &
Príncipe of -12.6 and -15.7 percent of GDP.
This compares with an underlying current
account balance in São Tomé & Príncipe
(based on the projected current
account balance in 2014 under the baseline) of
-39 percent of GDP. The elasticity of the
current account balance relative to the REER is
assumed to be -1.05 drawing on Tokarick
(2010).2 Thus, this approach implies a real
exchange rate overvaluation of 22–25 percent.

External sustainability approach. This approach
calculates the current account balance that
would be consistent with a benchmark value
for net foreign assets. The resulting sustainable
current account balance is calculated at about
-4 percent of GDP in 2014. Using the same
elasticities as in the macroeconomic balance
approach yields a real exchange rate
overvaluation of about 37 percent.
Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate Approach.
Based on the coefficients estimated by Aydin
(2010) for Low to Medium-Income Countries,
this approach yields a 20 percent
undervaluation when foreign aid is included as
an explanatory variable. Excluding foreign aid
(which is statistically not significant) yields an
overvaluation of about 15 percent.

Safeguards Assessments:
An update safeguards assessment of the
Central Bank of São Tomé and Príncipe
(BCSTP) was finalized in November 2009. The
assessment concluded that the overall
governance structure and oversight should be
strengthened to mitigate the control risks
associated with the capacity constraints at the
bank. The BCSTP continues to be audited by
reputable audit firms and the 2009 audited
financial statements were published. However,
the financial reporting framework and the
internal audit practices did not yet adhere to
international standards.
Exchange Arrangements:
Since January 2010 São Tomé and Príncipe’s
has pegged the Dobra to the euro at a rate of
Dobra 24,500 per euro. Commercial banks buy
foreign exchange directly from the central
bank, which can charge up to 1.5 percent
commission on all foreign exchange
transactions. Any foreign exchange
commission that banks may decide to charge
cannot exceed two percent for transactions in
Euro and 4 percent for transactions in other
currencies. The new exchange rate system has
eliminated the multiple currency practice
related to the existence of numerous exchange
rate markets with differing effective exchange

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

rates for spot transactions that existed in
previous years.
São Tomé and Príncipe continues to avail itself
of the transitional arrangements under Article
XIV, but does not maintain restrictions under
Article XIV. However, it maintains one measure
subject to Fund approval under Article VIII: an
exchange restriction arising from Article 3(i)
and Article 10.1(b) of the Investment Code
(Law No. 7/2008) regarding limitations on the
transferability of net income from investment.
The restriction results from the requirement
that taxes and other obligations to the
government have to be paid/fulfilled as a
condition for transfer, to the extent the
requirement includes the payment of taxes
and the fulfillment of obligations unrelated to
the net income to be transferred.
Article IV Consultation:
The Executive Board concluded the last Article
IV consultation with São Tomé and Príncipe on
June 18, 2008.
Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP), Reports on Observance of
Standards and Codes (ROSCs), and Offshore
Financial Center (OFC) Assessments:

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

RELATIONS WITH THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
GROUP
(As of October 31, 2011)
1.
São Tomé and Príncipe became a
member of the African Development Bank
Group (AfDB) in 1976. To date, the Bank Group
has financed 28 operations in the country. This
includes 22 projects, including institutional
support, and 5 studies, for total net
commitments of UA 100 million under the
African Development Fund (ADF) (98.9%), as
well as one special support operation of UA
1 million under the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF).
Ninety-four percent (94%) of these funds were
in the form of loans and only 6% were in
grants. At October 1 2011, the total amounts
disbursed for the entire portfolio stood at UA
84.29 million, or 84.6% of net commitments.
Agriculture has been the most important
sector, receiving (24%) of the total assistance
followed by (23%) for infrastructure/transport;
(22%) for multi-sector interventions; (20%) for
social sector; (9%) for energy, water, and
sanitation; and (2%) for telecommunications.
These operations have helped build and
rehabilitate basic economic and social
infrastructure (roads, airport, electricity, water,
schools, and health centers) and have
strengthened São Tomé and Príncipe’s
economic and institutional capacities. The
AfDB has a national program office since 1995.
2.
The AfDB has only three active
projects—which started in 2005, 2006 and
2011—in human resource development,
agriculture (the second phase of the livestock
development project) and Infrastructure
Rehabilitation for Food Security (PRIASA).
These projects, in accordance with the PRSP,
focus on the main factors affecting poverty.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

The second phase of the livestock
development project, financed with ADF-X
resources (UA 4 million), was approved in May
2006 and signed in July 2006 – the mid-term
review of the project took place in September
2010, aiming at restructuring the project for
improved achievements. The human resource
development project, financed with ADF-IX
resources (UA 4 million) was signed in June
2003 and began in March 2005. This project
tackles cross-sectoral capacity-building by
providing training in literacy, information, and
community organization, as well as specialized
vocational training adapted to specific
demands, particularly in the oil and tourist
sectors. While the PRISA project, approved in
November 2010 and signed in February 2011,
aims at addressing the food security
challenges in the country.
3.
The AfDB Group assistance for São
Tomé & Príncipe (Country Strategy Paper
2005–09) rested on two pillars: Pillar I-Poverty
Reduction in Rural area; and Pillar IIPromotion of Good Governance in Public
Finance Management. The country allocation
of ADF-X resources (2005–07) was UA
5.15 million in the form of grants. The first
pillar helped promote and diversify the
country’s economic base, especially the
agricultural and rural sector, and reinforce
operations in the social sectors. The second
pillar supported macroeconomic reforms and
governance, through an institutional support
project on governance and a technical
assistance on the PRSP process, which helped
improve public finance management and
institutional capacity building to prepare the

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

country for the forthcoming oil era. The UA
300.000 TA on PRSP process was approved in
2008 and proved very much effective in
setting-up the PRSP follow-up mechanisms.
The UA 1 million grant as an AfDB response to
São Tomé & Príncipe food crisis, was approved
by the AfDB Board in April 2009, and disbursed
in a single tranche in August 2009. The mission
for the completion of the AfDB Country
Assistance for 2005–09 took place in
August 2009, together with the Country
Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR).
4.
In 2009 the AfDB updated a study on
São Tomé & Príncipe’s governance profile and
has finalized the study on the costs of
insularity in June 2010. Conclusions of this
important report was presented and discussed
with government officials, donors, and civil
society, in São Tomé, November 10, 2010. The
study on the regional capacity building
initiatives, within CEMAC, ECCAS, the African
Portuguese-speaking countries and the small
insular countries, was postponed.
Programming of other Economic and Sector
Work studies is underway.
5.
Decision has been made not
to prepare an AfDB Country Assistance for
2010–14, as initially planned, but to finalize an
Interim 2010–11 Strategy (approved by the
AfDB Board on November 16, 2010) in the
absence of a current PRSP, and in alignment
with other development partners position. This
interim strategy financed only one project
(under the ADF XI allocation, UA 5 million) in
the agriculture sector, i.e. a consolidated rural
infrastructure project in support of food
security (Pillar II)—the main objective of this
Interim Strategy being on targeting capacity
building activities in view of preparing the new
PRSP (pillar I), by accessing the AfDB Fragile
State Facility.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

6.
Since the I-CSP 2010–11 will expire at
the end of 2011; based on the authorities
information that the strategic thrust of the new
PRSP II will remain as of the PRSP I, the Bank
has started the preparation of its new strategy
forSão Tomé & Príncipe, CSP 2012–16. The
overarching goal of the Bank’s proposed CSP
2012–16 is to strengthening São Tomé &
Príncipe’s public sector capacity, notably in
the area of PFM, consistent with pillar I of the
I-CSP 2010–11. To that end, the proposed
CSP 2012–16 is articulated around a single
pillar, capacity building and institutional
strengthening, to be financed under the
ADF-XII.
7.
In addition, as São Tomé & Príncipe
reached decision and completion point
respectively in 2000 and 2007. In reaching the
HIPC decision point, São Tomé & Príncipe
became eligible to MDRI and the debt service
under the MDRI was estimated at
$99.56 million. The AfDB total assistance under
HIPC and MDRI amounted to $187.92. At the
end of December 2008, the AfDB provided
$13.33 million under HIPC and $99 million
under MDRI.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Introduction
1.
Although economic data are broadly
adequate for surveillance, serious financial,
human, and technological resource constraints
have slowed down efforts to strengthen the
statistical system.
2.
The country has participated in the
Fund’s General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS) since April 20, 2004. The metadata and
plans for improvement have not been updated
since the original metadata were posted on
the DSBB. Over the period 2003–09, the
country has benefited from technical
assistance from STA and other providers,
largely under the GDDS project for Lusophone
Africa.
National accounts
3.
Statistics on GDP/GNP are compiled on
a yearly basis and provided at the time of the
Article IV consultation and program review
missions. STA provided technical assistance in
national accounts to the National Statistics
Institute in 2005, 2006, 2008 and 2009. Low
response rates and/or insufficient rigor of the
responses to the business surveys, including
those from important enterprises, continue to
affect the quality of the business data
compiled.
4.
A new GDP series for the period
2007–10 with base year 2001 became available
in mid-2011. The new estimates cover: (i) GDP
by production approach at current and
constant prices; and (ii) cross-classification
tables by industry sectors. The revised series
reflect more accurately recent economic
developments. Based on the most recent
population census, corporation census, and

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

living conditions survey, higher weights are
now attributed to the sectors that experienced
faster growth, such as trade, transportation
and communication, and services.. While the
revision of the GDP series is a significant
improvement, a number of shortcomings
remain. Further improvements would require
input from a new household expenditure
survey (rather than living conditions survey),
using producer prices, and better estimates for
agricultural production. The National Institute
of Statistics (INE) is moving toward using a
new system to better capture survey and
market information and to include estimates of
the informal sector and is currently compiling
data from a household survey undertaken at
the end of 2010.
Consumer prices
5.
Since 1997 the CPI weights have been
based on a three-month household survey
conducted in 1995. Data from the recent
household expenditure survey need to be
compiled to update the weights. Current price
surveys only cover the capital, although there
are plans to implement regional surveys.
Government finance statistics
6.
Detailed revenue and expenditure data
are compiled and reported to AFR. The main
areas that need to be strengthened are
(i) monitoring of expenditures on projects
financed by donors; and (ii) financing
operations. All project loans financed by
donors are programmed in the budget, but
some are executed independently. The
government has requested development
partners to help in recording all external
financing in the budget. The recording of
financing operations and stocks is expected to

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

improve since the debt data management
capacity is expected to be strengthened.
7.
An October 2004 government finance
statistics (GFS) mission helped the Ministry of
Finance to compile and disseminate GFS for
the general government in accordance with
the Government Finance Statistics Manual
2001 (GFSM 2001). The mission prepared
bridge tables between national budget
classification and GFSM 2001 classifications to
be used to compile GFS for reporting to STA
and AFR, as well as in MOF policy work. Given
the importance of oil-related revenues, the
mission also reviewed the classification of oil
revenues under the Oil Revenue Management
Law and made recommendations on
classification of such transactions. A
September 2007 follow-up mission found
some progress with regard to the
recommendations made by the 2004 mission.
In particular, in January 2007 a new budget law
was approved that significantly improved
national budget classifications.
Notwithstanding these efforts, faster statistical
progress is hampered by an inadequate
accounting system.
Monetary and financial statistics
8.
STA missions provided technical
assistance on monetary statistics in December
2004, April/May 2006, June 2007 and
September 2010. As a result, the accuracy and
timeliness of the monetary data reported in
the standardized report forms (SRF) for the
central bank and the other depository
corporations data have improved.
9.
The previous missions found that the
BCSTP monthly trial balance sheets were
broadly adequate to compile monetary
statistics in line with the Monetary and
Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM).

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

10.
A New Plan of Accounts of other
depository corporations was introduced in
January 2010. The September mission
reviewed the new plan of accounts for the
financial system, and found it adequate for a
proper classification, sectorization, and
valuation of financial instruments, and in line
with the methodology of the MFSM. However,
the mission detected serious shortcomings in
the information reported by some banks, an
inconsistent approach in the way banks report
to the BCSTP, and the fact that one bank is still
reporting using the old plan of accounts. The
mission developed the bridge table that links
the ODCs’ trial balances—based on the new
plan of accounts—to the SRF for ODCs (form
2SR).
11.
A September 2010 mission assisted the
authorities in: (1) reconstructing the
standardized report form (SRF) for other
depository corporations (ODCs) following the
introduction of the new plan of accounts;
(2) assessing the quality of the data reported
by ODCs after the migration to the new plan of
accounts; (3) advancing work on the
generation of the SRF for the central bank,
based on the new plan of account; and
(4) establishing an integrated monetary
database (IMD) that automatically generates
the data required for publication in
International Financial Statistics (IFS), by the
African Department (AFR) of the IMF for
surveillance purposes, and by the BCSTP for
analytical and dissemination purposes. For the
integrated monetary database that meet the
data needs of STA, AFR, and BCSTP, STA
reconstructed the historical data starting from
December 2001.
External sector statistics
12.
There are significant weaknesses in the
collection of source data related to

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 11

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

merchandise trade. Some transactions,
including certain imports related to
investment, are not fully captured in the
balance of payments (BOP). Monthly data on
the main exports and imports are reported to
AFR regularly but with some lags in recent
months, and unit prices and volumes of
exports are only occasionally included. AFR
does not receive any data on São Tomé &
Príncipe’s international investment position
(IIP) as these data are not yet compiled by the
BCSTP.
13.
The GDDS Lusophone project has
targeted a substantial improvement in the
source data, including the response rate to the
surveys, and in the methodology for compiling
the BOP in line with the Fifth Edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual. A June 2003
mission reviewed the shortcomings of
reported current and financial account
transactions and concluded that weaknesses
were mainly due to under coverage, including
of foreign direct investment and commercial
bank reports on international transactions.
14.
A June 2004 mission found that
despite efforts to implement the previous
recommendations, several measures, in
particular those related to improving source
data were at best partially implemented. As a

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

result, inconsistencies in the classification of
BOP operations persisted and certain
components continued to be largely
estimated. Resource constraints, particularly
with regard to qualified staff, contribute to the
lack of improvement in the response rate to
surveys. The mission recommended improving
coordination and data sharing among dataproducing agencies, intensifying contacts with
survey respondents, and using alternative
sources to improve source data. A March
2007 mission found that little progress had
been achieved in implementing
recommendations of previous missions,
primarily due to resource constraints in the
BCSTP. The mission assisted the authorities in
reconciling balance of payments data and
outlined a set of recommendations and
detailed work plan to improve compilation
capacity. Resource constraints at the BCSTP
have also hampered the development of IIP
data.
15.
The authorities have built on previous
efforts to strengthen debt data management,
and a unit was created in late 2003 within the
Ministry of Finance. The authorities are
reconciling debt records with creditors and the
Commonwealth Secretariat debt recording and
management system is being operationalized.

Prepared by:

International Development
Association

São Tomé & Príncipe remains at a high risk of debt distress. The PV of debt-to-exports
ratio remains above the country-specific indicative threshold for a prolonged period of
time under the baseline scenario. 2 Under the baseline, São Tomé & Principe’s overall
external sector debt indicators are elevated in the short term but are expected to show a
decreasing trend over the longer run. Taking into account expected commercial oil
production beginning in 2015 and associated foreign direct investment, the projected
debt profile is consistent with manageable—if high risk—debt dynamics. Additional debt
will further heighten the risks to external sustainability. All debt indicators deteriorate
significantly under weaker growth and export assumptions. Uncertainties surrounding the
outlook for oil production underscore the importance of strengthening fiscal performance.
Under a non-oil scenario, reaching a sustainable debt level would require additional
fiscal adjustment of 2 percent of GDP in the medium term. This also calls for
(i) improving public financial and debt management; (ii) fiscal financing solely on the
basis of grants and highly concessional borrowing; and (iii) implementing a
comprehensive strategy to reduce the cost of doing business, attract investment, and
broaden the export base.

The DSA was prepared by IMF and World Bank staff in collaboration with the Saotomean authorities. The
analysis updates the previous Joint DSA dated February 18, 2009 (IMF Country Report No. 09/106). The DSA
follows the IMF and World Bank Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint Fund-Bank Debt
Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries (January 22, 2010).

2

São Tomé & Príncipe is classified as a “Weak Performer” based on the three-year average of IDA’s Country
Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index. Under the joint IDA/IMF debt sustainability framework, the
thresholds for “Weak Performer” are: 30 percent for the present value of debt-to-GDP ratio, 100 percent for
present value of debt-to-exports ratio, 15 percent for the debt service-to-exports ratio, 200 percent for present
value of debt-to-revenue ratio, and 25 percent of debt service-to-revenue ratio excluding grants.

BACKGROUND
1.
São Tomé and Príncipe reached the
completion point under the enhanced HIPC
initiative in March 2007, received topping-up
assistance in December 2007, and benefited
from HIPC/MDRI debt relief. MDRI, in particular,
brought substantial debt service savings, since
54 percent of total debt before the HIPC
completion point was with IDA, AfDB, and IMF.
Debt relief from Paris Club members also helped
improve the country’s debt profile as it
represented 14 percent of total debt before the
completion point.

bilateral agreements with all its Paris Club
creditors, except Russia, with whom
agreement has been reached but not formally
signed. 4In July 2008, São Tomé & Príncipe
received debt relief from Portugal, its main
non-Paris Club creditor at the time. Efforts are
underway to conclude additional debt relief with
other non-Paris club creditors. Discussions have
recently concluded with Algeria and are expected
to conclude in the near term with Brazil. The
authorities have requested the Fund’s assistance
to facilitate negotiations with Angola.5

2.
São Tomé and Príncipe’s medium- and
long-term public and publically guaranteed
(PPG) external debt was estimated at
$168.1 million in nominal terms as of August
2011 (Table 1)3. The debt burden has increased
from $110 million at the end of 2008, but remains
significantly below the pre-debt relief high of
$359.5 million at the end of 2006. Total public
sector debt is composed solely of debt contracted
or guaranteed by the central government, and
there is currently no State-Owned Enterprise
external debt. Debt composition has shifted after
the HIPC completion point. The share of
multilateral debt declined from nearly 60 percent
before the completion point to around
25 percent. Including technical arrears, Angola is
the country’s main bilateral creditor, accounting
for approximately 23 percent of outstanding
external debt. The main multilateral creditor is the
IDA.

It is assumed that bilateral creditors with which São
Tomé & Príncipe is engaged in negotiations will
provide debt relief on terms comparable to those of
the Paris Club. Currently, the country does not service
bilateral debt under negotiation and has accumulated
technical arrears in the amount of $80.4 million.

/19/12DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
4.
The medium-term macroeconomic
framework foresees a subdued recovery from
the global economic crisis, with annual output
growth projected to return to 6 percent (the
historic norm) by 2013 (Box 1). The main
drivers of growth are expected to be
construction, tourism, and agriculture. These
growth areas are supported by the public
investment program, which will continue to focus
on investments in transportation and
telecommunication, public administration, and
health. The DSA assumes continued
macroeconomic stability over the medium term
(i.e., through 2014) based on fiscal consolidation.
It is assumed in the baseline scenario that oil
reserves will be discovered in commercially viable
quantities and that oil production will begin in
2015.
5.
Fiscal performance has improved
since a significant slippage in 2009. In 2009,
the domestic primary deficit rose to 8 percent of
GDP, largely due to revenue underperformance
and excess current expenditure. The domestic
primary deficit narrowed to 4.1 percent of GDP in
2010 on account of improved revenue
performance. The domestic primary deficit is
expected to narrow further to 3.5 percent of GDP
in 2011 as on account of expenditure restraint. In
the medium term, the domestic primary deficit is
expected to decline as the efforts to boost
domestic revenues and contain expenditure
continue. Revenues are expected to be boosted
in 2012 as the government receives oil signature
bonuses (equivalent to about 9 percent of GDP).
6.
The current DSA assumes the same
level of external financing as under the
previous Joint DSA, but assumes higher loan
concessionality. The DSA assumes that the
average grant element of new disbursement is

about 50 percent through the medium term, in
line with the current IMF program. In the
baseline, concessional financing is phased out
beginning in 2015 as the country becomes an oil
producer; first moving from IDA grants to IDA
credits and then to accessing finance at market
rates. No financing from future privatization
operations, no commercial loans, no domestic
borrowing, and no short-term loans are assumed
throughout the period.
7.
The baseline scenario retains the same
petroleum assumptions applied under the
previous Joint DSA. Production and export of
about 12,700 barrels per day is assumed to
commence in 2015 in the Joint Development
Zone (JDZ) shared with Nigeria. This is expected
to yield $430 million in average annual export
earnings and $266 million in average annual
revenues to the JDZ, of which 40 percent
($106 million) will belong to São Tomé and
Príncipe.6 In accordance with the Oil Revenue
Management Law (ORML), these petroleum
revenues will be accumulated in a National Oil
Account (NOA) from which resources will be
drawn up to a maximum of 20 percent of the
balance per year to finance the annual budget.
Once oil production starts, the bulk of current
revenues are to be transferred into a sub-account
of the NOA—the Permanent Fund of São Tomé
& Príncipe. Resources in the Permanent Fund are
6

The last DSA update prepared by Fund staff
(February 2010) assumed a similar volume of oil
production and exports beginning in 2015 at a price
of $75 per barrel, compared to $82 a barrel in this
DSA. The 2009 Joint DSA assumed oil production
beginning in 2014 and exports starting in 2015. The
2008 DSA had the same timeline for production and
exports, but assumed a higher volume of production
of about 15,000 barrels per day, priced at $70 per
barrel.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 3

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

to be invested with a view to generating a
permanent income stream for the NOA.
8.
The main risk to the macroeconomic
framework arises from the uncertainty about
the prospects for oil. For illustrative purposes,
the DSA expands the analysis under the
alternative non-oil scenario to assess the debt
outlook in the event that oil is not discovered in

commercially viable quantities. The details of the
alternative medium-to long-term assumptions
are described in Box 2. Medium-term growth
could be slower than in the baseline if expected
concessional financing cannot be obtained. A
lack of grants or concessional loans will hamper
the efforts to diversify the economy and improve
infrastructure by slowing the government’s
public investment program.

Box 1. São Tomé and Príncipe: Baseline Macroeconomic Assumptions
Real GDP growth is projected at 5 percent in 2011
and then to average around 6 percent over the
period 2012–14 as the country recovers from the
global financial crisis and as foreign direct
investment in tourism and oil-related construction
picks up. Growth surges to 24 percent of GDP in
2015 as oil production commences, and then returns
to the long-run average of 5.6 percent over the
projection horizon.
Average annual inflation is projected to steadily
decline from 13.3 percent in 2010, to 8.8 percent in
2012, and further to around 3.5 percent by 2014. It is
assumed to remain around 3 percent over the longer
term. The path reflects fiscal tightening and the peg
of the dobra against the euro, which went into effect
in January 2010.
The non-interest current account deficit
(including official grants) increased to 30.4 percent
of GDP in 2010, due to increases in imports
associated with oil-related investment projects. The
non-interest current account deficit is expected to
remain over 24 percent of GDP until oil exports start.
Investment related to oil production is expected to
keep the deficit around 30 percent through 2017.
The current account is then expected to decline
sharply to 14 percent of GDP and will gradually
trend toward balance over the longer term. Pre-oil
export growth will be driven by increases in cocoa
production and re-exports of fuel to airline and
shipping companies as São Tomé & Príncipe
rehabilitates its airport and expands its connectivity.

The domestic primary deficit fell to 4.1 percent of
GDP in 2010 and is expected to continue declining in
the medium term, in line with the aim of mobilizing
sufficient revenues to cover recurrent spending.
Once oil production starts, the overall fiscal balance
will average a surplus of around 8 percent of GDP
over the longer term, while the non-oil domestic
primary deficit will remain in line with non-debt
creating financing. This is projected to result from
restraint in wage and goods and services
expenditures and improved revenue administration.
Grants are projected to decline from their current
levels of 19 percent of GDP in 2010 to an average of
9 percent of GDP in the medium term. These grants,
together with projected disbursements from
concessional loans are assumed to be spent entirely
on development projects and associated
maintenance.
FDI levels declined to an average of 6 percent of
GDP during 2009 through 2011 as a result of the
global financial crisis and uncertainty surrounding oil
production. FDI is expected to rebound to
17 percent of GDP in 2012 as exploration begins in
the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). In the oil era, FDI
increases substantially to finance oil-related capital
investments. Both grants and concessional loans are
projected to decline substantially as oil income
becomes available to finance development needs.
No domestic borrowing is envisaged. Any
domestic financing needs are met via a drawdown of
government deposits (including from the NOA).

EXTERNAL AND PUBLIC SECTOR DSA7
A. Baseline
9.
Under the baseline, the external debt
trajectory breaches the threshold level for the
present value of PPG external debt. Reflecting
São Tomé and Príncipe’s low exports, the PV of
PPG external debt-to-exports ratio is over three
times the indicative threshold of 100 percent and
is expected to remain above the threshold until
2015 when oil exports begin. External debt
indicators improve dramatically with oil, with all
ratios immediately dropping below the threshold
and trending down. The debt-to GDP ratio is
marginally above the threshold until the start of
oil production.
10.
São Tomé and Príncipe’s debt
dynamics remain below the thresholds for all
other indicators. The debt-to-GDP ratio is within
2 percent of the threshold in 2011 and 2012 and
additional borrowing beyond what is included in
the baseline will only drive it further over the
policy-dependent threshold, where it could
remain in breach until oil comes on stream. The
government has obtained additional concessional
financing over the past year from various sources
to make up for shortfalls in grants.8

11.
Debt service ratios are expected to
remain below the threshold for the projection
period. Although São Tomé and Príncipe’s debt
service ratios fall below the indicative thresholds,
the country will be unable to expand its very
narrow export base in the short term. Absent oil
production, this could contribute to solvency and
liquidity risks.

There is not much difference between the external
and public sector DSAs since the government of
São Tomé & Príncipe does not issue domestic debt
and is not projected to issue debt in the baseline
scenario.

During 2009, bilateral sources of highly concessional
financing included Angola ($10 million), Nigeria
($10 million), and Portugal ($1 million) and multilateral
institutions ($4 million). In 2010, concessional
financing was received from Portugal ($17.4 million)
and multilateral institutions ($3 million) while in 2011
the authorities received concessional loans from
Nigeria ($10 million), and multilateral agencies
($4.7 million) by the end of August.

B. Sensitivity Analysis and Alternative Scenario
12.
Stress tests show the vulnerability of
the debt position to a slowdown in export
growth and a combination of other adverse
economic shocks. The present value of debt
exceeds 30 percent of GDP through 2022.
Similarly, the debt-to-revenue ratio rises above
the 200 percent threshold from 2012–14, reaching
310 percent in 2013. Weaker-than-expected
export growth causes the present value of debtto-exports to rise to almost 800 percent

in 2013 and the debt service-to-exports ratio
to breach the threshold, reaching over
31 percent in 2014. Several other potential
shocks could also see debt levels remain above
the indicative thresholds for a prolonged
period. If the current account deficit were at
lower levels, then debt could be reduced more
quickly. Smaller current account deficits are
unlikely in coming years as the remaining
construction projects are rolled out and
existing projects are completed.

Box 2. São Tomé and Príncipe: Macroeconomic Assumptions under the Alternative
Non-Oil Scenario with Adjustment
Real GDP growth is assumed to be lower than in
the baseline by 0.5 percent of GDP from 2013–15 as
the government slows its public investment program
absent finance from oil revenues. Over the long
term, growth is projected to be sustained at around
5.5, similar to the historical norm. Strong
macroeconomic policies, measures to enhance the
business climate, and successful implementation of a
tourism development strategy would be needed to
achieve this potential. Growth would be led by
tourism, agriculture, and fishing. Investment will
have to be supported by grant inflows in the
absence of oil.
The projected non-interest current account deficit
would decline from around 30 percent of GDP to a
medium-term level of around 25 percent, reflecting
a decline in imports.
The domestic primary deficit is adjusted by a total
of 2 percent over a period of two years starting in
2014 to keep it in line with projected available nondebt creating financing. Making the adjustment will
keep the domestic primary deficit in line with nondebt creating financing. Most concessional
borrowing is projected to arise to finance capital
expenditures associated with the public investment
program. To minimize the impact on growth, the

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

adjustment would come through measures to
enhance revenue mobilization (i.e., broaden the tax
base by consolidating tax revenue reforms) and to
reduce nonpriority spending. The scenario continues
to assume receipts of oil signature bonuses in 2011
and 2012, reflecting the results of completed
contracts and on-going negotiations.
Concessional borrowing would decline from
unsustainably high levels in 2009–11 to the historical
norm of 3 percent of GDP, beginning with a
reduction of planned borrowing during 2012–15 by
around 3 percent of GDP per year. All borrowing
through the long term will occur on highly
concessional terms. Capital investment of about
US$24 million currently projected to be financed by
concessional loans over 2013 and 2014 will have to
be postponed to keep the PV of debt-to GDP ratio
around the threshold.
Grant financing is expected to remain around
historical norms, but additional grant mobilization
could mitigate the impact of lower borrowing for
capital investment.
FDI flows will subside toward 5 percent of GDP,
consistent with the average for Sub-Saharan
countries.

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

13.
Under a non-oil scenario, São Tomé &
Príncipe’s debt dynamics would remain close
to the thresholds, with increased vulnerability
to shocks. Fiscal deficits would be financed
through highly concessional borrowing, raising
debt levels relative to the baseline. Significant
breaches would occur throughout the projection
period for the debt-to-exports ratio. Additionally,
the debt-to-GDP ratio would steadily climb to just

over the 30 percent threshold from 2021 until
2023 before gradually declining resulting from a
combination of fiscal discipline and GDP growth.
An adjustment to correct the debt-to-exports
ratio is difficult given the narrow export base.
However, redressing the breach of the debt-toGDP threshold over the longer term would
require a sustained fiscal adjustment.

CONCLUSION AND THE AUTHORITIES’ VIEW
14.
São Tomé and Príncipe remains at a
high risk of external debt distress. São Tomé &
Príncipe benefits from the future oil prospects
which attract foreign direct investment and from
receiving grant inflows which clearly mitigate its
liquidity risks; these are unstable and insufficient
to limit the risks posed by the high debt levels.
Despite being at a high risk, São Tomé and
Príncipe’s debt dynamics are manageable. São
Tomé and Príncipe is able to service its current
obligations, and the overall public sector debt
situation, while elevated over the short term,
shows a downward trend in the longer run. The
authorities will need to monitor the adequacy of
fiscal adjustment under a non-oil scenario to
ensure that long-term debt sustainability is not
compromised. In this context, the DSA underlines
the need for measures to mitigate risks:


Strengthen the fiscal position such that
recurrent expenditures are covered by
domestic resources;



Accelerate reforms to improve policy and
institutional performance to enhance the
growth potential of the country;



Ensure favorable financing terms in the
form of grants or highly concessional
borrowing; and



Develop a comprehensive strategy to
reduce the cost of doing business and
attract investment that can broaden the
export base.

15.
Key medium-term vulnerabilities
include lower GDP growth, major external
shocks, and borrowing on less concessional
terms. These vulnerabilities underscore the
importance of sound macroeconomic policies to
improve the growth potential on a sustained
basis. The development of sound public debt
management, anchored in a medium-term debt
management strategy and in line with a mediumterm fiscal framework will be essential to guide
future development financing for São Tomé and
Príncipe. Priority should be given to projects
which would help generate high growth and
employment to help ensure debt service capacity
in the future.
16.
The authorities broadly agreed with
the key macroeconomic assumptions and the
analysis underpinning the joint debt
sustainability analysis. The authorities are
optimistic about the prospects for future oil
exploration, yet welcomed the discussion of a
non-oil scenario. While acknowledging that São
Tomé & Príncipe remains at risk of falling back
into debt distress, they highlighted that
supporting growth and diversification requires
mobilizing sufficient resources to implement the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 7

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

public investment program, which may require
highly-concessional borrowing to the extent that
sufficient grant financing is not available. The
authorities noted that additional borrowing does
not pose an immediate concern as the debt
service levels are currently well below the
thresholds.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP,
and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods a
re the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its
baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe
On January 23, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with São Tomé and Príncipe.1
Background
São Tomé & Príncipe’s economy is gradually recovering after a marked slowdown in 2009.The
slowdown reflected a decline in foreign direct investment as a result of the global financial
crisis. Gross domestic product (GDP) growth is estimated to have rebounded to nearly
5 percent in 2011 as externally financed projects helped drive activities in construction, trade,
tourism, and agriculture. Growth momentum is expected to increase as exploratory drilling for
oil continues. The authorities expect oil production to start in 2015. The recovery is subject to
downside risks stemming from the financial and economic difficulties in Europe, which could
dampen the prospects for aid, foreign direct investment, and remittances.
Inflation has declined substantially since 2008 but remains at double-digit levels. A tightening of
fiscal and monetary policies in 2008 and falling world food prices helped lower year-on-year
inflation from a peak of 37 percent in July 2008 to 11½ percent in June 2010. Since then, a
reversal in international food prices, increases in the administered retail prices of petroleum
products, and other domestic factors have kept inflation in the teens. Inflation is projected to

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

decline in line with expected falls in non-fuel commodity prices over the medium term,
supported by the peg to the euro and fiscal consolidation.
The central bank has made good progress in strengthening the regulation and supervision of
banks. It has initiated a program of on-site inspections and expects to complete the inspection
of all banks by end-2012. All banks have complied with a recent increase in minimum capital
requirements. Rapid credit growth and the economy’s vulnerability to economic and financial
stress in Europe pose risks to financial stability.
São Tomé & Príncipe remains at a high risk of debt distress, although it has received
substantial debt relief. The debt burden remains heavy, especially in relation to export
revenues. Improvement in the outlook hinges on the commercial viability of the oil discoveries.
Oil signature bonuses, investment inflows, and concessional loans have financed a large
increase in the current account deficit in recent years. Without oil, the deficit is not sustainable.
Quantitative assessments of the real exchange rate are inconclusive. However, continuing high
domestic inflation will lead to over-valuation of the real exchange rate and loss of international
competitiveness.
The authorities have improved the investment climate. The World Bank’s 2012 Doing Business
Survey ranked São Tomé & Príncipe among the top reformers in the past year. Major reforms
included the elimination of a raft of licensing and minimum capital requirements for starting a
wide range of businesses. The authorities are now turning their attention to upgrading the
country’s physical infrastructure and reforms in the energy sector to assure more reliable power
supply.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed São Tomé and Príncipe’s gradual recovery from the impact of
the 2008 global financial crisis. However, the economy is vulnerable to external shocks and
downside risks stemming from the ongoing financial and economic difficulties in Europe.
Directors commended the progress made in fiscal consolidation and saw a need for continued
efforts to dampen domestic demand pressures, safeguard international reserves, and protect
the exchange rate peg. They welcomed the authorities’ medium-term fiscal objective of
stabilizing the domestic primary deficit at a level that can be financed by available non-debtcreating resources. In this regard, Directors encouraged the authorities to further enhance
domestic revenues, reduce exemptions from customs duties, and adopt an automatic price
adjustment mechanism to pass through changes in world fuel prices to retail prices. Directors
also stressed the need to break the cycle of domestic cross arrears by ensuring realistic
budgeting for the government’s utility bills, imposing a hard budget constraint on regional and
local governments, and making the state-owned water and electricity corporation commercially
viable. They supported the steps being taken to ensure that future oil revenues are managed
carefully.

3
Directors noted that despite substantial debt relief, São Tomé and Príncipe remains at high risk
of debt distress and urged the authorities to maintain a prudent external borrowing policy,
relying mainly on grants to finance the public investment program. Directors stressed that, if
new borrowing is needed, it should be on highly concessional terms. They looked forward to the
participation in the multilateral debt relief initiatives by remaining creditors.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to strengthen monetary management and
banking supervision. They urged continued vigilance toward risks stemming from rapid credit
growth, high dollarization, and economic and financial developments in Europe. They supported
ongoing efforts to strengthen the Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of
Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework.
Directors commended the progress in improving the business and investment climate. They
encouraged the authorities to continue their efforts by upgrading infrastructure and assuring a
reliable energy supply, in order to boost output and export growth. Directors also urged the
authorities to complete the new National Poverty Reduction Strategy as soon as possible.

Statement by Mr. Assimaidou on Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe
January 23, 2012
Our Sao Tomean authorities would like to express their appreciation for the Fund’s continued
support and constructive policy dialogue including during the consultations held in Sao Tome
and in Washington DC in September 2011.
Sao Tome and Principe is recovering from the impact of the global economic and financial
crisis which led to a sharp decline of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), and increased
imported inflation pressures. As reflected in the well written and balanced staff report, the
authorities vigorously responded to mitigate the impact of the crisis, preserve
macroeconomic stability, while making inroads in achieving their growth and development
objectives.
Driven by the construction, tourism and agriculture sectors, real GDP growth for 2011 is
projected at 5 percent. Inflation continued its declining trend at 13.2 percent rate in October
2011 after reaching a peak of 37 percent in 2008. Nonetheless, the pass through of
international petroleum prices heightened domestic prices fluctuations.
The authorities’ policies aimed not only at mitigating the impact of the immediate crisis, but
also at realizing their medium term growth and poverty reduction objectives, in line with
their ECF-supported program. As noted by staff, the program performance criteria have been
substantially implemented, albeit with some delays. The authorities are in the process of
finalizing the updating of the poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP), which is required for
the ECF program reviews to be completed.
Fiscal Consolidation and Macroeconomic Stability
The authorities pursued a prudent fiscal stance, intensifying their fiscal consolidation efforts,
with the view to preserving macroeconomic stability, and safeguarding the exchange rate
peg. Fiscal performance in 2011 has been strong owing to higher than projected revenues and
tighter expenditure controls.
Looking forward, the 2012 budget aims to lower further the primary deficit to 3.2 percent of
GDP, in line with the authorities’ medium-term objectives. In this regard, greater revenue
mobilization efforts are planned, including stepped up tax collections activities, and customs
and tax administration efficiency gains. The authorities will take steps to break the cycle of
cross-arrears due to public utilities. These include a close monitoring of payments by local
municipalities to public utilities and adequately provisioning for the payment of utility bills.
As regards spending, the authorities will seek to control the wage bill in real terms, and to
reallocate expenditures towards priority sectors. The authorities will also strive to improve
public financial management, particularly through enhanced monitoring and increased
transparency in budget execution.

2

Enhancing monetary policy and financial stability
In order to promote the development of the financial system, and protect it from the
spillovers of the global financial crisis, the authorities are strengthening the regulatory and
supervisory framework, and monetary policy management.
With respect to monetary policy management, the authorities will focus on improving
liquidity management, with Fund technical assistance. The authorities are closely monitoring
inflation development as well. Their fiscal and monetary policy tightening and the recently
adopted peg helped significantly reduce inflationary pressures. However, the narrow
economic basis, supply bottlenecks, as well as import price fluctuations-notably of petroleum
and basic commodities prices-continued to drive the inflation outlook. Although second
round effects from the recent spike in prices were not observed, as noted by staff, the
authorities are undertaking steps to reduce supply side constraints, and stand ready to further
tighten monetary policy as needed.
Banking regulation and supervision will be further strengthened through increased banks’
capital requirement, and by stepping up onsite inspections of banks. The authorities are also
taking steps to enhance the resilience of the banking sector’s balance sheets to exchange rate
fluctuations, by taking measures to reduce the dollarization of the financial system, and
requiring commercial banks to hold reserve requirements in Dobra, the local currency.
The authorities are committed to ensuring that Sao Tome and Principe’s financial system is
in compliance with international standards such as the FATF’s AML/CFT. Amongst the
actions taken, they amended the AML/CFT laws, and established a Financial Intelligence
Unit, in line with the FATF’s recommendations. As recognized by the FATF’s assessment,
the authorities are fully committed at the highest level to implement the action plan agreed
upon, with the view to addressing the remaining deficiencies. They have also requested
Fund’s technical assistance for that purpose. In light of the progress made to date, and efforts
to further strengthen compliance, they are seeking the removal of Sao Tome and Principe
from the list of non-cooperating jurisdictions.
Strengthening Sao Tome and Principe’s External Position
The Debt Sustainability Analysis finds that Sao Tome and Principe remains at high risk of
debt distress due to a narrow export base, and uncertainties as to the oil production prospects.
In order to preserve external debt sustainability, the authorities are committed to seek grants
and highly concessional financing of their public investments. They are also strengthening
their debt management capacities and intend to pursue a prudent borrowing strategy.
To expand their export base, the authorities are moving forward with the exploitation of their
hydrocarbon resources, including through the allocation of development licensing in the Joint

3

Development Zone with Nigeria. They will also promote non-oil sectors, particularly
Tourism and Agriculture in order to diversify their economy.
The authorities are determined to preserve Sao Tome and Principe’s international
competitiveness in the context of the peg to the Euro, which recently experienced renewed
market stress on account of the sovereign debt crisis. They are determined to reduce over
time the inflation differential with the euro area, and will continue to improve the investment
climate including through reforms in the energy sector and infrastructure investments.
Medium Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy
As mentioned above the authorities are in the process of finalizing their National Poverty
Reduction Strategy (NPRS), which will guide their reform agenda going forward. The
finalization of the NPRS, which is required before the conclusion of the ECF program’s
reviews, was delayed due to capacity constrains and the need to ensure broad-based
ownership of the new strategy.
The NPRS will benefit from the recent update of the poverty profile. Key pillars of the
strategy will include: i) the reform of public institutions, and the promotion of good
governance, ii) a broad-based economic growth, iii) human resources development, and
iv) improved access to basic services.
The authorities will actively promote the role of the private sector in fostering a diverse and
resilient economy. They have deployed sustained efforts to enhance the investment climate,
including the establishment of a “one-stop” window to assist investors, and to streamline
business regulations. These efforts were recognized in the World Bank’s 2012 Doing
Business Survey which ranked Sao Tome and Principe among the top performers.
Going forward, the authorities will pursue additional reforms, building on the gains achieved
so far, including by overhauling the countries’ infrastructure, notably the port and airport,
and by reforming the energy sector.
