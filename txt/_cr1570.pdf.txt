STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
The economy has shown considerable resilience but the outlook is weighed down by
weak demand in Europe. Healthy private balance sheets, integration with Germany, and
employment support schemes have helped sustain employment and economic activity.
However, output is still well below potential and private sector job creation insufficient. With
exports accounting for about one third of domestic value added, the growth outlook
(1 percent in 2015) is heavily influenced by conditions in Europe.
The critical challenges are preserving competitiveness and addressing the looming
fiscal cost of ageing. The wage policies of the previous government reversed in part a loss
in cost competitiveness relative to the three main trading partners, but the economy has also
been losing ground in terms of innovation and productivity growth. Age-related government
spending is projected to increase sizably by 2040 (an added annual cost of 6 percent of GDP).
This reflects the combination of demographics and early withdrawals from the labor force
owing to generous access to social benefits and inadequate active labor market policies.
The new federal government has announced ambitious reforms to address these
challenges. Its focus is on improving competitiveness through temporary de-indexation of
wages and a modest fiscal devaluation, and activating underused labor resources by
tightening eligibility to pension, pre-pension and unemployment benefits. The program
should be complemented by reforms to increase productivity growth and employment
creation, by opening sheltered sectors to competition, lowering the cost of regulation,
increasing labor market flexibility and improving education and professional training.
Fiscal adjustment is expected to resume after a pause in 2014. The pace of structural
adjustment targeted for 2015–16 (0.7 percent of GDP a year) is appropriate given debt
sustainability risks, and is underpinned by pro-growth expenditure measures. Coordination
between the levels of government still needs strengthening across a range of issues.
Banks are adapting to a challenging operational environment and a more demanding
regulatory framework. The banking sector fared relatively well by the ECB’s comprehensive
assessment, but additional efforts will be needed toward Basel III capital standards. To
maintain adequate profitability, business models need to adapt further to the low growth
and low interest rate environment.

CONTEXT
1.
Following the May 2014 election, a center-right coalition government came into
power in October 2014. The move to the opposition by the socialist party—present in every
coalition government since 1988—and the entry into government of the conservative New Flemish
Alliance (NVA) marks a significant political shift. The government’s economic priorities are
competitiveness (fiscal devaluation and a one-time skip of wage indexation), deficit reduction
(cuts in social transfers and current spending), and activation (higher retirement age, further limits to
subsidized early retirement, and rebalancing of fiscal incentives in favor of work). The announced
measures triggered protests and strikes, but negotiations with the unions resumed in early 2015.
2.
Belgium’s economic performance is lackluster but compares favorably with the euro
area average, reflecting underlying financial strengths and employment support schemes.
Real GDP stands at 2 percent above its preLabor Subsidies
crisis peak (Figure 1), although the negative
(In percent of GDP)
output gap remains sizable (1.3 percent).

increase in labor subsidies (wage subsidies for

These subsidies compensated in part for the
deterioration in relative unit labor costs (ULCs),
accumulated since 2009 (Figure 3).
3.
However, a demand shortfall in Europe weighs down on the recovery, and structural
weaknesses undermine potential growth. Belgium has largely kept pace with its three main
trading partners in terms of export growth, but if unaddressed the deterioration in cost
competitiveness could undermine such performance. With exports contributing for roughly
35 percent of domestic value added, preserving external competitiveness has always been a key
policy priority, and the previous government froze real wages and adjusted indexation to close the
competitiveness gap. However, Belgium has also been losing ground in terms of fundamental
determinants of potential growth and competitiveness such as productivity growth and innovation.
Evidence of this is seen in the falling number of exporting firms and the increased concentration of
exports to a few capital intensive sectors.
4.
Staff assesses the external position to be moderately weaker than the level consistent
with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings. A substantial revision of the net
income balance resulted in an upward revision of the 2013 current account by 2 percent of GDP.
As a result, the cyclically adjusted current account is now close to the estimated norm based on the

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELGIUM

Fund’s EBA methodology. However, the volatility of external income flows raises uncertainty about
the EBA current account gap estimate. Based on the EBA exchange rate assessment of
January 2015 and productivity trends in the tradable sector, staff considers the real exchange
overvaluation to be in the 0–5 percent range (see Appendix I for more details).
5.
The level of economic activity is also depressed by low employment rates related to
distortions from tax and benefit policies. The combination of generous access to pension and
unemployment benefits, high labor taxes, early retirement schemes, and high minimum wages
contribute to one of the lowest employment rates (67 percent) in Northern Europe (Figure 4). The
employment rate for the 55–64 age cohort has been rising rapidly in the wake of past reforms, but it
remains particularly low at 42 percent. It is equally low for non-EU immigrants (40 percent), and low
skilled workers (47 percent). The low, and shrinking, level of non-subsidized private sector
employment has, in turn, narrowed the tax base to pay for social transfers and government services,
making the task of fiscal adjustment more arduous.
6.
Diverging patterns of public expenditure and GDP growth since 2008 have
complicated fiscal consolidation efforts. Cumulatively over 2010–14, primary structural
adjustment of 1.8 percent of GDP has been achieved entirely on the revenue front (Figure 5).
Containment of public consumption and investment has been offset by large increases in subsidies
and social transfers. Belgium exited the EU’s Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) in 2014 upon
confirmation that the 2013 deficit had fallen below 3 percent of GDP. However, structural fiscal
adjustment stalled in 2014, pushing the estimated deficit back above 3 percent of GDP. Belgium has
also found itself in violation of the debt rule under the preventive arm of Stability and Growth Pact,
and in February 2015 the European Commission will issue a new recommendation on minimum
required fiscal adjustment. Notwithstanding these challenges, market confidence remains strong,
with 10–year spreads vis-à-vis German rates at around 30 basis points at end-2014, and 15 basis
points as of early February 2015.
7.
Primary structural adjustment of 2.9 percent of GDP in 2015 and beyond is still needed
to meet the 2014 Stability Program medium-term surplus objective of 0.75 percent of GDP.1
Belgium’s fiscal medium-term objective (MTO) is among the most ambitious in the euro area
reflecting the sustainability gap created by the projected increase in the cost of ageing—i.e., an
added annual fiscal cost of nearly 6 percent of GDP by 2040. This fiscal impact reflects demographics
(the ratio of working age population to person 65 and older will decline from 3.2 today
to 2.2 by 2060) but also generous access to social benefits and low activity rates.
8.
Monetary easing by the European Central Bank (ECB) has been fully passed on to
lending rates. Lending standards have eased for non-financial corporations (NFCs) and SMEs, but
have been tightened for households in response to prudential measures taken by the National Bank.
Non-financial corporate (NFC) recourse to market financing has not visibly crowded out bank credit.
A drop in inflation expectations resulted in a slight increase in real lending rates in 2014 (Figure 6).
1

Based on the authorities’ estimate of potential GDP, the needed adjustment is only 1.5 percent of GDP.

9.
The ECB’s comprehensive assessment found capital gaps in two banks, which however
did not require further action. The two Belgian banks that failed the ECB’s stress test were
AXA Bank Europe (the Belgian banking arm of the French insurance group) and Dexia.2 Since
December 31, 2013—the cut-off date for the assessment—AXA Bank Europe has taken action to
meet minimum capital requirements. In the case of Dexia, which is in runoff mode, the potential
capital shortfall that was revealed by the stress tests did not require further action given the orderly
resolution plan supported by state guarantees. Belgian banks as a whole fared relatively well in
terms of liquidity and capitalization, with a CET1 ratio of 12.1 percent in the baseline and 7.4 percent
in the adverse scenario comfortably above the thresholds of 8 and 5.5. They were close to the euro
area average in terms of non-performing exposure, but came last in terms of leverage (3.6 percent
in the ECB’s baseline scenario). When taking into account the subsidiaries of foreign banks, the
picture confirms that the system as a whole is well capitalized and liquid, and that the nonperforming loans ratio is relatively low, stable and well-provisioned (Table 6 and Figure 7).

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
10.
Growth is projected to remain stable at 1.0 percent in 2015 owing to lackluster
demand conditions in Europe, wage moderation and fiscal consolidation. The strong rebound
in all components of private demand seen in early 2014 (business and housing investment, exports,
and private consumption) is projected to moderate in 2015. The boost from the recent drop in oil
prices—equivalent to about 0.2 percent of GDP according to staff estimates—and depreciation of
the real effective exchange rate largely offset a downward revision in the underlying demand
outlook in Europe. CPI Inflation is expected to slow to near zero in 2015 under the influence of lower
oil prices and wage moderation.
11.
The risks to the outlook are mainly external in the short run and domestic over the
medium term (see Risk Assessment Matrix in Appendix II). The risks are interconnected and, if
realized, are likely to interact and occur jointly. The authorities broadly shared the staff’s assessment
of risks.
High exposure to euro area weakness and geopolitical tensions. With 56 percent of its
exports directed to the euro area (EA), Belgium is heavily exposed to the risk of stalling
growth in the euro area and, through its integration in the German supply chain, to
weakness in emerging market economies. Even if direct trade and financial linkages with
Russia and Ukraine are small, an escalation of the crisis would have substantial adverse
effects through other European countries. Combined with the planned temporary deindexation of salaries, weaker growth could also push inflation lower, possibly further into
deflation territory. While labor cost containment measures should improve growth prospects
2

In the comprehensive assessment’s consolidated approach, the subsidiaries of foreign banks are not part of the
Belgian aggregate. Thus, the results reported for Belgium exclude BNP Paribas Fortis and ING Belgium SA, which
accounted for 42 percent of total banking sectors assets (as of end 2013).

over the medium term, they may not have a positive impact on investment or job creation in
the short run if expectations about future growth remain depressed.
Limited exposure to global financial instability but risks from lower profitability and
high leverage in the banking sector. The Belgian banking system has retrenched more
than most in the wake of the financial crisis: balance sheets have been derisked and
remaining non-sovereign foreign exposures are concentrated in mortgages of foreign
subsidiaries in Ireland and Hungary. Low profitability from domestic operations could
hamper the banks’ ability to maintain adequate capital buffers and improve the leverage
ratio.
Substantial cross exposures between the public sector and banks being unwound. As
banks shed stressed sovereign paper in the wake of the crisis, exposure to the Belgian
sovereign increased and then eased down to below 6 percent of total assets (end-2014).
Public sector claims on banks are declining. KBC has repaid €5 billion of the €7 billion in
public support it received in 2009, and plans to repay the rest on an accelerated schedule.
State guarantees to Dexia (10.8 percent of GDP) support the long-term dismantling of the
bank by covering market financing of the legacy assets in run-off.3 The guarantees could
cover any hole resulting from a rise in the cost of rolling over Dexia’s liabilities or valuation
losses on the asset side (notably from the structured product portfolio). In staff’s view,
realization of such a contingency could be covered in part by disposal of government assets
available for sale, which are valued at 9.4 percent of GDP.
Limited housing sector vulnerabilities. Following a steady and prolonged appreciation,
house prices peaked in 2013:Q3 (Figure 4). Given that average house prices are still lower
than in neighboring countries and that fundamental shifts in demand (due to population
growth, declining household size, and easier financial conditions) explain much of the price
evolution, estimates based on historical price-to-income and price-to-rent ratios appear to
overstate the degree of overvaluation4. Based on these considerations, and taking into
account the impact of less generous mortgage tax deductibility in Flanders and Wallonia
starting in 2015, staff and the authorities agree that overvaluation is small to moderate (in
the 0–25 percent range). Thus, real house prices are expected to decline gradually over the
medium term. Given strong household balance sheets, the high owner occupancy rate, and
generally healthy lending standards, the risks of a disorderly correction are limited.
Still, unexpected changes in housing-related policies and a large drop in expected future
income could destabilize the housing market. On the upside, supply constraints create a
potential for further price hikes; but, risks of a credit-driven increase in demand are small
given the tightening of macro-prudential policies and the close attention of the supervisor.

Long-term risks from insufficient structural reforms. Failure of structural reforms to raise
employment and keep up with competitiveness improvements in the rest of the euro area
would undermine potential growth, increase fiscal risks, and reduce preparedness for the
looming cost of ageing.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The new federal government’s economic program is closely aligned to past Fund recommendation
(Appendix III). Article IV discussions took place during general strikes called by the unions against the
government program. However, disagreements between the unions and the federal government were
fundamentally about how to distribute the burden of adjustment across generations and taxpayers,
rather than about the need for reform. All stakeholders recognized the importance of increasing the
duration of working life, strengthening competitiveness, and repairing public finances. The previous
government had already implemented a program of wage moderation and reform of social transfers to
address these challenges. The new government’s stance is that a more ambitious approach is necessary
to improve growth and employment prospects and secure fiscal sustainability.

A. Strengthening Potential Growth and Competitiveness
12.
A wage freeze to correct the labor cost gap relative to partners. To counterbalance the
impact of wage indexation, bargaining over the “real” component of wages has been guided by a
wage norm. The wage norm tracks labor costs relative to Belgium’s three main partner countries
since 1996. The norm has worked relatively well at preserving labor cost parity with neighboring
countries over time, but a sizeable gap began to develop in 2006. The gap narrowed to 2.9 percent
in 2014 following a government-imposed real wage freeze in 2013–14. The requirement that the
wage gap should be closed over time leaves little room for significant wage increases in the next
two-year round (2015–16). In addition, the government has announced an “index jump”, i.e., a
suspension of indexation equivalent to 2 percentage points of inflation. Given the projected
increases in wages in the three peer countries (1.35 percent a year in 2015–16 according to the
OECD), the expectation is that the wage gap will continue to close over the next two years.
13.
But also the need for more flexible wage setting. The mission supported the actions
taken to regain cost competitiveness, but noted that, even if parity with the norm were to be
restored, the labor market is unlikely to clear at a sufficiently high level of employment. Apart from
external competitiveness considerations, labor costs remain too high to create new employment
opportunities, particularly for the less skilled. The mission suggested that wage setting should allow
for greater differentiation at the enterprise level. This could involve a review of sector minimum
wages, and introduction of opting-out options for firms seeking to adjust or to create new jobs.
14.
A reduction of the labor tax wedge to accompany wage moderation. The federal
government also committed to lower taxes on labor income, including through a phased reduction
of employers’ social security contributions (from 33 to 25 percent) in a revenue neutral way—largely
by consolidating job-specific cuts in social security contributions into a generalized cut.
Representatives of the major unions considered that the government should have
8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELGIUM

gone further in the direction of a “tax shift,” notably by raising the taxation of capital income to
reduce labor taxes further and faster, thus obviating the need for the “index jump.” Staff agreed that
fiscal devaluation could be pushed further, but also warned that government action to reduce labor
costs (by reducing the tax wedge or through specific subsidies as in the past) should not become a
way of validating excessive wage increases.
15.
Scope for productivity gains through product market reform. Staff noted that a large
share of the service economy (network industries, regulated professions, and to some extent
distribution) remains sheltered from competition. The resulting inefficiencies and rents weigh not
only on the cost of living but also on the competitiveness of export industries who consume these
services as inputs. In the end, foregone productivity gains have to be paid for by lower wages in
order to protect competitiveness. Staff thus encouraged the new government to give greater
impetus to competition to promote productivity growth and, in coordination with regional
governments, to reduce the high cost of regulation which weighs heavily on SMEs. The federal
authorities said they would reduce red tape by reforming legal codes and implementing an “only
once” policy, whereby documents provided by companies to one government agency would
become accessible to all other agencies.

B. Raising Employment Rates
16.
An increase in the retirement age and tighter access to early retirement. The measures
announced by the government (see Box 1 and Appendix IV) should make a significant contribution
to raising employment rates and reducing the fiscal costs of ageing. The government still has to
negotiate with social partners a number of issues, such as exceptions for hardship jobs and part time
pension conditions. Thus, the fiscal impact from these reforms cannot yet be assessed, but the
government stressed it was a major step forward in shifting the burden of adjustment away from the
young and future generations.
17.
Tightening eligibility to unemployment benefits. The announced reforms address the
two weakest aspects of Belgium’s unemployment insurance system: (i) its use as a bridge toward
retirement which encourages early withdrawal from the labor force; (ii) generous eligibility rules for
young workers first entering the labor force, which undermines work incentives and contributes to
inactivity traps. The authorities recognized that these measures would likely not translate into
significant employment gains in the short term, but emphasized the importance of these measures
to change behaviors over time.
18.
Need to accompany these reforms with better active labor market policies and
education. As recognized by the authorities, the benefits from increasing work incentives will be
realized if workers are also given opportunities to improve skills and align them to the needs of the
market. In these areas, Belgium scores very poorly: life-long professional training is well behind
peers; and the education system suffers from some glaring, if localized, failures as well as
generalized inadequacies in vocational training and school-to-work transition.

C. Placing Fiscal Policy on a Path of Steady Adjustment
19.
A resumption of fiscal adjustment following a pause in 2014. Although the financing
outlook remains very favorable, all stakeholders acknowledged that continued adjustment is needed
to reduce debt and regain fiscal space. The federal government set a structural adjustment target
of 0.7 percent a year in 2015–16, with a view to reaching structural balance by 2018 (authorities’
estimates). The delay in reaching the structural balance objective (relative to the 2014 Stability
Program) reflects the adjustment shortfall of 2014. The authorities stressed that the revenue effort
under their plan (0.7 percent of GDP cumulatively over three years) would be put to better use by
reducing labor taxes rather than achieving a faster adjustment (see table above). Beyond 2016, the
pace of adjustment will be guided by the new MTO to be set in the April 2015 Stability Program. The
authorities hope that their structural reforms would reduce the MTO, but the margin to adjust
the MTO is limited since it was already set below the level consistent with the rising cost of ageing.
20.
Adjustment underpinned by pro-growth expenditure measures and shared across
governments. Under a burden sharing agreement, regional and community governments
committed to maintain balanced budgets and absorb the unfunded cost of the responsibilities
transferred to them as of 2015—in all an adjustment of over 1 percent of GDP.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

BELGIUM

The phasing of that adjustment is to be negotiated in consultation with the federal government. The
federal government program targets a shift from revenue to expenditure-based adjustment (see
table) consistent with past Fund advice. Regional and community government plans also target cuts
to current spending and tax expenditures as the primary instruments of consolidation. This
rebalancing of policies should produce more durable and efficient outcomes.5

21.
Staff supportive of government plans. Given the high debt and the risks to public debt
sustainability (Appendix V), staff agreed that the projected gradual recovery justified the planned
pace of adjustment. Debt dynamics are particularly vulnerable to negative shocks to growth. The
debt sustainability analysis illustrates that, whereas debt would revert to a sustainable path after the
initial impact of standard shocks, it would remain on an unsustainable path under a stagnation or
deflation scenario. By contrast, exposure to interest rate shocks has been reduced by the
lengthening of the average maturity of debt (7.8 years in 2014). Staff assessed that policies were well
aligned to fiscal targets. Reflecting uncertainties about the timing of adjustment by regional
governments and the effectiveness of the measures announced so far, staff projects structural
adjustment of 0.6 percent of GDP a year in 2015–16 (see table above), which is only marginally lower
than the authorities’ projections. Because of a declining interest bill, the underlying primary
structural adjustment comes to 0.4 percent of GDP a year. In this baseline scenario, the debt ratio
would return to a downward path in 2016.
22.
Need to preserve room for investment. Staff was concerned that adjustment would rely
excessively on postponing public investment that is needed to upgrade infrastructure in
transportation, energy, education, and social housing. The constraint is tight at all levels of
government, reflecting in part the changed (and less favorable) fiscal treatment of public-private
partnership projects under the new ESA 2010 rules. This reinforces the need to curb and reverse the

rapid increase in the wage bill (one of the highest and fastest growing in Europe) and to rationalize
and cut back widespread subsidies.
23.
Strengthening coordination mechanisms between the levels of government. Fiscal
coordination across governments has been based so far on nominal deficit targets, which have led
to recurrent mid-course corrections through inefficient measures. The fiscal governance framework
adopted in 2013 reinforces the role of the High Council of Finance (HCF) to assess and monitor the
performance of the various governments relative to nominal and, for the first time, structural targets.
The shift to structural targets should improve the efficiency of policies. The HCF underscored the
difficulty of measuring structural adjustment at the subnational level, and said they were consulting
with other federal states in the euro area on this issue.

D. Seeking a More Efficient Tax System
24.
High taxation, heavily tilted toward labor income taxes. The federal government
program envisages a net reduction in labor taxes and a simplification of various social security
abatement schemes which should reduce distortions. Staff saw scope for going further in shifting
the burden of taxation away from labor through tax reform. It noted that income from capital is not
taxed uniformly, and that a more harmonized treatment would put taxation of such income on a
more equal footing with labor income. It also suggested that the use of reduced VAT rates could be
narrowed and that environmental taxes could be increased in line with the need to reduce Belgium’s
high energy consumption. Revenue gains from such reforms could be applied to reducing labor
taxes further. Staff also suggested rebalancing taxes on immovable property from transaction taxes
to recurrent taxes, which would stabilize tax collection and enhance labor mobility. The authorities
said they would explore options to redistribute further the tax burden away from labor, but
underscored the need to assess carefully the impact of other tax increase on economic behavior,
notably when it came to taxation of capital.

E. Continuous Adjustment in the Financial Sector
25.
The challenge of operating in a low growth and low interest rate environment. The
post-crisis retrenchment of banks into the domestic market has exposed the challenges of
maintaining adequate profitability while operating in a saturated market with low interest margins.
Banks are adapting, e.g., taking on new business lines from their foreign parents or developing
bank-insurance. The authorities pointed out that there is scope to reduce costs further and to
maintain adequate interest margins on new loans. A number of observers considered that
consolidation might also become necessary.
26.
High exposure to domestic mortgages but limited risks. Mortgages accounted for
37 percent of bank domestic assets at the end of 2013, up 10 percentage points since the beginning
of 2008. Even though house prices still appear somewhat overvalued, the authorities and banks did
not see a house price correction as creating risks for banks. Mortgage lending standards have been
prudent, non-performance remains low, and recourse loans insulate banks from the value of

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

BELGIUM

collateral. Staff nonetheless urged caution against banks taking higher risks in vulnerable mortgage
markets. The authorities noted that parliament had conferred the mandate on macro-prudential
policies to the National Bank in April 2014, and that the Bank had set up a new organizational
framework to deliver on its new responsibilities in terms of (i) detection of risks and (ii) assessment
and calibration of policy response. The authorities were not contemplating new measures to curb
mortgage lending at this stage. Staff also inquired about risks related to major securities settlement
activity in Belgium, which National Bank representatives considered well monitored and contained.
27.
Intermediating the liquidity surplus of Belgian banks. Belgian banks’ ample liquidity
position reflects their strong deposit mobilizing capacity. In the post crisis period, national
regulatory ring fencing and bank restructuring requirements constrained the redeployment of this
liquidity surplus through cross-border operations. In a context of weak credit demand, the result has
been relatively high holdings of sovereign paper. With the coming into force of Single Supervisory
Mechanism (SSM) and the creation a more integrated euro area banking market, pressures to
redeploy the liquidity surplus of Belgian banks through cross border flows could increase. The
authorities noted that indeed foreign banks had increased their presence in Belgium through
branches to tap into the liquidity generated in Belgium. However, they also expected that barriers to
cross-border flows would continue to exist in the absence of common deposit insurance and
resolution systems. In as much as the Belgian banks strong liquidity position is related to the
favorable tax treatment of bank deposits, the mission questioned the rationale for maintaining such
tax breaks in a progressively unified banking system, where the fiscal benefits will leak beyond
national borders.
28.
Regulatory changes. The banking law adopted in April 2014 set limits on proprietary
trading and new requirements on corporate governance and depositor protection. Banks noted that
the new limits on trading were not constraining their ability to service clients in the current low
volatility environment, but that they could in the future. This pointed to the need for a more
coordinated approach across jurisdictions. The authorities and the banks underscored the added
administrative burden associated with the transition to the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), but
otherwise welcome the benefits that would accrue from SSM in terms of leveling the playing field
and increasing transparency within the euro area.

STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
Healthy private balance sheets have contributed to the resilience of the economy, but
fiscal fragilities create risks over the medium term. In the absence of strong corrective measures,
the high and rising debt ratio and the projected increase in the cost of ageing will threaten
macroeconomic stability. Generous access to social benefits has helped absorb the impact of the
crisis, but it contributes to structurally low employment and to spending rigidities which have
undermined fiscal consolidation. The key to preserving stability lies in continued steady fiscal
consolidation combined with reforms that increase incentives and opportunities to work and
lengthen working lives.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELGIUM

30.
The federal government’s comprehensive economic program addresses these
challenges by providing a clear forward impulse to needed reforms. The government’s policies
to strengthen cost competitiveness, activate underused labor resources, and accelerate fiscal
adjustment all reinforce each other and should create the conditions for higher growth. When
sustained over time, they will also help preserve the financial integrity of the Belgian social security
system so that it can continue to cover social and economic risks for future generations. To improve
the chances of success, the strategy should be reinforced by broader labor and product market
reforms to enhance productivity and incentives to invest and create jobs. With responsibility for
economic policies now shared across governments, it is critical to develop effective instruments of
inter-government cooperation.
31.
Measures to increase competitiveness and employment by reducing labor costs are
welcome and should be accompanied by structural reforms to improve fundamental
determinants of competitiveness. The government has taken the right actions to correct past
deviations from the wage norm. The decision to reduce the labor tax wedge—the highest in
Europe—is equally welcome. We see room to go further in this direction in the context of broader
tax reform. However, acting on costs alone will not be enough if the economy does not keep up in
term of productivity growth. To stimulate innovation and productivity, a more aggressive approach
is needed to open sheltered sectors to competition and to reduce the burden of regulation. The
labor market also needs to become more adaptable, not least in terms of expanding room for
enterprise-level negotiations over wage and work arrangements.
32.
Reform of social benefits is rightly at the center of the government strategy, but
deficiencies in training and education should be addressed in parallel. In the absence of
effective active labor market policies, the extensive use of social benefits to mitigate the impact of
inadequate or eroded skills has contributed to their entrenchment and to the distortion of
incentives. The government’s planned reform of unemployment and pension benefits is critical to
correcting these distortions. However, in parallel to raising work incentives, it is necessary to
enhance job opportunities by addressing the underlying failings in education, vocational training,
and continuous skill development. Policy coordination across governments is essential since
responsibility for such policies lies mostly with regional and community governments.
33.
Fiscal objectives are sensible in terms of both the pace and the instruments of
adjustment. In the current gradual recovery scenario, structural fiscal adjustment targeted
for 2015–16 is appropriate given debt sustainability risks. The shift to expenditure-based adjustment
bodes well for the sustainability of the adjustment and for growth over the medium term. Currently
envisaged measures may prove insufficient to fully meet annual deficit targets in a context of
persistent low inflation. In response, policies should remain focused on medium-term objectives and
refrain from resorting to short-term revenue fixes or cuts to the investment budgets. More generally,
if growth and inflation threaten to disappoint projections by an appreciable margin, fiscal
adjustment could be eased by increasing growth-enhancing investment spending.

34.
With balance sheet repair nearly completed, the main difficulty for banks is to adjust
to a challenging operating environment and a more demanding regulatory framework.
Balance sheets have been largely derisked from legacy assets, although the long shelf-life of the
legacy assets in public banks will require protracted close oversight. As a whole, however, the
strength of liquidity and capital positions place banks in a strong position to expand credit in
response to an eventual recovery of investment. Pressures to maintain adequate profitability levels
are likely to persist, and supervisors will need to continue to pay close attention to how bank
business models adapt to this challenge.
35.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Appendix I. External Sector Assessment
Overall Assessment

Foreign asset
and liability
position and
trajectory

Background. The net international investment position (NIIP) remains strong at 53 percent of GDP at mid–2014, reflecting
very healthy private balance sheets. Despite Belgium’s decline as a financial center, gross foreign assets are large
(469 percent of GDP). Gross foreign assets of the financial sector stand at around 130 percent of GDP, down considerably
from the pre-crisis peak. But the gross foreign assets of the private non-financial sector have continued to grow to over
300 percent of GDP, reflecting in large part the growth of cross-border intra-group corporate financing transactions.
External public debt was 65 percent of GDP in mid-2014.
Assessment. Belgium’s large gross external positions reflect its position as a center for treasury units for non-financial
corporates. These treasury operations create large mutually offsetting positions which should not be an important source
of risk for Belgium. Risk exposures on the asset side are mostly related to financial sector foreign claims; and risk
exposures on the liability side to external public debt. Based on the projected current account and growth paths, the NIIP
to GDP ratio is expected to remain roughly stable. No sustainability concerns arise.

Current account Background. The current account (CA) had been in moderate surplus for two decades before the crisis, although on a
secular decline and turning into a modest deficit in the crisis years as exports dropped. Due to a significant recent revision
to the income balance, the current account in 2014 is now expected to register a surplus of 0.3 percent of GDP rather
than a deficit of 1.3 percent (September WEO). By this revision, the cyclically-adjusted CA balance would be +0.7 percent
of GDP, compared to a norm of 1 percent (January 2015 EBA estimates). The implied Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)
gap is zero.
Assessment. Belgium’s status as a center of corporate activity raises uncertainty about EBA CA gap estimates. Thus, even
though the cyclically-adjusted current account is close to the level consistent with medium-term fundamentals and
desirable policy settings, staff considers that greater weight should be given to other indicators in assessing external
stability.
Real exchange
rate

Background. Whereas relative ULC developments point to a gradual loss of competitiveness since 2004 (by about
9 percent relative to the euro area average), the impact has been muted by increases in labor subsidies. EBA model
estimates of January 2015 point to an overvaluation of the REER of 5 percent. The depreciation of the euro and fall in oil
prices since then would likely reduce the estimated overvaluation.
Assessment. Real exchange rate overvaluation is assessed to be in the 0–5 percent range.

Capital and
financial
accounts:
flows and policy
measures

Background. Gross financial outflows and inflows grew steadily during the pre-crisis period along the expansion of banks’
cross-border operations. Similarly, they have shrunk since 2007 along the bank deleveraging. Short-term debt accounts
for about 40 percent of the external liabilities and financing need. The capital account is open.

FX intervention
and reserves
level

Background. The euro has the status of a global reserve currency.

Overall Assessment:
The external position is moderately weaker
than the level consistent with medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policy settings.
This reflects fiscal deficits and recent losses
in cost competitiveness. Measures taken to
contain wage growth will help reverse the
competitiveness loss. The strong net
international investment position counters
the vulnerabilities associated with the high
external public debt.

Potential policy responses:
Planned steady fiscal consolidation,
reductions in labor taxes, and wage
moderation will help improve
competitiveness and ensure that the
current account gap remains closed over
the medium term. The impact of these
policies would be enhanced by productivity
enhancing structural reforms in the labor
and product markets.

Assessment. Belgium remains exposed to financial market risks but the structure of financial flows does not point to
specific vulnerabilities. The strong net international investment position reduces the vulnerabilities associated with the
high public debt.
Assessment. Reserves held by the euro area are typically low relative to standard metrics, but the currency is free
floating.

Appendix II. Risk Assessment Matrix
Source of Risk and likelihood

High
Protracted period of slower
growth and persistently low
inflation in Europe from failure to
fully address legacies of financial
crisis, leading to secular stagnation
and lower commodity prices. These
risks are compounded by the risk
of escalation of Russia-Ukraine
crisis.

Impact if realized and
transmission channel

High

High

Low
Limited exposure of domestic
banks to global risks. While the
sovereign-banking nexus remains
important, it is being unwound.

Low

Low
Rapid and disruptive housing
price correction.

Low
Failure to deliver on structural
reforms.

Coordinated policy response at
European level to which Belgium
could contribute by slowing the pace
of consolidation.

Strong impact through trade
channel and by implication
investment. Protracted growth
shortfall could in turn lower
potential growth, raise structural
unemployment and complicate
further fiscal adjustment.

Abrupt surge in global financial
instability in response to investors’
reassessment of risks

Stress in domestic banks from
delayed actions to resolve legacy
issues in public banks’ balance
sheets.

Policy response

Euro area monetary policy is first
line of defense against liquidity
stress, supported by activation of
backstops and resolution
mechanism.

Medium

Continue restructuring of public
banks, resolve their contingent risks.

Exposure to legacy risks has
been reduced markedly.
However, low profitability in
public banks with legacy assets
may carry a fiscal cost if and when
assets are disposed of through
privatization.

Medium
Overvaluation is expected to be
resolved gradually, but in a
context of economic stagnation
private adjustment could
accelerate. In such an event, the
wealth shock to households could
lead to adverse increase in the
savings rate. Banks are however
relatively well protected given
prudent lending standards and full
recourse loans.

Medium
Failure to keep up with
competitiveness gains in the rest
of the euro area would trigger
adverse growth-fiscal dynamics

Following the increase in capital
requirements on mortgage lending
in 2014, additional macroprudential measures could be
introduced while also working on the
supply side of the housing market to
alleviate price pressures

Pursue reform program announced
by the government (mostly labor
market, taxation and social
transfers), and complement it with
product market and regulatory
reforms.

Appendix III. Main Recommendations of the 2014 Article IV
Consultation and Authorities’ Response
Fund Recommendations

Maintain a steady pace of structural fiscal adjustment
of 0.75 percentage points per year.

Policy Actions
Fiscal Policy
Adjustment in 2014 fell short of the objective, but the new governments (federal
and regional) target annual adjustment of 0.7 percent of GDP a year.

Rebalance consolidation toward expenditure measures
and away from tax increases, with emphasis on
reducing current spending, subsidies, and transfers.

As of 2015, consolidation is fully rebalanced toward expenditure measures
(transfers, current spending, and tax expenditures)..

Rebalance the tax burden toward indirect and
environmental taxes, and taxes on income from capital

Federal government commitment not to increase the tax burden, but to shift it
away from labor taxation toward higher taxes on tobacco, energy and alcohol, the
financial sector, and local public service companies that were erstwhile exempted.

Continue regular monitoring of banks’ evolving
business models and of legacy assets.
Prompt passage of the banking law designed to curtail
risks and improve recovery and resolution frameworks

Address distortions from inefficient social policies

Continue labor and product market reforms in order to



Promote labor mobility and adaptability,



Raise employment rates,



Eliminate barriers to competition, and lighten the
heavy burden of regulation.

Appendix V. Debt Sustainability Analysis
Public debt sustainability risks remain high. Under the baseline scenario, the public debt-to-GDP
ratio is projected to peak at 106.4 percent in 2015 and to decline to 98.2 percent by 2020 as the
fiscal deficit narrows and economic recovery gains traction. Gross financing needs are estimated
at 20.2 percent of GDP in 2015 and are expected to remain around 13–20 percent in the medium
term. The projected decline in public debt remains fragile, and even modest changes in the
economic environment would rapidly push the public debt ratio above 110 percent. A negative
growth shock, a prolonged period of economic stagnation, and realization of contingent fiscal
liabilities coming from existing bank guarantees represent the major risks to the debt outlook.
Baseline and Realism of Projections
Slow but steady fiscal consolidation under the baseline scenario and economic recovery result in
a gradual decline in the public debt ratio over the medium term, while the gross financing need
remains broadly unchanged.
Macroeconomic assumptions. Growth is estimated at 1.0 percent in 2015, rising to
1.3 percent in 2016 on the back of stronger demand. The output gap narrows over the
medium term and is projected to close in 2020. Inflation is projected to stay well below
2 percent throughout the period, reflecting the negative output gap, lower oil prices, and the
ongoing wage moderation.
Fiscal outlook. In staff’s baseline projections, the general government deficit comes down
from 2.9 percent of GDP in 2013 to 0.4 percent in 2020. The primary surplus is projected to
strengthen over the medium term, from 0.3 percent of GDP in 2013 to 2.0 percent of GDP
in 2020. The projected pace of fiscal consolidation results in a structural deficit of 0.4 percent
in 2020. However, consolidation measures past 2016 are yet to be elaborated upon.
Debt levels and gross financing needs. Belgium’s high level of government debt and gross
financing requirement calls for using the higher scrutiny framework.6 Government gross debt
has increased significantly since 2007, reflecting sizable fiscal stimulus, declining real and
nominal growth, and a large recapitalization of (and financial support to) the banking sector.
Public debt is estimated to have reached 105.6 percent of GDP in 2014 and is projected to
stay above the 100 percent mark in 2015–19. Gross financing needs are estimated at
20.2 percent of GDP in 2015 and are expected to remain around 13–20 percent in the
medium term.
6

For advanced economies that (i) have a current or projected debt-to-GDP ratio above 60 percent; or (ii) have
current or projected gross financing needs-to-GDP ratio above 15 percent; or (iii) have or are seeking exceptional
access to Fund resources; teams are required to use an extended set of tools to identify and assess specific risks
to debt sustainability. For these “higher scrutiny” cases, teams are also required to produce a standardized
summary of risks in a heat map and prepare a write-up to discuss risks, including any country-specific
considerations.

40

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELGIUM

Realism of baseline assumptions. The median forecast error for real GDP growth
during 2005–13 is -0.6 percent, suggesting that there is a modest upward bias in the staff
projections. The median forecast error for inflation (GDP deflator) is 0.2 percent, suggesting
that the staff forecasts have under-estimated inflation. The median forecast error for primary
balance suggests that staff projections have been slightly optimistic (a forecast bias of 0.3 percent of GDP), but the forecast biases are in line with other surveillance countries
and have improved during the later years.
Cross-country experience suggests the projected fiscal adjustment is feasible. The
maximum 3-year adjustment in the cyclically-adjusted primary balance (CAPB) over the
projection period (1.1 percent of GDP) is moderately ambitious but Belgium was able to
deliver impressive fiscal consolidation in the past. However, staff does not rule out the
existence of implementation risks and therefore a constant primary balance scenario is
presented to illustrate this risk.
Heat map. Risks from the debt level are deemed high given that the relevant threshold to
which Belgium’s values are compared is 85 percent and this threshold is breached under
baseline and all stress test scenarios. Similarly, Belgium’s gross financing needs exceed the
benchmark of 20 percent of GDP. Belgium also faces risks relating to its external financing
requirement and a large share of public debt held by foreigners. At 80 percent of GDP, the
external financing requirement is significantly above the upper threshold of early warning
benchmarks and the share of debt held by foreigners is relatively high at about 50 percent of
total.
Shocks and Stress Tests
The DSA framework suggests Belgium’s government debt-to-GDP ratio remains below
115 percent and its gross financing needs remain below 25 percent of GDP under all standard
macroeconomic and fiscal shocks. In all but the most extreme stagnation scenario, the debt ratio
returns to a downward path by the end of the projection period.
Growth shock. Under this scenario, real output growth rates are lower by one standard
deviation starting in 2015–16, i.e. 1.6 percentage points relative to the baseline scenario. The
assumed decline in growth leads to lower inflation (0.25 percentage points per 1 percentage
point decrease in GDP growth) while interest rates are assumed to increase 25 basis points
for every 1 percent of GDP worsening in the primary balance. Under this scenario, the debtto-GDP ratio increases to 112.2 percent of GDP in 2017 and declines thereafter.
High interest rate scenario. This scenario examines the implications for debt sustainability
of an increase in spreads by 200 basis points throughout the projection period. The
deterioration of public debt and gross financing needs are back-loaded as old debt gradually
matures and new higher interest rate debt is contracted. In 2020, the impact on financing
needs is 1.3 percent of GDP. Debt dynamics remain favorable, but the debt ratio would
be 2.0 percentage points higher than in the baseline by 2020.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

41

BELGIUM

Real exchange rate shock. This scenario assumes 15 percent devaluation in the real
exchange rate in 2015. This shock results in a slight decrease in debt and gross financing
needs ratios through the inflation channel.
Primary balance shock. This scenario examines the implications of a revenue shock and a
rise in interest rates leading to a cumulative 2.1 percentage points of GDP deterioration in
the primary balance (one standard deviation shock) in 2015–16. This scenario illustrates risks
of delayed fiscal adjustment, due to insufficient adjustment measures. This shock leads to a
deterioration in the debt ratio of 2.2 percentage points relative to the baseline in 2019 and
slightly higher gross financing needs.
Combined macro-fiscal scenario. This scenario aggregates shocks to real growth, the
interest rate, the exchange rate, and the primary balance while taking care not to doublecount the effects of individual shocks. Under this scenario, debt would reach 113.5 percent of
GDP in 2017 and remaining close to 110 percent of GDP until 2020. The impact on financing
needs would be significant, raising them to an average of 19.3 percent of GDP in 2016–20.
Contingent fiscal shock. This scenario assumes that 50 percent of state guarantees to the
financial sector are called upon in 2016. While the debt and financing needs impact is large,
the nature of state guarantees is such that they are unlikely to be exercised to such a degree
within the same year. Moreover, the Belgian state could cover some of these costs by
disposing of assets available for sale, which are valued at 9.4 percent of GDP.
Economic stagnation scenario. This scenario assumes nominal GDP growth will stagnate
throughout the projection period at 1.5 percent, i.e., annual real growth of 1 percent and
inflation of 0.5 percent throughout the 2016–20 period. Under this scenario, debt would inch
up every year by an average of 0.7 percent of GDP to reach 110.0 percent of GDP in 2020.
Similarly, gross financing needs would remain on average above 20 percent of GDP, rising to
20.0 percent of GDP in 2017.
Deflation scenario. This scenario assumes real GDP growth will stagnate throughout the
projection period with annual growth of 0.5 percent and inflation at zero percent. Under this
scenario, debt would increase by an average of 2.9 percent of GDP each year to
reach 121.0 percent of GDP in 2020. Gross financing needs would remain on average above
20 percent of GDP, peaking at 21.5 percent of GDP in 2017.

Belgium: Financial System Stability Assessment, including Reports
on the Observance of Standards and Codes on the following topics:
Banking Supervision and Regulation, and Insurance Supervision
and Regulation

IMF Country Report
No. 13/124

Summary: During the 2013 FSAP Update, staff assessed progress with the implementation of the
2006 FSAP recommendations. The report outlines that the authorities have made progress in
addressing the recommendations of the 2006 FSAP but many recommendations in the area of
conglomerate supervision and governance remain relevant. The new institutional model is a work in
progress and better communication and coordination between supervisory institutions is needed.
Improvements are evident in the intensity of banking supervision and the adoption of analytical
tools to support system-wide monitoring, including the introduction of an intensive process for
determining Pillar II capital requirements, liquidity stress testing for the banking sector, and
introduction of macrofinancial risk dashboard to monitor systemic and emerging risk. Funding and
risk management standards are being improved. Supervisory tools for monitoring group-wide risks
need to be upgraded. The crisis management framework, while updated for handling systemic firms,
is in need of a further upgrade owing in part to EU-wide developments.
Insurance supervision has been significantly strengthened although further work is needed,
particularly, in strengthening the solvency framework. Both bank and insurance supervisory
frameworks integrate vertical analyses of individual insurers with horizontal review of the sector. The
adoption of the new institutional architecture has allowed the FSMA to focus solely on market and
business conduct and the adoption of EU directives in the interim has addressed many of the
recommendations for the securities sector. The FSMA’s plan to adopt a risk-based approach to
conduct supervision must be adequately resourced. Pension regulation and supervision has been
strengthened. While pension funds remain the remit of the FSMA, there is currently a debate as to
whether this should be the responsibility of the NBB.

Belgium: Report on Observance of Standards and Codes—Fiscal
Transparency Module

IMF Country Report
No. 08/116

Summary: The report found that in many areas Belgium meets, and in some cases exceeds, the
requirements of the fiscal transparency code. The basic government finance processes are
supported by a sound institutional and legal framework. Roles and responsibilities in the budget
process are clear, with a well-defined separation of powers between the executive and legislature.
Fiscal information is provided through regular publications and extensive use of the internet. Budget
formulation is appropriately supported by medium-term macroeconomic forecasts and clearly
formulated medium-term fiscal policy goals, and fiscal policy is presented clearly, and in a mediumterm context. Finally, audit processes are extensive and help improve budget management
decisions, practices and standards, with government financial decisions evaluated ex ante and ex
post by various institutions.
There is room to improve the quality and openness of budget processes: (i) there is limited insight
about the objectives and targets of government expenditure; (ii) the medium-term budget estimates
need to make budgetary decision-making more oriented to the medium-term; (iii) the presentation
of new policy measures and their medium-term costs could be clarified; (iv) and budget
implementation by departments and agencies could be streamlined. Information available to the
public on the following topics could be increased: (i) fiscal risk and tax expenditures in budget
documents; (ii) in-year budgetary data on local government and agencies; (iii) the content of the
final government accounts; and (iv) the governance of state-owned equity holdings.
Institutional arrangements for fiscal policy coordination could be strengthened by (i) reinforcing and
expanding the role of the High Council of Finance, including by providing additional institutional
safeguards as to its continuity and independence, and having the Council cover all important issues
bearing on fiscal policy; and (ii) converting the budget agreements between the federal government,
regions, and communities into published agreements which specify the targeted balance for each
partner and identify the measures needed to achieve this target.
Finally, internal audit processes could be better coordinated and simplified by reducing the number
of internal control and audit layers—which makes the Court of Audit’s recent Single Audit initiative
to minimize overlap, coordinate work programs, and to share common data and analysis,
particularly timely.

Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT):
Belgium’s AML/CFT framework was last assessed in July 2014. The assessment was conducted by the
Financial Action Task Force (FATF) against the 2012 FATF standard using the 2013 assessment
methodology, both of which place greater emphasis on the effectiveness of AML/CFT measures in
mitigating the money laundering and terrorist financing risks. The evaluation report is scheduled to
be discussed during the FATF February 2015 plenary meeting. A previous assessment conducted in
2005 found Belgium’s AML/CFT framework to be largely compliant with the former standard,
although shortcomings were identified. The authorities appear to have addressed some of these
deficiencies, including by reinforcing the framework for the freezing of terrorist assets (in 2006) and
adopting a new AML/CFT law (in 2010). The latest assessment report, once adopted, will provide an
up-to-date picture of Belgium’s AML/CFT regime and identify measures for further improvement.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Belgium’s economic and financial statistics are adequate for surveillance purposes. The
National Bank of Belgium (NBB) regularly publishes a full range of economic and financial data and
provides calendar dates of main statistical releases. On-line access to these comprehensive
databases is facilitated by the NBB’s data search engine, Belgostat. Belgium is a SDDS subscriber.
Statistics for International Financial Statistics on banking institutions and monetary aggregates are
prepared on a monthly basis and are timely.
Belgium adopted the European System of Integrated Economic Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010)
in 2014. Revisions of national accounts were released in September, 2014, to comply with
EUROSTAT requirements to provide national accounts statistics in ESA 2010. Unlike in other
countries, the central bank is responsible for compiling national accounts statistics. Quarterly
accounts are published within a lag of three months. Both annual and quarterly accounts data are of
good quality, with shortcomings mainly related to export and import deflators, which are based on
unit values, rather than prices collected directly from exporters and importers.
Belgium compiles and publishes a complete set of general government accounts on an accrual
basis (ESA 2010). The NBB publishes annual and quarterly data on general government revenue,
expenditure, and net lending/ borrowing; transactions in financial assets and liabilities and a
financial balance sheet data; and details on the consolidated gross debt.
The overall quality and availability of financial indicators are good. The authorities are
providing quarterly updates of financial sector indicators (FSIs) in a timely manner.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Belgium

On March, 2, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Belgium.
The economy has shown considerable resilience but the outlook is weighed down by weak
demand in Europe. Healthy private balance sheets, integration with Germany, and employment
support schemes have helped sustain employment and economic activity. However, output is still
well below potential and with, subdued growth prospects, job creation remains insufficient.
The critical domestic policy challenges are preserving competitiveness and addressing the
looming fiscal cost of ageing. The wage policies of the previous government reversed in part a
loss in cost competitiveness relative to main trading partners, but the economy has also been
losing ground in terms of innovation and productivity growth. Age-related government spending
is projected to increase sizably by 2040 (an added annual cost of 6 percent of GDP). This reflects
the combination of demographics and a low effective age of retirement.
The new federal government has announced ambitious reforms to address these challenges. Its
focus is on improving competitiveness through temporary de-indexation of wages and a modest
shift of taxation away from labor, and activating working age population by tightening eligibility
to pension, pre-pension and unemployment benefits. The program should be complemented by
reforms to increase productivity growth and employment creation, by opening sheltered sectors
to competition, lowering the cost of regulation, increasing labor market flexibility and improving
education and professional training.
Fiscal adjustment is expected to resume after a pause in 2014. The pace of adjustment targeted
by the authorities for 2015–16 is appropriate given the level of debt and related risks. It is
underpinned by pro-growth expenditure measures, which should enhance its sustainability.
Coordination between the levels of government still needs strengthening across a range of issues.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every
year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's
economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for
discussion by the Executive Board.

2
Banks need to adapt further to a challenging operational environment of low growth and low
interest rates, and a more demanding regulatory framework. The banking sector fared relatively
well by the ECB’s comprehensive assessment, but additional efforts will be needed toward Basel
III capital standards.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They welcomed the authorities’
economic program and its emphasis on fiscal adjustment, competitiveness, and labor market
activation. Directors agreed that achievement of the program’s objectives would also require
sustaining the momentum of labor and product market reforms to foster productivity growth and
the economy’s long-term prospects.
Directors supported the government’s plans to speed up fiscal consolidation to safeguard debt
sustainability. They welcomed the shift to an expenditure-based adjustment strategy, given
Belgium’s already high level of public spending and taxation. In this regard, Directors were
encouraged by the planned reduction in labor taxes, and saw scope for further rebalancing the tax
burden away from taxes on labor income toward indirect and environmental taxes, and taxes on
capital income. More broadly, they advised enhanced coordination among federal, regional and
community governments on fiscal and other shared economic policies.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ actions to raise employment rates by reforming pension, preretirement, and unemployment benefits. Such actions build on past success in raising the
employment of older workers, and are critically important given Belgium’s structurally low
employment and population aging.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ measures to promote external competitiveness and job
growth by better aligning wage and productivity developments. In addition to wage moderation,
they recommended further boosting productivity by opening sheltered sectors to competition and
reducing the regulatory burden, including in the services economy; facilitating job creation
through more flexible contract arrangements; and strengthening the quality of education, training
and apprenticeship schemes.
Directors acknowledged the considerable efforts undertaken to repair bank balance sheets. They
welcomed the passage of the new banking law and other regulatory reforms put in place to
reduce risks associated with universal banking and to strengthen the resolution framework. They
nonetheless stressed the need for continued adjustment of banks’ business models, and called for

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

heightened vigilance in the supervision of the financial sector, given the challenging operating
