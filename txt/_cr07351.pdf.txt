INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
RUSSIAN FEDERATION
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2007 Consultation
with the Russian Federation
Approved by Michael Deppler and Michael Hadjimichael
July 13, 2007
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The authorities are considering a further fiscal relaxation that, together with the already approved 2007
budget, will increase the non-oil deficit by 2¼–3¼ percent of GDP through 2009. This implies that most
of Russia’s remaining terms-of-trade windfall will be spent, and that Russia’s twin fiscal and currentaccount surpluses will disappear within 2–3 years—having amounted to 8½–10 percent only last year.
With private demand gaining strength and GDP growth close to potential, staff cautioned that the
additional fiscal stimulus would accelerate real appreciation, and add to the nominal appreciation
necessary for inflation to be kept on track. Noting the authorities’ renewed focus on stabilizing the
exchange rate, staff was concerned that the relaxation risked aggravating the inconsistency between
inflation and exchange rate targets. While the authorities agreed that pressures would increase, they felt
that they would remain manageable, and noted that cyclical considerations had to be weighed against the
need to fund programs fostering long-term growth.
Staff argued that the planned fiscal relaxation would likely eliminate the remaining undervaluation of the
ruble over the next few years, leaving little room for additional loss of competitiveness. This pointed to
the risk of fiscally induced overshooting of the real exchange rate, especially if above-trend oil prices add
to spending pressures over and above what was discussed with the mission.
The authorities noted that the new fiscal framework for saving oil revenues will entail large spending cuts
in 2010-11, reflecting a continued determination to prevent a future drop in oil prices from forcing a
procyclical tightening. Staff welcomed this, but questioned the back-loading, noting that it would be
challenging to save up to 2 percent of GDP in the run-up to the 2011 elections, especially since
efficiency-enhancing reforms have stalled and pressures for social transfers remain strong. The authorities
agreed that progress with public-sector reforms would be key to expenditure control.
Staff argued that keeping inflation on target would require returning to a more flexible exchange rate.
Record-high interventions, prompted by surging capital inflows, have led to a sharp acceleration in
money growth in recent months that is inconsistent with the inflation target. Added exchange rate
flexibility would also discourage speculative capital inflows. The authorities resisted calls for such
flexibility, arguing that they would regain control over money growth through increased reserve
requirements and that capital inflows would decline, having been boosted by large one-off inflows.
Financial-sector discussions were concerned with regulatory and legislative obstacles to further
development. Discussions on long-term growth focused on the need to raise investment, as the scope for
catch-up gains in productivity will eventually diminish.

I. BACKGROUND
A. The Long-Term Perspective
1.
High oil prices, a strong catch-up potential, and sound fiscal policy underlie
Russia’s long spell of robust growth. Double-digit terms-of-trade gains annually since
2003, reinforced by rapidly developing financial markets and much-improved access to
foreign borrowing, have underpinned strong investment growth, punctured only by a soft
spot in late 2004 in the wake of turmoil in the oil and banking sectors. However, this growth
notwithstanding, the level of investment has remained low, and capital and labor have
accounted for less than half

B. Recent Economic Developments
2.
GDP growth has strengthened and become better balanced (Table 1). Growth
accelerated to 7.9 percent (year-on-year) in the first quarter of 2007, and high-frequency
indicators suggest undiminished momentum in the second quarter. The acceleration took
place even as oil prices fell from mid-2006 highs; in part because of the strong automatic
fiscal stabilizer embedded in the oil stabilization fund, which absorbs about 85 percent of the
fluctuations in revenues when oil prices change. Recent output growth reflects a pickup in

4
investment, suggesting that growth is becoming better
balanced. Consumption remains, however, the main
engine, spurred by annual increases in real incomes of
more than 10 percent. Higher growth also reflects
further fiscal relaxation.

constraints. In line with this, standard output gap analysis—which is subject to notable
conceptual and statistical problems in a structurally changing economy like Russia’s—also
suggests that GDP is close to potential.

increases compared to
previous years, an effect that accounted for about half of the decline in headline inflation in
2006. The slowdown was also a reflection of lower tradable-price inflation, as a change in
exchange rate policy allowed a modest appreciation of the ruble in nominal effective
terms―a notable break from the previous policy, which geared the CBR’s foreign exchange
interventions toward ensuring a steady depreciation of the ruble. The recent uptick in
inflation has followed the return to a less flexible exchange rate policy since mid-2006.

The ruble is still undervalued in real
terms, but competitiveness is eroding.
Estimates using the Fund’s standardized
CGER approach suggest that the ruble is
undervalued by 20 percent according to the
external-sustainability approach and by
1 percent according to the macro-balance
approach, implying a mid-point
undervaluation of about 10 percent. This
compares with the degree of undervaluation
of 15 percent estimated last year. This
weakening of competitiveness is confirmed
by indices of relative unit-labor costs,
which have increased steadily and are now
estimated to be above the level just before
the 1998 financial crisis. Nonetheless, staff
estimates suggest that wages in Russia are
still competitive internationally.1 So, while
profit margins are facing increasing
pressure, competitiveness is not yet a major
concern—non-primary commodity
exporters have maintained their market
share and annual growth in the
manufacturing sector is robust at 5–7
percent.

Staff estimates of the international competitiveness of Russian wages are based on a cross-country panel

equilibrium wage is estimated as a function of various measures of productivity and income, including per
capita GDP, human capital, share of agriculture, and institutional indicators.

rapidly rising incomes. Another important
development is the surge in overseas
borrowing by banks to fund their domestic
loan portfolios, reflecting an arbitrage
opportunity created by high domestic
lending rates and expectations of continued
ruble strength. Large share issuances by
two state-owned banks boosted capital
inflows in the first quarter of 2007.

Russia’s external vulnerability is low by most measures, but nongovernment
indebtedness is rising rapidly. From end-2004 to end-2006, the government’s
external indebtedness dropped from $106 billion to $49 billion, while that of the
nongovernment sector rose from $109 billion to $261 billion. This reflects, in part,
large-scale foreign borrowing by state-controlled firms (Tables 3 and 4).

The relaxation reflects higher recurrent expenditures and a decline in social
contributions. Federal primary spending increased by 2¾ percentage points of GDP during
2005–07, mostly because of higher recurrent expenditures in the social and security sectors.
A substantial part of this increase was due to higher transfers to extrabudgetary social funds,
notably to the pension fund, which saw a sharp deterioration in its financial position as a

Monetary policy has become more accommodative with the CBR’s resumption
of a fixed nominal exchange rate policy. Against a backdrop of rapid real appreciation and
increasing political concerns about competitiveness, the CBR has been resisting further
nominal appreciation of the ruble vis-à-vis a EUR-U.S. dollar basket since mid-2006. This
represents a reversal of the policy introduced in early 2005, wherein the CBR had been
allowing some, albeit limited, appreciation. The return to a fixed exchange rate has been
associated with a surge in capital inflows, record-high interventions, and a sharp acceleration
in base money growth, to 41 percent through April

the stabilization fund, to the capital account.
10.
Growth in broad money and bank credits is accelerating sharply. Broad money
growth (including foreign currency deposits) reached 48 percent by April (year-on-year)—
and growth of ruble broad money was even faster at 57 percent, reflecting continued
stagnation in foreign-currency denominated deposits. The rapid de-dollarization is also
evident from further large cash sales of foreign exchange by households.
11.
Rapid credit growth is fueled by ample liquidity and structural changes in the
financial sector. Increased liquidity in the banking system has been reflected in real credit
growth of close to 40 percent year-on-year―from a low base. Consumer lending is growing
particularly fast, reflected in the rising share of household loans in newly extended credit,
from 20 percent in 2003 to 33 percent in 2006. Rapid credit growth is also a result of ongoing
structural changes in the financial sector, as discussed in Box 1.
12.
Banks’ financial soundness indicators are strong, but weaknesses remain in the
banking system and in supervision (Table 8). Bank profits have surged, boosted by wide
interest-rate margins and high credit growth; aggregate NPL ratios are low; and liquidity
buffers remain relatively high. However, NPL and loan concentration ratios are believed to
be underreported as the financial sector continues to be plagued by poor prudential data,
limited transparency, and weak governance, as discussed below. In addition, concentration of
ownership is high and connected lending is a concern.

II. THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK
13.
The backdrop to the near-term outlook is stable. According to WEO projections,
Russia is facing a small terms-of-trade loss in 2007—following four years of double-digit
annual gains—but this loss will be largely absorbed through lower savings in the stabilization
fund. The favorable outlook for emerging markets, and widely held expectations of policy
continuity after the presidential elections, also suggest a relatively stable environment. It is
noteworthy in this regard that investment growth accelerated and capital inflows surged last
year; even as oil prices receded significantly from mid-2006 highs, President Putin confirmed
his intention to leave office, and the government further expanded its control over the energy
sector. This resilience in investment growth suggests that investor sentiments are relatively
robust, and that downside risks to the near-term outlook, in particular from lower oil prices,
are limited.
14.
Real GDP growth is expected to remain strong and resource constraints to
tighten further (Table 9). On the strength of buoyant investment growth, and with scope for
further TFP gains, potential GDP growth is expected to continue at its recent pace. However,
demand is likely to accelerate in 2007. This

financial sector, reinforced by sustained
large capital inflows, to add further strength
to private demand, not least because the rapidly expanding market for consumer credits
provides households with a newfound ability to consume against expected future income
gains. In view of this, staff projects GDP growth to continue at 7 percent, above the
consensus forecast of 6.6 percent, and demand pressures to increase with an attendant
tightening of resource constraints. As to 2008, growth is expected to remain robust on the
assumption of additional fiscal stimulus and slightly higher oil prices. Accordingly, staff
projects continued real appreciation and rapid import growth in 2007–08. The current
account surplus is expected to decline from almost 10 percent of GDP in 2006 to nearbalance in 2009. This reflects in part a steady fall in the non-energy balance because of rapid
import growth and a low base for non-primary commodity exports. But it also reflects the
decline in energy exports relative to GDP, as oil prices are assumed to remain largely
unchanged while energy output is not expected to regain its previous buoyancy.
15.
Inflationary pressures are set to remain strong. Against a backdrop of robust
demand growth and plans to gradually raise domestic energy prices starting next year,
upward pressures on prices will remain strong. In staff’s view, achieving even the relatively
slow decline in inflation targeted by the authorities during the remainder of 2007 and 2008
will require a change in policies, including additional nominal appreciation.

10
III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
16.
Macroeconomic discussions focused on tensions in the policy mix arising from
envisaged further relaxations of fiscal policy in the face of tightening resource
constraints and the fixed exchange rate policy. The discussions took place amid the
preparation of a supplementary 2007 budget that foresee a further large fiscal relaxation and
could entail small fiscal and current account deficits within 2–3 years, down from surpluses
of 8½–10 percent of GDP only last year, even with broadly unchanged oil prices. The
discussions addressed in particular conflicts between short-term cyclical considerations and
the medium-term objective of using oil revenues to boost potential growth and ensure a more
equitable income distribution. They also coincided with increased concerns within the CBR
of the implications for monetary policy of surging capital inflows.
17.
The erosion of competitiveness is increasingly bearing on macroeconomic
policies. According to staff projections, the real exchange rate appreciation will—in the
absence of further fiscal relaxation—slow gradually to 3–5 percent over the medium term, a
pace that would be broadly in line with Balassa-Samuelson-type effects. However, the
planned fiscal relaxation would mean that the appreciation would continue at a 7–9 percent
rate. Thus, staff projections suggest that the further fiscal relaxation will mostly eliminate the
remaining undervaluation of the ruble over the next few years, leaving the exchange rate
around its equilibrium level by 2009. However, the pace at which the undervaluation is set to
unwind and the possibility that the large catch-up gains in productivity might begin to wane
faster than expected, even as demand pressures fuel fast appreciation and high wage growth,
all point to increasing downside risks. This is especially the case for manufacturing, which
although still growing at a satisfactory pace, is already underperforming the nontradable
sector. In view of this, much of the discussion of medium-term issues focused on the risk that
an even faster fiscal relaxation than discussed with the mission would cause overshooting of
the real exchange rate.
A. Fiscal Policy
18.
The authorities are considering a fiscal relaxation over the next few years that—
under the current outlook for oil prices—would allow most of the remainder of the oil
revenue windfall to be passed through to

authorizations by an additional 2¼ percent of
GDP, to be distributed over the next three to
four years. With this, the planned expansion in the non-oil deficit over 2007–09 would reach
3.2 percent of GDP if the amounts authorized under the approved 2007 and three-year
budgets are fully spent and the borrowing margin under the new fiscal framework is fully
exploited. Ministry of Finance officials indicated that they were intending to limit borrowing

11
and to resist pressures to spend the reserves, and thereby aiming to limit the increase in the
non-oil deficit to 2¼ percent of GDP.2 Other officials, however, suggested that the non-oil
deficit would increase to the full extent of what is permitted within the newly approved
framework. This appears realistic in the light of past and present pressures to increase
spending. As regards the overall balance, the stabilization of oil prices and oil-sector output
will cause oil revenues to decline by 4 percentage points relative to GDP, resulting in a
decline in the headline surplus from 7½ percent of GDP in 2006 to near-balance in 2009. On
staff estimates, the oil price at which the budget would be balanced is set to increase from
less than $30 per barrel (Urals) in 2006 (when the actual price was $61 per barrel) to $55–62
per barrel by 2009 (when the price is projected to be $61 per barrel, according to the WEO).
19.
Staff cautioned that the planned increase in the non-oil deficit would increase
upward pressures on prices and the ruble. Noting that inflationary pressures were already
strong, as the economy is growing at close to potential and private demand is strengthening,
staff argued that additional fiscal stimulus would likely increase pressures for nominal
appreciation if inflation is to be kept on a downward path. It would also increase pressure for
real appreciation, as increased demand drives up prices for nontradable goods. In this regard,
staff noted that concern about competitiveness appeared to have been the foremost reason for
the return to a policy of resisting appreciation, and that this policy change was leading to a
rate of growth in money supply that is incompatible with the inflation target. Further fiscal
relaxation, therefore, would exacerbate existing tensions in the macroeconomic policy mix
and aggravate the inconsistency between inflation and exchange rate targets. With the risk
that large capital inflows might significantly exacerbate such pressures, staff felt that a more
cautious fiscal approach was warranted. It recommended that the authorities delay increasing
spending until the economy could absorb this spending without undue pressure on prices.
Under the current outlook, this suggests that there should be no increase in the non-oil deficit
in the remainder of 2007 and in 2008, beyond that envisaged in the approved 2007 budget.
20.
Ministry of Finance officials felt that the macroeconomic pressures would be
manageable, and noted that the government needed to strike a trade-off between
cyclical considerations and the need to fund programs fostering long-term growth. They
shared staff’s view that the planned additional fiscal stimulus would likely require
accelerated ruble appreciation if inflation is to be kept within target. They also stressed,
however, that the supplementary 2007 budget would target investments and projects expected
to boost long-term growth. They pointed to various infrastructure and housing projects,
research programs, and investments in aluminum, petrochemical, nuclear power, and other
priority sectors. Responding to concerns that some of these activities lie outside the normal
purview of government, and to broader concerns about the efficiency of such spending
considering that public sector reforms are not well advanced, the authorities noted that
2

The staff’s estimate assumes that the unallocated reserve appropriation equal to 5 percent of total spending is
actually spent and that the government makes full use of the annual borrowing of up to 1 percent of GDP
permitted under the new fiscal framework (see Box 2). The Ministry assumes that not all of the reserve
allocation would be spent and that no additional spending would be approved that would require borrowing
above the currently envisaged 0.6 percent of GDP.

12
spending efficiency in several areas would be strengthened through extensive use of Public
Private Partnerships. While they had advocated a somewhat slower pace of fiscal relaxation,
Ministry of Finance officials felt that the compromise embodied in the supplementary budget
reflected an acceptable balance between short-term costs and medium-term benefits.
21.
Ministry of Finance officials also noted that the government remained
committed to increase saving of oil revenues over the medium term as set out in their
new budgetary framework. The increase in spending under the planned supplementary
budget was meant to be temporary; spending would subsequently have to be lowered by
about 2 percent of GDP in order to stay within the deficit ceilings for 2010–11, set out by the
new framework for saving of oil revenues. Thus, while the swelling of the stabilization fund
meant that there was no longer political support for continuing to save current oil revenues
on the same scale as before, the approval of this framework was evidence of a continued
political determination to prevent spending from increasing to a level where Russia could be
forced into a procyclical tightening in the case of a drop in oil prices.
22.
Staff welcomed these intentions, but questioned the feasibility of the mediumterm spending plans. The depositing of all future oil and gas revenues with a new fund
separated from the budget, the fixed annual transfer to the budget, and the cap on the
budget’s non-oil deficit would strengthen demand management and allow intergenerational
considerations to bear on spending decisions. However, implementation of the new
framework was to be back loaded to 2010–11, and spending would be allowed to increase
above the level implied by the new framework during the interim period. In this regard, staff
found that the assumed spending cut of 2 percent of GDP was ambitious, considering that the
federal government’s non-interest expenditures amount to only about 16 percent of GDP.
Staff also noted that much of the savings would have to come from socially difficult cuts in
education, health, and other social sectors in the run-up to the 2011 elections—and that
efficiency-enhancing reforms in these sectors had stalled. Indeed, staff was concerned that
the government would find it difficult to resist pressures for spending increases, considering
that important groups, notably pensioners, were not sharing in the rapid growth in incomes.
For instance, annual transfers to the pension fund would have to be gradually increased to
2-3 percent of GDP merely to stabilize the replacement rate at the already low level. In view
of these considerations, staff doubted that the assumed expenditure cuts underlying the new
framework could be achieved, unless the new government gave priority to reinvigorating
stalled efficiency-enhancing social sector reforms. Similarly, staff stressed that, without
strong public-sector and administrative reform, the efficacy of the authorities’ planned public
investment would be much reduced. Such reform would also be essential to ensure the full
benefits of public-private partnerships.
23.
Staff cautioned that, looking forward, failure to contain spending created risks
of procyclical tightening over the medium term. While it agreed that there was little risk at
this juncture, the speed with which the twin surpluses were set to unwind, in combination
with the continued rapid real appreciation, pointed to the risk of a fiscally induced
overshooting of the current account and real exchange rate unless the government is able to
resist continued expenditure increases. In this regard, while the ruble was still somewhat
undervalued, staff projections implied that the proposed fiscal relaxation would mostly
eliminate the remaining undervaluation, suggesting that any further relaxation in the face of

13
continued strong growth in private demand could take a serious toll on GDP growth and
export diversification. Staff also noted that the virtual stagnation of the oil sector was
heightening the risk of such overshooting, as this sector’s contributions to both taxes and
foreign exchange earnings are declining fast.
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
24.
CBR officials were confident that they could keep inflation on a downward
course. Despite the recent uptick, year-on-year inflation was still running below the 2007
end-year target of 8 percent. The acceleration in money growth in recent months, resulting
from surging capital inflows and record-high foreign exchange interventions, was a matter of
concern, and this had prompted the increase in reserve requirements. The CBR would
consider increasing such requirements further if necessary to reduce money growth.
Moreover, it expected capital inflows to decline as the recent surge largely reflected a series
of one-off transactions relating to mergers in the energy sector and to share issuances by the
two large state-owned banks.
25.
The nominal exchange rate was expected to remain broadly unchanged. CBR
officials explained that, while the rapid real appreciation had prompted increasing political
concerns about competitiveness, their decision last fall to return to a stable ruble had been
brought about by the finding that appreciation, by fueling expectations of continued
appreciation, was exacerbating capital inflows. Under the current outlook, they expected to
be able to keep the currency steady during the remainder of the year.
26.
Staff argued that keeping inflation on the targeted path would require returning
to a more flexible exchange rate policy. Noting that demand pressures were set to increase,
in light of the procyclical relaxation of fiscal policy, staff warned that stabilizing the
exchange rate would likely prevent the CBR from adopting an appropriately restrictive
monetary stance. Indeed, in staff’s view, the rapid growth in liquidity resulting from
interventions would, if unchecked, lead to an overshooting of the authorities’ inflation target,
suggesting that monetary policy was already overly accommodating. The staff urged the
CBR to swiftly reverse the upturn in inflation, pointing to the added cost of doing so once
inflationary expectations begin to rise. It saw no alternative means for reining in money
growth other than scaling back interventions and allowing the ruble to appreciate. In this
regard, staff argued that successive increases in reserve requirements would not be an
effective substitute for a more flexible exchange rate policy, if only because the consequent
increased spread between deposit and lending rates would encourage disintermediation. In
this context, staff agreed with the CBR on the need to further develop the bank’s marketbased instruments, and to deepen the domestic money market. Looking forward, this would
strengthen the relative effectiveness of the interest-rate channel and increase the flexibility of
lending rates.
27.
Staff noted that conflicting inflation and exchange-rate targets had exacerbated
capital inflows. Discussions with market participants showed that the surge in medium-term
capital inflows, in particular through the banking system, was in large part due to
expectations that a strong balance-of-payments position implied further appreciation over the
medium term. Thus, while the mission agreed that the slow-but-steady appreciation during

14
2005–06 had presented markets with a predictable exchange rate path, encouraging
speculators to make one-way bets, the current rigidity was likely to exacerbate arbitragerelated inflows, as the inconsistency between inflation and exchange-rate objectives became
more apparent. By signaling that monetary policy would remain firmly focused on inflation
reduction, with the exchange rate allowed to appreciate as needed to keep inflation on the
targeted path, the CBR would eliminate the apparent tension between these two goals, and so
reduce the scope for such inflows. Staff reiterated, however, that this tension would persist if,
at the same time as the ruble is allowed to appreciate, the planned fiscal relaxation
necessitated a tightening of monetary conditions so as not to accommodate attendant
inflationary pressures.
28.
There was agreement that the CBR is likely to face a gradually more challenging
environment in the coming years. This reflects, in part, the pressures associated with the
planned fiscal relaxation for 2007–09. Moreover, even if a more-flexible exchange rate
policy succeeds in reducing arbitrage-related flows, capital inflows would likely remain
substantial, not least through the equity market. For instance, the privatization of the
electricity sector and the anticipated consolidation of the banking system are both expected to
attract considerable foreign interest. In this regard, capital inflows pose a more difficult
challenge for monetary policy than oil-related current account inflows, as the latter are for
the most part automatically sterilized via the stabilization fund. Finally, whereas underlying
inflation has been masked by slower increases in administered prices over the past two years,
the government’s commitment to raise domestic energy prices over 2008–11 suggests that
administered prices will add to pressures on headline inflation. The estimated impact on
annual inflation ranged from ½ to 1½ percentage points.
C. Financial Sector
29.
The rapid development of the financial sector is expected to continue. CBR
officials noted that the deepening of financial markets and the introduction of new financial
products had improved the efficiency of financial intermediation and spurred economic
growth. They believed that the financial sector would continue to expand rapidly and that
current institutions, laws, and regulations governing the operation of the sector did not pose
major obstacles in this regard. Market participants, however, raised some concerns that
inconsistencies among different laws and different regulatory institutions were hampering
development in some areas, e.g., in offering hedging instruments, including derivatives. But
they agreed that these obstacles would not prevent a continued rapid expansion of the sector.
30.
Although CBR officials found the regulatory framework for prudential
supervision to be broadly complete, they saw scope for strengthening the effectiveness
of supervision. Regulators were confident that banks had generally updated their riskmanagement systems to keep pace with the expansion of credit, but they felt the loan review
practices could be strengthened further. Moreover, they were working to improve the
evaluation of capital adequacy and obtain more accurate assessments of the financial
soundness of individual banks. They were also exploring steps to clarify the responsibilities
of the various agencies charged with overseeing the financial sector, and enhance the skills of
banking supervisors to improve the capacity of prudential supervision.

15
31.
Despite some notable risks, CBR officials considered the likelihood of a systemic
crisis to be low. According to CBR stress testing, credit risk is significant and remains the
most important risk to the system. Under the bank’s less-severe scenario, combining effects
of credit, market, and liquidity shocks, capital in the banking system would drop by
38.7 percent or 2.5 percent of GDP, while under the most severe scenario the capital
reduction will be equal to 63.1 percent or 4.0 percent of GDP. Even under the more benign
scenario, a large number of institutions will lose over 50 percent of their capital, suggesting
substantial vulnerabilities in the financial system. However, the authorities stressed that
neither scenario is likely to materialize in the near future because of the overall positive
macroeconomic conditions. For a more-likely range of shocks, CBR officials found that
banks are generally well capitalized and sufficiently provisioned. As profitability in the
banking sector has also remained high, they considered the risk of a systemic crisis to be low,
although periods of turmoil as in 2004 could not be ruled out.
32.
Staff welcomed the rapid development of the financial sector, but warned that
the favorable external environment may be masking underlying vulnerabilities. Noting
that the rapid credit expansion by the banking system has resulted in declining
capital-adequacy ratios and an increase in overdue loans in 2006, especially household loans,
staff recommended close monitoring of banks with fast-growing or large household loan
portfolios. It also cautioned that potentially significant vulnerabilities arise from the rapid
increase in open positions, as banks have increasingly funded their ruble lending through
borrowing in foreign currency, as well as from the large increase in banks’ holdings of rubledenominated corporate bonds. Staff noted that these vulnerabilities are heightened by the
lack of access of many banks to either the interbank market or foreign funding, and by
weaknesses in Russia’s prudential framework and regulatory practices. While agreeing that
there appears to be no major systemic risk, staff stressed that a more in-depth review of
vulnerabilities should be a priority. The Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) update
that is now underway would provide an early opportunity for such a review.
D. Investment Climate, and Long-Term Growth Prospects
33.
There was agreement that the prospect of diminishing catch-up gains in
productivity, and of a declining labor force, made the long-term growth potential
particularly dependent on raising the low level of investment. The authorities concurred
with staff analysis showing that productivity gains have been the key engine of growth, with
the combined contribution from labor force growth and capital accumulation accounting for
less than half of GDP growth in recent years. It was also agreed that while there was scope
for continued high catch-up gains in productivity going forward, as the reform agenda
promises to further improve the allocation of existing factors of production, such gains would
eventually wane as Russia’s transition process matures. The authorities also noted that
relatively adverse demographic factors, notably the comparatively low life expectancy and
low birth rate, have caused the labor force to contract since 2006, further weighing on the
long-term growth potential. In view of these considerations, there was agreement on the
urgency of increasing Russia’s still low level of investment, and on the need for economic
policies to reinforce and strengthen the investment climate.

16
34.
The authorities were confident that recent changes in economic policy would
boost investments and raise long-term growth. In particular, the increase in government
interventions in the economy over the next few years, in the context of the supplementary
2007 budget, would help overcome infrastructure bottlenecks and increase investments
through public-private partnerships. Moreover, the funding of the long-dormant development
bank and the introduction of the venture capital fund, special economic zones, and an
institute for nanotechnology research would further promote economic diversification, not
least by encouraging growth in areas where Russia had a potentially strong comparative
advantage. The expanded role of government in this regard was needed because important
market structures were still relatively weak, including the ability of financial markets to
provide competitive, large-scale, long-term financing. In addition to these new initiatives, the
government would continue to push ahead with structural reforms across a broad front. In
particular, electricity sector reforms—involving separation of generation and transmission,
and privatization—are now gaining significant momentum.
35.
Staff welcomed the emphasis on raising investments but stressed the importance
of complementary reforms. It noted that many important reforms were running behind
schedule, and it urged a general reinvigoration of reforms after the forthcoming elections. It
also noted that Russia scores low on cross-country comparisons of the business climate, with
corruption and bureaucratic meddling the predominant complaint. This suggested that the
authorities should give priority to long-delayed reforms of the public administration and the
civil service. While acknowledging that investments have continued to increase, staff was
concerned that the increased state control over the energy sector could reduce investors’
willingness to undertake large-scale projects with a long gestation period. Noting that the
poor performance of the state-controlled portion of the energy sector stands in stark contrast
to the long-term performance of the privately controlled part, staff questioned whether the
state was the best steward of this important sector. While agreeing that the long-term goal
should clearly be to diversify the economy away from natural resources, staff argued that this
sector provides Russia with a strong comparative advantage and that its resources can help
spur growth if harnessed through the right policies.
36.
The authorities hope to complete WTO accession by early next year. However,
they explained that Russia has concluded most bilateral negotiations, but that a number of
bilateral issues still remained to be resolved before multilateral discussions on accession can
commence. Moreover, such discussions would have to cover issues like the level of
agricultural support and enforcement of intellectual property rights. Staff urged early
conclusion of the discussions, noting that Russia’s increased integration into the global
economy would spur further enterprise restructuring.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
37.
Russia’s macroeconomic performance continues to impress. Much is owed to high
oil prices and large capital inflows, but also to good economic management. Most important
in view of the dependence on oil prices, the stabilization fund is providing a notable measure
of stability, helping self-sustaining growth in the form of rising investments and a positive
nexus of high growth in productivity, real wages, and consumption to take hold. The

17
acceleration in investments, even with receding oil prices and uncertainty relating to political
transition, points to the robustness of investor sentiments at this time.
38.
Private demand is gathering additional momentum. Restructuring, consolidation
and privatization are gaining pace, powering a further acceleration in investment growth.
This process is getting significant added impetus from the rapid development of the financial
sector and the strong foreign appetite for Russian assets. Private consumption is also set to
strengthen going forward, as the rapid development of markets for consumer credits and
mortgages now provides households a newfound ability to consume against future income
gains. With such a buoyancy in private demand, resource constraints are set to become more
binding even with robust investment growth and impressive catch-up gains in productivity.
39.
Against this background, the planned fiscal relaxation risks causing overheating.
Raising the non-oil deficit by up to 3.2 percent of GDP in the next few years will provide an
unhelpful fiscal stimulus considering that private demand is gaining further strength and that
the economy is already growing at potential. This will increase inflationary pressures,
entailing rapid, possibly excessive, nominal appreciation. In staff’s view, increased spending
of oil revenues should be delayed until demand pressures ease. Under the current outlook,
this means that the non-oil deficit should not increase further during the remainder of 2007
and in 2008.
40.
The planned fiscal relaxation will also entail continued rapid real appreciation.
Faster real appreciation is the means through which buoyant private demand, not least
investments in the tradable sector, will be forced to make room for the public sector’s larger
claim on scarce resources, if the government goes ahead with the plan to pass-through most
of the remaining terms-of-trade gains in the form of higher government spending. Such a
dampening of the private sector recovery would run counter to the objective of boosting
growth that underlies the case for interventions in the economy.
41.
Margins of competitiveness are set to narrow further. As yet, competitiveness is
not a major concern, as the ruble is still undervalued and Russia enjoys a notable if
narrowing degree of competitiveness. However, the authorities’ fiscal plans, in combination
with strong private demand, will largely eliminate the remaining undervaluation of the ruble.
Downside risks in this regard arise from the possibility that catch-up gains in productivity—
which have so far limited the loss of competitiveness in tradable sectors as surging demand
for labor by nontradable sectors have pushed up wages—will begin to wane as demandinduced pressures continue to fuel appreciation and rapid wage growth. This points to the
urgency of reinvigorating structural reforms in order to unlock further productivity gains. It
also suggests that demand pressures over and above what is currently projected could begin
to take a considerable toll on manufacturing growth and export diversification.
42.
In the context of narrowing freedom of action, additional fiscal relaxation would
significantly increase risks of procyclical tightening and of the real exchange rate
overshooting its long-term path. There is little risk of a procyclical tightening now—large
reserves and low indebtedness leave considerable scope for deficit financing. However, the
rise in the balanced-budget oil price, from about $30 per barrel last year to $55–60 per barrel
by 2009, illustrates the speed at which margins for maneuver are narrowing. The very fast

18
unwinding of the twin surpluses that is in store points to the risk of fiscally induced
overshooting of the real exchange rate if above-trend oil prices make it difficult for the
government to resist pressures for further relaxation over and above what was discussed with
the mission.
43.
This points to the urgency of controlling expenditures. The new framework for
spending oil revenues is close to best practice for management of natural resource wealth.
But its credibility is undermined by the large back-loaded spending cuts it assumes, not least
considering that large transfers to the pension fund are needed to avoid a socially
unacceptable drop in the replacement rate. In view of this, realizing significant expenditure
savings in socially sensitive areas in 2010–11, the run-up to elections, will be difficult
without a reinvigoration of efficiency-enhancing social sector reforms.
44.
Besides the risks of overheating, the planned interventions in the economy also
raise questions about the efficiency of spending. In some areas, the interventions go
outside the normal purview of government. More generally, the limited progress with regard
to public-administration and civil-service reforms, and Russia’s low score in international
comparisons of corruption and rent seeking, raise questions about the efficiency of large
interventions. While there certainly is a case for government support of infrastructure and
basic research, and while the authorities are seeking safeguards against waste, a more
cautious approach to interventions in the economy has served Russia well in the past. The
increasing dynamism of the private sector suggests that priority should be given to unlocking
this sector’s full potential by reducing government interference in the economy. Any scope
for higher spending should primarily be directed toward improving infrastructure,
overcoming problems in providing basic public services, and alleviating social problems
associated with rapid economic transformation.
45.
Turning to monetary policy, the renewed policy of maintaining a stable exchange
rate threatens to undo gains in reducing inflation. The sharp increase in money growth in
recent months as a result of record-high foreign exchange intervention is inconsistent with
keeping inflation on track. Staff believes that the CBR should return to a policy of giving
priority to inflation reduction, standing ready to allow appreciation as needed to keep
inflation on target. In this regard, frequent changes in reserve requirements are not an
effective substitute for a flexible exchange rate policy, as it tends to encourage
disintermediation and discourage savings. To avoid entrenching inflation expectations,
adopting a more flexible exchange rate policy is a matter of some urgency.
46.
Inconsistent exchange rate and inflation targets are fueling capital inflows.
Markets expect that the policy of resisting appreciation will eventually have to give way in
order to keep control of inflation. This exacerbates capital inflows, further undermining
control over money growth and inflation. By signaling that it will give priority to inflation
reduction and allow appreciation if needed, the CBR would discourage speculative capital
flows. However, much of the capital inflows are strategic in nature and so are relatively
insensitive to monetary conditions. These flows are likely to increase in the coming years. To
the extent that such inflows add to demand pressures, they are best offset through fiscal
policy.

19
47.
The rapid development of the financial sector is much welcomed, but financial
sector vulnerabilities are rising. Competitive forces unleashed by access to international
capital markets and entrance of foreign players are causing rapid deepening and broadening
of financial markets. But the associated pace of credit growth will place a premium on
effective supervision and prudential regulation. The rapid increase in banks’ consumer
lending, holding of ruble-denominated corporate bonds, and open foreign exchange positions
should be kept under close review. Vulnerabilities continue to be heightened by the lack of
access of many banks to the interbank market, and add urgency to the need to further
strengthen Russia’s prudential framework and regulatory practices. The Financial Sector
Assessment Program update now underway with a joint Fund-Bank expert team will provide
an opportunity for an early in-depth review of vulnerabilities and regulatory practices.
48.
Improving the investment climate is the main long-term challenge. Despite the
increases in recent years, the level of investments remains relatively low. Moreover, Russia
scores poorly in international comparisons of the investment climate. The limited progress
with regard to important reforms—not least, civil service, public administration, and legal
reforms—has been of limited consequence so far because high oil prices and the still strong
catch-up potential have entailed robust growth. To maintain such growth as the scope for
catch-up gains begins to wane, it should be a priority for the new government coming into
the office after the elections to reinvigorate such reforms.
49.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Box 1. The Increasing Role of Financial Markets in Economic Growth
Russia’s financial sector is expanding at a rapid clip.
Measured by assets, the sector as a whole has increased to
more than 150 percent of GDP as of end 2006.
The growing economic importance of the sector is
reflected in the rising share of investment that is being
financed with debt.

•

The share of bank loans in investment grew steadily
from 5 percent in 2003 to almost 9 percent in 2006,
although the bulk of bank lending remains short-term
(less than three years).

•

The corporate bond market is expanding rapidly and financed 6–9 percent of investments in 2006, up from
virtually nil in 2003. The supply of funds in the corporate bond market is driven by ample liquidity in the
banking system, an expanding base of domestic
institutional investors, and increasing foreign

1/ In percent of household income

Rapidly-growing household credit has supported the consumption boom.
•

Household credit grew at an average rate of more than 100 percent a year, during the past three years, as
banks rapidly increased their exposure to retail lending. Consumer credit expanded especially fast, reaching
almost 12 percent of household income (16 percent of consumption) in 2006. Although growth in consumer
credit has moderated somewhat recently, it is still growing at 75 percent year-on-year. Besides saturation in
some market segments, the slowdown reflects in part that concerns about loan quality have caused a
tightening of lending standards.

•

The mortgage market remains small, financing only about 5 percent of all real estate transactions, and is
mostly serving relatively high-income households. Nevertheless, the market is expanding steadily,
supported by increasing competition among banks and recently introduced refinancing instruments.

21

Box 2. The Budget Framework—Issues and Recent Developments
The new budget framework entails the creation of a second oil fund, the introduction of three-year
budgets, and steps towards performance budgeting. From 2008, the existing oil stabilization fund
(OSF) will be capped at 10 percent of GDP. It will continue to be invested in highly liquid securities and
serve as a buffer for the budget against a drop in the oil price. Once the OSF reaches 10 percent of GDP,
additional oil revenues will be accumulated in a new National Welfare Fund which will invest in higheryielding securities. The institutional arrangements for the management of these funds are currently being
discussed. Another important innovation is the introduction of three-year rolling budgets for the federal
government and the federal extrabudgetary funds, the first of which have already been adopted for 2008–
10. Moreover, in a gradual move towards performance budgeting, the government has started to include
performance indicators in the federal budget covering 70 percent of expenditure.
The changes could substantially improve demand management. A key innovation in this regard is
the introduction of the concept of the non-oil balance, which will be capped at a deficit of 4.7 percent of
GDP starting in 2011. Of this deficit, up to 3.7 percent of GDP may be financed from oil and gas
revenues, which under the new framework will also encompass the extraction and export taxes on
natural gas and oil products, while the cutoff price will be abolished. A remaining deficiency in the new
framework is that the corporate income tax and dividend revenues from oil, as well as the extraction tax
revenues accruing to the regional governments, will remain excluded from the stabilization fund
mechanism and accrue to the budget as non-oil revenue. The envisaged transfer of oil revenue of
3.7 percent of GDP to the budget is consistent with the calculations of the optimal level of spending of
oil and gas revenues based on an intergenerational framework discussed in Chapter I of the 2006
Selected Issues Paper.

2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0) and rising inflation
(based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP
growth rate,
ε = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and α = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.

Real GDP growth (in percent)
GDP deflator in US dollars (change in percent)
Nominal external interest rate (in percent)
Growth of exports (U.S. dollar terms, in percent)
Growth of imports (U.S. dollar terms, in percent)
Current account balance, excluding interest payments

APPENDIX I. RUSSIAN FEDERATION: FUND RELATIONS
(As of May 31, 2007)
•

Article IV consultation discussions were held in Moscow during May 14–25, 2007. The
mission met with Deputy Prime Minister Zhukov, Minister of Finance Kudrin, Central
Bank of Russia Deputy Governor Ulyukaev, other senior officials, members of the Duma,
representatives of the business and academic communities, and the press.

•

The staff team comprised Mr. Thomsen (head), Messrs. Takizawa, Tiffin, and Zebregs,
Ms. Ivaschenko (all EUR), Mr. Hauner (FAD), and Mr. Sadikov (PDR), and was assisted
by Mr. Mates (Moscow Office). Mr. Mozhin, Executive Director for Russia, participated in
the discussions.

•

During the last Article IV Consultation discussions, concluded on October 18, 2006,
Directors commended the strong performance of the Russian economy. However, in light
of the buoyancy of demand and still strong inflationary pressures, they recommended that
fiscal policy not be loosened further. They welcomed the improved inflation performance,
but cautioned that more exchange rate flexibility would be needed for the progress to be
consolidated. Stressing that long-run growth prospects depended on accelerating the
implementation of structural reforms and strengthening the investment climate, directors
were concerned about the slow pace of reforms.

•

Russia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. The restriction on
current account transactions identified at the time of the 2005 Article IV consultation has
been removed as part of Russia’s liberalization of the capital account. Russia, therefore,
maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers
for current international transactions.

•

Russia’s statistical database is adequate for surveillance, albeit with some shortcomings
(Appendix III). Russia subscribed to the SDDS in January 2005.

•

Russia’s exchange rate regime is a managed float with the central bank intervening heavily
in the foreign exchange market to limit nominal appreciation of the ruble.

foreign exchange market, which was unified on June 29, 1999. The interbank
market electronically links exchanges across the country. The official rate of the
ruble is set equal to the previous day's weighted average rate in the interbank
market.
The Russian Federation accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3,
and 4 of the IMF Articles of Agreement with effect from June 1, 1996. The
previously identified restriction arising from the reserve deposit requirement for
the payment of commission or expenses related to the purchase of external
securities acquired through R2 accounts has been lifted.

Article IV Consultation: Russia is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle.
The last consultation was concluded on October 18, 2006.

XI. FSAP Participation and ROSCs
Russia participated in the Financial Sector Assessment Program during 2002, and
the FSSA report was discussed by the Board in May 2003, at the time of the 2003
Article IV discussion (IMF Country Report No. 03/147). An MFD TA mission on
key monetary, banking, and related issues took place in April 2004. An FSAP
Update is scheduled for 2007. The first visit took place in May 2007. The second
visit is scheduled for the fall 2007.
A Fiscal Transparency ROSC mission, headed by Peter Heller (FAD), visited
Moscow in July 2003, and a new Data ROSC module was undertaken by a
mission in October 2003, led by Armida San Jose (STA).

APPENDIX II. RUSSIAN FEDERATION: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
1.
World Bank Group activities in Russia are guided by the recent three-year Country
Partnership Strategy (FY07-09) which was endorsed by the Bank’s Board in December 2006.
The CPS reflects a strong commitment by both the World Bank Group and the Russian
government to continue a close and productive relationship that is suitable to Russia’s new
conditions. While the federal government no longer needs the financial support of the World
Bank, it still values highly World Bank knowledge, experience, and project management
skills. New borrowing by the federal government will be limited over the period of this CPS,
whereas the use of guarantees, sub-national borrowing and new fee-for-service arrangements
for investment and policy advice are likely to grow. Given substantial developmental
challenges in a large number of Russian regions, the federal government has encouraged the
Bank Group to deepen its direct involvement in the regions. Correspondingly, a central
theme of the CPS is the focus of Bank Group activities in select regions, including economic
analysis (growth and business environment diagnostics), regional development strategies,
and related investment projects. IFC and MIGA operations will remain substantial (Russia is
IFC’s and MIGA’s largest exposure). The successful full transition to new modalities of
cooperation with the Russian government will involve increased coordination among IBRD,
IFC and MIGA.
2.
The CPS envisions a partnership with the Russian government for the realization of
four primary objectives: (a) sustaining rapid growth, (b) improving public sector
management and performance, (c) improving the delivery of social services, and (d)
enhancing Russia’s global role. The first three pillars correspond closely to the pillars of the
previous Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), and channel support directly toward the
development challenges and policies elaborated in the government’s Medium-Term
Economic Program, with a particular focus on the regions. The fourth pillar forms the basis
for a new area of assistance, and concerns Russia’s integration in the world economy and
donor community.
Major areas of Bank Group activities by CPS strategic pillars
(a) Sustaining rapid growth
3.
The World Bank Group will assist Russia in various ways in meeting the challenges
of sustaining rapid growth, including participation in macro-policy debates, monitoring the
investment climate, supporting public investment and PPPs for growth and diversification,
working with regions to identify and overcome barriers to growth, supporting investments in
priority areas at the regional level, and providing direct assistance to the private sector:
•

Macroeconomic policy and the effective management of Russia’s large external
inflows: The Bank will contribute to the macro-policy debate in Russia through the

6
periodic Russian Economic Report, on-demand policy notes and knowledge sharing.
Advisory services can include training and impact monitoring activities related to
WTO accession. In addition, there is strong interest in the Bank’s technical
assistance in advising on alternative uses for the windfall oil revenues, including the
development of an institutional framework for the effective management of a growing
diversified portfolio of foreign assets. The World Bank Treasury has experience and
expertise that can be valuable to Russia in this area and has held initial discussions
with the authorities on possible support.
•

Investment climate monitoring and policy advice: The Bank will continue periodic
business environment and economic productivity (BEEPS) surveys, regional
investment climate assessments, and administrative barriers studies undertaken by
FIAS for interested regions. The Bank and MIGA can work at the regional level on
capacity building and the development of investment promotion programs for
attracting FDI, similar to the initiative currently underway in Rostov Region. WBI
will continue capacity-building activities related to investment climate assessments.

•

Supporting Government investment and public-private partnerships (PPPs) for
growth and diversification: Two proposed projects in support of developing Special
Economic Zones and IT Parks (both in FY07) have the goal of promoting the
diversification and the agglomeration of economic activities in Russia. A
microfinance infrastructure development project (FY08) focuses on financial
cooperatives and their integration into the financial system of the country. On-going
investment projects support land registration and the development of a national
cadastre for securing property rights and the development of land markets. Possible
partial risk guarantees of the Bank to the power sector could help attract investment to
the electricity sector for modernization and substantial increases in capacity. And
another partial risk guarantee instrument may be used to support the construction of
an aluminum complex (SUAL) in Russia’s Komi Republic, possibly alongside an IFC
investment. In addition, regular and reimbursable TAs will support development of
PPPs across sectors.

•

Working with regions to identify engines of growth, develop growth strategies, and
remove barriers to growth: The Bank will prepare a Country Economic
Memorandum focused on relieving barriers to growth at the sub-national level and on
questions of regional agglomerations. The development of fee-for-service
arrangements with the regions would provide another avenue for supporting
preparation of regional investment strategies and growth analyses, and provision of
other analytical services.

•

Supporting investments in priority areas at the regional level: The IFC/Bank SubNational Development Program will support priority regional public investments.
The government is interested in developing this financing mechanism further, as it

7
involves direct lending to well-performing regions and municipalities without
sovereign guarantees. One to three such sub-national operations per year are
contemplated over the CPS. Infrastructure is also an important area of IFC
investments. This concerns primarily transport and logistics, but also includes
municipal infrastructure. MIGA can play a role in supporting foreign direct
investment in infrastructure at the sub-sovereign level, including in the water and
solid waste sectors.
•

Providing direct support to the private sector: IFC will continue to support Russia’s
private sector growth agenda through a combination of financial and advisory
services to promote the growth of the private sector and the diversification of the
Russian economy. IFC will finance projects (1) with important spill-over effects to
other companies, such as infrastructure and financial markets, (2) in sectors where
Russia may have a comparative advantage, for example the processing of natural
resources and those that promote the knowledge economy, and (3) those increasing
the range and quality of products and services available in the Russian market,
particularly outside of Moscow. Much of IFC’s activities will remain concentrated in
the financial sector, where priorities will be: (i) building long-term relationships with
medium-sized independent private regional banks, so as to increase competition and
the range of services available to the population. IFC financing, provided in the form
of long-term senior loans and, in selected cases, subordinated loans, will help to
strengthen the banks’ balance sheets, reach new clients (including SMEs), attract
more depositors, and consolidate their position as leading regional banks; (ii)
supporting the introduction of specialized banking products, including mortgage
financing, consumer finance and leasing; (iii) supporting the process of privatization
of state-owned banks, as and when requested by the Russian Government; and (iv)
supporting development and use of new financial instruments, such as partial
guarantees of local currency bonds and securitization.

•

Continuing IFC advisory work through the Private Enterprise Partnership and FIAS:
This technical assistance will address the following objectives: (a) increasing the
development impact of investments through strengthening local suppliers and
engaging in community development work around large investments; (b) building the
capacity of private banks to deliver new product lines, such as mortgage finance and
financing for energy efficiency; and (c) improving corporate governance and
environmental sustainability through work with banks and real sector clients,
including IFC investees. FIAS will continue to work with select regions to improve
the business climate by assisting in implementation of policies/instruments to kickstart functioning markets of land and commercial real estate.

•

MIGA will continue to support foreign investors through the provision of political
risk guarantees: Supporting foreign investment in infrastructure, in close
coordination with the Bank, will remain an important area of MIGA’s activity in

8
Russia. In the financial sector, the Agency will continue to explore opportunities to
support capital markets transactions, including asset-backed securitizations. MIGA
may also continue to promote the role and assist in the expansion of foreign banks in
the Russian banking sector. Areas for potential further involvement in Russia include
the manufacturing, agribusiness and services sectors.
(b) Improving public sector management and performance
4.
Public sector management has been a particular area of strength of World Bank
work in Russia, which will be further deepened in coming years. The Bank will remain
engaged in supporting programs for modernizing selected public sector institutions,
improving government administration, the judiciary, local self-government, and budgetary
management at federal and sub-national levels. The Bank will expand its engagement in
regions in these areas, in accordance with the federal priority for improving public sector
performance at the sub-national level.
•

Modernizing selected public sector institutions: The completion of on-going projects,
together with a new project in the pipeline, will contribute to the modernization of
public institutions and improved public services. These include tax modernization,
customs development, cadastre and registration, fiscal federalism, performance-based
budgeting, treasury development, and a statistical development project (FY08).

•

Supporting the government program in administrative reform: The Bank will
continue its close engagement with the government in the area of administrative
reform at the federal and sub-national levels, including the coordination and
implementation of substantial donor funds. The primary goal will continue to be
bringing Bank and international expertise to bear on the implementation of the
government’s program for administrative reform, which currently places a strong
emphasis on encouraging initiatives at the sub-national level. So far, the Bank has
concentrated sub-national work in the Southern Federal Okrug and regions in the
North-West. A possible project could be also developed to promote administrative
reform in lagging regions.

•

Stepping up engagement on judicial reform: Assistance on judicial reform also
involves the coordination of donor funds and special cooperation at the regional level.
A recently approved project supports judicial reform (FY07) with a focus on
improving dispute resolution, the enforcement of laws, and the transparency of
information.

•

Support for budgetary reforms: The Bank will continue to respond to the demands of
the federal and some regional governments for assistance in budgetary reform and the
development of performance-based budgeting. In addition, the Bank will remain a

9
partner to the government in the continued scaling up of the Fiscal Federalism Project
(now financed by the Russian government) and its expansion to the municipal level.
•

Supporting the reform of local self-government: The Bank will continue its dialogue
with the government in this area, and in brining international experience to bear on
this vital area of reform in Russia. A study has been launched for monitoring and
assisting the development of local-self government in rural areas in the Perm, Penza,
and Adygeya regions. The Bank will seek to engage directly with regions and
municipalities in this area on the basis of new modalities, including a discussion of
replicating the positive experience of the Fiscal Federalism Project model for building
capacity at the municipal level.

•

Investments in municipal development: On-going and possible future regional
projects have significance for overall municipal development and the quality of
municipal services. This includes the current Kazan and Saint Petersburg municipal
development projects, a housing and communal services project under preparation
(FY08, also see below), and possible regional projects on water and heating system
upgrades.

•

Supporting anti-corruption initiatives: As a coherent national-level anti-corruption
program may begin to take shape, the Bank will explore avenues of possible
constructive contributions to such anti-corruption initiatives.

(c) Improving the delivery of social and communal services
5.
In addition to continued general cooperation with the federal government, the Bank
will concentrate much of its support for improving social service delivery at the sub-national
level. The Government has prioritized the social sector and social services in its mediumterm program. Given that the primary responsibilities and initiatives for reform in these
services will be at the sub-national level, the Bank will concentrate its focus on the regions.
Main activities include the continuation of work in the areas of poverty, education, and health
in cooperation with the regions. Additional activities include the monitoring of social trends
and service delivery quality (joint with USAID) and special employment-related activities in
the Southern Federal Okrug (the development of decentralized employment services, and
labor integration of youth). Another critical area for improving living standards is provision
of housing and communal services. The government places high importance on improving
the performance of the housing and communal services (HCS) sector and on the delivery of
high quality services by communal enterprises, and closely links service provision with
improving the quality of life.
•

Continuation of the poverty work: In addition to continued cooperation with Rosstat
and federal ministries, the emphasis of the Bank poverty work (in cooperation with
DFID) has moved to the regional level. The Bank is working, and will continue to

10
work, directly with regions on monitoring poverty and improving social assistance
programs, including labor market policies. Regional social protection strategies for
Tver, Tomsk, Kalmykia and three other regions will be developed with Bank
assistance. Successful models of cooperation can be scaled up to similar regions.
•

Improving the health of the population: The Bank will continue its engagement with
the government on adult health, and the development of a national strategy to
improve the health of the population, with the goal of reversing the strongly negative
trends in premature mortality and morbidity. As a follow up to earlier child welfare
efforts and jointly with international donors the Bank will assist in design and
implementation of practical mechanism for family support, preventive social welfare
and child care at federal and regional level. Additional advocacy, public awareness
and information sharing efforts jointly with government leaders, public figures,
private sector and NGOs will be undertaken in support of critically needed
government policies in this area. Another priority is to advise federal and regional
authorities on appropriate risk pooling, insurance, and sustainable health financing.
IFC will continue working with private companies on programs for occupational
health, including HIV-AIDS issues. The Bank will implement on-going projects in
the health sector and offer to scale up or modify existing models at the sub-national
level as a service to regions. The development of public-private partnerships in the
health sector could be supported jointly by TA from the Bank and direct financing by
IFC to PPPs and/or purely private providers. Lessons from the TB/AIDS project
could be applied through more focused interventions in interested regions through
sub-national projects and TA. A few regional projects could be supported for
removing environmental hotspots and addressing other environmental concerns
posing major health risks to population.

•

Modernization and improvement of the education system and vocational training:
The Bank will complete current projects in education designed to modernize the
system and improve vocational training. As is the case of health, the Bank will seek
to meet demands of regions for special support at the sub-national level for education
reform. Regional TA and possible projects could focus on improving systems for
professional and vocational education, accompanied by parallel assessments of local
labor markets with an eye to improving the quality of local professional labor supply.
The recently completed Youth Strategy by the Bank provides recommendations for
improvements in youth policies, with possible applications to Russia for forwarding
the dialogue on youth policies in the area of education and training.

•

Improvement in the provision of housing and communal services: The Bank’s
support in the infrastructure sector will largely focus on improving quality of utility
services and housing. The Bank has a large portfolio focused on improving heating,
water, electricity, and other municipal services in selected regions. This includes the

11
current Kazan and Saint Petersburg municipal development, municipal heating,
municipal water and electricity reform projects. A housing and communal services
project (FY08) in support of reforms and investments in HCS on grant basis allocated
to regions on a competitive basis, and an electricity generation guarantee (FY08) will
continue Bank efforts on improving quality of utilities and housing services. Also, a
large share of sub-national lending is expected to focus on improving these services.
•

Housing finance and energy efficiency through IFC's PEP program: IFC’s PEP
program is currently focusing its work on two new product platforms in Russia:
housing finance and energy efficiency, both of which are complemented by IFC
investments in this area. The Primary Mortgage Development Project is working to
streamline the mortgage lending process in Russia. IFC's Sustainable Energy
Efficiency Program in Russia combines IFC's advisory and investment capacity. The
project makes credit lines available to banks for on-lending for energy efficiency
projects, and provides technical assistance to banks and private companies in order to
raise the lending volumes available for energy-saving projects. The program has
already disbursed its first credit line to Center Invest Bank in Rostov, and currently
has a US$60 million pipeline of potential deals across all regions of Russia. IFC also
runs a number of additional programs in Russia, including support for corporate
governance in the banking sector, for improvement of forestry management practices
in the Northwest, and for development of local suppliers to the mining sector in the
remote region of Magadan.

(d) Enhancing Russia’s global role
6.
The Bank has a strong commitment to support Russia’s increasing global role, and
assist the country in fulfilling its global commitments. The Bank will continue cooperation
with the Russian government in support of its emergence as an international donor and active
member of multilateral organizations. In addition, the Bank will assist in establishment of
mechanisms and implementation of specific actions arising from Russia’s global
engagements, such as the Climate Change and Biodiversity Conventions, and pandemic
diseases initiatives. During the CPS period, the Bank will also seek to share with Russian
experts its analysis (and advocacy) that is currently directed towards the traditional DAC
donors. Specific areas for Bank’s engagement in Russia are:
•

Assistance in the formulation of an ODA strategy for Russia as emerging donor: The
Bank will continue to assist Russia as an emerging donor, and will cooperate on the
design of Russia’s development aid strategy and the establishment of a national ODA
system. Specific Bank support includes training/capacity events, information sharing,
and advisory services. The Bank will remain engaged with Russia on international
policy initiatives developed under Russia’s G-8 presidency, including on Russia’s
priority themes for international assistance – quality of education, energy poverty,
and the spread of infectious diseases.

12
•

Providing access to the Bank’s instruments for channeling Russian developmental
assistance: The Bank will help in arranging an Africa debt-for-development swap, the
establishment of an Avian Flu Trust Fund, the implementation of the Education For
All/Fast Track Initiatives and Russia’s participation in the Global Village Energy
Partnership. It will also facilitate expanding Russia’s role in IDA. Beginning with a
high-level Emerging Donor Meeting in April 2006, the Bank is assisting Russia in
organizing development aid seminars and international events. The Bank will also
seek opportunities for increased engagement of Russian experts in development
policy debates, their participation in the Bank’s work in other countries, and “staff
secondments” for building capacity within the Russian Government for aid allocation
and management.

•

Fulfilling international obligations related to global goods: The Bank will assist
Russia in developing procedures and mechanisms for implementing specific activities
in the framework of the Climate Change and Biodiversity Conventions. TA is
currently being provided on the introduction of low-carbon technologies and climate
change mitigation. If the government moves ahead with the introduction of financial
instruments for low-carbon technologies in Russia, the Bank would be ready to
support the preparation and implementation of a number of carbon-finance projects.
There are three GEF projects in the Bank’s pipeline awaiting the establishment of a
legal and institutional framework for their introduction at the regional level with
federal oversight. Additional projects on biodiversity and climate change could also
be prepared. The Bank will continue participation in the Ministerial Conference on
Forest Law Enforcement and Governance in Europe and North Asia.

•

Linking Russian companies to global markets: IFC and MIGA activities are also
relevant to the expansion of Russia’s global role. In keeping with its global strategic
objective to encourage investment across emerging markets (South-South
investment), IFC will continue to actively support strong, reputable Russian clients in
investments elsewhere in emerging markets. Consistent with its strategic objective to
support South-South investments through the provision of guarantees, MIGA will
continue to proactively engage Russian companies planning to invest in emerging
markets.

Focus on Russian regions
7.
The Bank is working with the federal government in identifying a small sub-set of
6–10 regions that may become the target of concentrated work programs with the Bank.
Regions are being chosen from wealthier, middle income, and poorer areas. Important
criteria for the selection of regions for Bank engagement are (i) the willingness and
commitment of the regional administration to work with the Bank; (ii) a past history of
successful cooperation; (iii) the reform-orientation and competence of the regional
administration; (iv) strategic importance of the region for Russian development and the

13
existence of other similar regions for possible scaling up of successful cooperation; and (v)
the region’s creditworthiness and potential interest in Bank operations (for wealthier or
middle income regions). Following initial engagement of selected regions, the strategic
directions and modalities of cooperation with the Bank will be included in a joint
Memoranda of Understanding, to be signed with the leaders of the focus regions. As noted,
Bank involvement at the regional level would involve a combination of targeted AAA on
diagnostics of the local economy and investment climate, and development of regional
strategies, coupled with selected lending operations to address key challenges.
8.
The World Bank Group will concentrate some work in poorer Russian regions,
which are often in most need of development assistance. The list of priority regions will
include some such poorer regions. IBRD engagement in poorer regions that lack
creditworthiness will depend significantly on opportunities for participation in federal
programs or the coordination of donor funds. IFC will make special efforts to support private
sector activities in poorer areas. For some poorer Russian regions which have achieved
creditworthiness, potential opportunities exist for fee-for-service activities or sub-national
lending without sovereign guarantees. Discussions on the development of new instruments
will give particular attention to facilitating Bank work in poorer areas.

14
APPENDIX III. RUSSIAN FEDERATION: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Economic and financial data provided to the Fund are considered broadly adequate
for surveillance purposes. Russia has a reasonably comprehensive and timely statistical
database, but difficulties remain in terms of data accuracy and frequent data revisions. State
and private enterprise activities are measured through forms sent to firms included in
enterprise registers, with sample surveys increasingly replacing full-count collections. The
authorities are generally cooperative in reporting data to the Fund, mainly through the
resident representative office, and during missions. Russia produces a wide range of regular,
timely publications on financial and economic statistics. The authorities report data for the
Fund’s International Financial Statistics (IFS), Government Finance Statistics Yearbook, the
Direction of Trade Statistics, and the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook.
2.
A draft ROSC on data dissemination practices was prepared in 1999–2000, but never
published. A new data ROSC was prepared in October 2003 and the authorities approved the
publication of the report on the IMF website in April 2004.
3.
Since January 31, 2005, the Russian Federation is a subscriber to the SDDS.
However, data on general government operations (GGO) in the National Summary Data Page
(NSDP) currently refer to 2003. The Russian Federation has not provided certification of its
metadata.
4.
Reserves template series are available on
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sta/ir/colist.htm, and external debt series are available on
http://www.worldbank.org/data/working/QEDS/sdds_countrydata.html.
National accounts
5.
The Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat) compiles and publishes quarterly and
annual national accounts data on a timely basis, using the 1993 System of National Accounts.
Rosstat introduced chain-linking into their quarterly and annual national accounts in 2006.
Chain-linked data have been published for 2003 onwards. Source data are obtained from
surveys of businesses and households, including financial surveys of businesses and
employment surveys of households, and are supplemented by administrative data. Efforts are
underway to improve coverage, but further progress is needed to cover small and medium
enterprises. The estimates of GDP are compiled by type of economic activity and expenditure
category; however, the estimates by type of activity are considered more accurate. The
statistical discrepancy between the production and expenditure approaches is generally no
more than 2 percent, which is acceptable by international standards. The data are also
presented by income category, but estimates of the financial account by institutional sector
are not compiled.
6.
The delay in finalizing a modern statistics law⎯requiring firms to provide data with
credible penalties for noncompliance, together with a guarantee of confidentiality⎯is an

15
impediment to further improvement of national accounts data. Furthermore, revisions to the
data are not flagged when they are disseminated. As a result, it is difficult for users, including
the Fund, to maintain consistent time series.
Prices
7.
Rosstat compiles a national consumer price index (CPI) of good quality, which was
developed with Fund technical assistance. Following a moderation of inflation, Rosstat
stopped the weekly publication of headline inflation in January 2003, retaining only monthly
reports. In addition, Rosstat has begun publication of monthly core inflation data. Further
improvements could be made on the basis of a new household budget survey—which has
been under consideration for some time—and by the current efforts to improve the treatment
of seasonal items in the index. World Bank and TACIS assistance is available in these areas.
Rosstat also publishes a producer price index, and the State Customs Committee has initiated
the development of foreign trade price indexes.
8.
Monthly CPI and PPI, both Laspeyres indices (2000=100), cover all regions of the
Russian Federation. In addition to the general CPI index, Rosstat publishes indices for the
foodstuffs, non-food products, and services. However, the weights of the CPI components
have been made available since 2006 while PPI components are not disclosed, rendering time
series analysis difficult.
Government finance statistics
9.
The staff is provided with monthly information on revenues, expenditures, and
financing of the federal government and annual information on revenues, expenditures, and
financing of local governments and extrabudgetary funds. The published functional
classification of expenditure differs slightly from international standards. Expenditure data,
classified by economic type, need improvement. Presently, annual data are compiled with a
long delay. Data on domestic and external federal debt are compiled monthly, but are made
public only in summary form on a quarterly basis. In addition, there is no unified debt
monitoring and reporting system. In the context of a work program for statistical
improvement agreed with STA, there have been ongoing improvements in the coverage and
quality of GFS data, although expenditure data remain poor. The reform of budgetary
accounting is well advanced and includes the introduction of accrual accounting for the
whole of government. In the 2006 Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY), data for
the central, local and general government were reported through 2005 on both accrual and
cash basis in accordance with the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001)
methodology. The Treasury has been reporting aggregate government finance data for
publication in IFS on a cash basis since April 1996.

16
Monetary statistics
10.
Monetary data are reasonably comprehensive and generally in accordance with
international standards. Classification and sectorization are in line with the methodological
guidelines, except that financial derivatives (which are at an initial stage of development) are
not included in the instrument classification. The basis of recording broadly follows
methodological recommendations. Since 2006, monetary gold is valued at current quotations
set by the CBR. Following the 2003 data ROSC recommendations, the authorities included
all non-operational credit institutions in the coverage of the monetary statistics and
reclassified their deposits as restricted deposits. The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) intends to
revise further its compilation procedures to conform fully to the guidelines of the Monetary
and Financial Statistics Manual 2000.
11.
Analytical accounts for the monetary authorities and commercial banks are reported
for publication in IFS with a lag of one month. Timely interest rate data are available. The
CBR has yet to conclude compilation of monetary data using new Standardized Report
Forms (SRFs). At the request of the authorities, a TA mission visited Moscow in April 2007
to assist in expanding the coverage to include other (nondepository) financial corporations
and to facilitate the completion of the SRFs.
External sector statistics
12.
Balance of payments statistics are compiled on the basis of the fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). Though significant improvements have been made to
enhance the quality of balance of payments statistics, there remains scope to improve the
coverage of certain components of the current and the capital and financial accounts. In
particular, improving the detail of data on the financial account would facilitate the analysis
of relatively complex flows.
13.
The State Customs Committee needs to improve substantially the coverage and
valuation of exports and imports. Merchandise imports data published by the State Customs
Service are subject to large adjustments for under recording, especially for “shuttle trade” by
individuals, smuggling, and undervaluation. Large differences between partner country and
customs data on imports persist, although statistical agencies are seeking to reconcile the data
with those of partner countries. The CBR has developed a methodology for calculating
export and import transactions that are unrecorded by the customs authorities. There is a need
to improve the coverage and quality of surveys on direct investment, and trade in services
including travel. The CBR has moved toward direct data collection to address these
limitations.
14.
As noted, Russia disseminates the data template on international reserves and foreign
currency liquidity. However, published historic series on reserves have not been corrected for
changes in definitions. Headline data on reserves are reported to the Fund and the markets on
a weekly basis with a four-business day lag. The Fund receives additional detail on reserves

17
and reserve liabilities through the central bank balance sheet, but this information which is
not as comprehensive as the reserve template, which is disseminated with a lag of twenty
days.
15.
Quarterly external debt data are now published by sector, maturity, instrument, and
currency, with a lag of one quarter as prescribed by the SDDS. Furthermore, the CBR started
publishing quarterly debt service projections by sector and instruments.
16.
The CBR has commenced publishing an annual international investment position for
all sectors with data starting in 2000. The international investment position for the banking
sector has been available on a quarterly basis since 2001Q1 and published with a three-month
lag.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
September 12, 2007

1.
This statement summarizes information that has become available since the staff
report was issued. The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged.
2.
The economy has gained additional momentum. Recent figures suggest that output
grew by 7.8 percent year-on-year in the first half of 2007, well above both the authorities’
and staff’s estimates of potential. High frequency indicators point to even stronger output
growth in recent months. Such indicators also suggest that growth continues to be powered
by very buoyant domestic demand, reflecting a surge in investments and continued strong
growth in private consumption. Real wages increased by 17 percent during the first half of
2007, compared to the same period of last year. In light of these developments, the Ministry
of Economy has announced that it will increase its 2007 forecast for real GDP growth, from
6.5 percent to 7.2–7.4 percent, while the consensus forecast has increased to 7.1 percent.
Staff has for now maintained its forecast of 7 percent for 2007, but agrees that the risks are
now mainly on the upside.
3.
The current account surplus is continuing to decline at a relatively rapid pace. In
the second quarter of this year, the current account surplus relative to GDP almost halved
compared to the same period of 2006, even with oil prices at broadly the same level during
these two periods.
4.
Inflation has continued to increase. Since the issuance of the staff report, headline
inflation (year-on-year) has risen above the official end-year target of 8 percent, from
7.4 percent in March to 8.6 percent in August. As discussed in the staff report, this trend
mainly reflects the return to a more fixed exchange rate policy from mid-2006, a policy
change that has been associated with a surge in capital inflows and unsterilized interventions.
Since June, in an effort to stem the increase in inflation, the CBR has again allowed slightly
greater exchange rate flexibility, with the ruble appreciating until mid-August, when capital
outflows and downward pressures on the ruble associated with the current turmoil in
financial markets prompted the CBR to intervene to support the currency (see below). While
these outflows have eased short-term pressures on monetary policy, staff believes that the
risks remain biased toward an overshooting of the end-year inflation target of 8 percent.
5.
The authorities are still planning a notable fiscal relaxation in the context of a
supplementary 2007 budget. Duma approval is now expected in October. The parameters of
the supplementary budget remain as described in paragraph 18 of the staff report.
6.
Russia has weathered the recent turmoil in world financial markets relatively
well. Compared to the beginning of August, sovereign spreads increased by about 50 bps to
about 150 bps, but have now stabilized. Similarly, after an initial drop of about 8 percent

2

over the first half of August, the local stock market firmed after the Fed’s action on the U.S.
discount rate, and ended the month down by only 5 percent. As foreign investors reduced
their Russian exposure, the CBR acted intermittently to smooth downward pressure on the
exchange rate, and there was a small loss of official reserves during August. However,
despite this loss, reserves have increased by $113 billion so far in 2007, and currently stand
at $416 billion.
7.
Liquidity in the banking system has been restored. The CBR’s sales of foreign
exchange, combined with significant end-August tax obligations, resulted in a domestic
liquidity squeeze. Overnight money-market rates doubled from about 4 percent to 8 percent,
prompting the CBR to inject a growing amount of liquidity via the one-day repo facility. At
the peak of the liquidity squeeze, rolled-over repo operations reached a historic high of Rub
272 billion ($10.6 billion). Now that the tax-payment period is over, however, money-market
rates have dropped to 5–6 percent, and repo operations are again minimal.
8.
The turmoil in financial markets has increased the vulnerability of some banks.
Staff remains particularly concerned that Russia's fragmented and inefficient interbank
market may leave some individual regional or mid-size banks vulnerable to a deterioration of
credit conditions. Thus, some banks with limited access to the interbank market have relied
on foreign borrowing as a key source of funds, and may face difficulty as the cost of this
funding rises. An FSAP-update mission is scheduled to visit Moscow in October.
9.
Recent developments have reinforced the thrust of the staff appraisal. In
particular, staff continues to believe that further fiscal relaxation should be avoided at this
juncture when the economy is gaining additional momentum spurred by strong domestic
demand, and when inflation is already rising and the ruble is appreciating rapidly in real
terms.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation
with the Russian Federation
On September 12, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Russian Federation.1
Background
Russia’s economic growth remains robust. High oil prices, a strong catch-up potential, and
sound fiscal policy underlie Russia’s long spell of robust growth. Several years of double-digit
terms-of-trade gains, reinforced by rapidly developing financial markets and much-improved
access to foreign borrowing, have underpinned strong investment growth, punctured only by a
soft spot in late 2004. Nevertheless, the level of investment has remained low, and capital and
labor have accounted for less than half of the increase in GDP since 2003, with the balance
due to higher total factor productivity. Robust growth has thus owed much to Russia’s still
considerable catch-up potential, as resources are reallocated to more dynamic sectors in the
economy. The resulting nexus of strong productivity growth, rising real incomes, and higher
consumption has been a key source of self-sustaining growth, especially in recent years as
capacity constraints have slowed energy exports.
Despite the broad stabilization of oil prices since mid-2006, GDP growth has strengthened,
rising from 6.7 percent in 2006 to 7.8 percent for the first half of 2007. Moreover, much of this
momentum reflects a pickup in investment, suggesting that growth in Russia is now becoming
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

more evenly balanced. Consumption nonetheless remains the main engine, spurred by real
income growth of over 10 percent.
With surging growth, the economy is running increasingly close to capacity. Domestic resource
constraints are tightening, not least in the labor market, causing increased leakage of demand
into imports and renewed inflationary pressures. From a peak of almost 14 percent (year-onyear) in mid-2005, inflation dropped to 7½ percent in March 2007. However, inflation has since
firmed to over 8½ percent as of August, standing above the end-year target of 8 percent.
Following six years of robust GDP growth, measures of capacity utilization are at historical
highs. The constraints are particularly evident in the oil sector. Having increased by about
10 percent annually through 2003, the increase in oil production slowed sharply in 2004–05,
and appears now to have stabilized at about 2–3 percent.
Russia’s balance of payments has strengthened. The current account surplus has narrowed as
a result of accelerating import growth and slowing energy exports. But, this has been more
than offset by sharply higher capital inflows—as of early September, reserves increased by a
record $113 billion in the year to date, reaching a total of $417 billion. With a still-substantial
current account surplus, rapidly increasing foreign exchange reserves and declining external
debt, Russia’s external vulnerability is low, although non-government debt is rising rapidly.
The overall fiscal surplus has continued to increase because of higher oil revenues. However,
fiscal policy has since 2005 allowed an increasing share of Russia’s oil-revenue windfall to
pass through to the economy. This relaxation has been reflected in a continued deterioration in
the general government’s non-oil balance. Staff projects that the non-oil balance will decline
further under the 2007 budget, by 0.9 percent of GDP.
Monetary policy has become more accommodative over the past year, reflecting the CBR’s
resumption of a more steady exchange rate policy in mid-2006. This represents a reversal of
the policy introduced in early 2005, wherein the CBR had allowed some, albeit limited,
appreciation. The return to a more stable exchange rate policy has been associated with a
surge in capital inflows, record-high interventions, and a sharp acceleration in base-money
growth to 40 percent through July (year-on-year). Importantly, in the context of a year-end
inflation target of 8 percent, rising inflationary pressures and market expectations of a possible
appreciation have exacerbated capital inflows, not least through the banking system. Since
June, however, the CBR has allowed for greater exchange-rate flexibility to help stem inflation.
Additionally, the worldwide market turmoil of August has eased the pace of capital inflows.
Notwithstanding currently unsettled conditions on world markets, demand pressures are
expected to remain strong in 2007. Russia’s terms-of-trade are projected to ease slightly in
2007, but the overall environment will still remain broadly supportive. As in 2006, the balance
of payments is expected to strengthen further, with capital inflows more than offsetting a lower
current account surplus. Overall, staff projects GDP growth of around 7 percent over the near
term, driven by robust consumption and investment demand. This outlook also reflects a
substantial fiscal impulse in 2007 along with a rapid expansion of consumer credit. In light of
recent trends, inflation threatens to exceed the official end-year target of 8 percent.

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the strong performance of the Russian economy in recent
years, noting that this has been due not only to high oil prices and large capital inflows but also
to good macroeconomic management. In particular, the policy of saving the large oil revenue
windfall has provided a considerable measure of stability. However, Directors noted that
Russia continues to face tensions in the policy mix designed to reduce inflation while
preserving exchange rate stability.
Directors noted that demand pressures appear to be intensifying, driven by acceleration in
investment and strong growth in private consumption. With output close to potential, upward
pressures on prices and the real exchange rate are likely to persist.
Against this background, Directors noted that the planned fiscal relaxation in the next few
years would provide an undesirable fiscal stimulus. This would increase pressures for real
ruble appreciation and make it more difficult to reduce inflation. It is also likely to exhaust most
of the remaining margin of competitiveness, raising the risk of the real exchange rate
overshooting its equilibrium level. Directors therefore called on the authorities to avoid
increasing the non-oil deficit during the remainder of 2007 and in 2008.
Directors emphasized the need to control public spending, and to pay more attention to the
quality and efficiency of expenditures. In this regard, they welcomed the new framework for
spending of oil revenues, which is close to best practice for management of natural resource
wealth. They cautioned, however, that the back-loading of spending cuts in socially sensitive
areas in 2010–11, in the run-up to elections, is risky. Such cuts might not be feasible unless
efficiency-enhancing social and public sector reforms are reinvigorated. Most Directors also
advised against extending the government’s mandate to areas where private sector
participation might be more efficient.
Directors noted that the recent rise in inflation stemmed from the return to a less flexible
exchange rate policy since mid-2006, a change that led to large unsterilized interventions in
the face of surging capital inflows. They stressed that keeping inflation on the targeted path
would require returning to a more flexible exchange rate policy. In this regard, Directors
welcomed the authorities’ willingness to accept appreciation, as was evident from June until
August this year. They urged the central bank to stand ready to scale back interventions as
needed to keep inflation within target, noting that greater focus on the inflation target while
allowing more exchange rate flexibility could help curb one-way bets and reduce speculative
capital inflows.
Directors welcomed the rapid development of Russia’s financial sector, but cautioned that high
rates of credit growth might also increase vulnerabilities. In particular, the rapid increase in
consumer lending, corporate-bond issuances, and open foreign-exchange positions should be
kept under close review. While Russia has weathered the recent turmoil in financial markets
relatively well, the tightening of access to foreign capital markets could increase the
vulnerability of a number of banks. Directors welcomed the current Financial Sector

4
Assessment Program update, which provides a timely opportunity for a review of
vulnerabilities.
Directors observed that the key long-term challenge will be to improve Russia’s investment
climate. Although recent investment growth has been impressive, they noted that the level of
investment is still relatively low and that Russia still ranks poorly in international comparisons
of the business climate. Raising investment levels is particularly important in light of the
projected decline in the labor force and the declining prospect for continued high productivity
gains over the medium term. In this regard, Directors observed that progress on important
reforms in public administration and the civil service has been limited. The challenge facing the
new government would be to reinvigorate such reforms.
