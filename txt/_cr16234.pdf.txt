IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Peru
On June 20, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Peru, and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal
without a meeting.2
As a result of prudent macroeconomic management, Peru has successfully navigated the
commodity cycle and the 2008–09 global financial crisis, and still leads growth among large
Latin American economies. Thus, the new government, which takes office on July 28, 2016,
will inherit an economy with a solid foundation, good institutional frameworks in place, and
structural reforms in train.
However, important challenges now loom, as metal prices have entered into a slump since
their 2011 peak, hurting exports, investment, and fiscal revenues. Following a sharp and
unexpected drop in 2014, growth picked up in 2015, reaching 3.3 percent largely owing to
higher metals production and fishing, and a partial recovery in services and commerce.
Despite a widening negative output gap, inflation increased by more than 1 percentage point
to 4.4 percent, y-o-y, in December 2015, reflecting food supply shocks, regulatory
adjustments to energy prices, and a pass-through from currency depreciation. The external
current account reached a deficit of 4.4 percent in 2015 despite the sol depreciation.
Monetary and exchange rate policies remained attentive to rapidly changing conditions. The
central bank has raised the policy rate since September 2015 by a full percentage point to
4.25 percent aiming at re-anchoring inflation expectations, which has added to tighter
external financial conditions. The sol was allowed to depreciate 14 percent with respect to
the U.S. dollar, while volatility was contained. The authorities have eased the adjustment to
commodity price shocks through an expansionary fiscal policy in 2015, but with mixed
results, as capital spending continues to suffer delays.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.
2

The Executive Board takes decisions under its lapse-of-time procedure when the Board agrees that a proposal
can be considered without convening formal discussions.

Peru is positioned to grow faster in the next two years, as mining production reaches full
capacity and large infrastructure projects advance. Inflation is expected to decline. Risks to
the outlook are balanced, and downside risks are mostly on the external side. Upside risks on
the domestic front are a pick-up in sub-national investment and possible larger-thanprojected increases in confidence and investment after the presidential election.
Executive Board Assessment
After decelerating sharply in 2014, economic activity recovered last year despite a volatile
external environment. The recovery largely reflected additional mining production capacity
coming on stream, although non-mining activity has also accelerated modestly more recently.
An expected increase in mining exports, together with some rebound in public investment,
will impart a strong positive impetus on growth going forward, which should spillover to
non-commodity sectors. Thus, despite sluggish external conditions, activity is expected to
accelerate further in 2016 and 2017, while inflation continues to decline.
Risks to the outlook are balanced. External pressures have carried over from last year and
comprise possibly weaker-than-projected growth in China (and, hence, softer metal prices),
possible adverse spillovers from other countries in the region (though these should be
relatively small), sharp asset price adjustments in advanced and emerging economies, and an
even stronger dollar. The response to shocks should be through further exchange rate
flexibility and easing liquidity conditions to support credit activity. Upside domestic risks
include stronger-than-expected improvements in business confidence (especially if the
incoming government announces decisive productivity-enhancing reforms) and a more
effective execution of the existing pipeline of infrastructure projects, which could lift growth
further in 2016–17 and beyond.
Monetary and exchange rate policies should remain attentive to rapidly changing conditions.
Following monetary tightening, the BCRP should now maintain a wait-and-see stance—
given declining inflation and medium-term inflation expectations, the fact that it is too soon
to evaluate the effect of past monetary tightening on economic activity and inflation, and the
usual uncertainties surrounding the exact cyclical position of an economy. This said, a
possibly steeper interest rate path in the United States than currently priced by the financial
market could trigger the need for further monetary tightening in Peru. Greater exchange rate
flexibility in 2015 was a welcome development with no noticeable impact on firms’ and
banks’ balance sheets; the latter remain healthy and profitable. Further decline in credit dedollarization has been achieved not least due to the measures introduced by the BCRP.
Further exchange rate flexibility would support the development of hedging instruments to
reduce currency risk and help accelerate the de-dollarization process. Recent measures to
deepen Peru’s equity market are also welcome.

3

A gradual fiscal consolidation in the next few years is advisable to maintain healthy debt
dynamics and to protect fiscal buffers. With the output gap closing around end 2017, there is
no case for loosening fiscal policy. A gradual fiscal consolidation would be important for
ensuring the sustainability of pensions, and defending against natural disasters and realization
of contingent liabilities. To accommodate higher-than-projected public capital spending, it
will be critical to create adequate fiscal space through containing current spending that is not
complementary to capital expansion and structural reforms (including in health and
education), and raising the low revenue collection through streamlining administration,
reducing informality and exemptions, and protecting Peru’s tax base from possible
international profit shifting by multinational corporations. Reducing bottlenecks to public
investment and improving management would go a long way toward enabling full execution
of budgeted spending and would support private investment.
With the end of commodity-driven growth, the agenda for growth-spurring structural reforms
has become a higher priority, including for further poverty reduction. Investments in capital
and labor will be needed to boost potential growth, which is otherwise estimated to be
3.5 percent in the absence of continued reforms. Long-standing challenges include reducing
informality, which should be in part addressed through labor market reforms aiming at
lowering the costs of hiring and firing workers, and spurring investment in non-extractive
industries, including through improving competitiveness and infrastructure. Peru’s current
decentralization framework should be improved, as it constrains full execution of planned
capital expansion and better allocation of resources. While Peru has achieved one of the
highest rates of education coverage in Latin America, the low quality of education remains a
crucial challenge, and the ongoing reforms will need to continue. Efforts to raise financial
inclusion are commendable, especially through the launch of the broad-based National
Financial Inclusion Strategy and the private sector-led e-money platform. Free trade
agreements also provide an opportunity for boosting and diversifying long-term growth.
Staff would like to relay their appreciation to the outgoing administration for the constructive
dialogue and look forward to working with the new government.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 3, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context: Even though economic conditions in Latin America remain fragile, the new
Peruvian government, which takes office on July 28, 2016, will inherit an economy with a
solid foundation. Over the last five years, and despite a downward trend in metal prices,
sizable fiscal and monetary buffers have been built and carefully managed, Peru’s
investment grade rating has been consolidated, economic diversification fostered,
private investment crowded in through partnerships in infrastructure projects, and
reforms initiated in civil service, education, and health care. Targeted social assistance
programs also went a long way in reducing poverty further.
Recent developments: Like the rest of the region, Peru has been affected by the end of
the commodity cycle. Following a sharp, unexpected drop in 2014, growth picked up in
2015 largely due to higher metals production and fishing. The recovery spilled over to
Q1 2016, and Peru remains one of the fastest growing economies in Latin America.
Outlook and risks: Unlike most of its peers, Peru is expected to grow faster in the next
two years, assuming expanded mining production remains as competitive as currently,
and large infrastructure projects advance. Risks to the outlook are balanced with
downside risks mostly on the external side. Upside risks on the domestic front are a pickup in sub-national investment and a perceived investor-friendly outcome of the
presidential elections (which reduces the risk of eroding Peru’s prudent fiscal framework)
implying possible larger-than-projected increases in confidence and investment.
Policy advice: The current policy mix is broadly adequate. A wait-and-see monetary
stance should be maintained at present given lagged effects from previous monetary
tightening and declining inflation. Greater exchange rate flexibility is welcome in helping
adjustment and should be continued. The progress in credit de-dollarization is laudable
and further steps in this direction should increase the effectiveness of monetary policy
and reduce financial vulnerabilities. The consolidation strategy, which is guided by the
current fiscal framework, is appropriate; larger spending on public infrastructure and
social projects should be accommodated through raising tax revenue without
compromising Peru’s positive debt dynamics. The continuation of ongoing reforms and
a strong push for reforms in the labor market, fiscal decentralization, and public
investment management are crucial to boost potential growth.

CONTEXT
1.
As a result of prudent
macroeconomic management, Peru has
successfully navigated the commodity
cycle and the 2008–09 global financial
crisis, and still leads growth among
large Latin American countries.
However, important challenges now loom
as metal prices have dropped markedly
since their 2011 peak, hurting exports,
investment, and fiscal revenues. Like
other emerging markets, Peru
experienced capital outflows as global
portfolios rebalanced and investment
appetite dropped. The sol has depreciated 31 percent with respect to the U.S. dollar since its peak
in January 2013, but only 3.8 percent in nominal effective terms over the same period, and Peru’s
current account deficit widened. While supportive policies over the past three years have softened
the adjustment, growth averaged about 2¾ percent over 2014–15 compared to 61/5 percent over
the previous decade. Following the runoff in the presidential elections (June 5), a new government
will assume office (July 28), providing an opportune time for setting a medium-term agenda that
builds on past achievements to raise potential growth and further reduce poverty.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
2.
After decelerating sharply in 2014, economic activity recovered somewhat in 2015.1
Growth reached 3.3 percent in 2015, led by mining and fisheries and a partial recovery in services
and commerce, while the unemployment rate increased to 6.5 percent, reflecting lagged effects
from the sharp downturn in 2014. From an aggregate demand perspective, private and public
consumption supported growth in 2015, together with inventory accumulation. The inventory
build-up, which more than explains the growth increase in 2015, is due to the year-end surge in
mining output which was exported during the first quarter of 2016. Gross private and public fixed
investment was a drag on overall activity. The external current account reached a deficit of
4.4 percent in 2015, mostly owing to large declines in metal prices while non-commodity exports
did not pick up despite the sol depreciation. The current account deficit was partially financed by
borrowing and foreign direct investment, while other capital flows remained subdued.

monetary stance in 2015. Despite a
widening negative output gap, inflation
increased by more than 1 percentage point
to 4.4 percent, y-o-y, in December 2015,
reflecting food supply shocks, regulatory
adjustments to energy prices, and a passthrough from currency depreciation.2 The
BCRP has raised the policy rate since
September 2015 by a full percentage point
to 4¼ percent aiming at re-anchoring
inflation expectations, which has added to
tighter external financial conditions (Box 1).

significant, amounting to US$8 billion or about 4 percent of GDP; FX swaps and FX-linked
certificates of deposit accounted for US$3.2 billion or about 2 percent of GDP; however,
intervention slowed by year-end and more recently has focused on managing appreciation
pressures. Net international reserves (NIR) remained high, at US$61.5 billion (308 percent of the
Assessing Reserve Adequacy (ARA) metric, or 263 percent after augmenting the ARA for
commodity buffers). While a significant part of NIR consists of domestic FX liabilities, these are
mostly of maturities of 2 years and longer, and do not constitute a short-term risk to reserves
(Annex II). After adjusting for these liabilities, NIR still remained within the adequacy range.

Following a string of surpluses since 2009, the non-financial public sector (NFPS)
deficit rose to about 2 percent of GDP in 2015. Government revenues fell by about 2 percent of
GDP. A loss of income from reduced tax rates accounted for about ⅓ of the total; the rest was
explained by a structural drop in commodity prices, one-off extraordinary revenues collected in
2014, and higher tax reimbursements on overestimated pre-payments, especially by commodity
producing companies. Under-execution of capital spending, especially at sub-national levels of
government, undermined the authorities’ targeted fiscal impulse. Overall, fiscal policy remained
broadly neutral in structural terms, and is estimated to have contributed negatively to economic
activity in 2015 since multipliers on investment spending (which fell) are greater than tax and
current-spending multipliers.3 Gross public debt increased to about 24 percent of GDP, including
pre-financing operations,4 with net debt (gross debt excluding government deposits at the central
bank and in private banks) increasing to 7 percent of GDP.5

Staff estimates of fiscal multipliers in the accompanying Selected Issues Paper, Chapter 2, while to be interpreted
with the usual caution, indicate that capital spending multipliers have a larger effect on growth both during cyclical
upturns and downturns (0.5–1.1) and over different horizons than tax measures and current spending increases.
Weighting revenue and spending impulses by their respective multipliers, the impact of the fiscal impulse on the
economy in 2015 was a negative 0.3 percent.
After a decade absence in European markets, Peru issued a 1.1 billion euro bond with 11-year maturity, yielding
2.75 percent, to pre-finance the 2017 needs.

In June 2015, the authorities also published for the first time the stock of contingent liabilities (as required by the

The banking sector reported strong results in 2015 (Annex III). In an effort to reduce
dollarization and encourage financial intermediation in local currency, the BCRP reduced the
average reserve requirement rate on local currency deposits from 20 percent to 6.5 percent from
May 2013 through June 2015. Private sector credit grew robustly at 9½ percent (y-o-y, in FX
adjusted terms), also reflecting a shift of corporate borrowing towards the domestic market. Net
profits increased 32 percent, the highest rate since 2008, while credit risk indicators stabilized.
Direct exposure to the commodity sector remains limited, and banks are solid, profitable, and
liquid. As a result of amplified de-dollarization measures introduced in late-2014, the share of FX
loans in total loans dropped to 27.4 percent in January 2016 from 38.2 percent in December 2014.
Expectations of further currency depreciation boosted dollar deposits in commercial banks in 2015
to about 45 percent of total deposits from 40 percent in 2014. The BCRP has been offering FX
repos with maturities of 2 to 5 years to close banks’ open balance-sheet positions in U.S. dollars
and support the creation of credit in local currency.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
7.
The recovery is off to a good start in the first quarter of 2016. Led by the jump in
exports (which absorbed the excess of mining inventories accumulated in end-2015), a pick-up in
private consumption, and a strong rebound in public spending (including investment), GDP grew
4.4 percent, y-o-y, in the first quarter of 2016, with final domestic demand (domestic demand
excluding inventory accumulation) accelerating to 3.6 percent, y-o-y, from 3.3 percent, y-o-y, in the
fourth quarter of 2015. Inflation has declined since end 2015 (3.9 percent, y-o-y, in April 2016) and
inflation expectations have fallen within the BCRP’s target range at the 2017 and 2018 horizons.
Credit growth remained stable (8.3 percent in April, y-o-y), investment sentiment is recovering
following the first round of the presidential election on April 10, and the sol has appreciated since
mid-February 2016.

2015, government investment has picked up
in 2016Q1 with prospects of further expansion during the year. As business confidence continues to
recover, the incipient recovery seen in several non-commodity producing sectors in 2015Q4 and
2016Q1 is expected to continue and staff projects a 3¾ percent growth in 2016 and 4.1 percent
growth in 2017. By 2017, mining production is expected to double from its 2014 level, with smaller
increases thereafter owing to stalling new mining investment. The authorities project slightly higher
growth than the staff’s forecast for 2016 and 2017 on the assumption of stronger investment.
Inflation should converge to the target band by early-2017 as the fallout from El Niño wears off, the
pace of currency depreciation slows in 2016, and the full effect of past monetary tightening is felt.

Cerro Verde, Las Bambas and Antamina mines are expected to be the world’s second, fourth and fifth largest copper
mines by 2017. Falling copper prices are seen as unlikely to cause production cuts as copper’s marginal production
cost for Peru’s large mines is about US$1.2–1.5 per pound, which is still significantly below the international price of
about US$2¼. And, to recover mega investments, new or amplified mines will need to produce, even at the currently
reduced margins. In contrast, low oil prices are no longer enough to cover production costs in Peru and oil
production has decelerated steadily.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PERU

assumes a continuation of the relatively low total factor productivity (TFP) growth seen on average
from 2011 to 2015. This is consistent with the historical relationship between commodity prices and
TFP growth. As additional mining capacity feeds into higher exports over the medium term, the
current account deficit is projected to approach the norm of 2 percent of GDP by 2021 under
current policies (Annex II). The authorities saw the exchange rate to be currently in line with
fundamentals, noting that EBA models do not fully account for future copper expansion. The staff’s
baseline fiscal scenario is in line with the current authorities’ projections envisaging consolidation
driven by their fiscal rule. Despite policy tightening, monetary aggregates should grow more than
nominal GDP due to financial deepening.
10.
Downside risks are similar to those in last year’s assessment. The authorities and the
staff agree that the main external risks to growth are: (i) structurally weak growth and disorderly
rebalancing (towards services production) in China, affecting metal prices; (ii) a stronger-thanexpected dollar; and (iii) sharp asset price adjustments and decompression of credit spreads
(Box 2). The spillovers from the crisis in Brazil have been negligible, with exports to Brazil
accounting for only 3 percent of total, and markets seeing the crisis as an idiosyncratic event and
not a representation of broader problems in emerging market economies. There is some upside
domestic risk to staff’s near-term forecast from further strengthening of non-primary sectors’
growth, already observed in Q1 2016, a possibly stronger pickup in sub-national investment,
improvement in TFP, and the widely-perceived investor-friendly outcome of the presidential
elections leading to larger-than-projected increases in confidence and investment.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Holding Tight
11.
The recent monetary tightening appropriately aimed at re-anchoring inflationary
expectations. Under the authorities’ and staff’s baseline scenarios, Peru’s small output gap would
be closed around end-2017. Observed and expected inflation outside the target band could be
reasons for tightening the monetary stance further. However, the declines in year-on-year inflation
since end-2015 and softer medium-term inflation expectations corroborate the BCRP’s current
wait-and-see approach. The authorities reaffirmed their view (and staff agreed) that future policy
moves should be guided by the drivers of future inflation, such as movements in inflation
expectations, and take into account the lags with which changes in the monetary policy stance
affect the economy. The authorities and staff exchanged views on the estimates of the exchange
rate pass-through to prices (Box 3), which fall into the range of 0.1−0.2 for 1 percent depreciation
depending on the methodology. The authorities and staff concurred that the pass through is high
for some non-tradable goods that are directly priced in U.S. dollars. Staff stressed the importance
of continued BCRP guidance so that temporary inflation shocks do not contaminate inflation
expectations. Staff remarked that a possibly steeper path of interest rate hikes in the United States
than currently priced in by financial markets could trigger the need for further rate increases in Peru
to address the inflationary impact of a weaker sol. And there could be some pressure from the
recent 13 percent increase in the national minimum wage; however, as discussed with the BCRP, the

pass-through of minimum wage increases to consumer price inflation is uncertain. Staff expects
inflation to be within the authorities’ target range in the medium term.

stated that Peru has been subjected to many supply
shocks in the past that did not warrant monetary policy action and that inflation excluding food
and fuels (around 2¼ percent over the last decade) has been lower than headline inflation. Their
choice of targeting a band range (rather than its midpoint) is understood by market participants.
The choice was driven by the level of U.S. inflation, as a higher domestic inflation target would lead
to a weaker currency and to lower demand for local currency, increasing dollarization.

13.
The commendable steady de-dollarization of credit portfolios has helped reduce
financial stability risks and improve the transmission of monetary policy to economic activity
and inflation. Discussions focused on the next steps for the de-dollarization process, which was
accelerated in 2015 owing to the BCRP’s measures. The increase in U.S. dollar deposits in 2015
squeezed local currency funding and the BCRP repos provided a mechanism to avoid a credit
crunch in local currency for now. Staff inquired whether these repos would be a long-standing
feature of Peru’s financial sector, with their associated distortions on credit growth and exchange
rate risks for the BCRP. The BCRP asserted that its long-run repo operations (using dollar deposits
as collateral) are of a transitory nature and will be wound down as domestic currency deposits pick
up again and de-dollarization continues.7 Both the BCRP and bank supervisors (SBS) see the
increase in U.S. dollar deposits as a temporary response of economic agents to expectations that
the sol would depreciate further during the year. Staff suggested that more stringent prudential
requirements could further help make FX deposits less attractive, although directly imposing higher
costs on holders of FX deposits could be seen as intruding on Peru’s constitutional right to transact
in foreign currencies. Staff also reiterated the need to develop other measures that could help dedollarization, such as creating incentives for diversifying savings and investment instruments (e.g.
deepening local-currency bond markets, and allowing retail sales of government bonds),8 as well as
continuing to move in the direction of allowing greater exchange rate flexibility.9

Substitution repos, which carry some FX exposure for the BCRP, constitute 3 percent of the NIR.
Local currency public domestic bonds are likely to become Euro-clearable in 2016, and authorities are working to
develop real estate investment trusts (REITs) akin to the Mexican model. Modifications to the Alternative Securities
Market scheme could also encourage higher issuances by medium-sized companies.

PERU

14.
Staff welcomed greater exchange rate
flexibility but saw room for further flexibility. While
continuing to lean against trend currency depreciation,
the BCRP has been letting the sol absorb the decline in
commodity prices, without a noticeable impact on firms’
balance sheets. Exchange rate volatility has been higher
than in previous non-crisis periods since 2013 even after
controlling for external shocks, but most of the exchange
rate depreciation in 2015 was limited to the U.S. dollar.
Staff reiterated that, while temporary intervention to
reduce excess volatility could be helpful, greater
exchange rate flexibility would keep the current account
balance closer to equilibrium levels, discourage risk
taking, and incentivize the development of FX derivatives
to support currency risk hedging. That would help dedollarization and would limit the need for measures to
alleviate banks’ balance sheet mismatches. While macrofinancial risks from FX lending appear limited—stress test
calculations by the SBS suggest that only about
11 percent of FX lending poses risks to banks’ capital,
which is much below headline dollarization levels—FX
leverage by firms and households still requires close
monitoring (Annex III).

stability continue to stand out when compared to other
emerging market economies and the country has been the recipient of significant foreign direct
investment in the past decade. Reclassifying Peru into the MSCI frontier market index due to the
perception of low liquidity (as has been contemplated by MSCI) would lead to a change in the
investor base, but, even if regrettable, authorities believe it would not have significant macrofinancial consequences. The Supervisor of the Stock Market (SMV) and the management of the
Lima stock exchange (BVL) have been taking important steps to increase market liquidity, including
a temporary exemption of the capital gains tax, to which the staff does not object, and providing
stronger incentives for market makers and stock lending.

B. Ensuring Stability and Creating Fiscal Space
16.
Projected under-execution of public capital spending suggests a broadly neutral fiscal
stance in 2016, although staff stressed the importance of delivering the budgeted spending,
excluding the provisions for a stronger El Niño. Under the escape clause, the 2016 deficit target
was increased to 3 percent of GDP to support the economy and to accommodate provisions for a
possibly stronger El Niño. As El Niño has now been downgraded, the authorities project the deficit
not to exceed 2.5 percent of GDP. Staff estimates an even lower deficit (about 2¼ percent of GDP),
making the fiscal stance neutral in structural terms. A projected small loss in income tax collection
(following further rate cuts spread over 2015–19) is expected to be more than offset by lower
current and capital spending, given lower historical execution of investment than budgeted, and
the fact that this is a government transition year. Revenues could surprise on the upside if growth
rises by more than projected. Staff advises the incoming government to concentrate on delivering
the originally budgeted capital spending and resist surpassing the budgeted current outlays, since
the economy is recovering, the external current account deficit is still high, and inflation
expectations need to remain well-anchored. There was broad agreement with the current
authorities that a significant fiscal impulse is not necessary given the economy’s ongoing recovery.
17.
With the output gap estimated to close around end-2017, staff supported fiscal
consolidation starting next year in line with Peru’s current fiscal rules. Effective delivery of
budgeted capital spending is important to support medium-term growth and social objectives.
However, any expansion of the expenditure envelope for infrastructure and social reforms beyond
the current framework would require the creation of additional fiscal space through revenue
generation, in order to preserve healthy debt dynamics and fiscal buffers. Staff reiterated Fund
advice to reach a ½ percent of GDP primary surplus in the medium term. Such a target would

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PERU

stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio well below 30 percent,10 and protect the fiscal buffers necessary to
shield Peru against natural disasters, commodity price shocks, and the risk of realization of
contingent liabilities totaling 8 percent of GDP (including from public-private partnerships). It
would also help ensure the sustainability of pensions and Peru’s preparedness for longer-term
demographic shifts.11
18.
The newly elected Fiscal Council became operational in January 2016. As required by
law, the Council provided a non-binding opinion on the three-year macro fiscal framework released
in April 2016, which generally forms the basis for the following year’s budget and the medium-term
fiscal outlook. In the council’s view, the authorities’ medium-term estimates of growth in Peru are
somewhat optimistic, especially given the difficult external environment. They recommended
bigger adjustments in expenditures than projected to ensure fiscal sustainability and the credibility
of the fiscal rule.

the expenditure limit must adjust, counter cyclically, by up to ¼ of the output gap or 0.5 percent of GDP. When new tax measures yield a permanent change in revenue of
0.3 percent of GDP or more, the expenditure limit changes accordingly.
3/ In the first seven months of election years, two additional limits apply: (1) budget execution of national government’s primary spending cannot exceed 60 percent of
the annual budget and; (2) no measures can be taken that increase future current spending or reduce the fiscal space for the future administration.

19.
Peru’s tax burden is low and policy efforts should focus on improving revenue
collection while avoiding tax rate cuts. Peru has come a long way in improving the efficiency of
the tax system but further efforts are needed to reap the full benefits from these reforms. Peru’s
tax-to-GDP ratio, slightly above 15 percent, remains below the regional average, and is even lower
than this average if commodity-related income is stripped out. Staff discussed a number of areas
where improvements can be achieved, based on recommendations from the substantial technical
assistance provided in this area, and advised against further reductions in tax rates (Annex IV). The
10

In this connection, it will also be important to follow closely the evolution of private savings as a recent law allows
retirees to cash in 90 percent of their private pension funds instead of receiving the equivalent monthly pension for
the rest of their lives. A fast depletion of these savings poses a social contingent liability to the public accounts.

tax agency (SUNAT) agreed with the proposals, and was receptive to the recommendations in the
area of international taxation.12 SUNAT has its own action plan to raise collections that will need to
be supported through the introduction of complementary structural reforms, which would help
formalize the economy. While not following through with revenue increases if boosting investment
spending further could still keep debt-to-GDP ratios below the fiscal rule’s 30 percent (Figure 8),
this strategy would carry reputational risks and, if followed, would have to provide a credible
medium-term anchor to stabilize debt dynamics.

(Table 6, Box 4). Implementation capacity needs further
improvement, especially at the sub-national level, including for project selection and quality
assurance for large projects under the System of National Public Investment to ensure adequate
returns from public investment, while assessment of small projects could also be centralized. Efforts
should commence to prepare the new investment pipeline, so it is ready once current megaprojects (e.g., metro line, gas pipeline, highway, and airport) come to fruition. While investment
could be increased through public private partnerships, as has been done in the past, a system of
risk evaluation under the current framework should be enhanced to insure against contingent
liabilities to the state.

countries, and strong regulatory constraints that
preclude more dynamic job creation in the formal sector. Labor market reforms should introduce
more flexibility in hiring and firing decisions. The authorities indicated that the accession process to
the OECD could play a key role in triggering reforms, especially in the labor market, and that for the
first time since the mid-1990s, there will be a congressional majority that may see such reforms
favorably. However, they also saw the current social mood as a risk to a fast pace of reforms.
According to many stakeholders, Peru is well placed to reap the full benefits from free trade
agreements, including the TPP (through direct access to new markets, higher exports to current
trading partners, and innovation and job creation as regulatory systems of TPP nations become

compatible); the effect of the TPP on potential growth could be material if accompanied by the
supporting domestic reforms mentioned above. Possible revenue losses from the requirement of
eliminating 60 percent of nonzero tariffs would be very small and could be offset by correcting
weakness in tax collections and closing loopholes.
22.
Despite significant progress in poverty reduction and inclusion, further efforts are
necessary to improve social indicators and, thus, potential growth. Over the past year, the
poverty rate fell by ½ percentage point to 21.8 percent. The five main programs of targeted
assistance have been delivering important results such as higher student enrollment, reduced
malnutrition, and greater integration of women into the labor force, and the authorities’ objectives
going forward continue to be ambitious. Peru has also achieved one of the highest rates of
education coverage in Latin America through radical reforms in the sector. These reforms should
continue in full force to further improve the still-low quality of education (measured by student test
scores and teachers’ proficiency tests), reach higher staffing levels, and address the widespread lack
of adequate facilities. The National Financial Inclusion strategy launched in July 2015 sets targets
for financial inclusion; and the interoperable mobile money platform—a private sector-led initiative
―could help to achieve them (Box, Annex III). Staff commended the authorities for their efforts and
agreed that these areas should continue to be an integral part of the next government’s
development and inclusion strategy.

After decelerating sharply in 2014, economic activity recovered last year despite a
volatile external environment. The recovery largely reflected additional mining production
capacity coming on stream, although non-mining activity has also accelerated modestly more
recently. An expected increase in mining exports, together with some rebound in public investment,
will impart a strong positive impetus on growth going forward, which should spillover to noncommodity sectors. Thus, despite sluggish external conditions, activity is expected to accelerate
further in 2016 and 2017, while inflation continues to decline.

Risks to the outlook are balanced. External pressures have carried over from last year and
comprise possibly weaker-than-projected growth in China (and, hence, softer metal prices),
possible adverse spillovers from other countries in the region (though these should be relatively
small), sharp asset price adjustments in advanced and emerging economies, and an even stronger
dollar. The response to shocks should be through further exchange rate flexibility and easing
liquidity conditions to support credit activity. Upside domestic risks include stronger-than-expected
improvements in business confidence (especially if the incoming government announces decisive
productivity-enhancing reforms) and a more effective execution of the existing pipeline of
infrastructure projects, which could lift growth further in 2016–17 and beyond.
25.
Monetary and exchange rate policies should remain attentive to rapidly changing
conditions. Following monetary tightening, the BCRP should now maintain a wait-and-see
stance—given declining inflation and medium-term inflation expectations, the fact that it is too
soon to evaluate the effect of past monetary tightening on economic activity and inflation, and the
usual uncertainties surrounding the exact cyclical position of an economy. This said, a possibly
steeper interest rate path in the United States than currently priced by the financial market could
trigger the need for further monetary tightening in Peru. Greater exchange rate flexibility in 2015
was a welcome development with no noticeable impact on firms’ and banks’ balance sheets; the
latter remain healthy and profitable. Further decline in credit de-dollarization has been achieved
not least due to the measures introduced by the BCRP. Further exchange rate flexibility would
support the development of hedging instruments to reduce currency risk and help accelerate the
de-dollarization process. Recent measures to deepen Peru’s equity market are also welcome.
26.
A gradual fiscal consolidation in the next few years is advisable to maintain healthy
debt dynamics and to protect fiscal buffers. With the output gap closing around end 2017, there
is no case for loosening fiscal policy. A gradual fiscal consolidation would be important for ensuring
the sustainability of pensions, and defending against natural disasters and realization of contingent
liabilities. To accommodate higher-than-projected public capital spending, it will be critical to
create adequate fiscal space through containing current spending that is not complementary to
capital expansion and structural reforms (including in health and education), and raising the low
revenue collection through streamlining administration, reducing informality and exemptions, and
protecting Peru’s tax base from possible international profit shifting by multinational corporations.
Reducing bottlenecks to public investment and improving management would go a long way
toward enabling full execution of budgeted spending and would support private investment.
27.
With the end of commodity-driven growth, the agenda for growth-spurring structural
reforms has become a higher priority, including for further poverty reduction. Investments in
capital and labor will be needed to boost potential growth, which is otherwise estimated to be
3½ percent in the absence of continued reforms. Long-standing challenges include reducing
informality, which should be in part addressed through labor market reforms aiming at lowering
the costs of hiring and firing workers, and spurring investment in non-extractive industries,
including through improving competitiveness and infrastructure. Peru’s current decentralization
framework should be improved, as it constrains full execution of planned capital expansion and

better allocation of resources. While Peru has achieved one of the highest rates of education
coverage in Latin America, the low quality of education remains a crucial challenge, and the
ongoing reforms will need to continue. Efforts to raise financial inclusion are commendable,
especially through the launch of the broad-based National Financial Inclusion Strategy and the
private sector-led e-money platform. Free trade agreements also provide an opportunity for
boosting and diversifying long-term growth.
28.
Staff would like to relay their appreciation to the outgoing administration for the
constructive dialogue and look forward to working with the new government. It is expected
that the next Article IV consultation will take place on a 12-month cycle.

A Financial Conditions Index (FCI) provides a
quantitative assessment of overall financial
conditions in the economy. The index considers
different transmission channels from monetary
policy to financial variables (e.g., spreads, exchange
rate, asset prices, etc.) that influence the future
state of the economy. The FCI can also be used to
compare the relative stance of financial conditions
in different periods of time.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in

indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50
percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the
authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Box 3. Peru: Exchange Rate Pass-Through to Inflation1
The BCRP considers that the rising U.S. dollar explained 2/3 of inflation in 2015, with a exchange rate passthrough (ERPT) coefficient of 0.16 percentage point (pp) for a 1-percent depreciation of the sol. IMF staff has
followed two research strategies to estimate the extent of ERPT to inflation in Peru.
First, staff has analyzed how movements in the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) would affect inflation
in Latin American (LA) countries using a uniform cross-country methodology, as described in the Spring
2016 Regional Economic Outlook for the Americas (REO). This analysis suggests that the ERPT is low in LA. If
inflation expectations are well-anchored and the ERPT to import prices is complete, the ERPT to inflation
should be close to the import content of consumption, which is relatively low in Latin America. An
econometric analysis shows that countries with an inflation targeting (IT) framework and with flexible
exchange rates exhibit even lower ERPT. For example, the pass-through for IT emerging countries is
16 percent, while it is 52 percent for non-IT emerging countries. Peru is a case in point, with the lowest
import content in the region and a statistically insignificant ERPT. With an ERPT point estimate of only about
0.06, the small NEER depreciation in 2014–2015 would have contributed marginally to the inflation increase.

However, many contracts in Peru are set in U.S. dollars and a focus on an aggregate econometric strategy
using NEER could miss the effect of movements in the bilateral exchange rate on particular consumer price
categories. Estimates of ERPT for large CPI groupings using the most relevant exchange rate definition for
each category (for instance, the US$/sol for rent and electricity fares, but the NEER for food products and
clothing) show a higher and statistically significant overall ERPT of about 0.1 for the Peruvian economy. Once
the larger depreciation of the sol with respect to the U.S. dollar since December 2014 (14 percent) is taken
into account, staff estimates that ERPT accounted for about 50 basis points of the year-over-year inflation
increase in Peru from December 2014 (3.2 percent) to December 2015 (4.4 percent), still below the
authorities’ estimates.

when growth slowed. However, efforts were largely
derailed by bureaucratic and regulatory hurdles, lingering weaknesses in PIM, and the unfinished
decentralization process which hampered spending at the local level.

Important improvements will be necessary to achieve a greater bang for every sol invested. So far, Peru
is placed at 112th place out of 140 countries for quality of overall infrastructure by the World Economic
Forum. Staff estimates of public investment efficiency also points to sub-par outcomes. The PIM system
will need to be improved, especially in the areas of multiyear budgeting and national and sectoral

Change in gross public sector debt

Sources: National authorities and Fund staff estimates.
1/ Public sector is defined as non-financial public sector.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Bond Spread over U.S. Bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 4 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
8/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Annex I. Implementation of Past IMF Recommendations
1.
By and large, Peruvian authorities have been appreciative of staff advice and research
contributions. Peru is also one of the highest recipients of Fund’s technical assistance, especially in
the fiscal area. Consistent with past Fund advice, the authorities pushed to improve the execution of
public investment but this was derailed by issues stemming from excessive paperwork, the
unfinished decentralization process, and poor sub-national capacity. The authorities have been
making efforts to improve tax collection to offset revenue losses, and improve fiscal transparency.
Recommendations on the design of the structural fiscal rule were also taken into account when the
methodology was recently amended. Greater exchange rate flexibility was allowed in 2015, in line
with staff advice. A majority of 2011 FSAP recommendations have been implemented.

Annex II. External Sector Assessment
Overall, Peru’s current external position is assessed to be moderately weaker than fundamentals with
a moderately positive real effective exchange rate gap and a current account deficit wider than the
estimated norm. However, under current policies and given small Peru-specific policy gaps, the current
account is expected to gradually narrow closer to its norm in the medium term, financed mostly by
longer-term capital flows. In addition, Peru’s reserve position remains strong and external debt
remains low.
1.
The current account deteriorated
somewhat in 2015. The current account deficit
has widened by ½ percent of GDP to 4.4 percent
of GDP in 2015. Falling copper prices
significantly weighed on the trade balance,
despite an improvement in mineral export
volumes as new production came on-stream.
The deterioration in the trade balance was fully
offset by lower profit payments, which declined
by some 34 percent. In addition, current
transfers fell ½ percent of GDP, back to their
historical trend. Over the medium term, the
current account should narrow as copper
production is expected to double by 2018, and
would remain financed mainly by FDI flows.

2.
The real effective exchange rate depreciated little since the 2015 Article IV
Consultation and is moderately strong (Table above). Model-based estimates currently indicate
moderately weaker fundamentals, but only a small part of the CA gap (0.4 percentage points) results
from policy gaps. However, staff expects that the current account will narrow by about 1¼ percent
of GDP—the amount required to close the gap with the estimated norm—over the medium term,
owing to an increase in copper exports. The REER level regression results reported in the table
above have historically shown large residuals for Peru and therefore are considered less reliable than
other estimates.
3.
Peru’s net IIP liabilities and foreign participation in the local bond market have
historically been sizeable but do not pose immediate risks. A large increase in FDI liabilities over
the past decade, especially in mining, and in private sector debt has coincided with a significant
increase in foreign assets. And while large, most IIP liabilities have long maturities, with short-term
external debt not exceeding 4 percent of GDP. Non-resident holdings of domestic public debt are
also significant, albeit declining, and Peru’s total public debt remains modest, attenuating risks from
a sudden reversal of investor appetite.

4.
Peru’s international reserves comfortably exceed adequacy metrics despite sizable
foreign exchange intervention. Gross reserves stood at US$61 billion. The BCRP has sold
significant amounts of FX (US$8 billion in spot sales) to limit exchange rate volatility (in addition to
sales of swaps) and required high reserves against FX deposits with commercial banks. A significant
part of the NIR consists of domestic FX liabilities—including the Fiscal Stabilization Fund,
commercial banks’ reserves requirements on FX deposits, and deposits corresponding to FX repos—
which are mostly of longer-term nature and do not pose short-term risks to reserves—repos have
2−5 year maturities, access to FSF resources is limited by law, and high commercial banks’ reserve
requirements on dollar deposits protect against dollar liquidity risks. Even when adjusting the NIR
for theses liabilities, reserves remain within the adequacy range. Reserves also remain adequate
when augmenting the ARA metric with a commodity price buffer (US$4 billion based on prices at
68 percent of the confidence interval of futures data)—they stood at 250 percent of the augmented
metric, and excluding commercial bank deposits, at 162 percent of the augmented metric. Such
higher precautionary liquidity could be useful to buffer against sudden drops in commodity prices
and smooth adjustment to commodity price changes.

Annex III. Macro-Financial Stability Update
A.

Overall Macro-Financial Stability

1.
Peru remains broadly stable in macro-financial terms. Market and liquidity risks have
risen slightly, while inward spillover risks declined. Purely domestic monetary and financial
conditions have eased, despite the policy interest rate hikes from September 2015 to February 2016.
With the exception of risk appetite and monetary and financial conditions, these trends are broadly
consistent with the corresponding global risks as reported in the April 2016 Global Financial Stability
Report (GFSR).

Financial Sector Risk Assessment

2.
As of end-2015, the financial sector faces medium vulnerability risks, with adequate
buffers to contain them (Map). Credit growth has been robust, consistent with the pickup in
economic activity in 2015 and continued financial deepening.1 Banks are sufficiently capitalized and
liquid, reporting highest profitability and return on assets since end-2012. Non-performing loans
(NPL) appear to have stabilized, and are sufficiently provisioned for. Non-bank deposit-taking
institutions (micro-enterprises, and small and medium enterprises) have higher NPLs than banks, as
they are more sensitive to the economic cycle, but they constitute only a small part of financial
system assets (7 percent).2

1

The ratio of private sector credit to GDP in Peru (42 percent in 2015) is lower than expected for a country with its
population and income levels. Benchmarks used according to Finstats 2016.
2

In 2015, the SBS took receivership of one caja (a small cooperative), while other small intermediaries continued to
struggle, as their portfolios (concentrated in small firms) have deteriorated. However, systemic risk is limited due to
the small share of cajas in total financial sector assets and an expected wave of consolidation in the sector.

Dollarization remains a structural risk, albeit with recent asymmetric trends between
credit and deposits. Total credit dollarization has declined rapidly, ahead of BCRP targets, to
27.4 percent in January 2016, with SBS estimates of banks' net exposure to FX risk deemed even
lower at around 11 percent (due to collateral and hedging). However, deposit dollarization remains
relatively high at around 45 percent, as individuals sought protection against currency depreciation.
While there is a growing divergence between the currency matching of loans and deposits, banks
have been able to de-dollarize their loan portfolios ahead of deposits, as the BCRP has provided
soles through repo operations with 2−5 year maturities, thus supporting credit creation in local
currency.

about 1/4 of total—are vulnerable to large and abrupt
currency depreciations, but actual risks seem manageable. These firms do not have natural FX
hedges and are, thus, exposed to currency risk since the bulk of their external issuances are
denominated in U.S. dollars. Sectors with large FX asset-to-liability gaps, notably the construction
and consumer sectors, suffered the largest FX losses when the sol depreciated in 2015. Nevertheless,
estimated FX losses in the aggregate corporate sector were only 0.2 percent of total earnings, as
large gains in the mining offset losses in other sectors. Refinancing risks for bonds remain moderate
overall as most of debt is at long maturities and fixed interest rates. A recent BCRP survey also
showed that a significant portion of the bond proceeds were used for in-house investment as well
as to re-profile the existing debt. Some companies conducted debt management operations to
increase the share of local currency debt in 2015.

Asset price developments do not point to serious risks to either corporations or

financial portfolios. Stock prices have been declining since early 2012 in line with commodity prices,
but recovered since January 2016 in line with international developments. Measures were taken
recently to increase market liquidity. Housing prices, as reflected by the median apartment prices in
Lima, appear high although the price increases since the second half of 2014 have been more
subdued than in the previous four years (the average annual growth of apartment prices (in
constant soles) from 2011 to first half of 2014 was 14 percent). This may not accurately reflect the
segmentation in the market, where there is an oversupply of high-end condominiums in certain
residential areas in Lima while low-income housing is in short supply.

Peru: Progress in Financial Inclusion
Financial inclusion in Peru remains one of the lowest in the region. Only 29 and 12 percent of adults
have an account and saved at a formal financial institution, respectively, and credit penetration is only
42 percent. This reflects in part the large informality of the Peruvian economy, as well as geographical
challenges in extending financial services to rural areas where a significant segment of the population
resides.
Both public and private sectors have been making inroads into improving access to finance. The
authorities (through a multi-sectoral committee) launched the National Financial Inclusion Strategy in
July 2015, targeting to increase the access to personal accounts to 50 percent by 2018, and 75 percent by
2021. In the private sector, more than 30 financial institutions and four telecommunications companies
formed a partnership, Modelo Peru, to jointly build a fully-interoperable mobile money platform (BiM). The
creation of this platform was enabled under the 2013 law on electronic money.
BiM is a unique platform with high potential. It is targeting five million users in five years through the use
of mobile phones. The platform aims to create a digital ecosystem by enabling services across financial
service providers and mobile networks in the country. Users open a simplified transaction account tied to
their national ID and phone number, and are able to access the platform even on relatively low-tech devices.
As of end-April 2016, there were nine e-money issuers participating, with twenty more expected to join by
end-year. Three major telecommunications companies have also joined, with the fourth scheduled to join
soon. While it is too early to evaluate the effectiveness of BiM, initial indicators of user take-up are
encouraging.

Annex IV. Measures to Improve Tax Revenues
1.
Peru has come a long way in improving the efficiency of the tax system. In the last
30 years, Peru has successfully progressed from depending largely on trade taxes and a number of
small taxes and fees, to a modern regime based on a General Sales Tax (GST) and Income Taxes (IT),
with relatively few exemptions. However, tax-to-GDP ratios, slightly above 15 percent, are still below
the regional average. The end of the super commodity cycle, 2014 tax rate reductions, and lower
potential growth have pushed further down the road raising that ratio to 18 percent, originally a
2016 objective. Continuing social and infrastructure gaps call for alternative revenue enhancing
measures to be adopted in the coming years.
2.
Reforming the fiscal regime for the mining sector in 2011 was a remarkable
accomplishment. The government’s share in the mining sector was relatively low when the
commodity boom started since hardly any royalties were levied and the mining industry benefited
from widespread fiscal stability agreements granted by the tax authority. The current administration
successfully introduced new profit based and progressive mining royalties, with only a few
corporations sticking to their stability agreements. However, with the drop in prices, royalty
collections also dropped sharply.
3.
The motivation of the tax reform in 2014 was to spur domestic demand, increase
competitiveness of Peruvian corporations, and streamline the tax system. Income tax and some
excise rates were cut, and a number of specific investment incentives were granted; additionally,
some important steps were taken to simplify the complex system of withholding and drawbacks.
While some of these measures will improve efficiency, several of them will have a significant fiscal
cost. Although the cuts to the Corporate Income Tax (CIT) were accompanied with an increase in the
withholding tax on dividends, the measure effectively provides more liquidity for companies to
reinvest, deferring dividend distributions and hence also tax collection.
4.
Given the new macroeconomic landscape, and lower fiscal intake owing to lower
commodity prices and tax rate cuts, the tax policy agenda will need to reemphasize recouping
tax revenue losses while overcoming important structural challenges. The tax agency (SUNAT)
still faces the difficult task of enforcing a complex system, in a context of high levels of informality
and evasion.


Complexity. The various and widespread GST withholding schemes are costly to manage, but
they guarantee a minimum amount of revenue. Enforcing a system more reliant on voluntary
compliance may carry some risks, but it is more efficient and Peru has rightly moved in that
direction; the system can be further simplified as SUNAT’s institutional capabilities are improved.
This effort would help reducing the current high level of tax in dispute (tax under litigation is
larger than yearly tax revenues), which undercuts the incentive to formalize.



Fiscal stability agreements. There were 877 agreements in 2014, meaning that there were as
many potentially different special regimes to control. Aside from the possible distortions and
administrative complexity this implies, continuing to grant these agreements is hardly justified;

50

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PERU

Peru today has solid macroeconomic, institutional and social credentials, sufficient to foster an
attractive investment climate. The reduction in CIT rates should be an opportunity to eliminate a
good number of these agreements, as investors may surrender them to benefit from the tax cut.


International taxation. Peru’s tax system is adapting to its increasing integration to the world
economy, so that cross-border business has clear rules and double taxation is minimized.
However, this also entails risks, with increasing exposure to profit shifting and tax base erosion
by multinational enterprises. Peru has a number of specific anti-avoidance rules to protect its tax
base, which is an appropriate strategy given its administrative capabilities, but some of these
rules can be improved.1 It is important as well that Peru’s treaty policy does not undermine this
tax base protection in domestic law; special attention should be given to taxation of capital
gains on indirect sales of Peruvian assets and improving the capability of exchanging
information (Peru has very strict banking secrecy laws).



Subnational taxation (property tax). Local revenues are relatively low in Peru and there is ample
space to increase property tax collection. An essential aspect of this effort should to be to
change how properties are valued for tax purposes, bringing the base closer to market values,
together with modernizing the administration of local cadastres. This would not only increase
revenues, but also improve the progressivity of the whole system



Subnational taxation (canon). The decline in commodity prices has underscored the
inappropriateness of too-heavy reliance on volatile natural resource revenue, and the
assignment of the mining canon to subnational governments should be revisited—with the
goals of switching to more stable sources of income for subnational governments, achieving a
better distribution of canon across localities affected by the mineral extraction, and using the
canon more effectively to fund larger infrastructure projects.

WORLD BANK RELATIONS
(As of March 29, 2016)

A. Bank Group Strategy
The World Bank Group support to Peru is defined in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)
approved by the Board on February 1, 2012. The CPS is closely aligned with the Government’s
strategic vision of strong economic growth with greater inclusion and is focused on four strategic
objectives: (i) increased access and quality of social services for the poor; (ii) connecting the poor to
services and markets; (iii) sustainable growth and productivity; and (iv) inclusive governance and
public sector performance. The CPS also addresses cross-cutting issues such as those of governance
and gender. The CPS is a result of extensive consultations with government and civil society.
The indicative lending program is at about US$250 million per annum, reflecting Government’s
interest in policy reform support through Development Policy Lending and in reform
implementation support through an investment lending program. The strategy includes
development policy lending operations in the fiscal, social, and environmental sectors mainly
through deferred drawdown options.
Peru’s current lending portfolio includes 20 active projects with a commitment of US$1.7 billion and
an undisbursed balance of US$1.5 billion. In addition to 14 on-going investment lending operations,
there are two active DPL-DDOs (Development Policy Loans with Deferred Drawdown Option) and
two DPL with a CAT DDO (Catastrophes Deferred Drawdown Options) and two GEFs. The GOP took
the DPL-DDOs during the 2008–09 global financial crisis as part of its overall strategy to ensure
adequate contingency funding. New lending commitments since the start of the CPS period total
US$310 million in seven new projects. Some large investment projects (for example, the Lima
Metro II project) and a new CAT-DDO are expected to increase the commitment amounts
significantly during the second half of the CPS implementation period (FY 15–FY 16).
As Peru is becoming a stronger middle income country, demand for knowledge services is
increasing. This growing demand for knowledge is reflected in the increase in the number of
Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS) arrangements in Peru with the Bank in Education, Social
Protection, Financial Inclusion, Disaster Risk Management, Water Resource Management, Water
Supply and Sanitation, and Justice sectors. In addition to this new stream of RASs, the Bank has
continued to provide analytical services, hands-on support to improve capacities, South-South and
South-North knowledge exchanges and just-in-time support on a variety of issues as demanded by
the clients.
Finally, the Bank’s TF portfolio (currently over US$21 million considering GEF) complements other
WB support in the current core engagement areas of this CPS by providing valuable Analytic and
Advisory Activities and technical assistance. They support the harmonization and alignment of
funding from various development partners behind core government programs.

B. Bank-Fund Collaboration in Specific Areas
OECD. Peru has formally declared its intention to join the OECD by 2021. In July 2014, Peru’s
Minister of Finance requested support from the WBG for the preparation of the Country Program
that consists essentially of about 18 OECD institutional assessments of Peru. While the Bank is
finalizing the framework for this technical assistance, it will coordinate the work with other
development partners, including with the Fund.
Policy notes. To support the policy debate heading into the Peruvian political transition next
July 2016, the WBG will complete a series of policy notes in FY 16. Areas of analysis include: food
chains and nutrition, diversified growth, development of mid-sized cities, and connectivity.
Tax reform and fiscal decentralization. While the Fund has been active in providing various
technical assistance missions in the tax area, the Bank has finalized a study on Taxation and Equity,
looking at the challenges of increasing tax collection equitably. Jointly with the World Bank and IDB,
staff has worked on drafting laws and regulations for fiscal decentralization. The World Bank has
also focused on the design and implementation of decentralization of the social sectors and propoor spending policies.
Customs administration modernization. A needs assessment mission was undertaken together
with the IMF to develop an action plan for modernizing customs administration. The joint team
presented a technical report to SUNAT.
Public sector management. Bank-Fund collaboration has focused in the area of results based
budgeting, the implementation of a Treasury Single Account and modernization of budget
processes, institutions and information systems.

RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK
A. Country Strategy
Peru’s current Country Strategy covers the period 2012–16. The strategy has two pillars for the
Bank’s assistance to the Peruvian authorities by supporting (i) their efforts to close economic and
social gaps that still persist between urban and rural areas; and (ii) productivity gains as the main
basis for inclusive, and sustainable economic growth.
IDB’s strategic engagement with Peru focus on nine areas: (i) social inclusion; (ii) rural development
and agriculture; (iii) housing and urban development; (iv) climate change and disaster risk
management; (v) water, sanitation, water resources, and solid waste; (vi) energy; (vii) transportation;
(viii) public management; and (ix) competitiveness and innovation.
The Country Strategy is under implementation. The Bank has worked with the government on a
multi-sector and multi-annual approach of articulated interventions addressing, in a coordinated
fashion, various development gaps at the same time. Also, the Bank’s intention is to diversify the
instruments of support to the country. Innovation in instruments include service contracts with the
government in priority areas (“fee for services”), larger private sector operations, and extended use
of knowledge sharing and technical cooperation.
The Bank’s financial engagement scenario would entail negative net flows to the country between
2012 and 2016, particularly because of the Peruvian early repayment in 2013 to the IDB of 5 loan
balances for a total amount of US$1,232 million. However, this does not affect the base scenario,
where the Bank will maintain its share as a creditor in Peru’s total multilateral debt. The lending
framework for the strategy is consistent with the demand assumptions and the external financing
strategy of the government.

B. Lending
As of March 2016, the Bank’s portfolio of active, public sector operations consisted of 22 loans for a
total amount of US$1,479 million, including 2 policy-based loans with a deferred disbursement
modality for a total amount of US$600 million. The rest of the active portfolio consists of 20 loans
for an amount of US$879 million, of which US$220.4 million (25 percent) have been disbursed. The
public sector lending program for 2015 comprised five operations for a total of US$700 million,
including the 2 policy-based loans for US$300 million each. The public sector lending program for
2016 comprises three investment loans for a total amount of US$200 million.

US$670.2 million. The IDB Group private sector operations are distributed in the following sectors:
Oil and Gas, 44 percent; Energy, 24 percent; Financial Intermediaries, 20 percent; Agro-business,
6 percent; Education, 5 percent; and Tourism, 1 percent.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
General. Macroeconomic statistics are broadly adequate for policy formulation, surveillance, and
monitoring. Peru subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). A data ROSC was
prepared and published in 2003.
Despite progress in recent years, there is scope for improvement in the following areas:
(i) coordination among the agencies that compile official statistics to avoid duplication of efforts;
(ii) expanding the coverage of the wholesale price index to include mining, oil and gas extraction,
electricity and water, public transportation, and communication; (iii) finalizing the migration to the
standardized report forms for monetary data with the introduction of report forms for the central
bank, other depository corporations, and other financial corporations; and (iv) expanding the scope
of data sources for compiling financial flows of individual residents.
National accounts. In 2014, the National Statistics Office (INEI) released a new national account
series implementing the 1993 SNA and using 2007 as the base year.
Price statistics. At the present time, the official measure of inflation for Peru is the CPI for
Metropolitan Lima, compiled and published by INEI. Starting in January 2010, the Metropolitan Lima
CPI has been compiled using updated weights based on the 2008/09 Encuesta Nacional de
Presupuestos Familiares (ENAPREF). Since January 2011, city level indices have been compiled and
disseminated for the 24 departmental capitals and another large urban area using weights from the
2008/09 ENAPREF and a methodology matching that employed for the Metropolitan Lima CPI.
A new law issued in 2009 requires the INEI to compile a new national level CPI that will serve as the
official CPI for Peru in the future. An STA mission on the CPI was conducted in May 2–13, 2011 to
evaluate the methodology of the new national CPI index. The new national level CPI, starting with
the January 2012 index, was disseminated since February 2012 The WPI, statistical techniques used
to compile the index generally follow international standards but the weights for the WPI are
outdated, and were derived from the 1994 input-output table and other reports and publications of
relevant ministries.
Labor market statistics. The authorities monitor labor market developments using four indicators:
open unemployment, underemployment, employment, and remunerations. While monthly
unemployment, employment and income data for metropolitan area of Lima from INEI are timely,
only urban employment indexes are available from the Ministry of Labor for other areas and with
some delays; monthly remuneration data for the government are timely but the monthly
remuneration data for the private sector are no longer available. The nationwide unemployment and
underemployment situation is surveyed quarterly. It would be useful to expand the coverage of
labor statistics to national level and develop competitiveness indicators such as productivity and unit
labor cost indexes.

Government financial statistics. The Central Bank (BCRP) compiles government finance statistics
(GFS) following the GFSM2001, for the general government and its subsectors. Data for all
subsectors are reported on a cash basis and financial assets and liabilities are reported at face value.
The authorities have not yet sent to the Fund information on the components of expenditures by
function. The coverage of published national budget data is narrower than the fiscal statistics
prepared for the combined public sector. The authorities report data for publication in the
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) using the GFSM 2001. No high frequency data is
reported for publication in International Financial Statistics (IFS).
Monetary statistics. The BCRP compiles and publishes the analytical accounts of the central bank,
depository corporations, and financial corporations broadly in line with the methodology
recommended by the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. The main divergences are the
exclusion of the deposits of other financial corporations, state and local governments, and public
nonfinancial corporations from the definition of broad money; and valuation of some financial
assets held to maturity at cost rather than at market prices or at the lower of cost or market price for
investment securities. At the request of the authorities, a mission visited the country in January 2007
to assist with the migration to the new standardized report forms (SRFs) for reporting monetary data
to the IMF. The mission finalized the SRF for the central bank, recommending improvements in the
classification and sectorization of some accounts. A follow-up mission took place in September
2008. The mission completed the work on the SRF for the central bank and developed a bridge table
linking the source data reported by banks to the BCRP to the report form 2SR (other depository
corporations). The mission identified shortcomings in the management of the database that
generate the accounts of the other depository corporations sector at the BCRP. Although the two
technical assistant missions finalized the groundwork for the migration to the SRFs, the BCRP has
not yet started reporting monetary data using the SRFs. No set date is foreseen for the migration to
the SRFs.
Financial soundness indicators. Peru started reporting data and metadata for financial soundness
indicators (FSIs) with a quarterly frequency in June 2011.
External sector statistics. The BCRP prepares quarterly data on the balance of payments and
international investment position largely in line with the recommendations of the fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). Data are reported to the Fund for publication in the IFS and
the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook. Departures from BPM5 include the lack of coverage of
assets held abroad and land acquisition abroad by residents; and not recording on an accrual basis
some external debt transactions.
The BCRP has been reporting since August 2001 weekly data on international reserves in accordance
with the Operational Guidelines for Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency
Liquidity. Since August 2006, the BCRP is including the full amount of the liquidity requirements in
the reserve template both under official reserve assets and as a contingent net drain (as specified in
Section III of the Data Template). Peru disseminates quarterly data on external debt with an eight
week lag on the National Summary Data Page with a hyperlink to the Fund’s website.
