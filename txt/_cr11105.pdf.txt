Executive Summary


The economic rebound has leveled off. Tanzania weathered the impact of the global
financial crisis relatively well, with growth in 2010 estimated at 7 percent. However,
activity may now be softening under the impact of below-normal rainfall. Consumer
price inflation is rising largely due to supply factors. The economy should rebound
quickly once the weather situation normalizes and return to an annual growth rate of
7-7½ percent over the medium term.



Large investments are expected to increase the weight of commodity sectors in
Tanzania’s output and exports. Policies should aim to preserve the competitiveness
of non-commodity sectors, including emerging manufacturing exports, through
forceful efforts to improve the business environment (including governance), also in a
regional context.



Rapid population growth is putting pressure on the delivery of public services,
far outpacing the growth of domestic revenue and foreign aid. A combination of
spending rationalization, tax policy reforms and enhanced public financial
management will be called for to maintain fiscal balance. Although an effective
reform of tax and spending policies requires time, there is some urgency in providing
a signal to investors and donors of the authorities’ intentions at the time of the
2011/12 budget. The authorities are committed to embark on a path of fiscal
consolidation and more realistic budgets. Staff recognizes, however, that next year’s
spending containment plans are ambitious in view of the need to safeguard priority
spending. Attainment of the authorities’ budget targets may be challenging if the risk
of donor aid shortfalls and higher international fuel prices were to materialize.



Revenue collection in 2010/11 is falling short of ambitious budget targets, partly
because of the adverse weather situation. In spite of recent spending cuts, a
financing gap may remain. The authorities are determined to align spending with
available resources while strictly enforcing commitment controls to prevent a further
accumulation of arrears.



Staff recommends the completion of the second review under the PSI. All
quantitative assessment criteria have been met and structural reforms are advancing,
even if with some delays. Staff supports the authorities’ request for modification of
the end-June 2011 assessment criterion on international reserves and re-phasing of
structural benchmarks.

5
I. BACKGROUND
1.
The economy has performed strongly over the past decade and progress has
been made towards the MDGs. Tanzania’s tradition of peaceful elections has provided a
solid basis for private sector development. Growth has averaged 7 percent since 2000. The
country’s abundant natural resources have spurred a robust expansion in exports, and
opportunities remain plentiful. The authorities have implemented wide-ranging policy
reforms over the past decades and recently were able to use the fiscal space accumulated in
better years to mitigate the impact of the global financial crisis.
2.
However, Tanzania faces formidable challenges. Per capita income is about
US$550, reflecting earlier decades of stagnation and high population growth. Poverty
declined only slightly over the last decade and remains widespread, with one in three living
below the poverty line.1 Tanzania is highly dependent on foreign aid, projected to peak at
10 percent of GDP this year.2
3.
The new poverty-reduction strategy (MKUKUTA II) was recently launched.3
While seeking to consolidate recent advances in the coverage and delivery of social services,
the new strategy envisages greater focus on agriculture and private sector development in
order to accelerate the decline in income poverty.
4.
The PSI, which was approved by the Executive Board in June 2010, supports
efforts to reduce poverty within a stable macroeconomic environment. Its objectives
include maintaining a strong fiscal position, low inflation, and low risk of debt distress, while
rebuilding fiscal buffers. The PSI-supported program also aims to create fiscal space for
infrastructure investment—critical for accelerated growth—together with the consolidation
of social sector gains, in line with MKUKUTA II. Structural reforms seek to enhance the
returns to public spending and deepen the financial sector.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
5.
Tanzania weathered the adverse shocks of recent years relatively well. Activity
slowed in the aftermath of the global financial crisis but rebounded in the second half of
1

Poverty fell from 35.6 percent of the population in 2001 to 33.3 percent in 2007 and indications are that it has
changed little since then.
2

Tanzania is the fourth largest foreign aid recipient in the world in terms of total flows (excluding Iraq and
Afghanistan).

3

The new National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty (MKUKUTA II) was approved in
September 2010 and launched in January 2011 (“Tanzania: Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper,” Country Report
No. 11/17, January 2011); it covers the period 2010/11 to 2014/15 and is discussed in “United Republic of
Tanzania—Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper—Joint Staff Advisory Note.”

6
2009, thanks in part to supportive fiscal and monetary policies (Figure 1). Consumer price
inflation fell into single digits as good harvests pushed down food prices. Financial market
indicators remained sound overall.
6.
The economic rebound has leveled off. Growth in 2010 is estimated at 7 percent
with continued strong performance in manufacturing, construction, and communications and
a more subdued expansion in agriculture and gold mining. Credit to the private sector gained
steam through the year, expanding by 22 percent (year-on-year) in January 2011 as
confidence returned following the global financial crisis. The external current account
widened slightly in 2010 as a broad-based pickup in imports offset strong growth in
traditional and manufacturing exports, while the impact of rising gold prices did not match
higher oil prices. The reserve cover remained comfortable at 4.7 months of imports at end2010. Consumer price inflation was 5½ percent in December 2010 but rose to 7½ percent in
February 2011, largely due to supply factors—namely, a rise in food prices after lower-thanexpected rainfall in Tanzania and neighboring Kenya, as well as higher energy prices. Core
inflation (which excludes food and energy prices) has risen little and was 5 percent in
February, in line with the authorities’ medium-term inflation objective.
7.
Revenue collection for 2010/11 has fallen short of targets, constraining public
spending and contributing to the emergence of arrears (Figure 2).4 Spending was cut by
1 percent of GDP (with respect to budgeted levels) in the context of the mid-year budget
review. The cuts were spread across a range of departments and agencies, but priority
programs were spared. Expenditure was also reallocated to make room for a higher wage bill
(amounting to ½ percent of GDP, partly reflecting hires in the education and health sectors)
and to bring on-budget ¾ percent of GDP in previously unbudgeted arrears related to road
construction. The authorities identified these arrears in the context of the mid-year budget
review through a focused investigation of unpaid claims reported by ministries and agencies.
Additional unpaid claims are to be paid, once verified, through the normal cash budgeting
procedures. Steps were taken to tighten spending commitment controls, including through the
stricter application of administrative sanctions.
8.
Monetary policy has become less accommodative. Growth in reserve money
slowed, in line with the PSI program’s targets for December and March, as foreign aid was
disbursed and the government repaid central bank advances. Short-term interest rates rose
from mid-2010 lows of 3 percent to 5¼ percent in mid-March 2011 as bank lending and
government debt issuance increased, although they remain negative in real terms. The

exchange rate has been stable in recent months reflecting relatively modest inflation
differentials and rising domestic interest rates. Non-performing loans remained at
manageable levels after jumping in the second half of 2010, largely reflecting deterioration in
personal loans, which expanded significantly in recent years.
9.
Looking ahead, there are indications that activity may be softening under the
impact of adverse weather and international fuel price conditions. Poor rainfall late in
2010 disrupted domestic electricity generation. The lower output from hydro sources,
combined with fast-rising demand for electricity and lagging investment, has led to
widespread power rationing and taken some edge off growth, particularly in the trade and
manufacturing sectors. The rising price of fuel is adding to the cost of replacement power
generation for the private and public sectors alike. The drought could also adversely affect
the 2011 food harvest.
10.
The near-term economic outlook is subject to a higher-than-average degree of
uncertainty with a rising risk of donor aid shortfalls and higher international fuel
prices. Real GDP growth is projected to decline in the coming months but rebound by the
end of the year, provided power provision returns to near normal levels; annual growth
would dip to 6 percent in 2011 and return to 7 percent in 2012. The extent of spring rains and
related speed of power restoration bear significantly on the 2011 growth projection, carrying
both upside and downside risks through their effect on agriculture and activity in general.
Other adverse risks include a shortfall in donor aid, based on early indications by
development partners, and continued high international oil prices above recent projections.
Over the medium term, growth could gradually rise to 7½ percent thanks to large investments
in mining and continued growth in the non-mining economy. Inflation will likely spike above
7½ percent in 2011 as hikes in international fuel prices are feeding through, but return to
around 5 percent quickly thereafter as international food and fuel price pressures ease.
III. PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PSI
11.
All continuous and end-December quantitative assessment criteria were met
(Table 7). Net international reserves and reserve money were comfortably within their
respective limits. Net domestic financing of the government fell below its program ceiling by
a significant margin, due in large part to early disbursement of foreign official assistance.
12.
Implementation of the structural reform program has slowed (Table 8). Only two
of the seven structural benchmarks due for the second review under the PSI have been met,
in the areas of public financial management (reporting on unpaid claims) and price statistics
(introduction of a measure of core inflation). Noticeable progress was made towards most
other benchmarks, but capacity constraints and changes following the October 2010 elections
often delayed implementation. The authorities are requesting a re-phasing of the relevant
benchmarks.

10


The preparation of a new medium-term debt management strategy is well advanced
and should be completed shortly.



The draft proposal for the establishment of a national social protection framework is
being updated at the request of the new Cabinet; it is expected to be submitted for
consideration in the coming months.



Finalization of both the pension fund investment guidelines and the index tracking
poverty-reduction spending has been hampered by technical capacity limitations but
should be completed before year-end with the help of additional technical support
from development partners.



On the financial side, a range of measures have been introduced (also supported by
extensive technical assistance) to ensure the adequate provision of liquidity to banks
in case of crises. Efforts are now focusing on establishing a more comprehensive
crisis resolution framework, also with technical assistance, and the structural
benchmark could be dropped.
IV. MEDIUM-TERM OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES

13.
The Tanzanian economy is undergoing far-reaching changes. Partly reflecting
shifts in the composition and direction of global demand, commodity sectors are expected to
further increase their weight in output and exports as planned investments are rolled in. At
the same time, manufacturing exports, mostly directed to the East African common market,
are gaining strength—a promising trend given their higher productivity and employment
generation potential. On the demand side, rapid population growth is putting pressure on the
delivery of public services in the infrastructure and social areas, far outpacing the growth of
domestic revenue or foreign aid. These emerging trends could have significant implications
for macroeconomic policy design. Against this background, the medium-term policy
discussions focused on the need to enhance competitiveness and the role of fiscal policy.
A. Enhancing Competitiveness
Sources and level of growth
14.
The Tanzanian economy is becoming more diversified. The exploitation of
Tanzania’s underground resources is accelerating at the same time as other non-traditional
sectors are blossoming; tourism remains a mainstay. International financial and trade
linkages, such as with China, are intensifying (Box 1).
15.
The mining sector is expanding and attracting potentially large flows of FDI.
Gold exports have increased from negligible 10 years ago to around US$ 1½ billion currently
(a quarter of exports of goods and services). Considerable exploration has taken place in
nickel, uranium, and gas, all of which are believed to have significant potential, with a large

11
investment in uranium expected to move forward by mid-2012. In addition, a Chinese firm
has recently won the tender for a US$3 billion investment in an iron ore and smelting project
and related coal field.
Box 1. Sustaining Tanzania’s High Growth Path Through Exports
The composition of exports has changed. Traditional exports—cash crops such as cotton,
coffee, and tea that were the basis of the colonial economy—have declined while gold now
constitutes 40 percent of goods exports, making Tanzania the fourth largest gold exporter in
Africa. Tourism has grown steadily and manufacturing exports have surged since 2005.
Overall, however, the weight of exports in the economy remains relatively limited (25 percent
of GDP in 2010) although trade reforms in the mid 1990s substantially reduced the level and
dispersion of tariffs and non-tariff barriers.
Tanzania’s main trading partners have also changed. Exports have shifted from the EU to
Switzerland, China, and South Africa (reflecting gold trade) as well as the East African
Community (EAC).

Rising commodity demand provides an opportunity. Tanzania has received large FDI into
the gold sector, and significant flows are expected to develop other commodities—iron ore,
coal, gas, and uranium. Experience across countries has shown that investment in extractive
sectors can quickly lift output, but that it is a challenge to add higher value added activities and
avoid damage to other tradables sectors resulting from upward exchange rate pressures. One
channel to benefit from commodity exports is to translate them into higher revenue collection
and, aided by good public financial management, effective government spending.
The emerging manufacturing exports can be a key ingredient of Tanzania’s structural
transformation into an emerging market economy. At present, manufacturing exports are
mostly destined for the EAC common market where strengthening demand provides
opportunities. To allow full exploitation of comparative advantages remaining non-tariff
barriers need to be eliminated and regional norms and investment rules harmonized.

16.
At the same time, manufacturing exports have recently shown signs of
dynamism. Earnings from the export of manufactured goods are exceeding US$1 billion a
year (twice the level of traditional exports) following a sharp increase after the global
financial crisis. Much of the expansion is reportedly in paper products, fertilizers, and
apparel.

12
Policy implications and discussions
17.
The floating shilling has supported the diversification of Tanzanian exports and
will be maintained. An exchange rate assessment by staff suggests that the currency, while
slightly on the strong side, remains broadly in line with fundamentals (Box 2), a conclusion
the authorities shared. The exchange rate will continue to be determined by market forces,
with only sporadic official intervention to smooth out excessive volatility.

investment systems may also have to be strengthened to ensure that proceeds from
commodity exports are successfully intermediated into other sectors of the economy.

19.
The potential lumpiness of FDI flows in the context of Tanzania’s relatively thin
financial markets could exacerbate exchange rate volatility. New instruments (such as
currency swaps) and liquidity management policies could be developed to mitigate the
disruptive impact of excessive volatility on exporters. Over the longer term, the modalities of
exchange rate and reserve management will need to be adapted to the shift from official to
private sources of foreign exchange. The authorities looked forward to engaging further with
staff on these issues.

The authorities are exploring, with World Bank support, the scope for institutional improvements in the zones,
including lower reliance on fiscal incentives.

13
Box 2. Exchange Rate Assessment
The Tanzanian shilling remained
relatively stable during the global
financial crisis, reflecting in part
Tanzania’s limited exposure to
international capital flows. Like in
other countries in the region, the
currency appreciated prior to the global
financial crisis but depreciated thereafter.
The faster depreciation in mid-2010 was
due in part to low domestic interest
rates.1
The Tanzanian shilling is estimated to be broadly in line with economic fundamentals.
The three standard complementary staff approaches suggest only a mild potential
overvaluation, well within error margins:2



The Macroeconomic Balance approach suggests the shilling is near equilibrium.
A depreciation of 2.5 percent is estimated to be required to reduce the underlying
current account deficit to the “norm” of 6.4 percent of GDP (given an estimated current
account elasticity of -0.55).



The External Sustainability approach also suggests that the shilling is close to
equilibrium. To shrink the current account deficit to the net foreign liability
stabilizing deficit (estimated at 4.1 percent of GDP), a depreciation of 6.7 percent
would be required (given an estimated current account elasticity of -0.55).



The Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate approach, which models the exchange rate
directly, indicates the shilling is close to equilibrium as well. The estimated
overvaluation is 4.2 percent.

B. The Role of Fiscal Policy
20.
Significant challenges are also emerging in the fiscal area. With rapid population
growth, demand for public services is expanding, particularly in the social and infrastructure
areas. Without explicit policy action, however, revenue growth can be expected to lag
behind. The authorities agreed that with little prospects of increases in foreign aid,
maintaining fiscal balance would call for an in-depth reassessment of the current fiscal policy
framework.
Government revenue and spending trends
21.
Tax revenues have stalled. After years of gains, they have stabilized near 15 percent
of GDP, well below potential (Box 3). Limited progress has been made to bring the informal
sector into the tax base and several budgeted tax reforms have been postponed. The growing
mining sector has so far had little net fiscal impact and this is unlikely to change in the
coming years, partly because of large embedded tax holidays.
Box 3. Renewing Reform Efforts in Tax Policy and Administration
The authorities implemented major revenue-enhancing reforms over the last decade. In
tax administration, a common taxpayer identification number was introduced, the VAT
registration threshold was raised, and a Large Taxpayers Unit created. Electronic fiscal devices
were recently introduced to reduce VAT evasion. The customs department was modernized
and risk assessment improved. In tax policy, the number of brackets of the personal income tax
was reduced and the top rate cut to equate it with the corporate income tax rate. VAT loopholes
were minimized and excise rates automatically adjusted to inflation. The reforms improved the
business climate by reducing red tape in paying taxes and raised annual tax revenue by about
6 percentage points of GDP.
Progress has stalled in recent years, and tax revenues have remained broadly unchanged as a
share of GDP over the last four years. The emphasis has shifted to administrative measures
which, however, face decreasing returns over time. Efforts to reduce some tax exemptions ran
into stiff opposition and were not successful.
Domestic resource mobilization has significant room for improvement. It is estimated that
actual revenue collection (on the basis of the existing tax structure) fell short of potential by an
estimated 6 percent of GDP in 2008, compared to a shortfall of 2 percent of GDP in Kenya.1
Tanzania’s tax performance lags behind comparators in nearly all categories: corporate income
tax collection is only half as good as in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa, VAT compliance is
substantially lower, and excise tax rates are lower than in other EAC countries.
Tax exemptions are not well monitored and cost the government 3½ percent of GDP per
year. Room exists to reduce VAT, import duty, and excise tax exemptions and exercise more
rigorous control over them.

22.
Expenditures are rising. They are largely driven by current outlays, which increased
from 14.9 percent of GDP in 2007/08 to 18.8 percent of GDP two years later. This partly
reflects the counter-cyclical response to the global financial crisis. However, even before the
recent stimulus package current spending was rising.
23.
Wages have doubled relative to GDP over the last decade and now absorb
40 percent of tax revenue. The increase is due to a combination of salary hikes and new
hires, including in the social sectors. The wage bill does not capture the full cost of public
compensation, as per diems, allowances, and pension contributions are reported under
“other” goods and services, and in some cases wages are included in investment spending.
Pressures on the wage bill are expected to continue given the need to recruit additional
teachers and health workers to build on recent gains in education and health.
24.
The high level of current spending
is crowding out investment. Current
outlays, which typically get funded first,
exceed the reliable revenue sources
(external budget support and domestic
revenue) by over 20 percent. As a result,
domestically-financed investment depends
on the remaining, less stable resources,
which leaves it vulnerable to unexpected,
cost-increasing, cutbacks.
25.
The cash budgeting system has not prevented the emergence of domestic arrears.
Recent budgets were based on overly optimistic revenue projections that provided more
spending room than was actually available. A shortage of resources combined with a high
level of non-discretionary spending reduced space for short-term borrowing and insufficient
commitment controls led to the accumulation of domestic arrears in early 2010/11.
Policy implications and discussions
26.
With unchanged policies, the fiscal deficit and the debt level would gradually
approach unsustainable levels (Box 4). Assuming that the share of aid is unchanged or
declining, a high spending path with flat revenue would imply a growing dependence on nonconcessional domestic or foreign borrowing and a higher public debt burden, an outlook the
authorities did not dispute. Staff considers that the overall deficit (after grants) will need to
be gradually narrowed to under 4 percent over the medium term to keep total public debt
sustainable.
27.
In the staff’s view, a combination of spending cuts, tax policy reforms, and
enhanced public financial management would be advisable to restore fiscal balance.
Expenditure restraint would need to be carefully managed to leave room for spending in
priority areas and high-yield infrastructure investment. Although the process can be spread

16
Box 4. Current Fiscal Trends Threaten Fiscal Sustainability

Maintaining current policies could
increase the deficit by some 3 to
4 percentage points of GDP by
mid decade. The widening deficit
would become increasingly costly to
finance. Shallow local capital
markets limit the scope for domestic
financing, increasing reliance on
non-concessional external financing.
As a result, public debt would rise
rapidly to 66 percent of GDP in
2014/15. Debt servicing costs would
grow concomitantly.
Alternatively, keeping borrowing
near current levels would require
sizeable changes in revenue and
spending policies. A projected
deceleration in overall foreign aid in
coming years is making the finding
of solutions more urgent.

over a number of years, there would be strong benefits in initiating the effort with the
2011/12 budget, to raise public awareness and bolster credibility. The authorities broadly
agreed with this approach and indicated that they will begin work to obtain the political
support that is needed for fiscal restraint.
28.
There is scope for reducing and streamlining current spending. In the staff’s
view, the 2009/10 fiscal stimulus needs to be unwound and spending on goods and services
brought to their pre-crisis level, which was several percentage points of GDP lower. Existing
subsidies (such as transfers to higher education students, subsidies to utility companies and to
agricultural producers) could be better targeted. In addition, the growth in the wage bill must
be stabilized while providing space for recruitments in social sectors. Determined efforts to
increase spending efficiency, including for investment projects, are needed to make room for

17
necessary expenditures within the spending envelope. The authorities agreed on the direction
of the needed changes. They indicated that a number of task forces have been established,
including for example on wage policy, but have not yet reached final conclusions.
29.
The tax base could be expanded and excise tax rates raised. Staff observed that
exemptions have unduly multiplied, particularly for the VAT, and could be usefully scaled
down. The authorities noted they were aware of the issue but had run into political
difficulties when attempting to curtail exemptions. They indicated they were therefore
putting the onus on tax administration reforms. Staff agreed there was scope for tighter
enforcement of current tax laws, but noted that the yield would likely be diminishing after
several years of advances in this area. The authorities indicated they would carefully study
the recommendations of recent IMF TA on tax policy, which detailed the scope for reducing
exemptions, suggested room for raising excise tax rates, and explored options regarding
mining taxation.
30.
Revenues from the (mostly gold) mining sector are relatively small. Annual gold
exports have risen from US$ ½ billion to US$ 1½ billion (7 percent of GDP) in the last five
years due to the rise in the price of gold. Meanwhile, government revenues from major gold
mining companies have remained at around US$ 100 million a year (½ percent of GDP).
They comprise mainly taxes on wages and some royalties as the terms of the 1998 mining act
and agreements with mining companies have provided significant corporate income tax
holidays. As a result, none of the existing gold projects have paid material income tax to
date.
31.
Despite recent efforts, revenues from existing gold mines may not grow much.
With continued high gold prices, about ¼ percent of GDP in annual income tax may begin to
be collected in the coming years from existing gold mines, and after mid decade this may rise
to perhaps ¾ percent of GDP. However, net increases in revenue will be relatively small in
the near term because of the offsetting impact of accumulated VAT and fuel tax refund
claims. Stepped-up efforts to bring to resolution past—and highly contentious—tax disputes
with existing gold mines, together with improvements in mining tax administration, as per
the commendations of recent TA, could generate some additional revenue. A new mining act
was passed in 2010 but existing gold mines remain governed by their respective agreements.
32.
Stronger budget procedures could increase the effectiveness of the cashbudgeting system. Staff agreed with the authorities that the system had served Tanzania well
and should be maintained. Staff noted, however, that the emergence of domestic arrears was
a sign of its limitations and that a more realistic budget was needed to avoid overburdening
it. The authorities are studying the recommendations of recent IMF TA to strengthen their
cash-budgeting operations.
33.
Public investment management could be strengthened to improve prioritization.
The authorities envision developing a medium-term investment plan, setting up a capital

18
projects database, and establishing a capital investment unit in the Ministry of Finance. Staff
welcomed these intended reforms and added that the institutional responsibilities for project
appraisal had to be clarified, with the Ministry of Finance retaining a gatekeeper role.
V. SHORT-TERM POLICY ISSUES
34.
The threat of a protracted weather-related supply shock and rising
international fuel prices puts additional pressure on near-term fiscal and monetary
management. The authorities were of the view that the impact would be relatively
short-lived and thus did not call for modifications in program targets at this point. They are
committed to preserving Tanzania’s hard-won financial stability and expressed their
readiness to tighten policies as needed.
Fiscal policy
35.
A financing gap of about 1 percent of GDP remains for 2010/11 after the
mid-year revision of the budget. With power shortages likely to put a damper on revenue
growth during the second half of 2010/11, revenues are projected to rise to 16.1 percent of
GDP. This is up from 15.8 percent of GDP in the previous year (partly because of
administrative measures) but still short of the authorities’ revised mid-year projection.
36.
The authorities are determined to compress actual spending to align it with
available resources (MEFP ¶13). To that end, they intend to downsize or delay
lower-priority programs and projects while making room for exceptional expenditure related
to the power crisis.6 The authorities trust such spending restraint can be implemented without
adverse impact on the delivery of social services or new arrears accumulation. In particular,
they are confident that their recently-increased strategic grain reserve will allow them to
alleviate any food shortage that could arise in case of a protracted drought. Staff stressed the
importance of a well-prioritized approach that focuses on the control of discretionary
recurrent spending while safeguarding high-priority investment and social programs.
37.
Staff strongly endorsed the authorities’ intent to embark on a path of fiscal
consolidation starting with the next budget. The deficit (after grants) would be reduced to
6 percent of GDP in 2011/12 and gradually to below 4 percent of GDP thereafter (MEFP ¶27
and ¶29). The authorities are committed to increasing the realism of budget revenue forecasts
to reduce the scope for underfunded spending commitments. Their baseline (unchanged
policies) revenue projection of 16.3 percent of GDP for 2011/12 is consistent with staff’s
forecast. Staff welcomed the authorities’ intent to include in the budget quantified estimates
of the impact of any proposed tax measure. Staff also endorsed the plan to expand the
contingent reserve to 5 percent of total expenditure (net of foreign-financed projects) so as to
6

19
create a sufficient buffer for unexpected revenue, spending, or financing developments. The
authorities and staff agreed that the expenditure containment plans for next year were
ambitious. Attainment of the budget targets may be challenging if the risk of donor aid
shortfalls and higher international fuel prices were to materialize.
38.
Existing spending commitment controls must be strictly enforced to help prevent
the reemergence of arrears. Staff welcomed the authorities’ resolution to tighten oversight
in this area and stressed the need for continued vigilance (MEFP ¶13). The newly-established
regular monitoring of unpaid claims could help to identify pressure points early.7 Additional
actions could be considered, such as a strengthening of procurement procedures, or a
thorough audit of the processes that led to the emergence of unpaid claims. The authorities
agreed to consider possible options, taking as a starting point the recommendations of the
recent PFM TA mission. Staff will closely monitor developments in this area, including to
help make sure that arrears are not used as a source of financing outside the program.
39.
The authorities intend to make full use of the non-concessional borrowing
agreed under the PSI (US$525 million, or 2 percent of GDP, in 2010/11). Negotiations are
reportedly well advanced, including for a loan tied to the construction of the two new power
plants. The authorities are interested in obtaining a credit rating and placing a sovereign bond
next year. Staff reiterated that non-concessional borrowing should be reserved for
well-designed, growth-enhancing, infrastructure projects where economic/financial returns
exceed borrowing costs.
40.
Tanzania’s risk of debt distress remains low. An updated DSA shows external debt
indicators would remain below indicative country-specific thresholds even after borrowing
under non-concessional terms the planned US$1.5 billion over three years.8 However,
scenario analysis indicates that the debt indicators are sensitive to further borrowing on
expensive terms. This highlights that a sound debt management strategy, a conservative
approach to non-concessional borrowing, and stronger capacity for public investment
planning and execution are key for maintaining future debt and fiscal sustainability. As
mentioned earlier, a continued widening of the fiscal deficit would also undermine
sustainability, buttressing the importance of fiscal restraint.
41.
Debt management processes should be strengthened as a matter of urgency. As
Tanzania’s debt is rising and its composition becomes more complex, its accurate tracking
(including debt from state-owned enterprises) and assessment of embedded risks become
critical inputs into policy design. Staff welcomed plans to unify debt monitoring and data

20
recording responsibilities in a single unit (a structural benchmark for June 2011), in line with
the recommendations of recent technical assistance (MEFP ¶18). The finalization and
publication of a new debt management strategy should also receive priority (the authorities
request the re-phasing of the relevant benchmark for June). Staff strongly encouraged the
authorities to build up technical expertise in this area as soon as possible.
Monetary and financial sector policies
42.
The authorities are carefully monitoring inflation in the context of rising food
and fuel prices. While the first-round impact of these supply-side shocks must be
accommodated, a tighter monetary policy stance would be needed were broader inflationary
pressures to arise. Thus far the pick-up in inflation is largely contained to food and fuel
prices. Nonetheless, the Bank of Tanzania will monitor core inflation closely and make
necessary adjustments to ensure that the reserve money target is consistent with emerging
demand, in line with program objectives. The authorities and staff view the recent increase in
short-term market rates as appropriate given the direction of inflation. The Bank of Tanzania
will maintain its regular foreign exchange sales while allowing the exchange rate to remain
market-determined.
43.
Financial sector reforms are ongoing and aligned with recommendations from
the recent FSAP. The inaugural Financial Sector Stability report was published in December
and progress is being made towards the establishment of a credit reference system (MEFP
¶35). A financial regulators forum has been created to coordinate financial sector oversight
and crisis management. Staff encouraged the authorities to promptly finalize investment
guidelines for pension funds so as to make the newly established regulator fully operational
(the authorities request the re-phasing of the related benchmark to September 2011—MEFP
¶36).9 The authorities are also encouraged to continue implementing their action plan to
address strategic deficiencies in anti-money laundering and combating the financing of
terrorism, particularly by reviewing the relevant legal framework. The authorities are also
preparing, with support from development partners, including the World Bank, for
Tanzania’s integration in the EAC single market.
44.
The Bank of Tanzania is working on the establishment of a comprehensive crisis
management framework. Measures have been introduced to help identify impending
liquidity shortfalls and facilitate access to emergency liquidity facilities in the event of a
crisis (MEFP ¶32). Following FSAP recommendations, efforts are now focused on
developing a broader crisis resolution framework, which will include different forms of
liquidity support. As the related structural benchmark is no longer relevant, the authorities

program.

21
request that it be dropped. The development of the broader framework is likely to stretch
well into 2012 and could be incorporated in the program once its timeline is clarified further.
45.
Staff noted the importance of continued vigilance regarding credit quality,
especially given the sharp increase in the volume of lending in recent years. While
overall bank soundness indicators remain strong, non-performing loans rose from 6.6 percent
of gross loans at end-2009 to 9.3 percent at end-2010, reflecting the impact of the global
financial crisis in some sectors as well as higher delinquency in personal loans after their
rapid growth over the past few years. The Bank of Tanzania has stepped up its oversight,
particularly of provisioning levels, and is monitoring developments closely (MEFP ¶34).
Structural policies
46.
The recent slowing of progress with structural reforms may suggest the need to
reassess structural priorities. Institutional responsibilities are still being defined following
the elections, with the newly-created Planning Commission expected to take a leading
strategic role. In that context, it could attempt to better prioritize and coordinate structural
reforms, taking due account of existing administrative and technical capacities. A main task
of the Planning Commission will be the strengthening of public investment processes and
improving links between medium-term investment plans and the budget. Consideration could
be given at the time of the next review to including structural measures in this area in the
program.
47.
Structural reforms directly related to poverty reduction programs could also
benefit from new momentum. The two remaining benchmarks under the PSI in this area
have been repeatedly delayed. The new national social protection framework is expected to
receive due consideration in the coming months. Staff strongly encouraged the authorities to
develop an index for monitoring social spending on the basis of the recent reclassification of
budget items. The authorities are requesting technical assistance to facilitate achievement of
this goal.
VI. PROGRAM MONITORING
48.
The quantitative assessment criteria and structural benchmarks for end-June
and end-December 2011 (the third and fourth review of the PSI) are presented in the
authorities’ Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) (Attachment I
to the Letter of Intent). The assessment criteria for end-June 2011 (MEFP Table 3) are
unchanged from the first review, except that the floor on net international reserves has been
slightly raised to reflect projected changes in balance of payments flows. MEFP Table 4
presents the structural benchmarks that are proposed for the remainder of 2011.

22
VII. STAFF APPRAISAL
49.
Ongoing changes in the global economy offer Tanzania opportunities to raise its
economic growth and accelerate poverty reduction. Tanzania has achieved strong growth
over the past decade on the back of extensive market-oriented reforms and fiscal
consolidation, but the impact of these efforts may be wearing off. The growing effect of
electricity shortages on economic activity highlights the extent to which infrastructure
deficiencies will increasingly weigh on medium-term growth if they remain unaddressed.
The business environment (including governance) should be improved to boost economic
competitiveness.
50.
Strong commitment to fiscal consolidation will be needed over the next several
years. The expansionary fiscal policies of the past several years need to be reined in, policy
buffers restored, and preparations made for a likely deceleration in foreign aid. Tax policy
measures as well as spending rationalization are needed to respond to the growing demand
for public services. More realistic budgets and better spending commitment controls would
help contain arrears. Strengthened debt management capacity and public financial
management, in particular in investment, are also essential.
51.
Early evidence of the commitment to control the deficit is critical for investor
and donor confidence. Although an effective reform of tax and spending policies may
require time, there is some urgency in providing quickly a signal of the authorities’ intentions
in this area. The 2011/12 budget in particular will be closely watched. Staff welcomes the
authorities’ public commitments to pursue fiscal restraint. Staff recognizes, however, that
next year’s spending containment plans are ambitious in view of the need to safeguard
priority spending. Attainment of the authorities’ budget targets may be challenging if the risk
of donor aid shortfalls and higher international fuel prices were to materialize.
52.
The gradual shift to a less accommodative monetary policy has been an
appropriate response to the recovery in economic activity. The authorities will need to
remain vigilant to the impact of rising food and energy prices.
53.
Staff recommends the completion of the second review under the PSI. All
quantitative assessment criteria have been met and structural reforms are advancing, even if
with some delays. Staff supports the authorities’ request for re-phasing of the structural
benchmarks, elimination of the structural benchmark on a liquidity assistance framework,
modification of the end-June 2011 assessment criterion on net international reserves, and
setting of end-December 2011 assessment criteria.
54.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation be held on a 24-month
cycle, in accordance with Decision No. 14747-(10/96), 9/28/2010, as amended.

APPENDIX. LETTER OF INTENT
Dar es Salaam
April 15, 2011
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
U.S.A.
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
1.
Tanzania has continued to record good progress in the implementation of its
economic and financial programme under the Policy Support Instrument (PSI). The
Government remains committed to maintain sound policies with the aim of sustaining
macroeconomic stability and accelerating economic growth and poverty reduction.
2.
Performance against PSI targets remained on track with all quantitative assessment
criteria for December 2010 and all continuous assessment criteria being met, some with
substantial margin. Similarly, progress has been made in implementing the structural reform
program.
3.
Based on the preliminary data on economic performance during the first nine months,
and performance in some key indicators during the fourth quarter of 2010, GDP growth for
2010 is estimated to have reached 7.0 percent. Economic activity is projected to slow down
during 2011 owing to the projected below normal rains and power shortages during the first
half and higher international oil prices. Owing to the unexpected power crisis and the
uncertainty regarding its length and severity, the GDP forecast is subject to higher than usual
uncertainty. However, in the medium term, growth is projected to stabilise above 7 percent.
4.
Annual headline inflation increased to 7.5 percent in February 2011 from 5.6 percent
in December 2010 and 7.2 percent in June, 2010 mainly due to increases in the prices of food
items and energy reflecting global trends, as well as the 18 percent rise in electricity tariff
starting in January 2011. Going forward, and incorporating a number of cost push factors,
inflation is targeted at 7.5 percent by end June 2011. Inflation is projected to decline to
around 5 percent in the medium term.
5.
The Government’s policy framework will continue to focus on sustaining the
macroeconomic stability, including fiscal sustainability, through implementation of
appropriate fiscal and monetary policies, with the aim of powering the economy to its growth
trajectory. The policy framework will include implementation of measures to increase
revenue efficiency; and scaling up good-quality investment spending to address the
infrastructure bottlenecks and sustain gains realized in social sectors, while containing
growth in recurrent expenditure. In addition to financing infrastructure development through
concessional and non–concessional borrowing, the Government will improve value for
money of its infrastructure spending, including through Public Private Partnership (PPP)
arrangements.

34
6.
The Government is continuing with implementation of it structural reform agenda
based on its four core reform programmes—the Public Sector Reform Programme, the Public
Financial Reform Programme, the Local Government Reform Programme, and the Legal
Sector Reform Programme—in order to enhance efficiency in resource utilization and service
delivery. In addition, the Government is continually improving the business environment to
support private sector led growth, through the Roadmap for Improving the Business Climate
that was adopted by stakeholders in 2010.
7.
Following discussions and consultations with the Fund staff, I hereby transmit this
letter of intent and the attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial policies, which
reviews the implementation of the programme during the first half and the projected outturn
for 2010/11, and describes the objectives and policies that the Government intends to pursue
during the fiscal year 2011/12 and over the medium term.
8.
The Government of Tanzania requests the completion of the second review under the
PSI in support of good performance and policy intentions going forward. The Government is
confident that the policies set forth in the attached MEFP are adequate to achieve the
objectives of its programme and will, in further consultation with the Fund, take any
appropriate measures for this purpose. We will regularly update the Fund on developments in
our economic and financial policies, and provide the data needed for the monitoring of the
programme. In addition, the Government will consult regularly with the Fund on any relevant
developments at the initiative of the Government or the Fund.
9.
The Government of Tanzania intends to disseminate this letter and the attached
MEFP as well as related Fund staff reports, and hereby authorizes the IMF to publish the
same on its website after consideration by the Executive Board.
Yours Sincerely,
/s/
Mustafa H. Mkulo

Tanzania’s economy has continued on a recovery path from a slowdown associated
with the global economic downturn. Preliminary national accounts statistics indicate that real
GDP (at market prices) grew by 6.7 percent in the first three quarters of 2010 compared with
4.8 percent in the corresponding period of 2009. The growth was contributed mostly by trade
and services (22.2 percent), agriculture and fishing (20.7 percent), transport and
communication (10.7 percent), and manufacturing (10.0 percent). Following good
performance in the first three quarters, and an indication of good performance in key
indicators in manufactured exports, and construction, the earlier projected GDP growth of
7.0 percent in 2010 is likely to be achieved.
2.
Following favorable weather conditions in 2009/10, food supply improved in the East
African region, leading to a reduction in inflationary pressures. Inflation took a downward
trend in 2010, from 12.7 percent in October 2009 to 4.5 percent in September 2010. The
National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released the revised CPI series beginning October 2010.
Based on this revision, inflation was 4.2 percent in October 2010, but started inching up from
November 2010 to 5.6 percent in December 2010, mainly on account of an increase in prices
of some food items and energy. In January 2011, the pressure was exacerbated by an
18 percent increase in electricity tariffs, and inflation rose in February to 7.5 percent.
3.
The trade account for the year ending December 2010 experienced a widening deficit
with imports increasing faster than exports partly due to high prices of oil in the world
market, and partly due to substantial recovery of capital and intermediate goods imports.
Imports of goods and services rose by about 19 percent in 2010 compared with a decline of
13 percent in the preceding year. Improvement in global demand also led to an increase in
world commodity prices, resulting in improved export performance. Exports of goods and
services rose by about 23 percent, with gold remaining dominant, largely due to the increase
in export prices. In the first half of 2010/11, the current account deficit decreased by
9.9 percent to USD 798 million compared with a deficit of USD 886 million recorded in the
corresponding period last year following a significant increase in official current transfers.
4.
However, an upward trend in oil prices in the world market is taking place given the
escalating instability in the Middle East and North Africa. This will in turn increase the
import bill in the second half of 2010/11. In addition, hydro power generation has been
substantially reduced due to inadequate short rains during 2010/11 season, leading to power
rationing that may be exacerbated if the long rains in 2011 are below normal, as is projected.
The ongoing power rationing is expected to negatively affect exports of manufactured goods
in the second half of 2010/11. Consequently, the current account (excluding official current
transfers) for 2010/11 is projected to record a deficit equivalent to 12.6 percent of GDP
compared with 11.4 percent of GDP in 2009/10. On the other hand, the overall balance of

36
payments is projected to record a surplus of USD 334 million. Official gross reserves by endJune 2011 are estimated to increase to USD 3,831 million, sufficient to cover 4.7 months’
imports of goods and services.
Performance under the program
5.
Performance against PSI targets for end-December 2010 remained on track with all
quantitative assessment criteria being met (Table 1). In particular, net international reserves
amounted to USD 3,594 million, above the target by USD 332 million, while the net
domestic financing of the Government budget was TSh 109 billion, which was below the
ceiling by TSh 356 billion. The average reserve money closed at TSh 3,524 billion, below the
target by TSh 34 billion.
6.
Progress has been made in implementing the structural reform benchmarks, although
slower than planned in some areas (Table 2). A report on outstanding payment claims as at
end December 2010 was prepared and a core inflation index has been introduced, while the
Medium Term Debt Strategy (MTDS) report will be published by end June 2011. However,
while progress has been made on each of the remaining structural benchmarks, it was not
possible to complete them yet, and thus the Government requests their re-phasing as
discussed below.
Fiscal policy
7.
Fiscal policy in the first half of the fiscal year remained within the PSI targets, thanks
to a proactive management of spending. The deficit before grants stood at TSh 1,762 billion
(5½ percent of GDP), or TSh 139 billion lower than programmed. External program
financing exceeded PSI projections by TSh 321 billion, allowing the Government to meet the
NDF target with a significant margin. The Government’s cash-budgeting system helped
contain monthly expenditure within available resources in order to meet the domestic
financing target.
8.
During the first six months of 2010/11, government revenue increased significantly
but fell short of budget estimates. Total domestic revenue collection including Local
Governments Authorities (LGAs)’ own sources increased by 20 percent compared with last
year. Revenue collection reached TSh 2,779 billion, exceeding PSI targets by about
4 percent, helped by the continuous implementation of measures outlined in the November
2010 MEFP to strengthen revenue collection. However, revenue collection fell significantly
short (about 10 percent) of budget estimates, reflecting the ambitious revenue targets,
including for VAT and excises. Large tax exemptions (about 1/3 of gross tax collections)
continued to erode the tax base and hamper revenue collection performance.
9.
Total cash expenditure for the first half of 2010/11 remained within the PSI envelope,
but large unpaid claims have surfaced from infrastructure projects. The execution of
expenditure during the first half was held to 91.3 percent of budget estimates, while

37
protecting priority sectors, including health and education, from budget cuts. Recurrent
expenditure was in line with estimates, while development expenditure stood at 74 percent of
the estimates. In addition, significant claims (TSh 255 billion or 0.7 percent of GDP) were
accumulated because spending on long-term infrastructure projects went faster than
anticipated under the budget, thus pushing total expenditure committed in the first half of the
year above the target. Foreign financed development expenditure experienced delays in
disbursement of project funds as well as delays in data reporting of direct-to-project funds.
10.
Total grants for the first half of 2010/11 were TSh 1,000 billion, equivalent to
75 percent of estimate, reflecting delayed disbursement of foreign project funds and data
reporting of project grants. Disbursements of budget grants were TSh 654 billion, while
basket support funds amounted to TSh 243 billion. The higher than estimated disbursement
of GBS and basket funds was mainly due to frontloading and exchange rate fluctuations.
Total foreign financing of the deficit after grants was 8 percent above the budget estimate for
the period, mainly due to higher than projected disbursement of general budget support and
basket funds. On the other hand, net domestic financing was 23 percent below the estimated
TSh 465 billion due to delays in execution of development projects.
Prospects for the reminder of FY2010/11
11.
The Government has taken steps to accelerate the implementation of administrative
revenue measures to improve revenue collection performance, but significant risks cloud the
outlook to end June 2011. Data for end-February indicates some improvement in domestic
revenue collection, but growing downside risks are emanating from the impact of the
protracted power rationing on corporate activity and profits. As a result, revenue collection is
projected to reach 16.1 percent of GDP for FY2010/11, slightly below the PSI targets and
around 90 percent of budget estimates.
12.
The Government has made progress in raising funds from external non-concessional
borrowing. Negotiations with a reputable bank for USD 197.8 million are at advanced stage
and the Mandate Letter has already been signed. The Government is currently reviewing the
loan agreements to ensure suitability of loan terms. This loan will be used for the installation
of 100MW gas fired plant in Dar es Salaam and 60MW heavy furnace oil power plant in
Mwanza. The Government is also discussing a Mandate Letter for USD 250 million with a
second bank, and the loan agreement is expected to be signed before end June, 2011. Taking
into account commitment and insurance fees estimated at about USD 40 million, the total
amount available from these two loans to finance expenditures in 2010/11 is expected to be
about USD 408 million. The Government is cautiously scrutinizing additional proposals from
these and other financial institutions to identify possible candidates to raise the remaining
balance from the USD 525 million ceiling on non-concessional financing.
13.
Spending will be adjusted to available resources while protecting key expenditure
items including investment and priority social spending. Accordingly, the mid-year budget

38
review capped total expenditure at 95 percent of estimate and 29.6 percent of GDP. In
addition, spending was reallocated to allow payment of TSh 255 billion in unpaid claims.
The Government has halted the process of signing new contracts for infrastructure projects
that are not funded. Given the severity of the power outage, it is essential to step up
investment in electricity generation. In addition, further pressures could also arise in
recurrent spending due to the need for increased fuel purchases to supply generators to
maintain power availability in the very near term. Any increased expenditures related to the
power crisis will be covered by reducing planned spending in other areas. In all, the revenue
shortfall and additional power-related spending will call for a further adjustment in
expenditure of about 1.1 percent of GDP. To cope with these additional shocks, the
Government will focus cuts mainly on lower priority areas, and where possible delay the
implementation of some projects.
14.
The Government continues with the efforts to enhance the capacity of Cash
Management Unit (CMU) in order to improve in-year cash flow projection and accordingly
advise the cash management committee. This will include enhancing the capacity of CMU to
perform detailed historical trend analysis as a basis for projecting and scrutinizing Ministries
and Development Agencies (MDAs) submissions.
15.
The Government has begun to compile outstanding payment claims from MDAs on a
quarterly basis, while strengthening commitment control and expenditure tracking and
monitoring. The Government monitors expenditure development arising from such claims to
facilitate a more accurate projection of cash requirements. The claims once verified are
incorporated and submitted for payment through the monthly cash budgeting committee,
pending available resources. The Government ensures that such claims are settled before the
end of the fiscal year to avoid accumulation of arrears in the following fiscal year. On a
provisional basis, the unpaid claims of three ministries have been reported to the Fund. Now
that the data is available for all MDAs, it will be shared with the Fund on a quarterly basis,
with a four week lag.
16.
The Government has developed the National Social Protection Framework (NSPF)
through extensive consultation with key stakeholders. The NSPF establishes guidelines for
stakeholders involved in the planning, funding, and provision of social protection measures
in line with MKUKUTA II, and provides a mechanism for collective state-led measures
implemented by the Government and its partners. However, the elections and formation of a
new government have delayed the formal adoption of this framework. As a result, the
Government requests a re-phasing of the related structural benchmark to end-June 2011. To
further assist in meeting the goals of MKUKUTA II, an index for monitoring priority social
spending is also being developed. However, this has proven technically more challenging
than anticipated, and thus the Government requests a re-phasing of the related structural
benchmark from end-March to end-December 2011. The Government is also seeking
technical assistance from a development partner to accelerate the work and support capacity
building in this important area.

39
17.
Foreign assistance in the form of General Budget Support and basket funds are
expected to be realized broadly within budget estimates. General budget support will be
slightly higher than the approved budget especially due to fluctuations in the exchange rate,
partly contributing to the narrowing of the resource gap emanating from domestic revenue
shortfall. Thus, in 2010/11 foreign grants are expected to be 5.6 percent of GDP, while loans
(including non-concessional borrowing) will be 5.5 percent.
18.
The Government has, with the help of IMF-World Bank technical assistance, in
January 2011 adopted a new tool to assist in formulating a Medium Term Debt Strategy
(MTDS). The new tool incorporates non-concessional borrowing and contingent liabilities,
including those arising from government guarantees. Significant progress has been made on
developing an MTDS consistent with resource needs under the MKUKUTA II and reflecting
contingent liabilities, but the process is not yet complete. Thus, the Government is requesting
a re-phasing of the related benchmark from end-March 2011 to end-June 2011. The
Government also intends to establish a unified data base of debt statistics, under a single
monitoring unit, and proposes that this be added as a new structural benchmark to be
completed by end-December 2011
19.
According to the report on Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) published in
December 2010, Tanzania’s public debt is expected to remain sustainable. However, the
Government recognizes that debt sustainability is sensitive to the terms of borrowing and its
utilization, and is committed to contracting external debt only on reasonable terms, and to
ensuring that all non-concessional debt is used to finance high-priority investment projects.
The Government will continue to control the issuance of guarantees on loans to various
public institutions in order to maintain sustainability of the public debt.
Monetary and exchange rate policies
20.
The pace of credit to private sector growth continued to pick up in the first seven
months of 2010/11, reflecting recovery of banks’ confidence in the economy following
easing of the global financial crisis. Credit to private sector grew by 21.5 percent in January
2011, far above the 9.8 percent recorded in the year ending January 2010. Consistent with
this development, broad money (M3) grew by 25.4 percent, compared with 20.1 percent
recorded in the year ending January 2010. The fastest growing component of M3 was foreign
currency deposits following the strengthening of US dollar against major currencies and the
shilling which led to higher demand for US dollars. The Shilling depreciated against the
US dollar by 6.1 percent in the first seven months of 2010/11.
21.
The Bank’s policy rate remained unchanged. Nevertheless, as credit growth
accelerated and banks’ excess reserves declined, money market interest rates increased in the
last quarter of 2010. The overall Treasury bill yield increased to 7.14 percent in January
2011, from 3.33 percent in June 2010, while the overnight interbank rate increased to
7.93 percent in January 2011, from 0.97 percent in June 2010. The same pattern was also

40
observed in the Treasury bond market, where average yields increased across all maturities.
This began to reverse in mid February 2011, as Treasury securities tender sizes were reduced,
coupled with build up of banks’ reserves following seasonal repayment of agricultural credit.
The overall weighted average Treasury bill yield fell to 5.70 percent by mid March 2011 and
the overnight interbank rate fell to 2.0 percent.
Programme for 2011/12 and the Medium term
22.
The Government will continue to focus on sustaining macroeconomic stability
through implementation of prudent monetary and fiscal policies. Building on the MUKUTA
II framework, the Government is in the process of developing a five year development plan
for 2011/12 – 2015/16, whose main thrust is on unlocking Tanzania’s growth potentials. The
Plan will prioritize key interventions and orderly sequence in their implementation so that
they can complement each other to enable effective and optimal resource allocation. Focus
will be on key areas within agriculture, infrastructure, investment in human resources,
environmental sustainability and land management. The Government will sustain
achievements made in social sectors and improve value for money of its infrastructure
program, including through private sector participation in infrastructure development.
23.
The Government is continuing with implementation of its structural reform agenda
based on four core reform programmes—the Public Sector Reform Programme, the Public
Financial Reform Programme, the Local Government Reform Programme, and the Legal
Sector Reform Programme— in order to enhance efficiency in resource utilisation and
service delivery. In addition, the Government is continually improving the business
environment to support private sector led growth, through a Roadmap for Improving the
Business Climate that was adopted by stakeholders in 2010. The Roadmap identified several
“quick wins” and short-term actions that the Government intends to implement quickly.
24.
Real GDP growth is expected to slow in 2011 on account of the ongoing power
rationing, projected lower than normal rains in the 2011 crop season and soaring international
oil prices. As the global economy continues to recover and demand for exports improves, real
GDP growth is expected to return to an average rate above 7 percent. Over the medium term,
growth is expected to increase further. On the other hand, it is expected that the continued
surge in world oil and food prices will increase headline inflation to 7.5 percent in June 2011.
In the medium term, it is expected that inflationary pressures will ease, with inflation slowing
to 5.5 percent in 2012 and remaining around 5 percent thereafter.
Fiscal policy
25.
As a baseline projection, domestic revenue is expected to trend upward given the
expected recovery in economic activities and continued efforts to strengthen tax
administration, and implement measures to increase revenue efficiency and bring it in line
with other countries in the East African region. Thus, in the baseline the revenue to GDP
ratio is projected at 16.3 percent of GDP in 2011/12. The Government is committed to

41
including in the budget realistic estimates of the revenue impact of measures in the tax area
that are not included in the baseline. This will ensure that the overall projection of revenues
in the budget provides a reliable foundation for determining the level of spending in the
budget.
26.
Foreign grants and loans are projected to remain at 6.4 percent of GDP in 2011/12,
with concessional loans also little changed from 2010/11 at 3.3 percent of GDP. Nonconcessional foreign borrowing is projected at an additional 2.1 percent of GDP, with net
domestic financing remaining at 1 percent of GDP. The Government will ensure that
resources realized from non-concessional borrowing are utilized to address critical
infrastructure gaps, including increasing capacity for energy generation and improving
transportation networks, with borrowing decisions made in line with Government’s
commitment to sustaining macroeconomic stability consistent with the PSI programme.
27.
Based on the available financing and the need to maintain fiscal sustainability, the
deficit after grants will be reduced to 6 percent of GDP in 2011/12. Given this deficit and the
baseline projection for revenues, total expenditure is projected to decline to 28.3 percent of
GDP. Only realistically projected increases in baseline revenues on the basis of quantified
estimates of policy changes will be reflected in total expenditure. Growth in the wage bill
will be kept in line in nominal GDP to safeguard Tanzania’s competitiveness. While making
room for increases in priority spending, including in health and education, total spending on
goods and services will be brought to their level relative to GDP prior to the global financial
crisis. In addition, the Government will continue to improve the quality of public investment,
and over the medium term will ensure that reported public investment refers only to actual
accumulation of physical capital. In addition, the contingent reserve in the 2011/12 budget
will be increased to five percent of total expenditure to create a sufficient buffer for
unexpected developments on revenue, spending, or financing.
28.
In the medium term, the Government will implement revenue policies aimed at
improving tax administration and maximizing domestic revenue collection. The Government
will undertake various reforms to strengthen domestic resource mobilization and limit tax
leakages. This will be achieved through: (i) improving tax structure; (ii) widening the tax
base by bringing the informal sector into the tax net, implementing the properties and
businesses formalization programme and introducing National Identity Cards;
(iii) strengthening bloc management, supervision and managing performance;
(iv) intensifying enforcement of collection of tax arrears and tax compliance; and
(v) improving tax administration by implementing the Tanzania Revenue Authority’s Third
Five-year Corporate Plan. In addition, the Government will undertake policy reform
measures in non tax revenue collection, and strengthen the management and control of tax
exemptions.
29.
The Government’s medium-term fiscal policy will help to ensure fiscal sustainability.
The overall deficit after grants is projected to gradually narrow from 6.5 percent estimated

42
for 2010/11 to below 4 percent by 2015/16, benefitting from the projected improvement in
domestic revenue collection and decline in overall expenditure. The projected deficit is
expected to be financed by both concessional and non-concessional loans. The proceeds from
non-concessional borrowing are intended to be used to support development projects
particularly infrastructure development. As a result, Tanzania’s total public debt will remain
below 45 percent of GDP over the medium-term.
Monetary and exchange rate policies
30.
The Bank of Tanzania will continue to implement monetary policy that is consistent
with low inflation, while providing room for private sector credit growth. Upside risk to
inflation from the second round effect of tariff hikes, power rationing, and increasing global
oil and food prices remain. The Bank of Tanzania will monitor inflation closely and make
appropriate adjustments to monetary targets in the events that core inflation begins to exhibit
indications of rising inflationary pressures. During 2011/12, the annual growth rate of
average reserve money and M3 is targeted at 19 percent, which should provide room for
private sector credit to grow by 21 percent in the year ending June 2012.
31.
The exchange rate will remain market determined and the Bank of Tanzania will
participate in the foreign exchange market with the main objective of implementing its
monetary policy and smoothing short-term exchange rate volatility, while maintaining an
adequate level of international reserves.
Financial sector stability
32.
The Bank is committed to ensure stability and soundness of the financial sector. In
this regard, the Bank has prepared an MOU to establish a financial regulators forum to
assume joint responsibility of safeguarding the stability of the financial system, and
coordinating crisis management and resolution. The Bank of Tanzania has also introduced
new measures to ensure availability of liquidity to the banking system, should the need arise.
Firstly, measures to recognize impending liquidity shortfalls have been stepped up by
strengthening surveillance of the banking system. This is done on a daily basis by examining
developments in a set of leading indicators. Secondly, access to emergency facilities at the
Bank of Tanzania has been eased to allow commercial banks to have access to these facilities
on short notice and at reasonable rates. In addition, a mission to develop further options for
resolution of crises was concluded in February 2011 and a report containing
recommendations is expected in the fourth quarter of 2010/11. The first published Financial
Stability Report was issued in December 2010, and the next half year report will be published
by May 2011. In light of the actions taken to date, the Government requests that the structural
benchmark on the establishment of a framework for emergency liquidity management be
dropped.
33.
Efforts are underway to reform the Deposit Insurance Board (DIB). A final report and
recommendations of the study on legal and operational framework for DIB has been

43
submitted by the consultant. A proposal for the reformed DIB will be considered by the InterInstitutional Committee before approval by the Government.
34.
Data on financial soundness indicators for end December 2010 indicate that the
banking system continues to be sound and stable on the whole. However, there was a
significant increase in non-performing loans (NPLs) in the second half of 2010. This was a
result of targeted examination on some key banks which revealed that a number of loans,
granted to sectors that had been affected by the global financial crisis, had not been properly
reclassified and provided for as required for bad and doubtful debts. This was followed by
full scope examination of those banks. The banks have been directed to strengthen their
credit risk management systems to reduce the NPLs. According to self assessment on the
25 Basle I Core Principles for effective banking supervision, the Bank has fully complied
with 8 Core Principles and largely complied with 16 Core Principles, but is materially not
compliant with one Core Principle. This will be addressed in the context of preparation for
the issuance of a sovereign bond.
35.
Progress has been made in the establishment of a credit reference system. Credit
Reference Bureau and Databank Regulations, were finalized and gazetted. The bidding
documents for a databank solution provider have been finalized and interested vendors have
been invited to purchase the same. The expected deadline for submission of bids is March 23,
2011. A public notice intended to entice interested and eligible private credit reference
bureau operators to apply for a license has also been issued.
36.
The National Social Security Authority has been formed and the CEO of the
Authority was appointed in September 2010. The regulator is now working in consultation
with the Bank of Tanzania to prepare investment guidelines for pension funds, and has
initiated an actuarial review of the pension funds as part of this process. Issuance of the
investment guidelines was a structural benchmark under the PSI for end-March 2011, but the
Government is requesting a re-phasing of the benchmark to end-September 2011 in order to
allow the actuarial review to be completed. Tanzania received technical assistance in
February 2011 to assist in the implementation of a reporting system for the collection of data
from insurance companies and pension funds. These reports will be compiled, disseminated,
and reported to the Bank of Tanzania on a quarterly basis, beginning with the quarter ending
June 2011.
37.
Regarding the national payment system, the Bank has continued to support banks and
mobile network operators in development of mobile banking through a mobile payment
policy partnership. Mobile Payment Regulations have been drafted by the Bank to promote
financial inclusion of the under-banked and unbanked. These will be reviewed by
stakeholders before June 2011. In addition, utilization of TISS has continued to expand
reaching 50.3 percent of total government expenditure by January 2011. It is expected that

44
once most ministries make payments through TISS, cheque capping for Government
payments exceeding TSh 10 million will be implemented.
38.
Following the ratification of the Common Market Protocol by all EAC Partner States
in July 2010, EAC central banks have taken steps towards implementing a Cross Border
Payment System, which will help to promote trade among the East Africa countries. Business
and technical functional specifications for the development of the East African Payment
System (EAPS) were agreed by all members and signed-off in September 2010. The EAPS
regulatory framework is in the process of being finalized. In the meantime, the enhancement
and testing of the system has commenced. The system will go live in the fourth quarter of
2010/11.
39.
Measures to liberalize capital account continue to be implemented following their
inclusion in the East African Common Market Protocol. A National Task Force which was
formed to review national laws has identified a list of laws and regulations which need to be
amended to facilitate removal of existing restrictions on capital and financial account
transactions. In the meantime, the Bank has started reviewing the Foreign Exchange Act of
1992.
Statistical issues
40.
Revision of the composition of the consumer basket was finalized by the National
Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on the basis of results from the 2007 household budget survey
(HBS) and the new CPI series was released as planned in November 2010. The rebased CPI
follows the internationally recommended COICOP and has a lower weight for food and
larger weights for communications and some other household expenditure items. The new
classification incorporates a number of methodological improvements, including the use of
geometric mean for compiling elementary index aggregates, the use of an improved index
compilation system, and improved procedures for collecting and processing prices. The
reference period was also changed from December 2001 to September 2010. The revision of
CPI compilation makes it comparable to most other EAC member states. Work is now
underway to develop a harmonized core inflation index for the EAC. In the meantime, the
NBS is publishing a CPI measure excluding food and energy prices as a proxy for core
inflation, thus meeting the related benchmark under the PSI.
Programme Monitoring
41.
Progress in the implementation of the policies under this program will be monitored
through assessment criteria (ACs), indicative targets (IT), and structural benchmarks (SBs)
detailed in the attached Tables 3 and 4 and through semi-annual reviews. The modification of
the end-June 2011 AC on net international reserves is being requested while ACs for
end-December 2011 are being proposed, to be assessed respectively at the third and fourth
reviews. The third review is expected to be completed by end-December 2011 and the fourth
review by end-May 2012. The attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding contains
definitions and adjustors.

ATTACHMENT II. TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING ON SELECTED
CONCEPTS AND DEFINITIONS USED IN THE MONITORING OF THE PSI-SUPPORTED
PROGRAM
April 15, 2011
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The purpose of this Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) is to describe
concepts and definitions that are being used in the monitoring of the quantitative PSI
assessment criteria and indicative targets under Tanzania’s program supported by the PSI
arrangement. The principal data sources are the standardized reporting forms, 1SR and 2SR,
as provided by the Bank of Tanzania to the IMF, and the government debt tables provided by
the Accountant General’s office.
II. DEFINITIONS
Net international reserves
2.
Net international reserves (NIR) of the Bank of Tanzania (BoT) are defined as reserve
assets minus reserve liabilities. The BoT’s reserve assets, as defined in the IMF BOP manual
(5th edition) and elaborated in the reserve template of the IMF’s special data dissemination
standards (SDDS), include: (i) monetary gold; (ii) holdings of SDRs; (iii) the reserve position
at the IMF; (iv) all holdings of foreign exchange; and (v) other liquid and marketable assets
readily available to the monetary authorities. Reserve assets exclude assets pledged or
otherwise encumbered, including but not limited to assets used as collateral or guaranteed for
a third party external liability (assets not readily available). The BoT’s reserve liabilities
include: (i) all short-term foreign exchange liabilities to nonresidents, of original maturities
less than one year; and (ii) outstanding purchases and loans from the IMF.
Reserve money and reserve money band
3.
Reserve money is defined as the sum of currency issued by the BoT and the deposits
of commercial banks with the BoT. The reserve money targets are the projected daily
averages of March, June, September, and December within a symmetrical one percent band.
The upper bound of the band serves as the assessment criterion or indicative target.
Net domestic financing of the Government of Tanzania
4.
Net domestic financing of the Government of Tanzania (NDF) includes financing of
the budget of the central (union) government of Tanzania (“government”) by the banking
system (BoT and commercial banks) and the nonbank public. NDF is calculated as the
cumulative change since the beginning of the fiscal year in the sum of: (i) loans and advances
to the government by the BoT and holdings of government securities and promissory notes
(including liquidity paper issued by the BoT for monetary policy purposes), minus all
government deposits with the BoT; (ii) all BoT accounts receivable due from the
Government of Tanzania that are not included under (i) above; (iii) loans and advances to the

50
government by other depository corporations and holdings of government securities and
promissory notes, minus all government deposits held with other depository corporations;
and (iv) the outstanding stock of domestic debt held outside depository corporations,
excluding: government debt issued for the recapitalization of the NMB and TIB; debt swaps
with COBELMO (Russia) and the government of Bulgaria; mortgage on acquired sisal
estates; compensation claims; and debt of parastatal companies assumed by the government.
Government deposits at the BoT
5.
Government deposits at the BoT include government deposits as reported in the BoT
balance sheet, 1SR -including counterpart deposits in the BoT of liquidity paper issued for
monetary policy purposes, and foreign currency-denominated government deposits at the
BoT, including the PRBS accounts and the foreign currency deposit account.
External payments arrears
6.
External payments arrears consist of the total amount of external debt service
obligations (interest and principal) of the government and the BoT that have not been paid at
the time they are due, excluding arrears on external debt service obligations pending the
conclusion of debt-rescheduling arrangements. The ceiling on external payments arrears is
continuous and applies throughout the year.
Contracting or guaranteeing of external debt on nonconcessional terms
7.
The term “external debt” will have the meaning set forth in Point 9 of the Guidelines
on Performance Criteria with Respect to External Debt (Executive Board’s Decision
No. 6230-(79/140), as amended by Decision No. 14416-(09/91), effective December 1,
2009). External debt will be determined on the basis of currency of denomination of the debt.
Government external debt is outstanding debt owed or guaranteed by the Government of
Tanzania, the Bank of Tanzania, subnational governments, and companies in which the
government has at least 50 percent ownership, unless otherwise stipulated.1 The ceiling on
external debt is continuous and applies throughout the year.
8.
Government debt is considered nonconcessional if the grant element is lower than
35 percent, calculated using discount rates based on Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) commercial interest reference rates (CIRR), adjusted as
appropriate for different maturities. For maturities of less than 15 years, the grant element
will be calculated based on 6-month averages of commercial interest rates. For maturities
longer than 15 years, the grant element will be calculated based on 10-year averages. This
PSI assessment criterion applies not only to debt as defined in Point 9 of the Guidelines
1

Excluded for these purposes, except if the government offers an explicit guarantee on the debt, are: Tanzania
Investment Bank; Tanzania Port Authority; Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation; Dar es Salaam
Rapid Transport Authority; Economic Processing Zones Authority; National Development Corporation; Small
Industries Development Organization; National Housing Corporation; National Identity Authority; Dar es
Salaam Water and Sewage Authority; and Tanzania Airport Authority.

51
on Performance Criteria with Respect to External Debt (Executive Board’s Decision
No. 6230-(79/140), as amended by Decision No. 14416-(09/91), effective December 1,
2009), but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been
received.
9.

Foreign program assistance and program exchange rates

10.
Foreign program assistance is defined as budget support and basket grants and loans
received by the Ministry of Finance (MoF) through BoT accounts and accounts at other
depository corporations and is calculated as the cumulative sum, since the beginning of the
fiscal year, of the receipts from (i) program loans and (ii) program grants. Program assistance
does not include nonconcessional external debt as defined in paragraphs 7 and 8.
11.
Foreign program assistance and program exchange rates for the period April 1, 2011
through December 31, 2011 are:

III. ADJUSTERS
Net international reserves
12.
The end-June, end-September and end-December 2011 quantitative targets for the
BoT’s net international reserves will be adjusted downward by the amount in U.S. dollars of
any shortfall in foreign program assistance in U.S. dollars (up to a limit of TSh 250 billion),
with each quarterly shortfall converted from U.S. dollars to Tanzanian shillings using that
quarter’s program average exchange rate. The cumulative shortfall will be the sum of all
quarterly shortfalls in Tanzanian shillings up to the date of assessment, relative to projections
shown in the Quantitative PSI Assessment Criteria and Indicative Targets Table attached to
the applicable Letter of Intent and Memorandum of Economic and Financial Polices of the
Government of Tanzania.

The end-June, end-September and end-December 2011 quantitative limits on the net
domestic financing of the Government of Tanzania will be adjusted upward for any shortfall
in foreign program assistance in U.S. dollars (up to a limit of TSh 250 billion), relative to
projections shown in the Quantitative PSI Assessment Criteria and Indicative Targets Table
attached to the applicable Letter of Intent and Memorandum of Economic and Financial
Polices of the Government of Tanzania. Each quarterly shortfall will be converted from
U.S. dollars to Tanzanian shillings using that quarter’s program average exchange rate. The
cumulative shortfall will be the sum of all quarterly shortfalls in Tanzanian shillings up to the
date of assessment.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION AND
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND1
UNITED REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA
Joint World Bank/IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the staffs of the International Development Association and
International Monetary Fund
Approved by Jeffrey Lewis and Marcelo Giugale (World Bank)
and Saul Lizondo and Dominique Desruelle (IMF)
April 21, 2011
Tanzania’s risk of debt distress remains low even when taking into account government
borrowing from both domestic and external sources, including on non-concessional terms.
While the planned external non-concessional borrowing (USD1.5 billion over the three-year
PSI period and 1 percent of GDP per year thereafter) increases the present value (PV) of
debt-to-GDP and other indicators, it should not jeopardize long-term debt sustainability.
However, alternative scenarios suggest that debt indicators would be sensitive to further
borrowing on expensive terms. In addition, public debt sustainability analysis raises some
concern under an alternative scenario of persistently large primary deficits. This highlights
that a sound debt management strategy, a conservative approach to non-concessional
borrowing, and commitment to fiscal discipline are important factors for maintaining debt
and fiscal sustainability.
I.

BACKGROUND

1.
Tanzania’s macroeconomic performance over the last decade has been strong.
Growth averaged 7 percent per year during 2002–09 which, together with a sharp increase in
revenue collection and increased donor funding, provided room for a substantial expansion in
public spending. Inflation was kept in check for much of this period, but accelerated in 2008
(13.5 percent at end year), driven mainly by the spike in international food and fuel prices.
However, it slowed back to around 5 percent by 2009. Tanzania has coped well with the
global crisis, in part thanks to supportive fiscal policies. Growth quickly rebounded to its precrisis level, reaching about 7 percent by end of 2010.
The positive overall economic outlook is tempered in the near term by below-normal rains
and power rationing. Growth is projected to slow to 6 percent in the coming months but to

previous one prepared in May 2010. Tables and figures are in fiscal years (July–June). For example, 2011 refers
to fiscal year 2010/11.

55
rebound to an average of 6.6 percent in the next fiscal year, once the power situation
normalizes, and 7.4 percent by 2012/13. Growth is expected to rise to 7.5 percent of GDP
over the medium term, thanks to large investments in mining and continued growth in the
non-mining economy. Higher international food and fuel prices could push up inflation in the
second half of 2011 before it slows back down to 5 percent. Official international reserves
are at a comfortable level (US$3.9 billion as of end-June 2011, more than 4.7 months of
current year imports of goods and services), partly reflecting solid export growth, Fund
balance of payments support under the Exogenous Shock Facility (ESF), and the SDR
allocation.
2.
Tanzania has benefited from extensive debt relief. HIPC and MDRI debt relief
reduced Tanzania’s debt burden sharply to US$3.4 billion, or 20.6 percent of GDP at endJune 2007. Debt policy has remained prudent since the provision of debt relief, and total
external debt amounted to US$6.5 billion or 30 percent of GDP by end-June 2010.2 In
present value (PV) terms, the public and publicly guaranteed sector (PPG) external debt
stood at about 22.7 percent of GDP at end-June 2010, or 90.5 percent of exports, while public
external debt service was around 0.8 percent of exports. 3 64 percent of PPG external debt
was owed to multilateral (mainly IDA) and 15 percent to bilateral creditors. Tanzania’s
public domestic debt stood at TSh 3.96 trillion (13.1 percent of GDP) at end-June 2010, up
slightly from the previous year. About half of the domestic debt is in short-term Treasury
bills.

56
spending, the authorities are currently exploring sources for semi-concessional and nonconcessional external borrowing, as well as domestic funding sources.
II. BASELINE ASSUMPTIONS
4.
Changes in baseline assumptions are minimal from the previous DSA (Box 1).
The growth path (with medium-term growth at about 7.5 percent annually) is virtually
unchanged. Similarly, inflation (GDP deflator) is projected at the Bank of Tanzania’s
medium-term objective of 5 percent; the real exchange rate is assumed to stay constant at
2009/10 levels throughout the projection period; and export/import price index deflators are
assumed to grow 2 percent annually. The noninterest current account deficit is expected to
increase in 2010–12 before improving steadily to below 6 percent of GDP in the long term,
due to the supply response to the buildup in infrastructure.
Box 1. Comparison with the previous DSA
Changes in assumptions with respect to the previous DSA are largely limited to updating prices
and interest rates in view of prevailing market conditions; and incorporating revisions in the
debt stock as provided by the authorities as they proceed with upgrading their data base and
debt monitoring capacity.










Growth: Growth is projected at 7.5 percent over the medium- and long-term, slightly
above the rate recorded prior to the global financial crisis on account of the stepping up of
infrastructure.
Exports and imports: Export growth is kept somewhat higher than import growth to
reflect higher infrastructure spending and export-led growth.
Development spending: Development spending increases from 8.6 percent of GDP in
2009/10 to an average of 9.8 percent during 2010–13, and thereafter 9.4 percent.
External non-concessional borrowing: As in the previous DSA, non-concessional
borrowing is assumed to increase by 1 percent of GDP a year after the PSI program
period. The average interest rate has been lowered from 9 to 8 percent in line with
prevailing market conditions.
Foreign concessional loans and grants: External grants decline to about 3 percent of
GDP by 2019/20 and thereafter, compared to 4.5 percent in the previous DSA. Foreign
concessional loans also decline in percent of GDP to reflect a gradual reduction in aid
dependency.
Fiscal financing gap: The fiscal financing gap increased substantially in 2010/11 from
the previous year. The alternative scenario whereby the primary deficit is fixed at 2010/11
level throughout the entire projection period shows substantial deterioration in all debt
indicators.

5.
Borrowing assumptions are also largely unchanged. Domestic and external nonconcessional borrowing is expected to be used to finance infrastructure investment. This
includes non-concessional external financing of US$1.5 billion over the PSI program period

57
(US$525 million in 2010/11 and 2011/12, and US$450 million in 2012/13) and 1 percent of
GDP for the remainder of the projection period. Domestic financing is projected at about
1 percent of GDP for 2010/11–2014/15 and not exceeding 1 percent of GDP thereafter. The
new domestic borrowing is assumed to be at an interest rate of 10 percent (with automatic
rollover), while external borrowing is assumed to have an average interest rate of 8 percent,
with a 1-year grace period and 10-years’ maturity. The authorities are also considering
issuance of a Eurobond, likely in 2011/12.
6.
Government revenues are assumed to increase as a percent of GDP while
external grants and concessional loans will decline. Domestic revenues grow from
16.1 percent of GDP in 2010/11 to about 20 percent of GDP by 2018/19 and then
21.4 percent by 2030/31—within IMF staff estimates of Tanzania’s tax potential. On the
other hand, external grants decline from 5.7 percent of GDP in 2010/11 to about 3 percent of
GDP by 2019/20 and thereafter. External concessional loans (both program and project
loans) would fall from 4 percent of GDP in 2010/11 to about 2.7 percent of GDP by 2030/31,
consistent with a gradual reduction in Tanzania’s aid dependency. Annual development
spending is assumed to stabilize at 9.4 percent of GDP for the long term. Annual
maintenance costs equal to 5 percent of the total value of the accumulated additional
infrastructure spending—are added to government recurrent spending throughout the period.
7.
Work is underway to strengthen institutional mechanisms to ensure the quality
of new infrastructure spending and an appropriate risk management strategy. The
authorities have developed a list of priority projects consistent with strategic planning
documents, including the Medium Term Public Sector Investment Plan and the new PRS.
The IMF and World Bank have recently provided technical assistance on debt management
and institutional and legal frameworks for PPPs. Drawing on this assistance, the authorities
have put in place a new medium-term debt strategy and a new PPP framework. Similarly, the
President has approved a “roadmap” with recommendations to improve the business
environment, and thus, the private sector response to scaled up infrastructure investment.
8.
Debt data revisions by the authorities reveal weaknesses in debt recording. As
Tanzania’s debt is rising and its composition becoming more complex, it is crucial to be able
to track all external debt accurately. The authorities are committed to improve their debt
monitoring capacities (including through structural benchmarks in the context of the PSIsupported program). They would benefit greatly from technical assistance on properly
collecting, compiling and maintaining debt data.6

6

Currently, there are two parallel databases for the external debt, at the Debt Management Department of the
BOT and the Accountant General's Office of the MOFEA. The MTDS TA mission recommended that
consolidation of the debt database is a priority and capacity enhancements in this area are urgently needed.

58
III. EXTERNAL AND FISCAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
9.
The risk of external debt distress remains low under the baseline scenario. As a
result of the planned non-concessional external borrowing, debt indicators rise but do not
jeopardize
long-run sustainability (Figure 1). Debt service indicators increase gradually throughout the
projection period, but stay well below risk thresholds. The PV of public external debt-toGDP ratio would increase from 26.6 percent of GDP in 2010/11 to 28.8 percent by 2015/16,
before falling to 16.2 percent by the end of the projection period. The PV of debt-to-exports
is expected to peak at 97.4 percent of GDP in 2012/13, before declining to 46.5 percent in
2030/31. The debt
service-to-export and debt service-to-revenues ratios would reach 6.3 and 10.3 percent,
respectively, by 2030/31.
Alternative scenario and shock analysis indicate that Tanzania’s debt dynamics
is sensitive to the terms of external borrowing. Tanzania’s public external debt would
remain below the relevant risk thresholds under the standard bound tests and extreme
shocks.7 However, an alternative scenario with less favorable financing terms (the interest
rate on new borrowing is 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline) shows a much
larger deterioration in most indicators (e.g. the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio increases from
27 percent in 2010/11 to 37 percent by 2020/21) before converging down to 32 percent in
2030/31.
10.

11.
The path of total public debt, which includes external debt and domestic debt,
also appears to be sustainable. The PV of public debt-to-GDP ratio increases from
39 percent in 2010/11 to 41.2 percent by 2012/13, before declining to 19.2 percent by the end
of the projection period. Similarly the PV of public debt-to revenue ratio peaks at
183.6 percent in 2012/13 before declining to 78 in 2030/31. Debt service-to-revenue
increases from 6.8 percent in 2010/11 to 11.5 percent by end of the projection period
(Figure 2).
12.
Public debt sustainability is particularly sensitive to the fiscal position
(Figure 2). As the 2010/11 fiscal financing gap increased substantially from the previous
year, the alternative scenario whereby the primary deficit is fixed through the entire
projection period shows substantial deterioration in all debt indicators. Under this scenario,
the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio would accelerate from 39 percent to 69 percent (A2 in Table 4).
The large fiscal deficit partly reflects the counter-cyclical response to the Global Financial
Crisis (GFC). Restoring a more balanced fiscal position is an urgent requirement to prevent
an unsustainable debt buildup. Given ambitious assumptions on revenue increases in the
7

Debt burden thresholds for Tanzania are PV of debt to GDP ratio of 50 percent, PV of debt-to-exports ratio of
200 percent, PV of debt-to-revenue ratio of 300 percent, debt-service-to-exports ratio of 25 percent, and
debt-service-to-revenue ratio of 35 percent.

59
baseline, revenue reform will be imperative to generate sufficient revenues in a nondistortionary manner. Balancing higher demands on the budget against financing constraints
will also call for significant increases in spending efficiency. Reducing the deficit, while
funding additional expenditures in areas where they are critically needed, such as health and
education, will likely require ambitious tax policy and PFM measures, areas where IMF and
WB TA has recently been provided.
IV. CONCLUSION
13.
Based on the updated DSA, Tanzania’s debt indicators are expected to remain
below indicative, country-specific thresholds. The additional borrowing to finance a
stepping up of infrastructure investment over the medium term will increase the present value
(PV) of debt-to-GDP and other indicators, but should not jeopardize long-term debt
sustainability. While in general the downside scenarios and sensitivity analysis support the
assessment of a low risk of debt distress, borrowing non-concessionally on expensive terms,
and large and persistent primary deficits can reverse this outlook. Therefore a sound debt
management strategy, a conservative approach to non-concessional borrowing, and
commitment to fiscal discipline are key factors for maintaining debt and fiscal sustainability.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the
completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the
decision point. Hence these two amounts can not be added.

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed during the interim
period.

owed to the Fund as of end-2004 that remains outstanding at the time the member qualifies for such debt
relief.

IX.

Safeguards Assessments:

Safeguards assessments of the Bank of Tanzania (BoT) were completed in December 2003,
August 2008, and November 2009. The 2009 assessment found that, while the BoT had taken
steps to strengthen its safeguards framework, risks remained due to delays in implementing
certain priority recommendations from the 2008 voluntary assessment. The external audit and
financial reporting continued to comply with international standards, but the audited results
were published with significant delays. The assessment recommended a bank-wide risk
assessment, outlined steps needed to modernize the internal audit function, and proposed
measures to enhance transparency of financial, control and compliance matters. The BoT has
since taken steps to improve the timeliness of its financial audits and the financial statements
for 2009/10 were published within the statutory deadline. The implementation of other
measures is in progress.
X.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

The currency of Tanzania is the Tanzania shilling. Under the revised classification
methodology, Tanzania has a floating exchange rate arrangement. The official exchange rate
is determined in relation to the rate established in the interbank market for foreign exchange.
The weighted average rate in the interbank market was TSh 1,516.83 per U.S. dollar as of
end-February 2011. The exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments
and transfers for current international transactions.
XI.

Article IV Consultation:

The most recent Article IV consultation was concluded on June 8, 2009 (Country Report
No. 09/179).
XII.

Resident Representative:

Mr. John Wakeman-Linn has been the Senior Resident Representative since August 2010.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
The United Republic of Tanzania
On May 6, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Tanzania.1
Background
The economy has performed strongly over the past decade with average growth of
7 percent, a robust expansion in exports, and progress towards the MDGs. The
authorities have implemented wide-ranging policy reforms over several decades and
recently were able to use the fiscal space accumulated in better years to mitigate the
impact of the global financial crisis. Nonetheless, challenges remain. Per capita income
is about US$ 550 and poverty remains widespread, with one in three living below the
poverty line. Tanzania is highly dependent on foreign aid, projected to peak at
10 percent of GDP this year.
Tanzania weathered the adverse shocks of recent years relatively well. Activity slowed
in the aftermath of the global financial crisis but rebounded in the second half of 2009,
thanks in part to supportive fiscal and monetary policies. Consumer price inflation fell
into single digits as good harvests pushed down food prices and fuel prices were
subdued. Financial market indicators remained sound overall.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

75
The economic rebound has now leveled off. Growth in 2010 is estimated at 7 percent
with continued strong performance in manufacturing, construction, and communications
and a more subdued expansion in agriculture and gold mining. In recent months, power
shortages after below-normal rainfalls have been taking a toll on activity. Growth is
expected to decline to 6 percent in 2011 but rebound quickly once the weather situation
normalizes. Consumer price inflation rose in early 2011 largely due to higher energy and
food prices—the latter mainly weather-related.
The medium-term outlook is favorable but could raise significant policy challenges.
Large projected investments in the commodity sectors could weigh on overall
competitiveness and pose challenges for exchange rate management. It also needs to
be ensured that these investments benefit other sectors of the economy. Rapid
population growth will continue to put pressure on the delivery of public services, far
outpacing the growth of domestic revenue or foreign aid.
The near-term fiscal situation is already challenging: revenue collection for 2010/11 is
falling short of ambitious budget targets due in part to the adverse weather situation,
constraining public spending and contributing to the emergence of arrears.2 Spending
was cut in the context of the mid-year budget review, and steps were taken to tighten
commitment controls, but more spending restraint is likely to be needed.
Monetary policy has become less accommodative, and the exchange rate has been
stable in recent months reflecting relatively modest inflation differentials and rising
domestic interest rates. Non-performing loans remained at manageable levels after
growing considerably in the second half of 2010, largely reflecting deterioration in
personal loans, which expanded significantly in recent years.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for the continued strong performance
despite the adverse shocks in recent years. While medium-term prospects remain
favorable, Directors encouraged the authorities to press ahead with essential fiscal
consolidation and structural reforms to sustain pro-poor growth and employment over
the medium term.
Directors agreed that a prudent 2011/12 budget would be an important first step
toward strengthening public finances. While recognizing that high fuel prices,
weather-related supply shocks, and shortfalls in donor aid could complicate near-term
fiscal management, they encouraged the authorities to continue to streamline current
spending by trimming the wage bill, aligning spending more closely with available
2

76
resources, and tightening existing commitment controls to help prevent the
reemergence of arrears. At the same time, it will be important to safeguard essential
social spending and high-yielding infrastructure investment.
Directors stressed the importance of broadening the tax base, reducing tax
exemptions, and strengthening public financial management. They considered that
strengthening VAT compliance and enhancing the taxation of the mining sector will be
key to boosting revenue mobilization.
Directors encouraged the authorities to expeditiously complete their debt
management strategy and maintain a cautious approach to non-concessional borrowing
to ensure debt sustainability over the medium term. In this context, they stressed the
need to carefully select projects financed with nonconcessional borrowing through
rigorous cost-benefit analysis.
Directors urged the authorities to monitor inflation developments closely and
stand ready to further tighten monetary policy as needed. They noted the staff’s
assessment that the exchange rate appears broadly in line with fundamentals. Directors
welcomed the overall soundness of the financial sector and the authorities’ reform
efforts, in line with the 2010 FSAP recommendations. They emphasized the importance
of continued vigilance regarding credit quality, given the recent rise in non-performing
loans and lending.
Directors stressed the importance of reinvigorating structural reforms and
improving governance and the business environment. Further progress in these areas is
critical to bolstering private sector confidence, increasing economic diversification, and
preserving the competitiveness of non-commodity sectors, including emerging
manufacturing exports.

IMF Executive Board Completes Second Review Under Policy Support Instrument for
Tanzania
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the second
review of Tanzania’s economic performance under the Policy Support Instrument (PSI). The
Executive Board also concluded Tanzania’s annual Article IV consultation, which will be
covered in a subsequent Public Information Notice.
The Executive Board approved a three-year PSI for Tanzania on June 4, 2010 (see Press
Release No. 10/227). The IMF’s framework for PSIs is designed for low-income countries
that may not need IMF financial assistance, but still seek close cooperation with the IMF in
preparation and endorsement of their policy frameworks. PSI-supported programs are based
on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a participatory process involving
civil society and development partners. A country’s performance under a PSI is reviewed biannually.
Following the Executive Board’s discussion of Tanzania, Mr. John Lipsky, IMF First
Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, said:
“Tanzania has shown continued strong macroeconomic performance as accommodating
fiscal and monetary policies helped mitigate the impact of the global financial crisis. The
authorities now rightly intend to rein in these expansionary policies, restore policy buffers,
and prepare for a possible deceleration in foreign aid. The threat of a protracted weatherrelated supply shock and rising international fuel prices will also weigh on near-term fiscal
and monetary management.
“Building on the tradition of solid budgetary policies, a prudent 2011/12 budget would be an
important first step toward realigning spending with available resources. Such a positive
signal of the commitment to fiscal consolidation would be critical for investment and donor
confidence. Bolstering revenue mobilization through tax policy measures as well as spending

79
rationalization are needed to respond to the growing demand for public services. More
realistic revenue forecasts and better spending commitment controls would help contain
arrears.
“Cautious macroeconomic policies have enabled Tanzania to mobilize non-concessional
resources to finance infrastructure investment. It will be important to strengthen public
investment and debt management processes in order to ensure value for money from these
resources. Non-concessional borrowing should be allocated to well-designed growthenhancing infrastructure projects that are the subject of a rigorous project evaluation process.
“The gradual shift to a less accommodative monetary policy has been an appropriate
response to the recovery in economic activity. The authorities will need to be vigilant to
rising inflationary pressures and the impact of further increases in food and energy prices.
“The authorities’ structural reform agenda needs to be reinvigorated to improve governance
and the business environment, which will help bolster private sector confidence, increase
economic diversification, and preserve the competitiveness of non-commodity sectors.”

80
Statement by Mr. Majoro, Executive Director
United Republic of Tanzania
May 6, 2011
1.
My Tanzanian authorities’ perseverance with prudent macroeconomic policies and
deepened structural reforms enabled the economy to recover swiftly from the global
economic crises. They remain determined to persevere with this macroeconomic framework
as they face new global challenges of a second spike in commodity prices, and repetitive
drought conditions. They are confident that with continued support of the Fund and the
international community, they stand a good chance of mitigating the effects of the
commodity price surge and the fallout from the sovereign debt risks in advanced economies.
They, in that regard, stand ready to take appropriate measures to protect the country’s
macroeconomic stability.
2.
My authorities appreciate the Fund’s constructive engagement and support under the
PSI and the related technical assistance packages. Going forward, they are determined to
further strengthen their macroeconomic framework, and achieve key national and regional
objectives set out in their PRSP—Mkukuta II—and East African single market protocols that
are supported by the PSI.
3.
To that end, and in view of the strong performance under the program—with all endDecember 2010 quantitative performance/assessment criteria observed with good margins,
and implementation of structural reforms on track—they request Directors’ support for the
completion of the second review of the PSI. They also request Director’s support for the
modification of the end-June 2011 assessment criterion on international reserves, and
rephasing of structural benchmarks.
Recent economic developments and respective policy environment
4.
Tanzania’s strengthened economic fundamentals—policy-wise and the broadened
economic base—helped the country weather the storm of the global economic downturn and
return swiftly to a growth path. Real GDP growth that had declined from 7.4 percent in 2008
to 6.0 percent in 2009 as a result of the deterioration in the external environment, did recover
to 7.0 percent in 2010. However, real GDP growth for 2011 is projected to decline to
6 percent, largely as a result of weather-induced power shortages and another round of
deterioration of external environment—especially the effects of the surge in global energy
and food prices and the decline in the inflow of development aid. The economy should,
however, recover promptly once the government’s investments in additional power
generation kicks in later this year, weather conditions normalize, external shocks subside,
and donor funding increase to pre-crisis levels.
5.
The trade account of the balance of payments in 2010/11 recorded an improvement
following higher growth in exports—in particular gold and tourist receipts—which offset the
impact of the fuel-related increase in the import bill. Overall, exports—both traditional and
non-traditional—expanded at a particularly rapid pace, with manufacturing exports nearly
doubling through the year. Official gross reserves by end-June 2011are estimated to increase

81
to USD 3,816.2 million, sufficient to cover to about 4.7 months of import of goods and
services. However, the recent assessment by the International Energy Agency that the current
high oil prices may remain for a longer period due to surging demand and limited new supply
could have a significant impact on the country’s import bill and its official reserves.
6.
My authorities’ fiscal policy in the first half of the fiscal year remained within the PSI
targets, mainly due to a proactive management of spending and improved revenue
performance. The cash-budgeting system helped contain monthly expenditure within
available resources and meet the domestic financing target. On the revenue front, data as of
end-February indicates some improvement in domestic revenue collection and the full year
performance is projected to exceed the outturn during the first half of the year. Nevertheless,
the authorities concur with staff’s assessment that growing downside risks emanating from
the impact of the protracted power shortages on corporate activity and profits may affect the
level of revenue collections in the near term. Notwithstanding the difficulties entailed in
modifying the fiscal regime of the mining sector for existing agreements, the authorities
remain focused on broadening the tax base, and strengthening customs and tax
administration. They view the recent Fund TA recommendations on tax policy and public
finance management as fundamental inputs into their reform effort, and they look forward to
further engagement with the Fund in this area with the view of raising the revenue yield.
7.
The thrust of government spending remained in line with the overall macroeconomic
framework—maintaining the level of spending on the key MDG clusters and infrastructure.
The authorities’ modest fiscal stimulus—totaling about 2 percent of GDP and targeted at
protecting employment and incomes, ensuring food security, and protecting investment in
infrastructure and key social sectors—has a built-in sunset clause at the end of 2010/2011. In
that regard, and in view of the projected shortfalls in general budget support by the country’s
development partners, the authorities agree with staff over the need for streamlining of
spending while protecting priority services and investments.
8.
The government has made progress in raising funds from external non-concessional
borrowing. Negotiations are in progress with various banks and institutions. The authorities
are confident that they will make use of the entire non-concessional borrowing window for
this financial year to finance key infrastructure projects.
9.
My authorities’ monetary policy continued to support the overall macroeconomic
framework with a low interest rate environment. Reemergence of inflationary pressures—
mainly due to increases in the prices of food items and energy reflecting global trends—has
raised new concerns. The Bank of Tanzania (BoT), in addition to strengthening the operation
of its policy instruments for sterilization of liquidity and broadening of its monetary policy
transparency, has adopted a tightened monetary policy stance to forestall the second round
effects of the commodity price surge. They reaffirm that their flexible exchange rate policy
has served the country very well also in supporting the diversification of exports.
10.
The banking system has weathered the global crisis well, with continued strong
capital base, but the authorities are mindful of the recent upturn in the level of nonperforming loans (NPLs) and, in that regard, continue to monitor these aggregates carefully.

82
The authorities are aware that a key challenge facing Tanzania’s financial sector today is to
ensure that the pension funds are strong, and managed professionally, in the interests of the
existing and prospective pensioners. In that regard, they have attached high priority to
strengthening the operations of the new regulator, the National Social Security Regulatory
Authority, with, inter alia, finalization of the investment guidelines for the social security
funds.
Medium-term policy framework
Fiscal policy
11.
My authorities will continue to actively use their fiscal policy to spur economic
growth to its trajectory and to address the effects of repetitive internal and external shocks.
To achieve these objectives, measures including sustaining budgetary spending levels for the
priority services, modest scaling-up of investment in infrastructure and primary sectors to
shore-up economic growth, and deepening structural reforms to improve the business
environment will continue to be prioritized.
12.
To maintain spending in these priority areas while embarking on a fiscal
consolidation path, the authorities will continue to strengthen domestic and concessional
resource mobilization in the medium term. Cognizant of the overall resource limitations, they
intend to facilitate greater inflows of FDI and participation of the private sector through
PPPs, and fully utilize the current three-year non-concessional financing window—about
$1.5bn. They will especially remain vigilant of the contingent liabilities arising from greater
use of FDI and PPPs, and debt sustainability implications of non-concessional funding. To
that end, they are building capacities in these areas, and are grateful for the recent tripartite
discussions with the Fund, the World Bank and the African Development Bank. Going
forward, they will further explore the non-concessional lending facilities at the latter two
institutions.
13.
On the expenditure side, the authorities will pursue expenditure streamlining in line
with the program. Going forward, they will seek to discuss with staff the various options and
related implementation modalities during the subsequent staff missions. Additionally, they
will take steps to strengthen budget execution, and improve the alignment between policy
objectives and the budget through prioritization of public investment in line with their
Medium-term Public Investment Plan (MPIP) and the forthcoming Medium-term Economic
Development Plan.
Monetary and exchange rate policies
14.
My authorities’ monetary policy will continue supporting their macroeconomic
framework through maintaining sufficient liquidity in the financial system, and low and
stable inflation. They will remain vigilant of the inflation pressures arising from the
resurgence of global commodity prices and domestic supply shocks. To achieve the objective
of anchoring its monetary policy on low and stable inflation, the BoT will continue to bolster
its open market operations, maintain a flexible exchange rate policy, rely substantially on

83
foreign exchange sales for sterilization of liquidity, and continue to improve liquidity
forecasting. The BoT reaffirms its commitment to maintain the transparency of its policy
stance and to promote orderly financial markets. The authorities will also seek to make
progress in the preparation for and negotiations of the East African Monetary Union. To that
end, the targeted support by the Fund in key relevant areas will be greatly appreciated by the
EAC partners.
Financial sector
15.
The BoT will continue to strengthen its supervisory and regulatory services to the
financial institutions to stem the reemergence of exposure to concentration of loan portfolio
and to contain the recent surge in NPLs. It will also continue to strengthen the regulatory
framework for financial institutions consistent with the recommendations of the recent FSAP
and further build on the recent inaugural Financial Stability Report. Following the
operationalization of the National Social Security Regulatory Authority, the BoT will finalize
the inaugural set of the investment guidelines for the pension funds.
Structural reforms
16.
My authorities’ commitment to the implementation of a wide range of reforms
underpins the Mkukuta II objectives. Improving the stock and quality of infrastructure—from
road and rail networks to energy and telecommunications and regional infrastructure
projects—is a priority with the aim of enhancing productivity in the primary sectors and
competitiveness of the country as a whole, and strengthening the East African single market.
Additionally, the authorities’ pursuit of agricultural transformation—Kilimo Kwanza—
should inject the needed momentum in tackling poverty in a predominantly agrarian
economy. The new national social protection framework would guide the authorities’ policy
thrust in other poverty-reduction programs.
Conclusion
17.
Tanzania’s macroeconomic fundamentals and the authorities’ continued commitment
to strong policies helped the economy to restore its growth momentum faster than earlier
envisaged. They are aware of the reemerging risks and are, therefore, prepared to take
appropriate measures to protect the gains in the country’s macroeconomic stability. In the
near term, and notwithstanding the need for fiscal consolidation, the authorities are
determined to ensure that the program focuses on sustaining macroeconomic stability,
enhancing domestic resource mobilization, promoting broad-based and pro-poor growth, and
increasing investment in infrastructure, primary sectors and core MDG clusters. Going
forward, they reaffirm that continued engagement with the Fund and the support of
development partners will enable them achieve these goals.
