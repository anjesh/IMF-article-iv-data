Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation—Supplementary Information
Prepared by Western Hemisphere Department
(In consultation with other Departments)
December 10, 2010
1.
This supplement reports on developments since the staff report (SM/10/304) was
issued.
2.
Recent data point to a further weakening in the economic recovery. In Q3 real
GDP grew at 1 percent (s.a.a.r. annualized), below staff’s forecast (1½ percent), with the
undershoot largely reflecting weaker-than-expected residential construction and net exports.
Employment rose in November, but by less than expected; nevertheless, the unemployment
rate fell to 7.6 percent, the lowest since January 2009. Meanwhile, Canada’s current account
deficit widened to 4⅓ percent of GDP in the third quarter. Headline and core inflation edged
up but remained within the Bank’s control range.
3.
Recent measures smooth the medium-term fiscal adjustment path. The
government has announced additional details on infrastructure funding, namely that it will
extend by seven months the deadline for infrastructure projects to be completed under the
economic stimulus, to October 31, 2011. Under staff estimates, the extension of the deadline
for funding infrastructure projects significantly smoothes the change in the general
government structural balance for CY2011, reducing it from 1.1 percent of GDP to
0.9 percent of GDP (and possibly lower). In the staff’s view, this adjustment reflects a
welcome recalibration of the balance between supporting the recovery and making a start
toward medium-term deficit reduction, particularly as Canada has ample fiscal space to
respond should downside risks materialize.
4.
Provincial budgets consolidation plans remain on track, with recent fiscal data
more favorable than anticipated. Recently released third-quarter figures on provincial
economic accounts, as well as the release of Quebec’s 2009–10 Public Accounts and the
Update on the Economic and Financial Situation, indicate that both sub-national government
net lending, and total government net lending have improved notably since the Q2 release.

2
5.
On December 7, as widely expected, the Bank of Canada left the overnight rate
unchanged at 1 percent for a second consecutive meeting. The Bank noted that the global
economic recovery is unfolding as expected, although risks have increased, including the key
risk that sovereign debt stress in several countries could trigger additional strains in global
financial markets.
6.
Financial markets conditions have remained broadly stable. Since the staff report
was issued. The Canadian dollar has been broadly unchanged vis-á-vis the U.S. dollar, while
the stock market has continued to rebound. Measures of financial strains remain subdued,
with the measure of interbank spreads rising slightly. Interest rates on long-term government
bonds have picked up, trailing the rise in U.S. treasury rates. The Bank’s December
Financial System Review noted that risks to Canada’s financial system remain elevated, and
had increased since the prior report was issued in June.

November 24, 2010
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 1/


Focus. The pace of exit from macro stimulus, cementing fiscal stabilization, and financial sector
reform in the context of international initiatives.



Background. Canada has performed well compared with its G-7 counterparts, thanks to its more
resilient financial system, but was hit harder than other commodity exporters, due to its strong ties
with the U.S. The economy continues to recover on the back of a substantial policy stimulus and
strong domestic demand, but the recovery is now moderating.



Economic Outlook. Growth is expected to be muted in the second half of 2010 and in 2011 as
household debt has run up to high levels, housing markets are cooling and fiscal stimulus is waning.
Risks are tilted to the downside, with a key risk that the global recovery stalls.



Monetary Policy. Given the benign inflation outlook, forthcoming fiscal drag, and the mounting
challenges to domestic growth, the Bank has appropriately put further rate hikes on hold for now;
going forward, accommodation should be withdrawn cautiously. The authorities are considering, as
part of the ongoing statutory review of the monetary framework, steps including a shift to pricelevel path targeting (PLPT), in 2012; the staff and the authorities see the existing inflation targeting
framework as serving Canada well, while the benefits in practice of PLPT are uncertain.



Fiscal Policy. The recession and large stimulus ended an 11-year string of federal surpluses. The
authorities appropriately target a return to balance at the federal level over the medium run, with an
ambitious and growth-friendly plan. The near-term adjustment is substantially frontloaded despite
the steps taken by the authorities to smooth it; in light of the heightened risks to the outlook, a
smoother adjustment could have been contemplated. For the long run, stabilizing health-care costs
will pose challenges.



Financial Sector. The Canadian financial system remains resilient, but near-term risks have
increased, including from stretched household balance sheets and U.S. exposures. Canadian
financial institutions are well positioned to adapt to the international post-crisis reform agenda; a
national securities regulator remains an important priority.



Analytical Work. Background studies explore the dynamics of the exchange rate during the crisis;
recent trends in the housing market; the framework for housing finance; potential growth in the post
crisis era; and the outlook for the Canadian auto-sector vis-à-vis NAFTA partners.

1/ Significant policy developments occurred after this Staff Report had been issued to the Board, which are
discussed in the attached Staff Supplement.

I. MACROECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS, PROSPECTS, AND RISKS
Canada has weathered well the global recession, reflecting a strong position at the onset of
the crisis, a sizeable macro policy response, and a healthy banking sector. However, the
recovery is slowing and near-term external risks are mounting. In the absence of a doubledip recession in the United States and/or a new rapid deterioration of global financial
conditions from renewed sovereign credit strains, Canada should enjoy a comfortable, if not
exuberant, rate of growth in the near term.
A. Canada’s Rapid Recovery
1.
The Canadian economy emerged from the recession in the second half of 2009
(Figure 1). The recession ended in 2009Q2 and GDP recovered its pre-crisis level by end
2010Q2, growing by a cumulative 3.4 percent (non-annualized, compared with a peak-totrough decline of about 3¼ percent). Growth was particularly strong in late 2009 and early
2010, leading to a faster recovery than in other G-7 countries as well as advanced commodity
exporters. As a result, Canada is the only G-7 country that virtually recouped the loss in
employment (apart from Germany) and output during the recession by mid 2010, and the first
to record year-over-year increases in employment by mid 2010Q1.
2.
Domestic demand has been buoyant, in part because bank credit continued to
flow thanks to a resilient financial system. Indeed, household debt rose to a new high of
143.6 percent of disposable income (vis-à-vis 148.6 percent in the United States on a
comparable basis), supporting consumption. Meanwhile residential and business investment
gained momentum, on the back of favorable financing conditions.
3.
The rapid turnaround of activity and vigorous domestic demand owes much to
the government’s rightly-sized and well-targeted macroeconomic stimulus. In January
2009, the federal and provincial authorities launched a major fiscal stimulus—one of the
largest among advanced economies—totaling about 4 percent of one year’s GDP over two
years, including measures targeted at credit, housing, and labor markets.1 Meanwhile, the
federal government pumped liquidity into the economy through the purchase of insured
mortgages.2 In April 2009, the Bank of Canada slashed its policy rate to an all-time low of ¼
percent, and committed to keep rates at that level until mid-2010, conditional on inflation
developments. Simultaneously, the Bank injected liquidity in short-term markets to alleviate
1

Canada’s stimulus is around 2 percent of GDP per year in 2009 and 2010, and includes the effects of phased
revenue measures included in the 2007 Economic Statement (amounting to a total 1 percent of GDP over two
years) and policies announced in the Economic Action Plan of 2009. Staff estimates exclude financing measures
to support the auto sector of around 0.9 percent of GDP.
2

The Insured Mortgage Purchase Programme (IMPP) allowed the government to buy up to CAD 125 billion of
insured mortgage pools to support the liquidity of the Canadian Mortgage Housing Corporation–a Crown
corporation–with the goal of providing stable long-term funding to lenders so as to help them continue
providing credit.

4
pressures on financial institutions (though the expansion of its balance sheet was small by
international comparisons, given the resilience of the Canadian financial system). As the
recovery progressed, the Bank wound down liquidity operations and partly withdrew
accommodation, raising the policy rate to 1 percent by September 2010.
4.
The labor market has been a relatively bright spot in the recovery. Some
270,000 jobs were lost in 2009 (proportionally less than in prior recessions),3 but job creation
has been swift in 2010. However, the

industries linked to domestic demand.
Thus, the labor market has benefited from the relative strength of Canadian domestic
spending (notably construction and services) during the recession and the early stages of
recovery. In turn, this has helped to support household consumption.
5.
However, the recovery is now moderating. Q2 GDP expanded by only 2 percent
(q/q, s.a.a.r) and the average real GDP growth over July and August was near zero. Real
consumer spending growth has softened owing to the accumulation of debt and rising
financing costs. By contrast, business investment in inventories and machinery and
equipment (+30 percent in 2010Q2) remains an area of strength. Residential investment
stalled following the expiration of the Federal Home Renovation Tax Credit at end-January
2010 (which had boosted investment), the strengthening of mortgage insurance qualification
rules in April 2010, and the introduction of Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) in Ontario and
British Columbia in July. House prices remain elevated and are on the high side of modelbased estimates of fundamentals, but do not indicate a bubble in housing markets (see Box 1
and Chapter 1 of the Selected Issues Paper).

Employment fell by just 2.3 percent in the recent recession, compared with 3.4 percent in 1990–92
and 5.4 percent in 1981–82.

has narrowed, while capital inflows have
shifted from FDI (predominantly into
energy and metals) into portfolio investment in government and corporate securities. This
shift seems to reflect a combination of factors, such as growing uncertainty about commodity
prices, strong confidence in Canada’s macroeconomic policies and financial resilience, and
ample global liquidity.

although it picked up slightly in 2010Q2,

8.
Financial markets have largely recovered from the turmoil. The stock market has
rebounded by almost 50 percent since March 2009, despite recent volatility related to rising
uncertainties about the U.S. outlook and concerns about contagion from European sovereign
debt strains (Figure 5). The 3-month CAD LIBOR-OIS spread—an indicator of counterparty
risk—has narrowed to pre-Lehman levels. Overall financial conditions remain stimulative, as
reflected in banks’ wholesale funding costs, corporate bond spreads, and effective household
and business borrowing rates.

6
9.
Canadian banks were resilient to the global crisis. Banks have remained profitable,
with adequate provisioning and sound asset quality. Nonperforming loans rose to only
1.3 percent of total loans, compared with 5.4 percent in the United States, 3.5 percent in the
United Kingdom and 3 percent in the euro area (Figure 8). Capital adequacy has improved to
about 15½ percent (total regulatory capital/risk-weighted assets), after banks raised private
capital. Sound regulation and supervision helped maintain stability, as did the government
liquidity injections in 2008–2009 (see Box 3 and Table 1). Major banks’ Credit Default
Swaps (CDS) spreads have declined sharply from crisis highs and are around pre-Lehman
levels.
10.
Staff estimates suggest that the Canadian dollar is on the firm side, but there are

according to the Staff’s CGER analysis, although within a reasonable margin of uncertainty.5
11.
Corporate balance sheets remain healthy. Corporate leverage ratios have fallen,
and profits have rebounded, but they remain below pre-crisis levels. The Senior Loan Officer
Survey points to a widespread easing in business-lending conditions during 2010Q3. For
corporate borrowers, borrowing conditions eased for the fifth consecutive quarter thanks to a
better outlook for these firms and the economy, as well as growing competition among
lenders. However, small business lending conditions were unchanged, following a modest
easing in the second quarter.

4

The authorities maintain a freely-floating exchange rate regime. The exchange regime is free of exchange
restrictions and multiple currency practices.

5

The modest ERER misalignment signals a deviation of the actual real exchange rate from the model’s
estimated real exchange rate equilibrium given the relative weakness of underlying fundamentals (strong terms
of trade and reduced external liabilities but weak relative productivity growth). The projected CA balance is
weaker than both the current account norm and the NFA-stabilizing current account balance, implying a
moderate macro-balance and a small external-sustainability misalignment.

7
B. The Outlook: Elevated Domestic and External Risks
12.
The staff’s outlook is for a continued gradual recovery (Figure 3). Staff projects
GDP growth to rebound from -2½ percent in 2009 to 3 percent in 2010, then to slow to
around 2⅓ in 2011 (broadly in line with the Bank of Canada’s projection and the consensus).
GDP would be driven by the second year of fiscal stimulus in 2010, (staff estimates that the
stimulus will add 1 percentage point to growth in 2010)6 and by business investment growth
on the back of accommodative credit conditions, while net exports would remain a source of
restraint reflecting buoyant imports along with soft exports. While consumption momentum
will likely fade significantly in the second half of 2010 and into 2011 as household debt has
run up to high levels and housing markets are cooling, prospects for continued respectable
job growth and the positive outlook for commodity prices will soften the adjustment; staff’s
analysis suggests that the positive impact on domestic demand from rising commodity prices
is only partially mitigated by an appreciating Canadian dollar, with larger effects on domestic
demand observed in the resource-rich western provinces (Figure 4). Stronger growth in the
United States and continued momentum in consumption spending in Canada would lift
growth in 2012. Inflation is expected to remain contained throughout the projection period
thanks to a slowly-closing output gap.

severely by the economic downturn, particularly in light of the stresses on the auto sector.
Moving forward, the outlook for western provinces appears favorable given the ongoing
strength of commodity prices, while Ontario’s outlook would be more closely linked to U.S.
economic developments given the high reliance on U.S. exports.
6

In 2010–11, the Economic Action Plan is on track to deliver a further CAD22 billion in federal stimulus
spending, complemented by CAD 7 billion in stimulus funding from provinces, territories, municipalities and
other partners. Funding for the Action Plan in 2010–11 is 98 per cent committed. (In its first year of
implementation, the Economic Action Plan has delivered over CAD 33 billion in stimulus to the economy).

8
14.
Potential growth would recover gradually to around 2 percent (see Chapter 3 of
the Selected Issue Paper). Staff estimates that the crisis shaved 2 percentage points from the
trend level of Canada’s GDP, owing to the sharp decline in investment in 2009. The upward
trend in potential growth over the medium term largely reflects the expected recovery in
investment spending. Staff’s estimates imply an output gap of about 2 ½ percent at 2010Q3,
which would close in 2015.

15.
Staff sees risks to real GDP growth as tilted to the downside. Stretched household
balance sheets are the main domestic risk although the Canadian debt imbalance is currently
not as great as that experienced in the U.S. (expressed on a comparable basis, the debt to
income ratio stands at 143.6 in Canada and 148.6 in the United States). Housing markets
pose some risks as well, as price-to-income and price-to-rent ratios are at the highest level in
over 30 years, while model-based estimates suggest a moderate overvaluation in some key
provinces (Figure 3). However, the markets are now cooling, and overheating seems to have
mainly been a regional phenomenon (see Box 1). Under the staff’s baseline, housing activity
will moderate in the second half of 2010 and early 2011, taking into account pent-up
demand, the moderate overvaluation in some provinces, and the effects of rising mortgage
rates (which remain low by historical standards). However, a stronger than expected
correction in the housing market could have sizeable spillovers to the rest of the economy.7
Risks to other components of private domestic demand are balanced.

7

A 10-percent house price correction would deduct CAD148.2 billion from household balance sheets-non trivial taking into account a marginal propensity to consume of around 6 percent (Pichette, L., 2004, “Are
Wealth Effects Important for Canada?” Bank of Canada Review): the crisis had initially deducted CAD
24.6 billion in aggregate households’ residential wealth, and since the trough in 2009Q1 real estate household
wealth increased by around CAD 90 billion. In the event that residential investment grew at half the rate
projected in the staff’s baseline scenario in the second half of 2010, this would deduct some 0.2 percentage
points from 2010 average growth rate.

9
16.
A weaker U.S. outlook and worsening global financial conditions (if overseas
sovereign strains intensified) pose the largest downside external risks. With the United
States accounting for three-fourths of Canadian exports, a further worsening in the U.S.
outlook could have major implications for Canada’s growth (staff estimates that a
1 percentage point drop in U.S. growth reduces Canada’s growth by ½ to ¾ of 1 percentage
point). Sovereign debt strains limited to a few European countries would have limited output,
trade and financial effects on Canada, though output losses could be more serious in a worst
case scenario (see Box 4). On the upside, unexpectedly stronger momentum in the emerging
market world, notably Asia, would exert positive but modest effects on Canada as increases
in commodity prices that raise terms of trade and domestic demand are partially offset by a
stronger currency (see Chapter 2 of the Selected Issues Paper).
17.
Specific U.S.-related risks include subdued U.S. auto demand and financial
contagion from non-performing assets. The outlook for U.S. construction and consumer
durables—both key to Canadian exports

i.e., 4 percent of total employment; see Chapter 4 of the Selected Issue Paper). In addition,
anemic growth performance in the United States, coupled with persistently high U.S.
delinquency ratios for mortgage and consumer loans, could also have implications for some
Canadian banks with large exposure in the U.S. retail and commercial real estate sectors.
18.
In addition, Canada’s economic performance has important spillovers for small
countries in the Western Hemisphere.8 Canada is one of the world’s main recipients of
immigrants—accounting for almost one fifth of its population. Weak activity in Canada can
thus significantly affect remittances to other countries.9 It can also affect adversely the

Government data shows that in 2008 about 4 in 10 Canadians wired money back home to family and/or
friends. The majority of these funds are going to the Philippines and Haiti. Pre-crisis, Haiti’s flow of
remittances was approximately 25 percent of its GDP, whereas the Philippines received an amount of
remittances equivalent to 13 percent of their GDP.

of arrivals in the Caribbean so far in 2010. Finally, strains in Canada’s banking system could
have important repercussions abroad as a result of the strong presence of Canadian banks in
the Caribbean and Latin America, and that of Canadian insurance companies in North
America (two Canadian banks are the first and second largest in the Caribbean).

II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Discussions focused on measures to cement Canada’s strong macroeconomic and financial
policies, and to deal with the deteriorated risk scenario. The pause in the reduction of
monetary stimulus is appropriate given the risks to the outlook. On the fiscal front, the nearterm adjustment is substantially frontloaded, while the authorities’ sensible plan to return to
balance over the medium term relies inter alia on significant restraint of program spending.
Sound regulation and supervision helped maintain financial stability during the crisis, and
Canada is playing an important role in shaping the international debate and initiatives on
regulatory reform—which in turn will have important implications for Canada.
19.
Against the backdrop of heightened risks to the outlook, discussions focused on
three areas:

Pacing the exit from extraordinary monetary and fiscal stimulus, to strike the right
balance between Canada’s relatively advanced cyclical position (and the risk of rising
domestic imbalances) and hedging downside risks to the outlook;

11

Cementing fiscal stabilization, to put Canada’s net debt-to-GDP ratio (already low by
international perspective) on a declining path over the medium term, to both bolster fiscal
prudence and prepare for coming demographic pressures; and


Adapting financial regulation in light of the lessons from the crisis, with the key
objective to strengthen securities regulation through further progress toward the creation of a
national regulator.
20.
The authorities and mission team broadly agreed on the priorities. On the exit, it
was agreed that the pause in the pace of monetary tightening struck the right balance. Fiscal
policy is appropriately set to shift from expansion to consolidation next year, albeit with a
front-loaded adjustment, while both monetary and fiscal policy have room to respond to
downside risks if they materialize. Monetary policy should be the first line of defense if the
outlook deteriorates, given the room to ease quickly, although fiscal policy has room to
respond as well in a downside scenario. On financial sector regulatory reforms, staff and the
authorities concurred that Canada is well positioned to adapt to emergent international
initiatives and is appropriately focused on strengthening financial system infrastructure and
institutions, including through the creation of a single national securities regulator.
A. What is the Right Pace of Exit From Extraordinary Stimulus?
Monetary Policy—A Pause in Tightening
21.
Staff saw as appropriate the cautious pace of return to a neutral stance. At its
policy meeting during the mission, the Bank of Canada decided to maintain its target for the
overnight rate at 1 per cent. Staff considered that the weakening global recovery, the
deceleration in Canadian household spending coupled with the elevated household debt
(including taking into account that variable and adjustable rate mortgages are about
30 percent of the total),10 and softening inflation warranted this pause in tightening. Bank
officials noted that deflationary risks were quite low, and inflation expectations well
anchored, and that any further reduction in monetary policy stimulus would need to be
carefully considered. Meanwhile, they added, the stance of monetary policy remained
appropriately accommodative, although room existed for further monetary stimulus if the
outlook deteriorated.
22.
Uncertainties about the neutral level of the policy rate in the near term, along
with a globally accommodative monetary environment, further argued for caution in
tightening. Uncertainties about the rate of potential growth going forward could point to a
lower neutral rate. Moreover, persistent interest differentials between Canada and world

Mortgage Market in Canada.

12
markets could attract capital inflows and put additional upward pressure on the currency, a
particular concern in an environment of sustained global monetary accommodation.
23.
At the same time, domestic financial imbalances warranted close monitoring
given the still-accommodative monetary stance. Staff supported the Bank’s vigilance
regarding developments in the housing market and the use of regulation, rather than
monetary policy, as a first line of defense against financial imbalances. In line with staff, the
authorities saw regional evidence that house prices were on the dear side, but emphasized
uncertainties about estimates of house price misalignment in the wake of the crisis. Bank
officials stressed that they will continue to monitor carefully developments in the housing
market and household balance sheets.11 In addition, they were reflecting on lessons from the
crisis for the conduct of monetary policy in light of macro-financial linkages, including the
relevant transmission channels, and refining their models and analysis to ensure that due
weight was put on financial developments in formulating policy decisions.12
24.
The mission also discussed the monetary framework, noting that the current
framework serves Canada well, whereas the practical benefits of a more strict regime
are uncertain. The discussions centered on the 2011 statutory review of the Bank’s
framework involving three questions: whether the inflation target should be lowered; whether
to adopt Price-Level-Path Targeting (PLPT); and the weight given to financial stability. Bank
officials and staff agreed that price-level targeting offered a number of theoretical benefits
relative to inflation targeting, especially in a low inflation environment like the current one.
In particular, PLPT could combat disinflationary pressures by committing to offset any
temporary undershooting of the desired inflation rate. However, the mission and the
authorities agreed that given the lack of experience with PLPT, the benefits in practice were
less clear, particularly in light of the potential challenges in communicating the objectives
and direction of policy over the medium run. While these challenges would be lessened if
policy targeted a stable price level, this could require sizeable volatility in both the policy
rate and inflation, and eventually in output. On balance, the mission and the authorities
agreed that the current inflation targeting framework had served Canada well, while the gains
from shifting to a new framework were unclear. The authorities noted that they would
continue to research the pros and cons of PLPT in the run up to the 2011 review, with any
revisions to the framework becoming operational in 2012.

11

In the December 2009 Financial System Review (FSR), the Bank of Canada conducted a stress-test
simulation to assess a scenario of sustained growth in household indebtedness in relation to income and an
environment of rising interest rates over the medium term. Results indicated that system-wide stress remains
unlikely, although the likelihood of this risk materializing in the medium term was judged to have risen in the
June FSR as a result of higher levels of household indebtedness.

October 5, 2010.

Fiscal Policy—From Stimulus to Consolidation
25.
The mission praised the fiscal response to the crisis during 2009-10 and
supported the authorities’ medium-term plans under the budget. Staff noted that the
March 2010 Budget was appropriately focused on balancing the budget over the medium
term (Box 2). It also followed through on the second year of Canada’s Economic Action Plan
as anticipated, building on the 2009 stimulus and earlier permanent tax relief. The 2010
stimulus package—which the authorities confirmed was on track and 98 percent committed
by end September—included for FY 2010–11 a sizeable dose of infrastructure capital
investments, tax relief, employment insurance (EI) and training measures, along with
industry specific measures and support for research and development.
26.
Consolidation plans under the budget for FY 2010–11/FY 2014–15 remained
largely unchanged following the Update of Economic and Fiscal Projections released
during the mission, although the pending withdrawal is now less frontloaded. The
profile includes a slightly smaller deficit in FY 2010–11 (by 0.1 percent), but marginally
worse deficits in outer years (by around 0.35 percentage points of GDP from FY 2011–12
through FY 2013–14), due to a combination of upward revisions to near-term revenues since
March, recent changes to Employment Insurance (EI) program funding, downward revisions
to real GDP growth in 2010 and 2011 from a worsened global scenario, and accounting
adjustments13 that pushed up slightly the fiscal deficit for 2009–10. In structural terms,
however, the accounting adjustments largely contribute to a bigger fiscal withdrawal in 2010
but a slightly smaller withdrawal in 2011 than anticipated in the March Budget both at the
federal and general government levels. The authorities now expect to balance the budget by
FY 2015–16 with a slight surplus (0.1 percent of GDP).

13

These include CAD 5.9 billion in HST transition payments (CAD 4.3 billion to Ontario and CAD 1.6 billion
to BC) originally allocated to FY 2010–11 and FY 2011–12 that in the Update were brought forward to FY
2009–10 relative to the March Budget, as well as adjustments for an over-accrual of employee pension costs
affecting the bottom line in FY 2009–10 and following years.

27.
The mission noted that the budget entailed a substantially front-loaded
adjustment:14


Staff estimated the fiscal down payment for FY 2011–12 at about ¾ percentage point
of GDP at the federal level, and at about ⅓ of a percentage point of GDP per year in
subsequent years up to FY 2014–15.15 On a calendar year basis, the change in the
structural balance, at a general government level, amounted to 1.1 percentage points
of GDP in 2011, compared to an overall adjustment of 2 percentage points of GDP
through 2015. In light of the heightened risks to the outlook, the mission considered
that a smoother adjustment could have been contemplated. That said, the
government’s recent steps to delay hikes in the EI premium until after 2011 and allow
flexibility in funding ongoing infrastructure projects moved in the direction of
smoothing the up-front adjustment.

14

Significant policy developments occurred after this Staff Report had been issued to the Board, which are
discussed in the attached Staff Supplement.

15

The “fiscal down payment” or “fiscal impulse” is the change in the “fiscal stance” and is roughly equal to the
change in the cyclically adjusted fiscal balance (in percent of GDP).

15
28.
It was agreed that fiscal policy had room to respond should downside risks
materialize. The mission noted that this could involve a front-loading of infrastructure
spending planned under Building Canada (scheduled to imply outlays equal to about
⅓ percent of GDP per year for FY 2010–11 up to FY 2013–14) or bringing forward
corporate income tax (CIT) cuts planned over the next 2 years (staff estimates that a
½ percentage point decrease in the CIT rate reduces revenues by roughly 0.1 percent of
GDP). The authorities noted that they would revisit their plans if the outlook deteriorated to
an extent that warranted a fiscal response.
B. Cementing Fiscal Stabilization
29.
From an international point of view, Canada’s overall fiscal outlook in the
aftermath of the crisis stands out as among the best in the G-20 (Figure 5). Net debt is the
lowest in the G-7, reflecting an 11-year string of federal surpluses prior to the crisis. In
addition, Canada’s combined federal-provincial budget shortfall16 and Canada’s projected net
debt accumulation between 2007 and 2015 are among the lowest of the group, and the
projected general government budgetary position for 2015 is the best in the G-7 after
Germany.

30.
The mission supported the authorities’ aim to return to balance over the
medium term, given the impending long-term costs of aging and healthcare costs. Staff
saw the plan as credible, in light of Canada’s strong track record and modest imbalances,
notwithstanding the effects of the crisis and large stimulus. The plan centered on a bold
reduction of non-transfer government payments while protecting major transfers to persons
and other levels of government. In line with the authorities’ overall strategy, the budget
envisages no hikes in taxes on consumption or personal or corporate income. Indeed, plans

16
for spending restraint were ambitious, implying zero real future program spending growth to
return that spending to its historically low pre-crisis ratio to GDP.17 In the event this
adjustment proved difficult to implement, other steps would need to be considered, including
steps to restrain growth in transfers to provinces or to enhance revenues including increases
in taxes. Staff added that downward revisions to public debt charges in the Update relative to
assumptions in the March Budget were subject to the risk that interest rates in Canada could
trend upwards in the medium run on the back of higher U.S. yields from higher U.S. debt.18
31.
The mission noted the significant risks to long-term fiscal sustainability from the
budgetary impact of population ageing and health-care inflation.19 The mission stressed
the importance of increasing transparency and communication about these challenges and
their long-run implications, to increase public awareness and contribute to a debate about
possible solutions. Given that responsibility for implementation lay with the provinces (with
the federal government covering around 20 percent of total program expenses via the Canada
Health Transfer, which accounts for about 17 percent of all provincial and territorial
revenues), one option would be to develop arrangements for provinces to share experiences
in managing costs and reaping efficiency gains (some provinces, notably Ontario and
Québec, had already moved to contain costs). This option could be taken up in the context of
renewing federal transfers to provinces and territories in support of health care (current
arrangements expire on April 1, 2014).
32.
The mission welcomed the “growth-friendly” nature of the adjustment plans,
which included measures to boost productivity and long-run growth potential (Table 2).
In line with Canada’s commitments under G20 MAP to promote strong, sustainable and
balanced world growth, Budget 2010 introduced a number of targeted actions that will
provide additional support to economic potential and boost productivity growth that has been
in structural decline. The intention to continue reducing marginal effective tax rates on
capital accumulation and further strengthen infrastructure were particularly welcome. The
mission also welcomed the authorities’ intention to eliminate all remaining tariffs on

17

At the federal level, total program spending growth under the Update is expected to average 2.3 percent per
annum starting in FY 2012–13, which is well below the recent trend rate of about 7 percent per year, bringing
the program spending ratio in line with spending ratios in the FY 2006–07 to FY 2008–09 period.

18

Budget 2010 estimates that a sustained increase in the yield curve by 100 basis points decreases the budgetary
balance by CAD 1 billion in the first year, CAD 2.1 billion in the second year and CAD 3.0 billion by the fifth
year (implying a cumulative total impact on the federal balance of about -0.3 percentage points of GDP).

19

Using a relatively conservative assumption for gross public debt charges (based in turn on a gross effective
interest rate around 7 percent from FY 2013–14 onwards), the Parliamentary Budget Officer estimates a steep
climb in the federal net-to-GDP ratio over the long term due to healthcare inflation and ageing. Specifically,
under the baseline scenario the federal net debt-to-GDP ratio climbs from about 33¾ percent in FY2013–14 to a
projected 100 percent of GDP in 2050–51, reaching 365 percent of GDP by FY 2084–85. Lower debt charges
assumptions (based for example on a gross effective interest rate of around 5 percent from FY 2013–14
onwards) halve the projected debt-to-GDP ratio by the end of the horizon, although this remains sizeable.

17
manufacturing inputs and machinery and equipment, which was noteworthy in light of
heightened risks of protectionism internationally. Other priorities to boost growth potential
could include strengthening the business environment by phasing out restrictions on foreign
direct investment, increasing the flexibility of the immigration system, and continuing to
eliminate interprovincial barriers to trade in goods and labor mobility.
33.
The mission also welcomed the return to prudent budgets charted at the
provincial level, with the intention to stay the course on announced stimulus in the near
term. The crisis brought about an overall deterioration of provincial fiscal positions but with
significant underlying variations. Provinces east of Manitoba saw their deficits and debt
increase substantially, and within these, Ontario (hit particularly hard by the U.S. recession)
has the largest deficit. Meanwhile, Quebéc and Nova Scotia have smaller deficits but higher
debts. Western provinces enjoy lower debt burdens, and savings from resource royalties
helped to cap the deterioration in their budget balances during the crisis. Faced by an
escalation of health spending costs—which in Canada fall largely on provincial finances—
most provinces schedule a gradual reduction of the fiscal shortfall, based on caps on spending
growth by freezing salaries and curbing health care expenditure (e.g., through measures that
facilitate lower generic drug prices, increase the efficiency of the health care system and
establish accountability systems for hospitals). Provinces also envision measures to increase
revenues, notably via hikes in indirect taxes, excises and utilities rates (see Box 2).

C. Adapting Financial Regulation to the Lessons of the Crisis
34.
The mission noted that Canada’s financial stability arrangements had served the
country well through the crisis. These arrangements included strong regulation, including a
prudent leverage ratio that included off-balance-sheet exposures; low reliance on wholesale
funding (reflecting a robust retail deposit base); a well regulated mortgage market, including
incentives to maintain low loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, and comprehensive mortgage
insurance coverage (most securitized loans and those with LTVs above 80 percent made by
regulated depository institutions (75 percent prior to April 2007 must be insured for the full
amount, but typically, lower LTV loans are also insured given the lower risk weight under
the Basel framework for insured mortgages); and consolidated supervision of wholesale and
retail banking activities (see Chapter 5 of the Selected Issues Paper). In addition, cooperation
among the relevant authorities, including the Office of the Superintendent of Financial
Institutions, the Bank of Canada, the Department of Finance, the Financial Consumer
Agency of Canada, and the Canadian Deposit Insurance Corporation was facilitated via
participation in forums such as the Financial Institutions Supervisory Committee and Senior
Advisory Group, with regular exchanges of information and views on financial stability
issues.

Nevertheless, the authorities and mission agreed that there was no room for
complacency. Key risks included elevated household debt, a potential housing market
correction, and international exposures, with staff emphasizing the importance of continuing
to stress-test financial institutions for these risks:


The low level of interest rates had helped to contain debt-service ratios, but debt
service would rise as interest rates returned to more normal levels. The authorities
saw exposure to rising interest rates as significant, and as having increased in the first
half of the year, but still manageable, with the Bank pointing to its recent stress tests
for this risk. Similarly, banks faced significant interest rate risk on their trading
books, but overall interest-rate risks that were around pre-crisis levels.20, 21



Officials also agreed that housing markets warranted monitoring, although the risk of
systemic stress was seen as moderate, given that about two thirds of all mortgages
were insured, and origination followed prudent practices. However, in a worst case
scenario, a housing correction could impose fiscal pressures given CMHC’s
contingent liabilities to the housing market.22



Banks also had significant exposures to U.S. markets (118 CAD billion as of March
2010 according to the BIS), which would come under pressure in the event of a
double-dip recession. The authorities reported that their stress tests implied a modest
impact from a simulation of a post-Lehman type recession.



On exposures to Europe, the consequences of the sovereign stress had so far been
minimal for Canadian banks, and Canadian banks and investors did not appear to hold
significant amounts of debt issued by the most stressed countries. The direct exposure
of Canadian banks to smaller European economies is modest (see Box 4). That said, a
contagion scenario could pose larger risks.

Bank of Canada scenario analysis suggests that by 2012Q2, the proportion of households with a debt service
ratio exceeding 40 percent—a threshold above which households are considered to be financially vulnerable—
would rise from 5 percent in 2010Q1 to 7.4 percent, assuming that the overnight rate rose to 4.5 by 2012Q2 and
credit grew at its current robust rates.

CMHC insurance in force amounted to CAD$473 billion at year-end 2009, with CAD$1.3 billion set aside
for expected claims and related settlement expenses, and CAD$6.7 billion in unearned premiums and fees
covering potential future claims. At year-end 2007, CMHC’s insurance in force was CAD$334 billion with
CAD$552 million set aside for expected claims, and CAD$5.1 billion in unearned premiums and fees covering
potential future claims.

The authorities saw Canada as well positioned to adapt to emerging regulatory
changes on the international front. They supported the development of stronger
international capital and liquidity standards, pointing to the Bank’s analysis that found
substantial net benefits from measures under consideration by the Basel Committee,23 and did
not anticipate adverse effects on credit extension or liquidity conditions. Authorities noted
that care is required in implementing G-20 commitments stated at the Pittsburgh Summit that
all standardized OTC derivative contracts should be traded on exchanges or electronic
trading platforms, where appropriate, and cleared through central counterparties by end2012, to avoid unintended consequences for smaller jurisdictions (in particular to ensure that
these jurisdictions can access the central counterparties). They also did not favor the
application of a global financial sector levy, on the basis of economic efficiency reasons and
of the absence of noticeable fiscal costs imposed on Canada by its financial institutions
during the crisis. Authorities saw the use of countercyclical capital buffers and contingent
capital, rather than capital surcharges, as the optimal approach to deal with systemic risks,
stressing concerns about the moral hazard that could be associated with identifying particular
institutions as too big to fail. The authorities also put due emphasis on improving crossborder resolution, and are actively involved in international committees on this front. Staff
agreed that emergent regulatory standards did not pose high hurdles for the Canadian
financial system, which came from a position of strength, including high regulatory
requirements.24
37.
The mission saw continued progress toward establishing a national securities
regulator as an essential ingredient in the financial stability framework. A key lesson
from the crisis was the importance of strong securities markets regulation, integrated into an
overall perspective on financial stability. The experience with the non-bank asset backed
commercial paper market in Canada, which collapsed amid concerns about the quality of
underlying collateral, underscored this point. Authorities confirmed that the move to a
national securities regulator was on track, with the Transition Office working swiftly with the
participation of 10 provinces and territories toward the mid-2012 deadline for launch. The
authorities remained confident that they could make continued progress on this front, and
agreed that the national regulator should have a stability mandate and work closely with other
relevant national authorities on financial stability issues.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
38.
Thanks to a strong policy response and a resilient financial system, the Canadian
economy exited the crisis on a strong footing. Output recovered forcefully at end-2009 and

Private analysts estimate that the major Canadian banks will have enough capital to meet the new Basel III
rules in their entirety by 2012 (even though they will not be fully applied until 2019).

21
early 2010, following the extraordinary monetary and fiscal stimuli—with policy rates cut to
virtually zero, emergency liquidity facilities launched, and a set of timely, targeted and
temporary fiscal injections implemented by the federal and provincial governments. The
recovery has also been aided by firm commodity prices and the resilience of the financial
system. More generally, Canada’s strong performance owed to a credible and time-tested
framework for macroeconomic policy management, including the Bank’s inflation targeting
regime, and prudent fiscal planning.
39.
Incoming data reveal that the pace of the expansion has slowed over recent
months. The recovery decelerated in the second quarter of 2010, in the context of slowing
global demand and a strengthening Canadian dollar. Household spending growth has also
eased, as the effect of the policy stimulus diminished, while the housing market has cooled.
In addition, risks to the outlook have increased, including from increasingly stretched
household balance sheets in Canada, and elevated housing market fragilities in the United
States.
40.
Monetary policy should remain highly accommodative absent inflationary
pressures. A pause in the Bank’s interest rate hike until the global and domestic outlook
improve significantly will continue to support growth against the backdrop of fiscal
withdrawal, and avoid undue upward pressure on the currency given the globally
accommodative monetary environment. With rates now above zero, monetary policy has
room to respond if conditions warrant. Regulation should continue to serve as the first line of
defense for dealing with emergent financial imbalances.
41.
On fiscal stabilization, the government appropriately charts a course to fiscal
balance over the medium term. This would put net debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward
trajectory from already low levels, maintaining Canada’s standing as the strongest fiscal
position in the G-7. The plan includes welcome, growth-friendly measures to support
Canada’s long-run economic potential, notably infrastructure spending and cuts in the
corporate income tax rate. For the longer-run, and as in many advanced countries, restraint in
health care spending will be an essential ingredient in fiscal stability.
42.
The medium-term consolidation plans are appropriately ambitious, and include
growth-friendly measures. In the event that freezing program spending in inflation-adjusted
terms proves difficult, other steps would need to be considered, such as steps to restrain
program spending (notably transfers to provinces) or enhance revenues. Meanwhile,
continued public infrastructure spending will strengthen the backbone of Canada’s economy,
while ongoing steps to further reduce the marginal effective tax rate on capital formation will
encourage private investment. In this context, Canada’s intention to eliminate all remaining
tariffs on manufacturing inputs and machinery and equipment is noteworthy, and shows
leadership at a time of heightened risks of protectionism internationally. Complementary
structural reforms could include further steps to reduce interprovincial barriers, as well as
stepped-up efforts to liberalize FDI.

22
43.
For the longer-run, restraint in health care spending will be an essential
ingredient in fiscal stability. Like many advanced countries, Canada faces the twin long-run
fiscal challenges of population ageing and health-care inflation. Left unchecked, growth in
health-care spending would put increasing and unsustainable pressure on the fiscal positions
of Canada’s governments. Increasing transparency and communication about these
challenges and their long-run implications would help to increase public awareness and
contribute to the debate about possible solutions. Options could include developing
arrangements for provinces to share experiences in managing costs and reaping efficiency
gains when renewing federal transfers to provinces and territories in support of health care.
44.
However, the near-term budgeted adjustment is substantially front-loaded, and
a smoother adjustment could have been contemplated in light of the elevated risks to
the outlook.25 Recent proposals to reduce the rise in EI premia and allow some flexibility
around the deadlines for unfinished infrastructure projects appropriately move in the
direction of smoothing. If downside risks materialize, fiscal policy has ample room to
respond, including through providing additional fiscal support for labor markets, bringing
forward infrastructure spending under the Building Canada program, and frontloading
planned cuts in corporate income taxes.
45.
Canada’s financial stability arrangements continue to serve it well. Unlike a
number of its peers, Canada’s financial system maintained the ability to intermediate funds
during the crisis, and avoided the systemic strains evident elsewhere. While measures of
financial stress such as arrears and nonperforming loans have risen, they remain at modest
levels, and capitalization is strong by international comparison. This good performance
reflects a sound approach to financial stability, with strong cooperation among the relevant
agencies, high prudential standards, strict supervision, and a proactive policy response to the
crisis. Looking ahead, the authorities are rightly alert to potential risks surrounding elevated
household debt in Canada and financial institutions’ exposures to the U.S. economy;
continued stress-testing for downside risk scenarios is desirable. They have also rightly
responded to emerging risks in the housing market by tightening mortgage standards in 2008
and earlier this year.
46.
Canada is well positioned to update its financial regulatory framework in line
with emerging international initiatives. The transition to the Basel III framework of higher
capital and liquidity standards should be smooth, given the already high requirements and the
sound balance-sheet positions of the banks. Indeed, the factors underlying Canada’s
resilience to financial strains that emerged during the crisis—including a well-regulated
mortgage market, limited reliance on wholesale funding, consolidated supervision of

discussed in the attached Staff Supplement.

23
commercial and investment banking activities, a conservative leverage ratio, and close
cooperation among entities responsible for financial stability—have been key inputs in the
international debate on financial regulatory reform. Going forward, Canada’s emphasis is
appropriately on strengthening the infrastructure for OTC derivatives markets, improving the
resolution mechanism via contingent capital, and calibrating macroprudential tools, such as
countercyclical capital buffers.
47.
The initiative toward national securities regulation is another essential part of
this framework. In this connection, the steady progress toward this goal is welcome. The
creation of a national securities regulator will both bridge potential gaps in the supervision
and regulation of what are essentially national markets, and create a venue for bringing
securities regulation into the ambit of national coordinating initiatives for promoting
financial stability.
48.

It is recommended that the next consultation occur on the usual 12-month cycle.

Tax Advantage

Reducing taxes for all Canadians and
establishing the lowest overall tax rate
on new business investment in the G7.

Implementation Status
Tax relief for individuals, families, and
businesses totaling about $220 billion over
2008/09 and the following five fiscal years.
Measures already undertaken include:
a) A new Tax-Free Savings Account that
allows Canadians to invest up to $5,000 a
year in eligible investments.
b) Implementation of a Working Income Tax
Benefit (WITB) to make work more
rewarding for low-and-modest income
Canadians.
c) Significant broad-based tax relief that
improves the rewards from work, and
targeted measures that improve the fairness
of the tax system for families, seniors and
pensioners, persons with disabilities, and
students.
In 2010 Canada has the lowest overall tax rate
on new business investment (METR) in the G-7,
following the elimination of general capital taxes
and reductions in corporate income tax rates; it
is legislated that the federal general corporate
income tax rate would decline from more than
22 percent in 2007 to 15 percent in 2015.

Box 1. How Vulnerable is Canada’s Housing Market?
The residential real estate cycle may have reached its long-predicted peak in Canada. Sales volumes
fell as summer moved in while the pace of price increases moderated. The surge in late 2009 and early
2010, following the decline through 2008, appears to have been due to buyers rushing to beat deadlines
before stricter mortgage rules and additional sales taxes were implemented. Indeed, in 2010 Q2,
residential investment (+1.3 percent) basically stalled as a drop off in renovation activity offset a sharp
30 percent gain in new homebuilding. The decline in renovation activity was largely expected, and likely
related to the expiration of the Federal Home Renovation tax credit.
Going forward, several factors may indicate further downward pressure on house prices. First,
price-to-income and price-to-rent ratios remain 1 standard deviation above historical averages. Second,
staff’s model-based estimates from the Early Warning Exercise (EWE) and Vulnerability Exercise for
Advanced Countries (VEA) suggest an overvaluation around 13 percent, exceeding the 10 percent
threshold. (The EWE real estate model combines these three indicators to create a heat map for house
price valuation.) Moreover, the predicted

income projections suggest a decline of
almost 6 percent through 2015.

These indicators put Canada among
the advanced countries where a house
price correction is most likely to take
place. Yet, the point estimate for the
house price disequilibrium (the
difference between actual prices and
estimated equilibrium or long-run prices)
is not large by historical standards, and
Canada ranks only 7th among 22
advanced economies in the VEA sample
in terms of potential overvaluation.
Furthermore, other components of
residential real estate vulnerability
(namely, potential impact on GDP,
household balance sheets, and mortgage
market characteristics) remain moderate
or low in Canada, compared to other
advanced economies. That said, with
most mortgages being “rollover”
mortgages with terms of at most five
years, any future interest rate increases
could put additional strains on already
highly indebted households.1

Box 2. Federal and Provincial Budget 2010’s Plans for Deficit Elimination
Canada plans a return to balance over the medium term. With a deficit estimated at
CAD 53.8 billion in 2009-10 and the economy starting to recover from the recession, the federal
government has laid out a detailed plan to return to a virtually zero deficit in FY 2014–15.
Canada’s new budget plan reaffirms the authorities’ pledge in the G-20 context in June on the
need to halve budget deficits by 2013 and stabilize debt-to-GDP ratios by 2016. As a result of
measures in Budget 2010, the government projects that the deficit will decline by almost half over the
next two years to CAD 27.6 billion in FY 2011–12, and by two-thirds to CAD 17.5 billion in FY
2012–13. In 2014–15, the deficit is projected to be CAD 1.8 billion. The debt-to-GDP ratio is
expected to peak at 35.4 percent in FY 2010–11 and then fall to 31.9 percent by FY 2014–15.
Program spending as a share of GDP is expected to decline from 15.6 percent in FY 2009–10 to
13.2 percent in FY 2014–15.
The plan rules out increases in corporate, personal, income, or consumption taxes while
allowing built-in automatic hikes in EI premiums. It also envisages a protection of major transfers
to persons and other governments (i.e., CST, CHT, and equalization transfers), relying instead in
significant part on a series of expenditure compression measures, namely:


Letting temporary fiscal stimulus measures elapse after fiscal 2010–11.



Implementing targeted measures (worth about CAD 18 billion over 5 years) to constrain
spending growth, in particular (i) restraining national defence spending; (ii) capping
international assistance at CAD 5 billion from next year onwards; (iii) containing public
administration costs by freezing operational budgets; and (iv) implementing strategic program
reviews.

Provincial governments’ 2010 budgets also plan a return to balance in the medium term,
although at different paces. In general, the size of the deficit faced by a jurisdiction informed the
pace of consolidation, with Ontario at the high end (8 years), followed by Manitoba and
Saskatchewan opting for timetables of 5 years.
At the provincial level, deficit reduction strategies vary. While all provinces but Alberta and
Saskatchewan will postpone program and capital spending restraint until post-2010 to aid recovery,
all governments have committed to: (i) keeping program expenditure growth near or below 2 percent
while protecting core services (health and education); (ii) flat-lining or outright cutting departments’
operational budgets and non-core program spending; and (iii) curtailing civil service (i.e.,
compensation, headcount / attrition). From the revenue side, main provincial deficit reduction
measures include: (iv) increasing value-added consumption taxes (Nova Scotia, Quebec); (v) raising
fuel, tobacco, or liquor taxes (Quebec, Manitoba, Saskatchewan); (vi) raising user fees (water, tuition)
and health premium (Quebec); (vii) deferring previously announced tax relief (Manitoba,
Saskatchewan); (viii) raising personal income taxes for higher earners (Nova Scotia).

Box 3. Canada’s Financial System Resilience: What Can Others Learn?
Canada’s financial system displayed remarkable stability during the global turbulence. The system has avoided
systemic pressures: no financial institution failed or required public capital injections (banks raised capital in markets,
albeit at elevated cost owing to higher global risk aversion).
Key factors behind this relatively strong performance
included:
Sound supervision and regulation: The 2008
FSSA Update found that the regulatory and supervisory
framework meets best practice in many dimensions,
including with regard to the revised Basel Core
Principles for banking supervision.

total (Tier 1 and 2) capital, versus Tier 1 capital in the
U.S. Canada also includes some off-balance sheet exposures in its definition of assets (such as include credit
derivatives, financial standby letters of credit, guarantees, and surety arrangements), whereas the U.S. leverage
calculation does not.
Low risk tolerance and conservative balance sheet structures: Banks have a profitable and stable domestic
retail market, and (like their customers) exhibit low risk tolerance. Banks had smaller exposures to “toxic” structured
assets and relied less on volatile wholesale funding than many international peers.
Proactive response to financial strains: The authorities quickly reacted to the crisis by expanding liquidity
facilities, providing liability guarantees, and purchasing mortgage-backed securities (all of those facilities have now
expired) and other credit support to specific markets. In addition, the resolution framework was reformed providing
authority for public capital injections and other transactions to support financial stability. More recently, the
authorities had again acted proactively by restricting mortgage rules for government insured mortgages to help
prevent a housing bubble.
Effective coordination between supervisory agencies: Officials meet regularly in the context of the Financial
Institutions Supervisory Committee (FISC) and other fora to discuss issues and exchange information on financial
stability matters.1
Regulation reviews: To keep pace with financial innovation, federal authorities review financial sector
legislation every five years—next review to be completed in 2012 (Ontario has a similar process for securities market
legislation).
Conservative residential mortgage markets: Only 5 percent of mortgages are nonprime and only 25 percent
are securitized (compared with 25 percent and 60 percent, respectively, in the U.S.); all of which are effectively
unconditionally government guaranteed. About two-thirds of residential loans are guaranteed, since almost all loans
that are securitized, plus those with a loan-to-value ratio (LTV) above 80 percent held by regulated depository
institutions must be insured for the full loan amount (rather than the portion above the 80 percent LTV, as in the
U.S.). Also mortgage interest is nondeductible, encouraging borrowers to repay quickly, and mortgages are recourse.

Box 4. Should Canada Be Concerned of Adverse Inward Spillovers from Europe?
So far Europe’s sovereign debt turmoil had modest financial and trade effects on Canada. While
Canada’s stock and credit market volatility increased as the crisis erupted in early 2010, corporate bond
spreads have increased modestly since early May, and Canadian short-term funding markets have been
largely unaffected, owing to the economy’s relatively strong fundamentals. In addition, Canadian
government yields have declined benefitting from investors’ flight to quality. Likewise, Canada’s trade
account has not been significantly impacted by the European crisis due to its limited exposure to European
trade.
Going forward, a scenario of increased financial market stress in Europe, however, could trigger
larger effects. With only 9 percent of Canadian total exports going to the EU, Canada’s direct trade
exposure is small. However, spillovers of Europe to the rest of the world may affect Canada’s exports
indirectly. Further developments could increase uncertainty of the global recovery, soften the U.S. demand
for Canadian exports, and dampen global demand for commodities.

At present, financial exposures to Europe are contained, given relatively strong fundamentals of
Canada’s financial institutions, and there have been no material dislocations in Canadian financial markets.
Canada’s banks’ total financial claims on smaller European economies are modest as a share of assets and
Tier-1 capital. Claims on larger European economies, including the U.K., are significantly larger, however.

Exchange Rate Arrangements: The authorities maintain a “free floating” exchange
rate regime. The exchange rate regime is free from exchange restrictions and multiple
currency practices. The Canadian authorities do not maintain margins with respect to
exchange transactions. However, the authorities may intervene to maintain orderly conditions
in the exchange market. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign
exchange. Canada has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 (a) and
maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and

3
transfers for current international transactions. Canada maintains exchange restrictions for
security reasons, based on UN Security Council Resolutions, that have been notified to the
Fund for approval (most recently in December 2007) under the procedures set forth in
Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51).
XI.
Last Article IV Consultation: The Staff Report for the 2009 consultation with
Canada was considered by the Executive Board on May 11, 2009 (IMF Country Report No.

XII. The 2010 Article IV discussions were conducted in Ottawa and Toronto from October
12–21 by C. Kramer (head), N. Batini, G. Bin Li (all WHD), and F. Columba (MCM). Ms.
Batini led an advance mission. Ms. Tsounta participated in the mission from headquarters.
Mr. Purves (Senior Advisor) attended the meetings. Mr. Eyzaguirre (WHD) and Mr. Hockin
(Executive Director) participated in the concluding meeting with Minister of Finance
Flaherty and Bank of Canada Governor Carney in Ottawa on October 27. A press conference
was held on October 28. Outreach activities included discussions with the private sector and
think tanks.

FSSA Participation and ROSC Assessments

Canada–Financial System Stability Assessment–
Volume II: Report on Observance of Standards
in the Financial System

www.imf.org

Summary: The FSSA report concluded that Canada has a stable and highly advanced
financial system, which is among the soundest in the world. Moreover, it is supported
by a well-developed regulatory system that shows a high degree of compliance with
major international standards. Nevertheless, the FSSA report made a few
recommendations to further strengthen the regulatory framework and financial
system’s resilience, most of which have already been addressed, including:


Introducing capital requirements for the guarantees in life insurance
segregated fund (completed by end-2001);



Tabling legislation granting the Office of the Superintendent of Financial
Institutions (OSFI) powers to remove a financial institution’s director or
senior officer if the person is deemed not suitable to hold that office based on
a number of criteria. The latter legislation brought Canada into broad
compliance with the Basel Core Principles;

Making significant progress in harmonizing securities regulation and improving
coordination among provincial securities regulators, including through a newly
created association of securities regulators, the Canadian Securities Administrators.
Although there remain multiple regulators at the provincial level, a Senate
commission was created to develop specific recommendations on further
harmonization and streamlining of securities regulation.

Canada: Report on the Observance of Standards
and Codes—Fiscal Transparency Module

IMF Country Report
No. 02/51, 03/12/02

Summary: The report found that fiscal management in Canada meets the
requirements of the fiscal transparency code, and in a number of instances represents
best practice. In particular, it highlighted the use of private sector economic forecasts.
Fiscal management was also commended for its statistical integrity, impartial tax
administration, open procurement, and a transparent regulatory process.
The report found several areas where further improvements would be desirable,
including: (i) the preparation of timely, current year estimates of federal and
provincial budgets on a comparable basis, (ii) a comprehensive account of the
procedures for the budget cycle and expenditure management system, (iii) systematic
reporting of the use of reserves for non-economic contingencies, (iv) resumption of
publication of reconciled national and public accounts forecasts of major aggregates
over the forecast horizon, and (v) publication by all governments of quasi-fiscal
activities.
Many of these issues have been addressed, including: (i) the release by Statistics
Canada of consolidated data for federal and provincial budgets for 2001–02 (on a
Financial Management System basis); (ii) the publication of comprehensive
descriptions of budget and expenditure management procedures, including a joint
document entitled “Budgeting in Canada” by the Government and the OECD, detailed
accounts of policies and procedures on expenditure management at the website of the
Treasury Board Secretariat, and the explanation of the budget cycle and process in
Budget and Update documents; and (iii) publication of reconciled national and public
accounts forecasting.
Canada: Report on the Observance of Standards
and Codes—Data Module

IMF Country Report
No. 03/328, 10/23/03

Summary: Canada’s macroeconomic statistics are comprehensive, timely, and accurate and
thus adequate to conduct effective surveillance of economic and financial policies. Official
institutions responsible for the compilation and dissemination of the macroeconomic
datasets are supported by adequate legal and institutional frameworks. These frameworks
protect confidentiality and ensure that statistical work is conducted within a quality
assurance program and with sufficient resources. Integrity is ensured by the professionalism
of the staff, transparency in statistical policies and practices, and the provision of ethical
guidelines for staff. Compilers generally follow internationally accepted guidelines in the
production of the macroeconomic statistics, which is well-supported by excellent efforts to
develop source data that facilitate a high degree of accuracy and reliability. Statistics are
generally relevant, well documented, available with good frequency on a timely basis, and
readily accessible to users, who trust them as objective.

5

While recognizing the high quality of the macroeconomic data, the report makes
recommendations to further strengthen the statistical system, most of which are already
being addressed, including these priorities:


Articulate the roles of Statistics Canada and the Bank of Canada in producing financial
sector statistics and explore possibilities for more data sharing of monetary and
financial statistics;



Estimate consumption of fixed capital at replacement cost rather than historic costs now
used for the corporate sector in the Canadian System of National Accounts (CSNA);



Disseminate information on the sources and methods used in compiling quarterly public
sector statistics for the quarterly CSNA; and



Reclassify certain transactions that are not recorded in line with the 5th edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5).

Canada: Report on the Observance of Standards
and Codes––FATF Recommendations for AntiMoney Laundering and Combating the
Financing of Terrorism

IMF Country Report
No. 08/372, 12/11/08

Summary: Canada underwent a detailed FATF evaluation of its anti-money laundering and
combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) framework in 2007. Shortcomings were
identified with respect to the scope of customer due diligence, AML/CFT supervision, and
the Canadian financial intelligence unit. Since then, a number of steps have been taken to
strengthen the framework in these three areas, resulting in significant improvements.
Canada: Financial System Stability AssessmentUpdate

IMF Country Report
No. 08/59, 02/13/08

Summary: The FSSA update concluded that Canada’s financial system is mature,
sophisticated, and well-managed. Financial stability was underpinned by sound
macroeconomic policies and strong prudential regulation and supervision, and welldesigned deposit insurance and arrangements for crisis management and failure
resolution. The banking system appeared sound, with stress tests showing that the
major banks could withstand sizeable shocks, although they did faces some
challenges related to the global financial turmoil that started in mid-2007. Also, there
were some concerns about bank attempts to build on their secure domestic position, to
enter highly competitive foreign markets or complex activities.
The update reiterated the advantages of moving towards a single securities regulator,
including the streamlining of policy development, reductions in compliance costs, and

6
improved enforcement. However, it also recognized the significant improvements to
the regulatory system from the creation of the Canadian Securities Administrators
(CSA), and the implementation of the passport system.

ANNEX II. STATISTICAL ISSUES
The quality, coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of Canada’s economic data are considered
to be excellent both in the context of the Article IV consultation and for purposes of ongoing
surveillance. Canada has subscribed to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard
(SDDS), and its metadata are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(DSBB). The data ROSC was published on October 23, 2003.
Real Sector. Statistics Canada provides timely and adequate data in monthly, quarterly, and
annual frequency thereby facilitating the analysis of economic developments and assessment
of policy proposals within a quantitative macroeconomic framework. In May 2001, Statistics
Canada effected a smooth transition from Laspeyres methodology for estimating real
expenditure-based GDP to Fisher index formulae, which enabled more accurate comparison
between Canada and other G-7 countries.
Fiscal Sector. Statistics Canada provides quarterly data (a Statement of Government
Operations along with a Balance Sheet) on the consolidated general government following
the Government Finance Statistics Manual, 2001 (GFSM 2001) recommendations. In
addition, the Department of Finance Canada provides monthly and annual data on the
federal government’s budget, tax policies, rules and regulations for Canada’s banks and other
financial institutions. The provided data enable adequate assessment of the impact of fiscal
policy measures on Canada’s economic performance.
Monetary Sector. The Bank of Canada provides timely and adequate coverage of daily,
weekly, monthly and quarterly data related to the monetary sector.
External Sector. Statistics Canada provides timely information on a quarterly frequency on
the balance of payments, external debt, and the international investment position (IIP).
Finance Canada provides monthly data on Official International Reserves in a format
comparable to the IMF’s reserve data template, thus enabling adequate surveillance. Data are
published at http://www.fin.gc.ca/finsearch/finresults_e.asp?Who=News .

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 22, 2010

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation
with Canada
On December 15, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Canada.1
Background
Canada has weathered well the global recession, reflecting a strong economic and
financial position at the onset of the crisis and a sizeable macro policy response. The
large fiscal stimulus (totaling about 4 percent of one year’s GDP over two years) and
prompt accommodation in monetary conditions strengthened domestic demand, and the
economy posted robust growth rates in late 2009 and early 2010. Labor markets have
been a particularly bright spot in the recovery, with Canada the only G-7 country (apart
from Germany) that virtually recouped the loss in employment during the recession by
mid-2010, and the first to record year-over-year increases in employment by the first
quarter of 2010.
During the recovery, the Canadian current account deficit expanded on the back of brisk
import growth, subdued exports to the United States—Canada’s main trading partner—
and an appreciating Canadian dollar, given recovering commodity prices and capital
flows. The financial system has avoided systemic pressures amid the global turbulence,
thanks in good part to strong supervision and regulation. Financial markets have largely
recovered from the turmoil and overall financial conditions remain accommodative.
However, the economic recovery is moderating and the outlook remains uncertain. In
particular, domestic demand is slowing, amid stretched household balance sheets and a
cooling housing market, following the introduction of tighter mortgage standards earlier
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summing
ups can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

this year in response to emerging risks. Net exports continue to be a drag on growth.
Inflation has remained contained, with core inflation around the middle of the Bank of
Canada’s control range. Looking ahead, risks are elevated and tilted to the downside
with high household debt levels the main domestic risk, and a weaker U.S. outlook the
largest external risk.
Macroeconomic policies are set to remain accommodative in the near term. In particular,
monetary tightening has paused following rate increases between June and September
that brought the target for the overnight rate to 1 percent and the phasing out of most of
the extraordinary liquidity facilities. More recently, the Bank of Canada put further hikes
on hold.
On fiscal policy, the authorities tabled a return to budgetary balance over the medium
term with an ambitious and growth-friendly plan, while remaining committed to deliver
the last year of stimulus. The near-term adjustment has been substantially smoothed by
recent fiscal measures. Specifically, the extension by seven months of the deadline (to
October 31, 2011) for infrastructure projects to be completed under the Economic Action
Plan.
Canada’s financial system continues to display resilience, partly reflecting strong
supervision and regulation. Financial soundness indicators are at strong levels.
However, near-term risks have increased, including from stretched household balance
sheets and U.S. exposures.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for the credible framework for
macroeconomic policy, their strong policy response to the crisis and the resilient
financial system, all of which have enabled Canada to exit the crisis on a strong footing.
The recovery, forceful in the beginning, is now moderating and risks to the outlook have
increased. To consolidate the gains achieved thus far, Directors encouraged the
authorities to maintain their prudent and far-sighted policies, while further strengthening
productivity and competitiveness.
Directors supported decisions by the Bank of Canada to put on hold further increases in
its interest rates. The accommodative stance of monetary policy would support growth in
the current economic environment. Inflation and inflation expectations remain well
anchored within the Bank’s control range. Directors observed that monetary policy will
have room for stimulus if needed.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ aim to return to fiscal balance over the medium
term, which would put the net debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward trajectory. The
authorities’ ambitious fiscal consolidation plans include growth-friendly measures to
support Canada’s long-run economic potential, notably infrastructure spending and cuts
in corporate income tax. In the event that the envisioned program spending restraint is
not sufficient, additional measures would be needed.

3

Directors noted that in the longer run restraint in the growth of health-care spending
would be essential. Left unchecked, such spending would put unsustainable pressure
on public finances. They encouraged the authorities to increase communication about
the attendant challenges to improve public awareness. Developing arrangements for
provinces to share experiences in managing costs would also be helpful.
Directors welcomed the recent moves to reduce the near-term rise in employment
insurance premia and to allow flexibility in deadlines for unfinished infrastructure
projects. Directors agreed that these moves appropriately smoothed the up-front fiscal
adjustment in light of the elevated risks to the outlook. They also noted that fiscal policy
had ample room to respond if downside risks materialized.
Directors recognized that Canada’s financial stability arrangements are continuing to
serve it well. Throughout the crisis, the financial system had maintained the ability to
intermediate funds, and avoided systemic strains. Directors called for continued
vigilance with regard to risks emanating from both domestic household debt and
financial institutions’ exposures to the United States.
Directors observed that Canada is well positioned to adapt its financial regulatory
framework to emerging international initiatives. The factors underlying Canada’s
resilience, such as its well regulated mortgage market, have been key inputs to the
international debate on financial regulatory reform. Further progress toward national
securities regulation will be an essential enhancement in the financial regulatory
framework.
