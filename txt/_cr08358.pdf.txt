Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2008 Consultation
with Solomon Islands
Approved by Kalpana Kochhar and Martin Fetherston
September 10, 2008

Discussions: Held in Honiara, Solomon Islands, July 16–25, 2008. The mission met with
the Minister of Finance, Governor of the Central Bank, other ministries and government
agencies, public enterprises, the business community, and donors.
Team: Ms. Thacker (Head), Ms. Fernandez, and Mr. Vitek (all APD). Mr. Moveni (OED)
joined some of the meetings.
Past Fund Advice: Executive Directors’ comments at the conclusion of the last Article IV
consultation on July 16, 2007, can be found at
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pn/2007/pn07110.htm.
The effectiveness of past surveillance remains mixed (see Annex I, Informational
Annex).
Exchange Arrangement: The Solomon Islands accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2(a), 3, and 4 in 1979 and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions
on payments and transfers for current international transactions. The exchange rate regime is
a de facto peg to the U.S. dollar.
Outreach: The mission met with donors.
Publication: The mission encouraged the authorities to publish the Article IV documents as
they have done in previous years.
Statistics: Despite some improvements, the coverage and quality of data remain poor, partly
reflecting capacity constraints, and hamper effective surveillance.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background and Challenges
Economic performance remains strong, but inflation has increased. Real GDP grew by
10.3 percent last year. For 2008, real GDP growth is projected at 7¼ percent, reflecting a
continued rise in unsustainable logging activity, and strong growth in nonlogging sectors.
Inflation has picked up recently due to increases in international food and fuel prices and
loose domestic policies. The fiscal deficit is expected to widen significantly, reflecting the
approval of a large supplementary budget in August. The current account deficit is also
expected to widen due to higher food and fuel imports, and mining-related FDI. Reserves are
expected to remain at 3 months of projected imports.
Over the medium term, logging and aid inflows are expected to fall sharply, negatively
impacting growth, and the balance of payments and fiscal positions. Exports from the
gold mine, scheduled to start operation in 2010, will offset the decline in reserves, but the
budget will be strained, requiring significant efforts to boost revenues and cut expenditures.
Key Policy Issues and Recommendations
Against this background, the mission focused on three key policy issues:
•
Tightening monetary and fiscal policies to contain inflation. The authorities have
responded to higher inflation by tightening credit conditions and removing taxes on rice.
However, monetary and fiscal policies need to be tightened further to prevent inflation from
becoming entrenched. The mission recommended raising the liquid asset requirement (LAR)
and restraining fiscal spending. The authorities agreed with the need for additional monetary
tightening, but argued that political and economic constraints prevent a reduction in fiscal
spending.
•
Safeguarding fiscal and external sustainability over the medium term as logging
activity declines. On the fiscal front, urgent measures are needed to strengthen the mediumterm fiscal framework, pursue reform measures to boost revenues, and accelerate the
restructuring of loss-making state-owned enterprises. On the external front, export
diversification is critical to replace declining logging export receipts. Impediments to the
operation of the gold mine need to be urgently addressed, including the resolution of land
ownership issues. The mission also encouraged the authorities to permit greater exchange
rate flexibility to safeguard reserves.
•
Stimulating nonlogging sector growth. Progress on structural reforms remains slow.
The authorities’ medium-term strategy focuses on fostering competition, improving the
provision of basic services, upgrading infrastructure, and addressing land ownership issues.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The political situation in the Solomon Islands (SI) has been generally stable
since 2003, but remains fragile. The Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands
(RAMSI) has helped to maintain peace and order since 2003, focusing on strengthening the
country’s institutional capacity and preventing future conflict. However, a recent study
argues that long-term peace-building requires a clearer understanding of the causes and
dynamics of conflict.1 The government has taken serious steps in this direction through
examining the root causes of the ethnic tensions and is preparing a Political Integrity Bill to
enhance political stability.
8

2.
Despite rapid growth during the last
five years, the SI ranked the poorest among the
Pacific Island countries in 2007. Real GDP
growth averaged 7 percent during the last five
years, driven by unsustainable logging sector
activity and aid inflows. However, progress towards
achieving the Millennium Development Goals
remains slow and per capita income remains below
its pre-conflict level (see Informational Annex).

II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK
3.
Real GDP growth increased to 10.3 percent
last year, driven by the logging and services sectors
(Table 1). Preliminary figures for the first half of 2008
suggest continued strong growth in these sectors,
while other sectors, most notably palm oil production
and fisheries, have also picked up. Real GDP is
projected to increase by over 7 percent in 2008.

16 percent (3-month moving average) at end-June
2008 from 10 percent at end-2007, and core inflation is up 14 percent during this period
(Box 1). At the same time, rapid private sector credit growth since 2004, an expansionary
fiscal stance since last year and the gradual depreciation of the SI dollar in nominal effective
terms have also been important contributory factors. As food and fuel prices stabilize and
recent monetary measures to tighten excess liquidity gain traction (see below), headline
inflation is projected to decline somewhat and end the year at about 15 percent (year-onyear).

half of 2008 suggest that spending continues
to exceed revenues. In addition, the
government has approved a supplementary budget, estimated at an unprecedented 5½ percent
of GDP, with 2½ percent to meet payroll increases granted in May. However, the bulk of the
financing for new spending has yet to be identified.
6.
Excess liquidity at commercial
banks has declined. Private sector credit
increased at an annual rate of about
60 percent during the last three years, albeit
from a low base, with personal loans rising
the fastest (Table 3). In order to reduce
excess liquidity and commercial bank
lending, the CBSI has allowed the National
Provident Fund (NPF) to invest abroad up to
30 percent of its investment portfolio (about
US$20 million) and introduced standing
deposit facilities in July. As a result, bank
lending has slowed recently.

Reserves remain adequate, but the deterioration in the terms of trade is expected
to widen the current account deficit. A pickup in logging exports (both volume and price
effects) and aid inflows, together with higher FDI, more than offset the increase in the food
and fuel import bill last year (Table 4). As a result, official international reserves increased
by US$16 million to US$120 million (about 4 months of projected imports). However,
reserves have declined more recently due to debt repayments, NPF investments abroad, and
higher imports. The current account deficit is projected to widen to 7 percent of GDP in
2008, financed largely by aid inflows and mining-related FDI. Reserves are expected to
remain at about 3 months of projected imports during the remainder of the year.
8.
The SI dollar depreciated by 9 percent in nominal effective terms during the
year to end-May 2008, reflecting its de facto peg to the U.S. dollar (Box 2). However, it
remained fairly stable in real effective terms, and external price competitiveness does not

6
appear to be a significant concern for now.2 That said, if inflation increases further, and wage
adjustments raise the cost of production, this could weaken competitiveness and reduce
exports, especially those of nonlogging sectors like fisheries, palm oil, and tourism.
Combined export receipts from these industries amounted to 9½ percent of GDP in 2007.
9.
The banking system remains well-capitalized and profitable. Nonperforming
loans (NPLS) remain low at 3 percent (Table 5). Personal loans, the fastest growing sector,
are generally collateralized by individuals’ savings in the NPF and default on these loans is
extremely small.
10.
There has been some progress on structural reforms. The State-Owned Enterprise
(SOE) Act, aimed at improving the efficiency of the SOE sector, and the Secured
Transactions Act, allowing movable property to be used as collateral, were passed by
parliament. The Civil Aviation and the Telecommunications Bills allowing and enhancing
competition in these sectors are expected to be approved later this year. However, little
progress has been made in addressing land ownership issues and easing infrastructure
bottlenecks.
11.
Risks to the outlook are mainly on the downside. Inflationary pressures from an
excessively expansionary fiscal stance, potential demand for further wage increases, and
further negative terms of trade shocks could trigger macroeconomic instability in the short
run and derail the progress made recently.
III. MEDIUM-TERM MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS
12.
The medium-term outlook hinges critically on the success of developing
nonlogging sources of growth, to offset the expected sharp decline in logging activity
(Table 6). The logging sector currently accounts for 20 percent of government tax revenues
and 65 percent of exports. But logging activity is expected to decline rapidly beyond 2009
and to become negligible by 2013, reflecting the unsustainably high rates of logging.
Therefore, growth in other sectors, including mining (gold and nickel), palm oil production,
tourism, and the services sectors, needs to be stimulated. In particular, gold mining
operations, now scheduled to start in 2010, are critical to sustaining exports and foreign
reserves once logging declines.
13.
Risks are skewed mainly to the downside. The principal risk to external
sustainability is a further delay in the start of gold mining operations which could reduce
foreign exchange inflows to finance imports, resulting in a rapid depletion of reserves. Also,
2

This exchange rate assessment is based on a qualitative analysis of recent and projected future balance of
payments dynamics, supplemented by implementation of the equilibrium real exchange rate approach.
Implementation of the macroeconomic balance and external sustainability approaches is precluded by data
availability constraints.

7
a lack of progress on structural reforms, in particular to address infrastructure bottlenecks,
could slow growth significantly and lead to a decline in average income per capita.
Nevertheless, future donor aid inflows in excess of current commitments could mitigate some
of these downside risks to external sustainability. The following three scenarios illustrate
alternative medium-term outcomes, contingent on policy actions taken by the authorities in
the coming period:
•

Baseline scenario: Gold mining operations are assumed to start in 2010, as currently
scheduled, but the pace of structural reforms remains moderate. While gold exports
will help to offset the decline in logging export receipts, the contribution to domestic
growth is expected to be limited, given the capital-intensive nature of the project and
the largely unskilled local labor it will employ. As a result, the economy is expected
to muddle along with an average real growth rate in the range of 3–4 percent per year,
allowing for a modest increase in average per capita income over time.3

•

Reform scenario: An acceleration of structural reforms could lift the economy onto a
steeper growth trajectory. In particular, improvements in infrastructure and a decline
in the cost of doing business could unlock the vast growth potential in the agriculture,
fisheries (including canning), and tourism sectors, and expedite production in the
mining sector. This would enhance fiscal and external sustainability.

•

Worst-case scenario: Given the history of the Solomon Islands and the fragile nature
of the coalition government, political and economic instability could resurface. If this
were to occur, gold mining operations could be further delayed and other sectors—
fishing, agriculture, and tourism—could lose their current growth momentum. With
the rapid depletion of forests and therefore logging, this could push the economy into
a protracted period of low growth with large deficits and rapidly declining reserves,
necessitating difficult economic adjustments.
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS

14.

Against this background, the mission focused on the following key issues:
•

3

Adjusting monetary and fiscal policies to contain the second-round effects on
inflation from recent surges in international food and fuel prices. The authorities
shared the mission’s concern, but argued that recent wage increases, and the
consequent rise in budget spending, was necessary to mitigate some of the impact on
the poor.

Average population growth is projected at 2.8 percent.

8
•

Safeguarding fiscal and external sustainability over the medium term as logging
activity declines. The authorities agreed that timely commencement of gold mining
operations was key to alleviating the pressures on the balance of payments from
declining logging exports. They also recognized the need to rationalize the budget
and cut spending to ensure fiscal sustainability given the current budget envelope.
That said, they were hopeful that they could mobilize additional aid inflows.

•

Stimulating nonlogging sector growth through infrastructure development and
the resolution of land ownership issues. The authorities’ medium-term development
strategy focuses on these issues, and they are taking steps to allow more competition
and encourage private sector growth.4

15.
The increase in inflationary
pressures, unless contained, could
unravel the recent gains in
macroeconomic stability. While most
countries faced with rising international
commodity prices have been tightening
policies to contain inflation, expansionary
monetary and fiscal policies (as discussed
above) have exacerbated the second-round
effects and led to additional pressure on
prices.
Discussions

16.
The mission advised the authorities that domestic demand management policies
need to be tightened to contain inflation:
•

4

The mission discouraged the authorities from adjusting the exchange rate to
counter rising inflationary pressures and instead encouraged greater exchange
rate flexibility. The real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with medium-term
fundamentals. With reserves falling recently due, in part, to the rising import bill,
adjusting the exchange rate to counter inflation could put further pressure on reserves
and jeopardize the competitiveness of nonlogging sectors like mining, fisheries, and

The authorities presented this to donors in June. However, reception has been lukewarm with donors
suggesting that the projects need to be costed and integrated within the framework of ongoing projects.
Authorities are revising the document in line with these suggestions.

9
tourism. Instead of temporarily reducing inflation by revaluing the currency, allowing
for greater downward exchange rate flexibility, underpinned by appropriately tight
monetary and fiscal policies, would help to safeguard reserves while containing
inflation.
•

On the monetary front, the authorities recognized that further tightening is
needed. The authorities pointed out that recent measures (discussed above) have been
effective in slowing credit growth. They concurred with staff to continue to use the
standing deposit facilities, and agreed to raise the LAR if additional tightening was
needed.

•

On the fiscal front, the authorities argued that they were constrained both by
economic and political realities. The authorities stressed that their initial response to
inflationary pressures was to eliminate the goods tax and the import duty on rice to
partially offset imported food price increases, while allowing the economy to adjust
to higher fuel prices.5 However, with the continued rise in commodity prices, calls for
wage increases, including most vocally by the opposition, had to be accommodated.6
That said, they argued that there will likely be some underspending in the
development budget given capacity constraints..
B. Addressing Medium-term Fiscal and External Sustainability

Background
17.
Debt levels have fallen, but remain significant. At end-2007, only the NPV of
external debt to GDP (38 percent) breached its Board-endorsed threshold (see Debt
Sustainability Analysis). All debt indicators are projected to decline and remain below their
thresholds in the medium term under the baseline scenario. However, historical scenarios and
several stress tests cause a number of indicators to significantly exceed their thresholds. In
particular, public sector debt and external debt levels are highly sensitive to temporary
declines in real GDP growth and export growth, respectively. Moreover, the medium-term
outlook hinges critically on the start of gold mining operations in 2010, without which the
balance of payments and foreign reserves would come under severe pressure. Based on these
considerations, Solomon Islands is classified as in moderate risk of debt distress, and the

5

Fuel prices are determined by private importers and retailers; however, electricity and transportation prices can
be increased only after consultation with the government.

6

The opposition submitted a no-confidence vote (which was defeated), citing government’s lack of response to
the plight of the poor due to higher food and fuel prices.

10
government should continue its nonborrowing policy, depending solely on grants until debt
sustainability risks are mitigated.7
18.
Fiscal and external sustainability could be at serious risk if gold mining is
delayed. Log exports have been very buoyant in the last five years (both due to the
unsustainable rate of logging and due to higher log prices) and have nearly doubled as a share
of GDP. However, instead of saving the windfall, budget spending has been increasing in
line with additional revenues. With the contribution from the logging sector expected to
decline sharply, gold export revenues will be instrumental in alleviating downward pressure
on foreign reserves. On the other hand, fiscal sustainability will depend on cutting
expenditures, unless donors provide budget support, as gold mining will contribute only
marginally to improve the fiscal situation given the generous tax concessions granted to the
gold mining company. The government’s medium-term fiscal strategy recognizes this and
envisages significant spending cuts, although it does not identify the areas where these cuts
would occur.
Discussions
19.
The authorities broadly agreed with the mission’s recommendation on areas that
could generate expenditure savings.


Strengthen the government’s medium-term fiscal framework and restructure
the budget: In particular,
o Undertake civil service reforms to reduce the wage bill, including by
eliminating vacant positions, and avoiding ad hoc increases in wages;
o Enhance monitoring and accountability of public enterprises to raise
efficiency, and restructure those that continue to incur losses (the latter will
also reduce the contingent liabilities of the government); and
o Enhance the transparency and accountability of spending by both the central
government and line ministries to ensure that monies are not misspent.



Expedite fiscal structural reforms to boost revenues: There is considerable scope
for strengthening tax administration, including by reducing exemptions and enforcing
tax collection, especially in the logging sector. In particular:
o Further raise the determined price of logs and introduce an automatic
adjustment mechanism.8 Following strong lobbying by the logging sector,

7

Thus far, the authorities have honored their commitment not to incur new borrowing. In 2008, a small amount
was disbursed in relation to an existing ADB loan.

8

The authorities use the determined price to calculate the tax obligation of log exporters. Adjustments to it are
currently done on an ad hoc basis.

11
the government deferred its plan to raise the determined price from June to
October. Implementing this in October as planned would send a strong signal
of the authorities’ commitment to reforms, and would boost tax revenues
(Box 3). Furthermore, saving some of this windfall to meet budgetary needs
over the medium term when logging revenues decline could ease the pressure
to cut spending.
o Improve monitoring of the logging sector to increase tax compliance.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that only 30–40 percent of log shipments are
inspected, resulting in foregone tax revenues of nearly 4 percent of GDP in
2007. The mission urged the authorities to enhance monitoring by employing
qualified personnel. This would not only help generate revenues that could
finance much-needed social and development spending (for example, for
financing free primary education or for funding more vocational training), but
would also encourage sustainable logging activity.


Accelerate SOE reforms: Following the completion of the current audit program,
SOEs should be subject to regular disclosure of annual financial statements to
improve financial management and restructuring. Also, divestment of enterprises that
are in commercially viable sectors, for example Soltai Fishing Company and
Solomon Airlines, is likely to strengthen the government’s balance sheet, and should
be undertaken.

20.
Enhance export diversification to preserve external sustainability. External
sustainability hinges on the success of offsetting the imminent decline in logging export
receipts with growth in other export-oriented sectors, especially mining. The mission
therefore urged the government to address bottlenecks that have repeatedly caused delays in
starting gold mining operations (discussed below), while emphasizing that additional tax
concessions should be avoided. Over the long term, nickel mining also has tremendous
potential to generate foreign exchange receipts and boost reserves. Should ongoing
exploration work establish that nickel mining is commercially viable, the mission advised the
government to negotiate an equitable profit sharing agreement with assistance from qualified
consultants.
C. Stimulating Nonlogging Sector Growth
Background
21.
Progress in removing constraints to broad-based growth has been slow. Major
impediments include ambiguity in land ownership, poor infrastructure, a shortage of skilled
labor, and unreliable and costly electricity, water, and telecommunication services. In
addition, poor governance remains widespread and the cost of doing business is relatively
high by regional standards. SOEs continue to make losses and require frequent cash
injections from the government. On the positive side, some progress has been made in

12
improving road infrastructure with the help of
the Asian Development Bank (AsDB), and in
enhancing competition in the airline industry.

22.
The authorities agreed with staff and
pointed to recent measures that are being
taken to improve the basic institutional and
infrastructure framework to stimulate
nonlogging sector growth. In particular:
•

Land ownership issues: The draft
Tribal Land Bill is currently being discussed by the Ministry of Lands and the
Attorney-General’s office, and is expected to be tabled in the November
parliamentary sitting. If passed, this law would help expedite the resolution of land
ownership issues, easing access to land for commercial purposes.

•

Increased competition in telecommunications: The government’s agreement with
Telekom, which now holds a monopoly in providing telecommunication services, is
expected to be reviewed later this year to allow competition in the sector.

•

Improved business environment for the private sector: The Companies Act and
Insolvency Act defining the framework in which private enterprises operate will be
tabled in the November parliamentary sitting.

•

State-owned enterprises: External managers are being hired with the assistance of
the World Bank to improve the financial viability and service delivery of the
Solomon Islands Electricity Authority (the state-owned electricity company).

•

Infrastructure improvements: The authorities emphasized their continued
commitment to work with the AsDB to improve road and water transport and port
facilities.

•

Alternative sources of energy: The authorities are also exploring this area,
including hydro, solar and biomass plants, with the help of the World Bank and other
donors, especially as this will help to reduce their dependence on diesel imports for
electricity generation.
V. OTHER ISSUES

23.
Various financial soundness indicators reveal that commercial banks remain
well capitalized and profitable. All three commercial banks are subsidiaries of foreign
banks and are supervised both by the CBSI and the supervisory authorities of their parent

13
banks. Most lending is collateralized and risk-weighted capital asset ratios, at about
20 percent as of March 2008, remain above the prudential norm. Moreover, nonperforming
loans remain low as a share of total loans at below 3 percent.9 However, given the rapid
credit growth in recent years, and the expected moderation in growth over the medium term,
NPLs could rise. The CBSI agreed to continue its close monitoring of the banking sector.
24.
The statistical database remains poor and hampers surveillance. Despite some
improvements, the coverage and quality of the real, public, and external sectors remain
deficient. Public sector statistics are inconsistent with the GFS methodology, and do not track
provincial government or SOE activities. The recurrent and development budgets have yet to
be integrated. External sector data suffer from serious misclassification problems. The latest
Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES), completed in September 2006, has been
used to revise the national accounts and construct GDP by expenditure component, with
assistance from PFTAC. However, these have yet to be officially published.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
25.
Political stability remains fragile. While the overall political situation has remained
stable since 2003, repeated jockeying by politicians and random jumps across party lines has
resulted in numerous changes in government, confounding consistent policy making. Efforts
to consolidate the party system, including through the Political Integrity Bill aimed at
preventing frequent party defections, are welcome, and should help create a more stable
political environment.
26.
Recent growth performance has been very strong, but its sustainability is in
question. Real GDP growth reached a 15-year high last year, driven by unsustainable
logging sector activity and strong service sector growth stimulated by donor aid inflows.10
More recently, some nonlogging sectors like palm oil production, fisheries, and tourism have
also picked up. However, average per capita income remains below its pre-conflict level.
27.
Monetary and fiscal tightening are urgently needed to contain inflation. While
the rise in international commodity prices has been the major cause of higher inflation,
expansionary domestic monetary and fiscal policies have exacerbated import price pressures
as reflected in the pickup in core inflation. In this context, recent efforts by the CBSI to rein
in excess liquidity through its standing deposit facilities are welcome. In order to anchor
inflation expectations, the CBSI should tighten the monetary stance further, including
through an increase in the LAR. To avoid placing an undue burden on monetary policy, fiscal
policy also needs to play a supportive role by minimizing spending of the supplementary
budget, where possible.

Loans are classified as NPLs if they are overdue for more than 90 days.

Aid flows are expected to decline over the medium term in line with current donor commitments.

28.
Maintaining fiscal sustainability will require a concerted effort to boost tax
revenues and cut expenditure growth. Efforts to bolster tax revenues will need to be
intensified, including by strengthening tax administration, raising the determined price of
logs to reflect international market prices, and cutting ad hoc tax exemptions. In addition,
reforms to rationalize civil service employment and restrain the future growth of the wage
bill, enhance the monitoring of SOEs, and restructuring/privatizing loss-making ones will
yield substantial savings. Improving expenditure control procedures to ensure that spending
remains within budgeted levels and increasing transparency of all government accounts will
also help cut expenditures.
29.
Structural reforms to generate nonlogging sector growth are critical to sustain
the growth momentum and preserve medium-term fiscal and external sustainability.
Given the imminent decline in logging sector activity, efforts to develop alternative sources
of growth should be intensified. In this context, the government’s efforts to allow
competition in the airlines and telecommunications industries are welcome. However,
reforms to address land ownership issues, improve infrastructure, and eliminate rent-seeking
activities to lower the high cost of doing business need to be implemented swiftly.
30.
The real effective exchange rate appears to be broadly in line with medium-term
fundamentals. However, a decline in competitiveness if inflation and wage growth are not
contained, and pressure on reserves if the decline in logging exports is not offset by exports
from other sectors, could necessitate exchange rate adjustment. Greater exchange rate
flexibility could help avoid sudden disruptive economic adjustments.
31.
The banking system remains profitable and NPLs are low, but the CBSI should
continue to monitor the situation closely. While commercial banks’ focus on collateralized
lending combined with rapid economic growth in recent years has helped to keep NPLs low,
banks remain vulnerable to a slowdown in logging sector activity. The CBSI should continue
to monitor banks closely to ensure that asset quality remains sound.
32.
The quality, timeliness, and availability of most data remains poor and hampers
effective surveillance. Data on monetary statistics are adequate. However, data on national
accounts and balance of payments, despite significant technical assistance, continue to be
inadequate. Data on the provincial governments and SOEs is almost nonexistent. The
authorities should give priority to improving data collection and quality, including by
committing adequate resources.
33.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Box 1. Recent Inflation Developments in the Solomon Islands
Inflation in the Solomon Islands has
increased recently. Following a
decline from a peak of 13.1 percent in
2006Q2 to a trough of 5.8 percent in
2007Q3, annual consumption price
inflation rose to 9.7 percent in
2008Q1. This surge was primarily
attributable to an increase in import
price inflation, which rose from
6.2 percent in 2007Q3 to 13.0 percent
in 2008Q1. This recent experience
parallels those of other Pacific Island
countries.
Increases in international food and
fuel prices accounted for the
majority of the recent surge in
inflation, exacerbated by
depreciation of the currency in
nominal effective terms. Given a
weight of 43 percent in the
consumption basket, an increase in
food price inflation from 3.1 percent
in 2007Q3 to 11.9 percent in 2008Q1
contributed to an increase in
consumption price inflation of
3.7 percent over this period.
Loose monetary and fiscal
conditions have supported high
domestic inflation. Domestic credit to
the private sector has grown at rates of
about 60 percent during the last three
years, about four times the growth rate
of nominal GDP. Further tightening of
the monetary policy stance is needed
to ensure that inflation is contained.

Box 2. An Exchange Rate Assessment for the Solomon Islands
The Solomon Islands’ dollar has experienced trend nominal depreciations with respect to the currencies of major trading partners.
Since 2003, the Solomon Islands’ dollar depreciated by 36 percent relative to the Australian dollar, by 21 percent relative to the Singapore
dollar, and by 16 percent relative to the Chinese yuan. These developments reflect its de facto peg to the US dollar over this period.
The value of the Solomon Islands’ dollar has remained broadly constant in real effective terms. During recent years, trend nominal
effective depreciation has offset erosion of external price competitiveness caused by higher inflation in the Solomon Islands than among its
major trading partners.

Real effective exchange rate (RHS)

A qualitative exchange rate assessment suggests that the value of the real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with medium
term fundamentals. A macroeconomic projection conditional on a constant real effective exchange rate suggests sustainable balance of
payments dynamics over the medium term. However, the risks surrounding this baseline projection are tilted towards the downside. If gold
mining does not begin in 2010, or if further large increases in international food and fuel prices occur, then depreciation of the currency in
real effective terms may be needed to safeguard reserves following the imminent decline in logging.

A quantitative exchange rate assessment also suggests that external price competitiveness is not a significant concern. Accounting
only for trend deterioration in the terms of trade with the equilibrium real exchange rate approach suggests that the value of the real
effective exchange rate is currently broadly in line with its estimated medium run equilibrium value.1 However, if further large negative
terms of trade shocks occur, then depreciation of the currency in real effective terms may be needed to preserve external sustainability.
_____________________________________________

The equilibrium real exchange rate approach yields an overvaluation estimate of 4 percent for 2008Q1. Data availability constraints
preclude implementing the macroeconomic balance and external sustainability approaches.

To help slow down logging activity, the government has recently passed some measures.
These include: (i) the cancellation of licenses of logging companies who fail to submit
acceptable public environment reports; (ii) the issuance of a directive to the Foreign
Investment Board not to approve any new application for logging operations; and
(iii) adjusting the reference prices of logs from an average of US$71 to US$78 per cubic
meter effective May 1, 2008. However, the government has backtracked on announced plans
to further increase reference prices to US$85 by June 1, 2008 and reintroduce an automatic
price adjustment mechanism to bring reference prices in line with movements in market
prices.

Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis 2008

MEDIUM-TERM BASELINE SCENARIO AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS1
Solomon Islands’ debt declined last year, reflecting arrears payments, debt write-offs, and
regular debt servicing. As a result of this improvement in the debt situation, as well as high
nominal GDP growth over the past few years, all the debt indicators are projected to fall below
their policy-dependent indicative thresholds throughout the medium-term (2008–13) under the
baseline scenario.2 However, historical scenarios and several stress tests still result in a
substantial increase in the debt burden and cause several indicators to rise significantly above
their thresholds. Moreover, the medium-term outlook hinges critically on the success of
developing nonlogging sectors, including gold mining, to offset the projected sharp decline in
logging revenues beyond 2009. If gold mining operations do not start in 2010, the balance of
payments and foreign reserves would come under severe pressure.3Based on these results, the
Solomon Islands is classified as in moderate risk of debt distress. However, the vulnerabilities
arising from stress tests and the downside risks to the baseline scenario from further delays in
starting gold mining operations suggest that the risks to debt sustainability are still significant.
Therefore, the country should continue to depend solely on grants until these debt sustainability
risks are clearly mitigated.

1

Data on state enterprise and provincial government debt are not available. Therefore, the public debt
sustainability analysis is limited to central government debt data.

2

These include the NPV of debt in percent of exports (100 percent), GDP (30 percent), and revenue
(200 percent), and the debt service in percent of exports (15 percent) and revenue (25 percent).

3

The operation of the gold mine, initially scheduled for 2008, has been significantly delayed, due mainly to
land ownership issues, as well as problems with securing political risk insurance.

2

Assumptions for the Medium-Term Baseline Scenario
Real GDP growth is projected to average 3.8 percent over the medium term.
Logging activity is expected to decline sharply, but nonlogging sector growth is
projected to average about 6 percent as activity in other sectors picks up, including
mining, palm oil production, and tourism. Gold mining operations are assumed to
start in 2010.
Inflation is projected to average 7.6 percent over the projection period, influenced
largely by the recent sharp increase in commodity prices and past expansionary
monetary and fiscal policies, but is expected to decline to 5 percent by the end of the
projection period as fuel and food prices stabilize.
The fiscal balance is projected to register an average surplus of 1 percent of GDP
over the medium term given the limited availability of financing, the government’s
commitment to no new borrowing,4 and the need to continue to make regular debt
service payments. This requires a sharp reduction in spending relative to present
levels.
The current account deficit is expected to decline when gold export receipts
materialize in 2010, offsetting the decline in logging receipts, but is expected to
widen to about 12 percent at the end of the projection period, due mainly to a
substantial pick up in nickel mining related imports financed by FDI inflows.5 The
real effective exchange rate is assumed to be constant.
Aid inflows are expected to drop sharply in 2010, reflecting the current schedule of
donor commitments, but FDI from the mining sector (gold and nickel) is expected to
increase significantly. Given these developments, reserve cover is projected to fall to
about 2½ months of projected imports by 2013, but to increase significantly
thereafter, assuming that nickel production starts in 2014.

4

Under the baseline scenario, the government is assumed to maintain its policy of no new borrowing. However,
starting in 2014, we assume that borrowing to finance development needs will resume, and that the ratio of
external debt to GDP will stabilize at its projected end-2013 level.

5

The Sumitomo Metal Mining Company is expected to invest about US$2 billion in the Solomon Islands, and
plans to start the first phase of nickel production in 2014.

The debt situation has improved further. The Honiara Club initiative resulted in a shortterm moratorium on principal repayments and the forgiveness of interest payments during the
moratorium (0.2 percent of GDP), which expired in 2007. It also allowed for debt forgiveness
and arrears settlement (1.8 percent of GDP) from the Export Finance and Insurance
Corporation (EFIC) subject to the successful completion of an Australia-led review.6 This
review was completed in April 2007 and the debt has been forgiven. The authorities also
settled arrears to foreign creditors amounting to 3.8 percent of GDP, and have been regularly
servicing the bulk of their debt obligations. These developments helped bring down total public
debt to 52 percent of GDP at end-2007, from 64 percent of GDP in 2006.
Debt Sustainability under the Baseline Scenario
The external debt sustainability analysis still provides mixed results (Table 1).7 At end2007, the NPV of external debt to GDP was 38 percent, above its policy-dependent indicative
threshold. However, under the DSA baseline, this ratio is expected to fall below its threshold

6

The Honiara Club is a multilateral forum convened by the government in October 2005 to seek debt relief
from its official creditors. Four creditors participated in the Honiara Club, namely, the Export Finance and
Insurance Corporation (EFIC), the European Commission, the European Investment Bank, and the International
Fund for Agricultural Development.
7

This analysis assumes that the government remains current on all debt obligations from June 2008, and that all
debt in arrears (at end-2007 a total of SI$ 115 million was in arrears, with about SI$24 million each to the EU
and EIB, and SI$12 million to OPEC) are treated as current short-term obligations with NPV equal to face
value.

4
by end-2008 given debt developments this year and high nominal GDP growth.8 All other
indicators, including the ratios of the NPV of debt to exports and revenue, and debt service
ratios, were below their thresholds, and are expected to decline over time. Compared to the
previous joint DSA, debt indicators decline at a faster pace over the medium term due mainly
to higher projected GDP growth.9
The overall central government debt has declined, but remains relatively high (Table 2).
At end-2007, central government domestic debt in nominal terms (including arrears) stood at
14 percent of GDP, well below its 2003 peak of 51 percent. In 2008, it is projected to decline
further to 12 percent of GDP, reflecting the continued regular repayment of existing debt.
Total central government debt in nominal terms is projected to decline from more than
50 percent of GDP in 2007 to 22 percent of GDP in 2013. Nevertheless, the NPV of public
sector debt to revenue, albeit declining, is projected to remain relatively high at an average of
more than 70 percent of revenues during the next six years.
Risks to the Debt Dynamics
There are considerable risks based on stress tests and historical scenarios that reflect
the country’s continued fragile debt position (Tables 3 and 4).
•

External Debt: If key variables revert to their historical averages, then the NPV of
external debt to exports continues to rise, because historical averages for real GDP
and export growth are very low,10 and the 10-year average of nondebt creating flows
is significantly below recent levels. Among the various stress tests, bound test 2
(export growth at its historical average minus one standard deviation) results in the
most extreme increase in both the NPV of debt to exports and the NPV of debt
service to exports due to the high volatility of exports. The most extreme stress test
for the NPV of debt to GDP is bound test B5 (temporary reversion to historical
averages, of real GDP growth, export growth, the U.S. dollar GDP deflator, and net
non-debt creating flows, minus one half a standard deviation).

•

Public Debt: The ratios of the NPV of public debt to GDP and the NPV of public
debt to revenue rise dramatically if GDP growth declines temporarily to its historical

8

The thresholds (see footnote 2) apply to countries with weak policies and institutions, and are discussed in
Operational Framework for Debt Sustainability Analysis in Low Income Countries—Further Considerations.
Although improving, the Solomon Islands’ 3-year average CPIA (2005–2007) of 2.8 remains the lowest among
the Pacific Island Countries.

Real GDP growth was significantly affected by the civil conflict, which resulted in an average growth rate of
negative 4 percent over the period 1997–2002.

5
average (bound test 1). This results in a more than five-fold increase in the current
level of the NPV of public debt to revenue.
In addition, other risks related to the country’s unstable history could materialize.
Given the country’s volatile history and its fragile coalition government, political and
economic instability could materialize. At present, logging accounts for about 65 percent of
export revenues. In 2010, this ratio is expected to drop to about half, and to become
negligible by 2013. Under the baseline scenario, gold export receipts are expected to more
than offset this decline (accounting initially for about 40 percent of export receipts in 2010).
This would prevent reserves from falling below 2½ months of projected imports over the
medium term. But, if gold mining operations are delayed further, it is unlikely that export
earnings (even assuming other nonlogging sectors pickup) can fill the gap created by
declining logging activity. The balance of payments could then come under severe pressure
and reserves could fall rapidly, necessitating difficult economic adjustments and risking the
country’s ability to service its debt obligations.
Caution should be exercised in interpreting these results given uncertainties
surrounding key variables. Macroeconomic variables are subject to large measurement
errors. Donors’ plans are uncertain and contingent liabilities are likely to increase if plans,
including through hiring external managers, to improve the management and operational
efficiency of financially-strapped SOEs are further delayed.11
The authorities should continue efforts to reduce debt and refrain from new borrowing
over the medium term. In view of impending fiscal pressures from declining logging
revenues and committed aid, and the need to sustain progress towards debt sustainability, the
authorities should restore fiscal discipline, settle remaining arrears, and refrain from
incurring new loans, at least until debt sustainability is firmly established. Vigorously
pursuing planned SOE reforms will also be necessary to minimize future contingent
liabilities to the budget.

11

Reported contingent liabilities of SOEs are SI$75 million, but the government has undertaken an extensive
audit program for all SOEs which are expected to further clarify the financial position of this sector.

1/ The public sector covers only the central government. The DSA exercise was conducted jointly with the World Bank.

2/ Current estimate of recognized contingent liabilities. Remaining contingent liabilities are estimated at 4.3 percent of GDP.
3/ Residuals are large in the latter half of the projection period due mainly to the large and volatile FDI from the nickel mining company.
4/ Gross financing need is defined as the primary deficit plus debt service plus the stock of short-term debt at the end of the last period.
5/ Revenues excluding grants.
6/ Debt service is defined as the sum of interest and amortization of medium and long-term debt.
7/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows. The DSA exercise was conducted jointly with the World Bank.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

ANNEX I: SOLOMON ISLANDS—THE AUTHORITIES’ RESPONSE TO RECENT
FUND POLICY ADVICE
Advice from the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Formulate a medium-term national development
strategy (NDS)
Formulate a medium-term budget framework

Actions Taken
The Ministry of Finance is currently consulting
with donors on a draft NDS.
Medium-term fiscal strategy prepared in February
2008.

Save revenue overperformance and limit
expenditures to budgeted levels.
Adjust the reference prices of logs and introduce an
automatic price adjustment mechanism.

Revenue overperformance was spent to finance
expenditures beyond budget levels.
Reference prices were adjusted effective May 1,
2008. Planned additional increase in June 2008
postponed to October 2008. An automatic price
adjustment mechanism has yet to be introduced.
The authorities have not yet decided on the exact
shape of the tax reforms they wish to introduce.
No tangible progress on recommendations from the
Special Audit Report on the Treasury Payroll. The
minimum wage was raised in April 2008, which
would require an increase in wages for some civil
servants.
These were never implemented. The authorities’
strategy has changed. Current plans to strengthen
SIEA management include the hiring of external
managers with the assistance of WB.
No progress.
No progress. The Central Bank’s court-appointed
mandate to oversee DBSI has been extended to
2009.
No progress.
ADB-supported projects to rehabilitate roads and
maritime services are on track and TA is being
provided to improve capacity at the Ministry of
Infrastructure and Development.
Basel I methodology for calculating risk weighted
assets was adopted and the capital adequacy ratio
increased in the fourth quarter 2007. The
classification of banks’ loan portfolios and
provisioning requirements were tightened in
December 2007.
PFTAC has provided technical assistance on
improving external and national income accounts
statistics in 2008, but data quality and timeliness
remain poor.

Continue with preparations towards introducing a
VAT.
Enhance expenditure control through tighter payroll
controls and avoiding generalized civil service
wage increases.

Implementation of SIEA and SIWA management
contracts

Privatize Solomon Airlines
Liquidate the DBSI

Pass the NPF Bill
Continue to upgrade transport infrastructure

Tighten prudential measures

Improve statistical database

Exchange Rate Arrangements:
Since November 2000, the exchange rate for the Solomon Islands (SI) dollar has been based
on an undisclosed trade-weighted basket of the currencies of the Solomon Islands’ major
trading partners, with the U.S. dollar as the intervention currency. During 2002, as pressures
on external reserves intensified, the Central Bank of Solomon Islands (CBSI) accelerated the
rate of currency depreciation, leading to a gradual real depreciation of the SI dollar. Since
December 2002, the CBSI has kept the exchange rate broadly stable against the U.S. dollar,
although there is no public commitment to continue to do so. The Solomon Islands now

4
maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions.

ANNEX III: SOLOMON ISLANDS—SUPPORT FROM THE PACIFIC FINANCIAL TECHNICAL
ASSISTANCE CENTER1
(As of June 2008)
Tax Administration and Policy
A mission in May 2004 designed plans to modernize and enhance the efficiency of the
Customs and Tax Divisions. A further mission in May 2005 reviewed the current system,
outlined a detailed strategy for the implementation of tax reforms over the next few years,
and assessed the required technical assistance to support this strategy. The authorities
released a tax reform proposal in conformity with PFTAC’s advice. A mission in February
2006 assisted the government further with a detailed implementation plan, including
discussions on the policy and design issues in relation to the VAT, income tax and revenue
administration. With assistance from LEG, draft legislation was prepared for the VAT and
Revenue Administration Acts. In December 2006, a mission assisted the authorities in the
preparation of a high-level design and project plan for the implementation of the Business
Revenue Reform, and a follow-up visit took place in early May 2007. A joint FAD-PFTAC
regional mission took place in February-March 2008 and recommended strategies for
addressing future revenue needs, and a follow up visit took place in May 2008. However, the
government’s revenue policy remains to be finalized.
Public Financial Management
In May 2006, the PFTAC adviser undertook a review of the Public Finance and Audit Act
(PFAA; 1978), the Financial Instructions (FI; 1978) and the Stores Instructions (1976; SIs).
The mission agreed with the authorities that the more immediate need was for a process
redesign of the key accounting operations, linked to a significant redraft of the FI. In August
2006, a mission recommended measures to improve accounting operations and installed two
consultants to redraft the FI. A final report was sent to the authorities in January 2007. The
government has indicated that their new AUSDAID/RAMSI advisor will review this in
consultation with PFTAC.

The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) in Suva, Fiji, is a regional technical assistance
institution operated by the IMF with financial support of the Asian Development Bank, Australia, Japan, Korea,
and New Zealand. The Center’s aim is to build skills and institutional capacity for effective economic and
financial management that can be sustained at the national level. Member countries are: Cook Islands,
Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa,
Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.

7
Financial Sector Regulation and Supervision
In September 2004, an advisor visited the CBSI to advise on the implementation of an antimoney laundering regime. A peripatetic advisor visited in January 2005 to assist with
improving the CBSI’s bank supervision department’s database. In April 2005, the PFTAC
advisor worked with an MCM expert to provide assistance in dealing with a failed insurance
company and developing a supervisory framework for insurance companies, provided advice
on the oversight of the National Provident Fund, developed supervisory guidelines on
AML/CFT activities in financial institutions, and prepared a project document for the
establishment of the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). In September 2005, the PFTAC
advisor assisted CBSI staff in conducting an AML/CFT on-site examination of a domestic
bank. CBSI staff also attended a seminar on monetary policy in shallow markets arranged by
PFTAC/MFD in March 2005. In February 2006, the advisor participated in an AML/CFT
awareness training seminar conducted by the CBSI. In November 2006, the CBSI hosted the
annual meeting of the Association of the Financial Supervisors of Pacific Countries. [A
mission in May 2008 provided training to CBSI staff on implementing Basel I and the use of
regulatory reporting forms.]
Economic and Financial Statistics
During 2003, the National Statistics Office (NSO) restarted activity, with the production of
the Honiara CPI. A joint PFTAC/Secretariat of the Pacific Community mission in February
2004 devised a recovery plan, and AusAID and NZAID provided funding for equipment and
a long-term advisor (a former PNG deputy statistician) to help build capacity and also to
coordinate the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES). The CBSI compiles
balance of payments and GDP data and CBSI staff attended a regional training course on
balance of payments statistics arranged by PFTAC in April 2005. Missions in August 2005
and February 2006 reviewed current methodologies for balance of payments and national
accounts statistics and suggested some short-term improvements to their compilation.
Assistance was also provided on a prototype government finance statistics system. In
September 2006, the NSO released the findings of the 2005/06 HIES. In July 2007, a
Monetary and Financial Statistics mission visited to assist the authorities in moving towards
the MFSM 2000 reporting standards. Over the February 2007-May 2008 period, PFTAC
experts assisted the authorities in improving the compilation of balance of payments statistics
and revising the GDP data. Future follow up missions include a CPI rebase and import price
index mission in August-September 2008 and a BOP and IIP statistics mission in early 2009.

ANNEX IV: SOLOMON ISLANDS—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of June 2008)

Since becoming a Bank member in June 1978, the Solomon Islands has received eight IDA
credits totaling US$50 million in the infrastructure, education, health, finance, and
agriculture sectors. Following the repayment of all outstanding arrears in September 2003,
the Solomon Islands came out of nonaccrual status, and country relations have normalized.
The Solomon Islands is eligible for an IDA 14 allocation of SDR 7.3 million (indicative
only) over FY 2006–08. The IDA allocation for FY 07 is SDR 5.2 million.
The Bank’s assistance to the Solomon Islands is motivated by the need for re-engagement in
a low capacity post-conflict country, while recognizing the abundance of donor funds. The
assistance program is guided by the government’s own development priorities articulated in
the National Economic Reform, Recovery, and Development Plan (2003–06), and the Bank’s
broader Pacific Regional Engagement Framework (2005–2009) which has a focus on (i)
strengthening government capabilities, and (ii) improving incentives for the private sector.
The Bank’s involvement in the Solomon Islands is in the following areas:
Strengthening Government Capabilities
•

Health Sector: The government has initiated preparatory steps to move toward a sectorwide approach (SWAp) in the health sector, consistent with the direction that AusAID, as
main donor to the sector, is also moving as indicated in the recent AusAID’s White Paper
on development aid. IDA approved the Health Sector Support Program Technical
Assistance Project worth SDR 1.0 million (US$1.5 million) in March 2008, which will
focus on improving public expenditure management, monitoring performance, and
building management capacity.

•

Education SWAp: The Bank has co-financed a study to support the development of a
National Skills Training Plan. The government has yet to decide on joining the Education
for All Fast Track Initiative (FTI). The Bank is not planning any other major operations
in the education sector at this stage.

Energy Supply: The Bank is supporting the government’s decision to implement a structural
reform program in the electricity sector in order to improve electricity supplies, reduce their
dependence on diesel-fired electricity generation, and provide affordable rural electricity
systems. The government has determined that the best way to improve the performance of
the Solomon Islands Electricity Authority (SIEA) is to improve operational efficiency,
system reliability and financial sustainability of SIEA through: improved financial and
operational management, reduction of losses, improved generator and distribution system
reliability and improved revenue collection. IDA and RAMSI will support the Government

9
by making available an IDA grant to finance the following project components:
Strengthening Management. Engagement of two expatriate line managers (an expatriate
General Manager with a technical background and a Commercialization Manager) and an
overseas Director to be appointed to the Board; Financial Operations. Implementation of a
commercialization program for the Finance Department, including new financial
management and billing systems and preparation and implementation of a new finance
accounting manual with a staff training program, and Technical Operations.
Implementation of a loss reduction program, a planned maintenance program for generation
facilities in Honiara, and a distribution reinforcement program to increase the availability of
existing generation and improve system reliability. Technical project implementation support
to SIEA will also be provided, with consultancy services, a technical training program for
engineering staff, and establishment of a partnership with the Fiji Electricity Authority. The
project is scheduled for World Bank Board approval by June 17, 2008. In preparation for the
implementation of the project, the Government has approved a debt restructuring and cross
liability adjustment scheme where the SIG will forgive SBD 196.0 million in on-lent loans
and SBD 8.5 million in Pay-as-you-earn taxes (PAYE) and custom duties arrears in return for
the SIEA to write off SBD 21 million in SOE and arrears of other government authorities, for
a net total contribution of SBD 183.5 million (US$25.8 million). In addition, the Government
will provide a cash contribution to SIEA of SBD 5 million (US$0.7 million) exemption of
duties and taxes on goods and services financed through the project for a total of US$1.65
million. Based on the debt restructuring and the proposed project, the Bank expects that by
2011, SIEA will be in a position to pay taxes and still be profitable. The GEF supported
regional renewable energy and energy efficiency project has now started operations in
Solomon Islands, two of the major commercial banks are now offering long term loans for
SolarPV equipment, making these accessible to a majority of the population.
Water Sector: The Bank has prepared a Financial Restructuring Plan (FRP) for the Solomon
Islands Water Authority (SIWA). The report provides the government and SIWA Board with
an overview of SIWA's financial position and recommends that the management contract for
the SIEA be extended to cover SIWA. JICA has started to implement a technical
restructuring plan at a cost of US$9 million to be completed in three years time.
•

Rural Growth: The Bank has completed the Agriculture and Rural Development
Strategy (ARDS) which has been disseminated within the country. The Bank launched
the Solomon Islands Rural Development Program (RDP) in February 2008, co-financed
by the EU and RAMSI, and implements the main recommendations of the ARDS.
Implementation started for four provinces and is scheduled to start in 2010 for the
remaining provinces.

10
Improving Incentives for the Private Sector
•

Telecommunications Sector: Τhe Bank is providing grant-funded technical assistance to
the government to examine ways to improve the competitiveness of the sector to reduce
telecommunication costs and improve service quality and coverage, in particular outside
Honiara. Specifically, the Bank is advising the government on: (a) strategic options for
reform, including market liberalization/introduction of competition; (b) preparation of a
new telecommunication law; and (c) development of new sector regulations including for
rural/universal access. The Bank is ready to assist the government to manage the
transition from a monopoly to competition if the Cabinet chooses to renegotiate the
current 15-year exclusive license of the incumbent, Our Telekom, on the occasion of the
first period review in 2008; and if management of Our Telekom is willing to renegotiate
the exclusive license. The Bank is also ready to consider a longer-term program of
technical support—possibly through an IDA grant if the government wishes—for
development of regulatory capacity and a rural access program.

•

Foreign and Domestic Investment: The Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS)
has provided assistance to the government for the preparation of new foreign investment
legislation and with a review of investment incentives and administrative barriers to
business. Preliminary discussions with the Government on the participation of Solomon
Islands in the WBG Pacific Regulatory Simplification and Investment Policy and
Promotion Program are ongoing.

11
ANNEX V: SOLOMON ISLANDS—RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of June 2008)
Since joining AsDB in 1973, Solomon Islands has received 16 loans amounting to
$79.3 million, and 58 technical assistance (TA) projects amounting to $13.85 million.
Solomon Islands is eligible for the Asian Development Fund (ADF) grants available to
countries that are very poor, heavily indebted, or in a post-conflict situation. AsDB approved
ADF grant in the amount of $350,000 in 2006 and $4.95 million in 2007. The 2005–06 and
2006-2008 ADF allocations for Solomon Islands succeeded in catalyzing substantial bilateral
grant cofinancing for the improvement of rural roads and wharves (an additional
$16.5 million in cofinancing from Australia and New Zealand and an additional $4 million in
cofinancing from the European Commission).
AsDB’s country assistance strategy seeks to achieve rapid, pro-poor, private sector-led
economic growth, and focuses on improving transportation infrastructure and services and
the enabling business environment.2 Capacity development and the promotion of good
governance are priorities. AsDB assistance is currently provided entirely on a grant basis
and, in line with government policy, no new lending to the country will be provided until
public finances stabilize.
AsDB has committed substantial support through an ADF grant funded Emergency
Assistance Project to the country in response to a strong earthquake and consequent tsunami
on April 2, 2007, which caused significant damage in Choiseul and Western Provinces. The
project will include the repair of priority unsealed roads and watercourse crossings;
replacement of bridges; reconstruction of wharves and jetties; and reconstruction of the Gizo
town water supply and sanitation system.
AsDB currently has ongoing TA projects in the areas of institutional strengthening of the
Ministry of Infrastructure and Development, inter-island transportation, private sector
participation, business law reform, and secured transactions reform. AsDB’s Post-conflict
Emergency Rehabilitation Project, which helped rehabilitate about 140km of roads and
51 bridges on Guadalcanal and Malaita damaged during the civil conflict (1999–2002) was
completed on 31 March 2008. The Solomon Islands Road Improvement Project, approved in
2006 as an ADF grant with significant bilateral grant cofinancing, helps to rehabilitate roads
and bridges throughout the country to improve rural residents’ access to markets and
economic and social services, promote private sector-led development, foster market

ANNEX VI: SOLOMON ISLANDS—POVERTY AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT INDICATORS
Social indicators of poverty and human development remain low in the Solomon Islands. The
country ranks 129 out of 177 countries in the 2007/08 United Nations Human Development
Index, below all Pacific island countries, except Papua New Guinea. There are few recent
poverty statistics, but anecdotal evidence suggests poverty remains high. However, the more
extreme forms of poverty, such as malnourishment, have remained limited due to an
abundant resource base, assured access to customary land tenure, and resilient social
networks. This advantage is under pressure from a population growth rate that, at about
3 percent a year, is among the highest in the world.3
Results of the 2005–06 HIES indicate that majority of the population do not have access to
basic services such as electricity and water. For example, 86 percent of the population uses
open fire for cooking, 80 percent relies on kerosene lamps as primary source of energy, and
78 percent does not have water piped into their household.
Nonetheless, the Solomon Islands has achieved some progress in improving living conditions
since independence despite falling per capita incomes. Prior to the civil conflict in 1999,
sizable health and education expenditures (at 3–5 percent of GDP each) and high per capita
aid inflows had helped underpin these improvements. Providing widespread and quality
education to the very young population (45 percent under age 15) is a challenge. The primary
education enrollment ratio is about 95 percent, although primary education is not
compulsory. The enrollment ratio is only 30 percent in secondary education. Concerning
health, malaria is rampant, with the highest rate of infection in the world outside of subSaharan Africa, and a third of the rural population lacks access to safe water.
The paucity of data makes an assessment of human development trends since 1999 difficult,
but anecdotal evidence suggests that pro-poor services delivery is improving. The positive
trend was likely either halted or reversed during the civil conflict. While the conflict sharply
reduced agricultural production for market (due to the lack of security and transport
services), this has recovered since mid-2003 and service delivery has been enhanced.
The aggregate social indicators mask large differences between urban and rural areas. The
two main problems in the rural sector are the lack of essential public services such as health
and education, and cash income due to difficulties in market access for rural products. While
the urban areas have better social services and average incomes are higher, the urban poor
face difficulties in securing employment and land for residence.

3

The 2005–06 HIES estimates the average population growth rate at 4.4 percent, but the authorities are
disputing this.

14
The government has committed to monitor progress towards the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs). Achieving the MDGs by 2015 is still possible, but remains a major
challenge. Progress in some areas, such as reducing malaria incidence, maternal mortality,
and ensuring environmental sustainability, has so far been inadequate.

ANNEX VII: SOLOMON ISLANDS—STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance, particularly
for the real, fiscal, and external sectors. Although the National Statistics Office (NSO) is
being rebuilt, the Central Bank of Solomon Islands (CBSI) continues to publish highly
summarized monetary and price data in its Monthly Economic Bulletin and data on all sectors
in its Quarterly Review and Annual Report. There is a Solomon Islands page in IFS, but
significant updating delays occur, particularly for the balance of payments (BOP),
government finance, and national accounts statistics.
Real Sector Statistics
GDP estimates are currently prepared by the CBSI. Despite several TA missions by PFTAC,
GDP estimates remain severely hampered by data availability and quality, and rely on limited
sources (primarily commodity exports and employment estimates). A survey of business
activities for 2003 covering 1,434 businesses was published by the NSO in August 2006,
including employment and financial data for NSO-registered private and government
business enterprises. A 2005–06 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) was
completed in September 2006. Data on production of major export commodities are reported
monthly. No breakdown of GDP by expenditure categories exists.
GDP was rebased to 2004 with the help of a PFTAC advisor in February 2007. More
recently, the May 2008 PFTAC mission provided further assistance in finalizing the 2003
and 2004 National Account estimates, as well as developing preliminary estimates for 2005
and 2006.
The NSO produces the CPI, which currently covers only the capital Honiara. Using the HIES
results, the weights of the Honiara price index were revised in 2007; and the authorities plan
to compile a national CPI measure, which will initially cover major provinces in the near
future. To this end, the NSO has already constructed a list of commodities to be covered by
weight, but the collection of actual price data has yet to commence. Limited data on total
employment can be obtained from the National Provident Fund. Wage data are not compiled.
The Ministry of Tourism, in coordination with NSO, has launched a visitors’ survey in early
2008 to measure tourism spending.
Monetary and Financial Statistics (MFS)
The CBSI publishes monthly MFS in summary form and provides more detailed data in its
quarterly and annual reports. Reporting of monetary statistics to the Fund has improved
recently, but still has a lag of about two months. A November 2005 expert mission, during a
PFTAC monetary statistics workshop held in Fiji, reviewed the collection and compilation
procedures and provided training and a work plan for the CBSI to comply with the

18
methodology of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual and to report data using the
standardized report forms (SRFs). A July 2007 mission found that limited progress had been
made in implementing the 2005 mission’s recommendations due to the high turnover rate of
the CBSI’s monetary statistics team. The mission introduced the SRF for the central bank,
and initiated the development of an integrated monetary database that will meet the data
needs of the CBSI and the Fund. A follow-up mission is scheduled for early 2009 to
introduce the SRF for the other depository corporations based on a soon to be introduced call
report form to collect balance-sheet data from reporting corporations.
Government Finance Statistics (GFS)
The Ministry of Finance (MOF) started monthly press releases on budget outturns in August
2003. However, its expenditure and financing data are not consistent with the GFSM 2001
methodology, and historical data seem unreliable given the breakdown of accounting
mechanisms and large expenditure arrears. The NSO has developed a prototype GFS system,
but problems exist in the coverage of the general government. In particular, data for
provincial governments are unavailable and ongoing audits of state enterprises have yet to be
completed. The authorities started collecting disbursement information on donors’ grants in
2006. The introduction of the Commonwealth Secretariat Debt Recording and Management
System (CS-DRMS) database in the CBSI and MOF in March 2005 has improved the quality
of official debt data, but coordination problems remain. The MOF does not report annual or
subannual GFSM 2001-based data for the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY)
and the International Financial Statistics (IFS), respectively.
External Sector Statistics
The CBSI estimates partial quarterly BOP statistics based on cash foreign exchange
transactions, reported through the banking system, which are available with a three-month
lag. These data are deficient in detail and coverage, and classification problems remain. An
April 2008 PFTAC-TA mission found the Customs trade data lacking in accuracy, helped the
CBSI carry out surveys, and introduced appropriate changes in methodology. As a result, the
BOP data have been revised quite significantly.
Remedial Measures
The NSO is gradually resuming data collection and publication responsibilities, but its
effectiveness continues to be hampered by weak technological skills among its staff and low
survey response rates. The authorities have agreed on an action plan with the recent PFTACTA mission to implement measures to effectively move the responsibility for national
accounts statistics back to the NSO in 2009.

19
Looking forward, the authorities need to focus on a number of statistical issues identified by
various PFTAC-TA missions, including: (i) ensuring that compilation methodologies are
applied consistently for GDP and BOP data; and (ii) collecting prices for additional items in
the CPI, particularly on diesel fuel and telecommunications products. In the area of the BOP,
there is a need to: (i) increase the response rate to enterprise surveys to reduce reliance on
FET records; (ii) investigate alternative data to supplement FET data, including the use of
official transfers data from the government’s financial accounts; and (iii) review the Customs
merchandise trade data.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
the Solomon Islands
On October 20, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Solomon Islands.1
Background
Economic performance has been robust since peace and order was restored in 2003
largely on account of unsustainable logging and aid flows. Real GDP growth averaged
7 percent in the past five years and macroeconomic stability has been maintained.
Despite this stellar growth performance—unprecedented since the country’s
independence in 1978—the Solomon Islands remains the poorest in the region. The
anticipated sharp decline in logging and aid flows poses serious risks to medium-term
fiscal and external sustainability. Moreover, there have been frequent changes in
government which has slowed the pace of critical structural reforms to enhance nonlogging sources of growth.
In 2007, growth accelerated to 10.3 percent, driven mainly by logging and other
emerging sectors (palm oil and services), but is expected to decline to 7 percent in 2008
as logging activity starts to fall. Inflation rose to about 16 percent (3-month moving
average) in June from 10 percent in end-2007, but will likely moderate towards the end
of the year as commodity prices stabilize and recent monetary tightening measures take
hold. Reserve levels remained comfortable at end-2007, but the current account is
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
projected to widen in 2008 due to the deterioration in the terms of trade. Nevertheless,
reserves are likely to remain adequate given continued strong donor inflows, logging
export receipts, and FDI inflows from the mining sector.
After several years of surpluses, the fiscal balance swung to a small deficit in 2007.
Strong revenue performance was overtaken by spending excesses on wages and goods
and services. In 2008, the budget will likely remain expansionary, with a supplementary
budget of nearly 6 percent of GDP passed by parliament recently. This calls for further
monetary tightening to help prevent inflation from becoming entrenched.
Medium-term challenges from declining logging activity and aid flows are daunting and
require accelerating critical reforms. Measures to strengthen the government’s fiscal
position remains slow, although some progress has been made. In particular, a mediumterm fiscal framework has been drafted and the determined price of logs (which is used
for the calculation of logging taxes) has been raised in May 2008. The expected decline
in logging revenue calls for serious efforts to broaden the revenue base, rationalize
fiscal spending, and strengthen the finances of state-owned enterprises to place the
fiscal sector on a more sustainable footing. The debt situation has improved recently,
but remains highly sensitive to a decline in export and GDP growth. Meanwhile, external
sustainability relies solely on the coming on stream of gold production in 2010, after
several delays in commencement owing inter alia to land ownership issues.
Limited progress has been made to stimulate sustained non-logging sources of growth.
The country remains beset with poor infrastructure, land ownership issues, a shortage of
skilled labor, and unreliable and costly basic services. In addition, weak governance
remains a serious concern. Nevertheless, some progress has been made in improving
infrastructure with the help of ADB and enhancing competition in the airline industry.
Other measures are also in the pipeline, including a draft Tribal Land Bill, strengthening
the management of the state-owned electricity company, further improvements in
infrastructure, and enhancing competition in the telecommunications sector.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the Solomon Islands’ continued strong economic growth,
driven mainly by logging activity, but also by a pickup in non-logging activity. However,
Directors noted that inflation has risen as a result of fuel and food price shocks, rapid
private sector credit growth, and an expansionary fiscal stance. Debt indicators are
declining but remain high, and the current account is projected to deteriorate in the near
term because of the terms of trade shock. Over the medium term, the economic outlook
hinges critically on developing non-logging sources of growth and exports to offset the
expected decline in logging activity.
Directors therefore highlighted the urgency of tightening fiscal and monetary policies
and forcefully implementing structural reforms to maintain macroeconomic stability,
safeguard fiscal and external sustainability, and accelerate growth in the non-logging
sectors. In particular, they stressed the importance of ensuring that gold mining
operations start as expected in 2010, to alleviate possible pressure on the balance of

3
payments arising from declining log exports. Directors welcomed the authorities’
commitment not to undertake new external borrowing.
Directors commended the government’s adoption of a medium-term fiscal strategy to
achieve a balanced budget, by both boosting tax revenue and reducing non-priority
expenditure. Efforts to improve tax administration and widen the tax base would be
crucial. Raising the reference price of logs to reflect international market prices and
narrowing ad hoc tax exemptions could make essential contributions. Directors stressed
the need to rationalize civil service employment, contain the government wage bill, and
enhance the efficiency of state-owned enterprises. Better expenditure-control
procedures would keep spending within budgeted levels and foster enhanced budgetary
transparency and accountability.
Directors observed that, while the recent decline in commodity prices would ease
inflationary pressures, further tightening of monetary policy would prevent inflation from
becoming entrenched. They supported efforts by the central bank to rein in excess
liquidity. Directors recommended that the central bank seek to develop financial markets
further and make greater use of interest rate mechanisms of monetary control. To avoid
placing undue burden on monetary policy, fiscal policy needs to play a supportive role,
especially in the near term.
Directors agreed that the real effective exchange rate appears to be broadly in line with
medium-term economic fundamentals. They also considered that the current exchange
rate peg to a basket of currencies has served the country well. Nonetheless, greater
exchange rate flexibility could help encourage export diversification, easing the impact
of the expected decline in log exports.
Directors noted that the turbulence in global financial markets has not had a noticeable
impact on the financial sector in the Solomon Islands. Banks are profitable, liquid, and
well-capitalized, and non-performing loans are low. Nevertheless, banks remain
vulnerable to slower growth especially in the logging sector. Directors therefore advised
the central bank to continue to monitor banking developments closely to ensure that
asset quality remains sound.
Directors commended the various structural reforms being implemented to enhance the
business climate and stimulate the growth of non-logging sectors. They attached high
priority to efforts to improve the infrastructure, allow competition in the airline and
telecommunications industries, address land ownership issues, and lower the cost of
doing business. Directors strongly encouraged the authorities to move quickly on these
reforms.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ continuing efforts to improve the quality and
timeliness of macroeconomic data. They stressed the need to allocate sufficient
resources, ensure adequate staff training, and benefit from continued Fund technical
assistance.
