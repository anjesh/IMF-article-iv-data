ISRAEL
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
March 9, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context. After a strong recovery from the great recession, growth is now slowing. In
this context, a loosening cycle for monetary policy has begun, fiscal automatic
stabilizers are operating—which will imply that the 2012 fiscal balance target is
overshot—and earlier upward pressures on the shekel have abated.
Prospects. The global slowdown is expected to slow Israeli growth to slightly below
trend in 2012, with inflation remaining squarely inside the target range, and the
external current account balance turning slightly negative. Global uncertainty and
regional strains are key risks.
Near-term policy challenges. Fiscal policy should remain focused on medium-term
debt reduction—by adhering to the total spending limits in the 2012 budget and the
ceilings under the expenditure rule for the 2013–14 budget—to underpin sustainability.
Given anchored inflation expectations, monetary policy has scope to offset the effects
of this fiscal action and steps to raise bank capital ratios on output and credit growth.
Policy Framework Recommendations. On the fiscal side: allow for stabilizers in the
fiscal deficit targets and establish a Fiscal Council. On the monetary side: lengthen the
horizon of forecasts, emphasize the mid-point of the inflation target range, and secure
Bank of Israel (BoI) autonomy over its remuneration. On financial stability: establish a
Financial Stability Committee (FSC), strengthen the frameworks for crisis management,
emergency liquidity and early intervention and resolution, and raise required bank
capital ratios.
Macro-social priorities. Participation rates among the Arab-Israeli and Haredi groups
need to rise to tackle poverty and maintain the medium-term growth potential of the
economy. This requires further reform of incentives and labor market institutions.

THE CHALLENGES AHEAD
External and domestic strains cloud the
outlook

economic power―took place in 2011 and
could resurface.

1.
Israel emerged from the 2008–09
global crisis with strong economic growth, a
resilient banking system, and unemployment
at historic lows. In this context, policies were
gradually tightened through mid 2011 (Table 1
and Figures 1 and 2).

4.
And inequality and poverty—both
already high—are set to rise further reflecting
low participation and rapid growth of the
Arab-Israeli and Haredi communities (see SIP
Chapter I).

2.
But the external outlook has again
deteriorated. Although the world economy is
expected to avoid recession―assuming the
euro area crisis is resolved―growth
projections for 2012 and 2013 have been
marked down substantially. And regional
tensions have also risen (Annex I).
3.
In addition, extensive peaceful social
protests―in part reflecting a decade of
stagnant real wages and concentration of

Exports, at 40 percent of GDP, depend
on global demand for high-technology
products, such as electronics and
pharmaceuticals, and communications. One
third of exports go directly to Europe, with
more routed there indirectly. But if global
weakness is reflected in international oil prices,
this will help as Israel is a large net energy
importer.

Links through the financial sector are
limited. Banks’ cross border activities are
moderate: their total foreign assets and
liabilities amount to 10 percent and 14 percent
of GDP, respectively, with negligible direct
exposures to peripheral advanced European
countries. And, operations of foreign-owned
financial institutions in Israel are negligible.
Likewise, wholesale funding of banks is low,
but stress will likely appear from the domestic
corporate bond market (Figure 3).
7.
Given the country’s weak direct trade
linkages to the region, regional tensions
mainly affect Israel through security, investor
and consumer confidence, and via the public
finances.

Similarly, social pressures mainly affect
fiscal choices, on taxation and spending. The
“Trajtenberg Committee” (Box 1), set up to
help the government plan a response to the
social protests, has made a range of proposals
for taxation and spending adjustments, most
of which have been approved by the Knesset.
9.
If continued, participation and
demographic trends in minority communities
will soon significantly lower the potential
growth of the economy, with implications for
overall income growth, inequality, and fiscal
sustainability.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

ISRAEL

IS ISRAEL PREPARED?
Israel has strong fundamentals
10.
Externally, foreign exchange reserves
have increased steadily since 2008 to reach
$77 billion, some 10 months of total imports,
and above 130 percent of short-term external
debt. For the first time over the last two
decades, the net international investment
position has turned to a surplus (6 percent of
GDP, Tables 2 and 3).
11.
Institutional frameworks are also
strong.
12.
In particular, Israel’s new fiscal rule,
embedded in the 2010 Deficit Reduction and
Budgetary Expenditure Limitation Law, and
reflected in the 2011-12 “two year” budget,
comprises two disciplinary elements:


The expenditure rule adjusts the cap on
real expenditure growth as public debt
approaches 60 percent of GDP.



The headline budget deficit is targeted to
fall to 2, 1½, and 1 percent of GDP in 2012,
2013, and 2014 respectively.

13.
Furthermore, Central Bank legislation
has been reinforced. The 2010 Bank of Israel
(BoI) Law now stipulates price stability as the
primary objective of monetary policy, and has
strengthened the BoI’s autonomy,
transparency, and governance.
14.
The FSAP Update, conducted as part of
this consultation, concludes that the financial
system is stable, with the BoI maintaining
strongly proactive supervisory practices, which
have preempted the systemic risks seen
elsewhere (Figure 4 and Tables 4 and 5).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15.
Israel also enjoys the option to issue
sovereign bonds under Section 502(7) of the
US Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990. While
only some 7½ percent of Israeli public debt is
currently covered by these guarantees—some
40 percent is untapped—, and further use of
the scheme is subject to key formal limits, the
guarantees provide contingent reassurance.
16.
Moreover, following recent discoveries
of new natural gas fields, the total estimated
value of which is some 50 percent of 2011
GDP, Israel will become a net energy exporter
in coming years. Looking ahead, the taxation
of natural resources has been rationalized, and
provisions are being made to place the
proceeds in a sovereign wealth fund.
17.
This overall assessment of
fundamentals is reflected in Standard & Poor’s
rating upgrade from A to A+ on long-term
foreign currency credit rating in
September 2011. CDS spreads on the
sovereigns have risen somewhat recently, but
remain far below those of the stressed
European countries.

And economic performance was strong in
2010 and into 2011
18.
Output rebounded quickly from the
global downturn as early as 2009 Q2, with
growth of ¾ percent in 2009 and 4¾ percent
in 2010. This was initially led by a pick-up in
exports and private consumption, with a
strong recovery in investment.

This was also quickly reflected in a
return of employment to pre global crisis
levels. The unemployment rate fell to a
historical-low of 5½ percent, and wage
pressures remained moderate, in part
reflecting the increased entry of lower-wage
earners. Unit labor cost growth was flat
in 2011. But participation rates remain very
low around 56–58 percent.

Macroeconomic policies were adjusted
appropriately given the resumption of
growth during 2009
20.
On the fiscal side, the 2010 overall
balance strengthened by 1½ percentage
points of GDP (Table 6).
21.
As domestic demand recovered and
inflationary pressures and regional tensions
began rising, the BoI began a tightening cycle
in September 2009, raising the policy interest
rate from 0.5 percent to 3.25 percent by June
2011 (Figure 5). These steps were supported
by the adoption of macroprudential actions
targeted at the housing market (Box 2).
Though the CPI inflation was above its target
band for much of 2011, the tightening helped
bring it back within the target range later in
the year.
22.
However, widening interest rate
differentials vis-à-vis the United States and the
euro zone alongside a resumption of “safe
haven” flows led to large short-term capital
inflows and significant shekel appreciation. In
response, the BoI resumed intervention in

capital control and macroprudential policy
measures, such as the introduction of reserve
requirements on banks’ derivative transactions
with non-residents, new reporting
requirements on foreign exchange swaps and
derivatives, and the abolition of tax exemption
for non-residents’ investments in BoI securities
and treasuries.

Throughout, the shekel was slightly on

While the two-year 2011–12 budget
was prepared on the basis of further fiscal
consolidation, the slowdown in the latter half
of 2011 resulted in lower than anticipated

The poverty rate, among the highest in

And key concerns with preparedness for
an adverse global environment remain
28.
On the fiscal front, public debt is high,
at some 75 percent of GDP. And securityrelated expenditure—typically running at some
7 percent of GDP—constrains room for
maneuver (Table 4).
29.
Revenue shortfalls are anticipated to
continue into 2012. The authorities now
project the deficit to be 3.4 percent of GDP (in
line with staff forecasts), exceeding the 2
percent deficit target.
30.
Furthermore, the housing market
remains vulnerable (Figure 6). Though prices
have recently plateaued after over a 50 percent
increase since 2007―it is unclear if this heralds

31.
In this context, Israeli share prices have
fallen faster than in advanced countries, and
volatility in foreign exchange markets has
again risen.
32.
These strains are most apparent in the
Israeli corporate bond market—that seized up
in 2009. Spreads have risen, particularly in real
estate and holding companies, and bond
financing has dropped again in recent
quarters.

On balance, however, Israel is unlikely to
experience a severe downturn in the near
term
33.
As a baseline scenario, given the
external slowdown projected, staff expect real
GDP growth to fall to 2.9 percent in 2012 and
rebound to 3.8 percent in 2013, its staffestimated potential rate. Exports will be the
main channel, weakening and then leading the
subsequent recovery―albeit recovering more
slowly than after the 2008 downturn. Absent a
major global crisis, private consumption and
investment are projected to be resilient
throughout, reflecting capacity constraints, low
unemployment, and supportive macrofinancial
policies.
34.
The baseline scenario implies that the
output gap will turn slightly negative in 2012,
and will gradually close as the economy
rebounds. CPI inflation will remain within the
target band, reflecting soft domestic demand
alongside stable global energy and commodity
prices.

But risks—notably to the downside—remain significant
35.
Early resolution of the Euro area crisis
and stronger-than expected global growth
would buoy prospects. But persistent Euro
strains and the associated drag on global
output represent more likely downside risks to
the Israeli outlook, with regional tensions, a

resumption of domestic social protests, and
the possibility of early national elections all
compounding these challenges to growth and
to delivery of strong macroeconomic policies.

ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGES
With global strains rising, the key task is to maintain growth momentum while
strengthening resilience to downside external shocks. With the output gap opening
slightly and automatic stabilizers given free rein, fiscal policy should remain focused on
debt reduction over the medium term and on strengthening social inclusion. In this
context, monetary policy has room for maneuver, and is thus in a position to alleviate the
impact on growth of steady fiscal withdrawal. The FSAP update proposed various steps to
strengthen the financial sector.

A. Fiscal Policy and Framework
The 2012 budget deficit is expected to
overshoot the original target significantly

Revenue for 2011 is below budget
estimates. This reflects shortfalls relative to
projections of:



VAT (due to the deceleration in private
consumption);
capital gains receipts (due to sharp falls in
stock prices);
real estate taxes (due to lower
transactions); and
fuel and energy excise hikes (due to
cancellation of planned rises).

37.
Thus, although expenditure was
slightly lower than the budget in 2011, the
budget deficit was 3.3 percent of GDP,
somewhat above the 3 percent target.
38.
These revenue shortfalls relative to
official projections appear largely to reflect
overoptimistic estimates. In particular, the
outturns imply revenue ratios close to those in
2009 and 2010. Thus hoped for revenue
increases did not materialize. But overall, with
the possible exception of the yield from
corporate taxation—where strong economic
growth does not seem to be reflected in 2011
receipts—there is no evidence that the 2011
shortfalls are rooted in major structural
problems with the revenue base.
39.
Thus, the outlook for overall revenue
ratios in 2012 is similar to that for 2011,
implying an additional shortfall in 2012 of
revenue relative to the two-year budget
projections.

With expenditure ceilings for 2012
already set out in the approved two-year
2011–12 budget, and given staff growth and
associated revenue projections, the deficit
outturn for 2012 is projected at around 3.4
percent of GDP, exceeding the target by
almost 1½ percentage points of GDP.

The top priority of fiscal policy is to keep
public debt on a downward track over the
medium-term
41.
This will maintain confidence in Israel
despite strained international markets, and so
allow some flexibility in the deficit path in the
short term (Box 5).
42.
This critical task has become
considerably more difficult. Near-term global
and Israeli growth projections have been
marked down, and so the 2012 budget is set
to overshoot its deficit projection.
Furthermore, a surge in retirements in coming
years will reduce the growth of Israeli
productive capacity to below the norms of the
past decade. Social concern with prices will
constrain options to raise indirect taxation.
Calls for added public spending—including for

social needs and security—have mounted.1
Unfunded fiscal commitments of some ¾ of a
percentage point of GDP for 2012 have to be
resolved within the 2012 budget framework.
43.
Accordingly, the authorities'
commitment to maintain the total spending
limits in the 2012 budget is welcome, as is the
Trajtenberg committee’s determination to
observe these and the medium-term spending
limits. Alongside the decision to withdraw
plans for phased reductions in direct tax rates,
these actions have helped to underpin
continued investor confidence in the Israeli
sovereign in a difficult global environment.
And they allow scope to let the automatic
stabilizers operate on the revenue side in 2012.
44.
But more is needed—in particular, a
decisive effort to approach the 2013 budget
deficit ceiling should be made. This will require
contributions from all sides—from expenditure
restraint including defense to keep total
spending within the ceiling, new initiatives to
raise revenues, and efforts to strengthen the
productive potential of the economy.
45.
Even so, unless the outlook for activity
and revenues improves markedly in coming
months, a full return to the headline target for
2013 would be unduly contractionary. Final
determination of the appropriate 2013-14
targets for the fiscal balance should be made
before mid-2012 reflecting domestic and
global developments at that time.

1

Defense spending may also rise further following the
recent Supreme Court ruling that the exemption of
Haredi men from military service is unconstitutional.
This could lead to an unbudgeted surge in recruits,
although the pace and scale of such developments will
be determined in due course as part of a broader
response by the authorities to the ruling.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

46.
This change in the 2013 deficit target
will need to be accompanied by a further
strengthening of the fiscal rules and
frameworks. Given commitment to the
expenditure rule, there will likely need to be a
reset of the path of targets for the deficit
ceiling. Options for that include clarification
that the path will be adjusted for automatic
stabilizers. Alongside, and in response to the
mounting difficulty of securing medium-term
debt reduction, the establishment of a
permanent and independent Fiscal Council to
assess whether overall fiscal policies are
consistent with debt reduction may help to
secure that goal.
47.
Following the approval of the Knesset
of the arrangements for taxation of natural
resources, as recommended by the Sheshinski
committee, the authorities are finalizing
arrangements for the sovereign wealth fund.
This should follow international best practice,
including assigning all relevant proceeds to the
fund, and in regard to the management
arrangements it will follow and the size of
transfers back to general revenues.
48.
In this context, even with expenditure
restraint fully playing its appropriate role, there
is a good case for deficit-reducing
discretionary fiscal policy actions to focus on
taxation, over the near and medium terms. Key
non-security spending items―such as health
and education―are around levels of
moderate-spending OECD peers (see SIP
Chapter II). And in some areas, there is need
for increases, notably in education and public
investment, including in the Arab-Israeli
communities. So scope for additional overall
spending compression on a significant scale is
not apparent. On the other hand, with the VAT
rate at only 16 percent—albeit with few
exemptions—and given the priority attached

ISRAEL

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Strengthening medium-term expenditure
planning will add credibility

to strengthening environmental and housing
taxation, revenue increases in these areas
alongside curbs to tax expenditures could
reinforce the credibility of plans to lower
public debt.

50.
Continued expenditure restraint will be
required––on both the civilian and defense
sides, notably because government-approved
undertakings exceed the ceilings implied by
the fiscal rule. This perennial gap reflects
longstanding shortfalls in medium-term
expenditure planning mechanisms. As
recommended in the 2010 Article IV
consultation, and as is best practice in the
OECD, a comprehensive institutional
framework—including fiscal responsibility laws,
a medium-term macro-fiscal framework, and a
medium-term expenditure framework—is
needed.

49.
Although Israel has not exercised its
option to issue debt under the longstanding
US government guarantee scheme over recent
years, it has provided additional reassurance in
an environment of heightened sovereign risk.
There is a good case to seek extension of this
scheme when it expires in September 2012,
and given heightened global risks, to seek to
raise its limits.

ease towards and even beyond the mid-point
of the inflation target range.
54.
But three factors warrant close
attention.


First, wage pressures. While unit labor
costs have been stable—with wage growth
matching a productivity surge after the
2009 downturn—pressures could mount.
In particular, following increases of 2 ½
percent in the minimum wage in early
2011, rises of 8.9 percent are anticipated
for October 2012. And if fiscal adjustment
measures include increases in indirect tax
rates, this could trigger wage pressures,
with implications for inflation. Cooperation
by wage setters to maintain stability will be
essential to avoid this.



Second, house prices. While it is unclear if
house prices are misaligned, abrupt
corrections would pose limited risks to
financial stability but could destabilize
domestic demand. Conversely, monetary
relaxation could also reignite the market,
although the transmission between the
discount and mortgage rates has been
attenuated by recent macro prudential
measures aimed at reducing the
proportion of new variable-rate secured
loans to total loans. Measures to smooth
the supply of land for housing over time,
and steps to increase the taxation of
second properties, backed up by additional
macro prudential steps if necessary, would
help de-link further changes in the policy
rate from house price inflation.



Third, phased anticipated increases in the
required minima for banks’ core Tier 1
capital, possibly compounded by strains in

Headline CPI, which exceeded the 1–3
percent target range during the first half of
2011, has returned within the target range.
While longer-term inflation expectations have
remained stable and on target, near-term
inflation expectations have dropped sharply
towards the mid-point of the range since Fall
2011.
52.
This reflects various opposing forces:
upward pressure due to a narrowing output
gap; and downward pressures reflecting a
sharp decline in global food prices, reduced
retail mark-ups following the summer social
protests, and (until recently) a strong
exchange rate.

the corporate bond market, and the
recommended strong fiscal stance could
slow both credit growth and activity. Thus,
given lags, monetary policy should
anticipate and offset these effects, once
they are adopted. And if global tail risks
materialize, there would be scope for more
aggressive interest rate reductions.

The monetary and exchange rate
frameworks have been strengthened
55.
The adoption of a new BoI Law in 2012
has more formally entrenched inflation
targeting as the monetary regime in Israel.
However, there are a number of ways in which
implementation might be strengthened.
Options include emphasizing the mid-point of
the inflation target range as the goal for policy;
lengthening the horizon of published inflation
and GDP forecasts; and providing more and
more systematic public information on the
Bank’s forecasting technology. And, the
arrangements for remuneration of Bank of
Israel staff should be reviewed making this the
Bank’s remit alone to guarantee full budgetary
autonomy—as in other inflation-targeting
central banks—to secure the independence of
the central bank (see SIP Chapter III).
56.
The floating exchange rate regime
remains appropriate. Though the switch from
freely floating to floating which occurred in
2008 marked a break with a decade of
practice, it proved an effective response to the
disturbed global environment—notably
because the new regime was mainly aimed at
addressing disorder in the foreign exchange
market rather than at affecting the trend. As
inflation pressures have eased and markets
have begun anticipating interest rate cuts,
upward pressures on the shekel have eased
and discretionary intervention has not

Looking ahead, the monetary regime
should continue to emphasize the policy rate
instrument, with intervention playing a
secondary role. In the case that strong safehaven inflows resume, a mix of expansionary
monetary policy and tighter fiscal policy will be
appropriate. Should these measures not suffice
to maintain orderly markets, intervention and
additional administrative controls on foreign
currency transactions can be considered, but if
so, exit strategies from use of all these
instruments should be prepared.

Various factors underpin that
assessment:


Households’ balance sheets appear strong:
despite the housing boom, household
leverage has not increased even as their
financial assets appreciated in recent years
(Figure 7). Recourse-style mortgages,
banks’ close customer relationships, and
proactive BOI regulations on LTV ratios
and variable rate loans all kept loan losses
low. Corporate borrowing from abroad is
also modest (about 15 percent of GDP).



Commercial banks’ largest borrowers,
typically conglomerates groups, have
diversified business activities, and the BOI
has strengthened supervision of
concentration risk. Banks have negligible
direct exposure to European sovereign,
bank, and nonfinancial sector credit risks.



Policy to secure bank stability has long
emphasized highly proactive supervision as
the core instrument, a practice now being
adopted more widely internationally. And
banks are overwhelmingly deposit funded,
backed by strong implicit public deposit
guarantees, minimizing liquidity risks.

Regulation of nonbanks and financial
products has been strengthened (Figure 8
and Table 7). In insurance, the policy

CMISD has been substantially upgraded
since 2008. And in securities markets,
following the Hodek Committee’s
recommendations of early 2011, the
Companies Law was amended in August
2011 to improve the quality and timeliness
of disclosure, and corporate governance
requirements.

61.
With this background, the stress tests
conducted under the FSAP Update suggest
that the effect on financial institutions of a
major shock would be considerable but
manageable.2 A scenario more severe than
that seen in 2008-09 would erode some banks’
capital significantly, but could recover quickly
if earnings are retained. Liquidity stress tests
likewise are broadly comforting. Stress tests
for insurance and long-term savings funds also
confirm that institutions and policy holders
have sufficient buffers to cope with strong
shocks.

In light of the FSAP assessment and the
downside tail scenario, several steps are
recommended.
Bank capital requirements
64.
As the banking sector develops,
proactive supervision needs to be reinforced
by higher quality capital. Tail risks associated

with large borrower groups and the
concentrated structure of the banking sector
reinforce this case. Focus should be on raising
core Tier 1 capital, with some dilution of
controlling shareholders if that is necessary to
secure equity increases. The authorities are
considering plans to do this.

Liquidity requirements
65.
The BOI has already moved to tighten
its regulation on liquidity management, but
this is an area where international practice is
fast evolving in the aftermath of the global
crisis; the BOI will need to keep its regulations
and practice up to date.
Non-bank financial sector supervision
66.
Improving cross-border oversight, and
the supervision of groups connected to
insurance companies—in particular related
holding companies—are among the priorities.
For securities markets, enforcing high
standards of due diligence in the underwriting
of securities issues and closing the gap by
bringing all unregulated broker dealers into
regulatory periphery.

does not resolve apparent impediments for ex
ante cooperation among the supervisory
agencies, current architectural arrangements
may need to change to secure that goal.
Crisis management
69.
A comprehensive review of crisis
management framework should be conducted,
before a major disturbance occurs. Several
elements need to be integrated:


The BOI’s emergency liquidity assistance
framework should be more fully articulated
so as to facilitate quick action when
needed, but also protecting the BOI from
taking on undue risks.



The legal framework for BOI’s early
intervention powers and instruments
should be strengthened, and a special
bank resolution framework should be
established.



A financial support mechanism for
resolution is needed. Several possibilities
are available (such as several versions of a
resolution fund and deposit guarantee
scheme), but in any case there needs to be
some government rather than central bank
back-stop for what is an essentially fiscal
issue.



A study of the implications of Israel
“pyramid corporate” structures for the
origination and transmission of stress in
markets is needed. The results should
guide supervision policies, and the
implementation of proposals from the
“Concentration Committee” on reform of
corporate structures.

Supervisory coordination and macroprudential
oversight
67.
The institutional framework for
cooperation among supervisory agencies has
not been fully developed. While ex post, in mid
2008–09 crisis, cooperation between all the
relevant agencies was frequent and
substantive, ex ante it was considerably less so,
greatly hampering preparedness. A Financial
Stability Group consisting of representatives
from the BoI, the CMISD, and the Israel
Securities Authority, was set up in the mid2011. But key operational issues remain,
including those arising from the diverse
mandates of the agencies involved, which
complicate the sharing of information, the
coordination of diagnostic analysis, and policy
actions—including macro-prudential policies.

establishment of a more formal standing

reflecting Arab-Israeli women and Haredi
(Ultra Orthodox) men. The wage levels of
overall Arab and Haredi workers are lower than
other Israeli groups, and both communities
consequently experience high incidence of
poverty. If the employment and wage in their
communities were on a par with others, Israel
output would be some 15 percent higher than
it is, and annual fiscal revenues would also be
higher than they are by some 5 percent of
GDP. These participation issues are
macroeconomic in scale.
71.
Both communities want work, and
both should be facilitated to realize that goal.
Necessary steps include provision of basic
child care and transportation in the Arab areas,
arrangements for inclusion of Haredi males in
the armed forces in ways that support their
employment and productive potential, and
action to remove impediments to business
establishment in both communities. Both
groups also need their particular education

requirements to be addressed, notably
equalization of education provision at all levels
in Arab-Israeli communities with that
elsewhere, and focused provision of adult
education to address Haredi needs. And social
benefits to both groups, including child care,
should be increasingly tied to employment.
72.
A number of official initiatives to
address the needs of these "currently" minority
populations are underway—alongside the
many ongoing private initiatives. These include
targets for participation, extension of the
earned income tax credit, establishment of a
proactive unit for Arab affairs in the Prime
Minister's office, and expansion of Haredi units
in the defense forces. And the recent Supreme
Court ruling against Haredi exemption from
military service has made a decisive resolution
of these issues even more urgent. Accordingly,
as well as upgraded enforcement of anti
discrimination legislation and basic labor
regulations, much more is needed. This has
implications, as noted, for additional spending,
particularly education and public investment.
Early and substantive progress will require
strong leadership from all sides—and great
political dexterity.

THE AUTHORITIES' VIEWS
73.
The authorities agreed with the overall
assessment of economic developments and
the implications for policy including in the
financial sector. They underscored need for
maintenance of the 2012 expenditure ceiling
and commitment to the expenditure rule for
the 2013–14 budget. They recognized that
while the deficit targets for 2012 and 2013
could be missed, this in large part reflected
automatic stabilizers appropriately operating.

This, and the recent relaxation of monetary
policy would support near term growth, with
macroprudential measures in place to stabilize
the housing market. Policymakers stand ready
to adjust fiscal and monetary policy settings in
the event of a major global shock. And the
authorities agreed on the need to raise labor
participation rates.

74.
Within that overall agreement,
however, some differences of emphasis were
noted.
Fiscal Policy and Framework
75.
The authorities have decided not to
increase the rate of VAT further at this stage.
This reflects in part the concerns over the
increase in the cost of living, and that the VAT,
unlike many elsewhere, has few exemptions,
but all options remain on the table.
76.
Furthermore, in February 2012 the
government approved the general framework
of principles for the sovereign wealth fund,
under which withdrawals from the fund will be
restricted to the regular annual transfer to the
budget based on long term yields.
77.
The authorities indicated that they
would explore the option of extending the
existing US guarantee scheme as one element
of their broader efforts to reassure markets of
their commitment to fiscal stability. However,
they did not see need at this stage to seek to
raise the limits under the scheme.
78.
The authorities also do not see a
compelling case to establish a Fiscal Council.
They regard the scrutiny by international
agencies, the BoI, local experts, rating
agencies, and investment banks as providing a
sufficient degree of oversight. However, the
idea would remain under review.
Monetary Policy and Framework
79.
The authorities emphasized that they
regard the current stance of policy as
appropriately weighing upside and downside
risks, while maintaining "sufficient firepower in
reserve" to respond to possible adverse
shocks. However, they agreed that their

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

assessments would adjust in light of fiscal and
supervisory initiatives, once these were
adopted. They noted that the decrease in
intervention over time essentially had
constituted an exit strategy. It remains an
option in line with the announced policy in
cases of disorderly markets or significant
departure from economic fundamentals.
80.
They noted that while a number of
developments to the inflation targeting
framework could be considered, any change
should be gradual and reflect local
circumstances, given no ‘first best” model of
inflation targeting.
81.
The BoI noted concerns with the
current arrangement, regarding the
remuneration and contractual conditions for
its staff. However, the fiscal authorities
emphasized need for those arrangements to
be consistent not only with private sector but
also with public sector arrangements.
Accordingly, the current arrangement for the
BoI would remain in place.
Financial policy
82.
The authorities are considering a
number of options for the operation of the
proposed FSC. Their inclination, rather than to
move directly to formalizing the arrangement,
is to "learn by doing" first, and to design a
formal arrangement in light of lessons learned.
At present, cooperation between the
regulators has improved notably, in terms of
both consultation and information flows:
however, the need to prepare for effective
crisis management (even given the relative
safety and soundness of Israel's financial
system) requires an improvement in the pace
and intensity of this cooperation, especially
regarding the development of microbased information flows on institutional inter-

ISRAEL

connectedness (network diagrams) and related
stress tests that include contagion risks.3 The
BoI noted the lack of emphasis on these
important points in the FSAP and the Article IV
papers.
Labor participation
83.
While agreeing that this matter is
essential, the authorities also emphasized that

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

cultural issues and low job market skills restrict
participation in the labor market. They noted
early signs that these matters are responding
to an adjustment in incentives, and that
dialogue with all communities would continue.
And as part of the need for flexibility on all
sides, the authorities emphasized need for the
adoption of more of the core curriculum
across all schools, and increased enforcement
of anti-discrimination legislation.

STAFF APPRAISAL
84.
Israel's economy remains strong.
Growth has been robust with fixed investment
rising more recently, unemployment is at a
historic low, while inflation and inflation
expectations are squarely inside the 1–3
percent target range. The shekel is now
broadly consistent with fundamentals and
international reserves are appropriate by most
measures. These successes reflect strong
policy frameworks.3
85.
But vulnerabilities remain and growth
is slowing. Public debt and security
expenditures are high, house prices have
surged by over 50 percent in recent years, and
poverty is elevated. And risk premia in the
corporate bond market have risen significantly.
86.
Given the prompt accommodative
policy response to signs of slowdown, a severe
downturn is unlikely. The Bank of Israel
reversed its tightening cycle from September
2011, and automatic stabilizers are operating
fully. Accordingly, GDP growth is projected to
decline to a little below 3 percent before
returning to trend at 3¾ percent in 2013, with
both sides of this cycle led by exports.
3

See Moretti, M., et al, “Stress Testing at the IMF,” IMF
WP 08/206.

87.
Nevertheless, policies and policy
frameworks should all be adjusted further to
better anticipate the risks, as elaborated below.
88.
On the fiscal side, medium-term debt
reduction remains the top priority. This
requires firm adherence to the total spending
limits in the 2012 budget and a decisive effort
to approach the 2013 budget deficit ceiling.
Discretionary fiscal actions to this end should
focus on taxation, given limited scope for
overall compression of spending
89.
But a full return to the headline target
for 2013 would be unduly contractionary. The
target should be adjusted, as part of a broader
suite of reforms to the fiscal framework,
including specification that the deficit path will
be adjusted for automatic stabilizers,
confirmation that natural resource revenues
will be placed in a well-managed sovereign
wealth fund, and establishment of an
independent Fiscal Council.
90.
The monetary stance is broadly
appropriate under the baseline projections,
but the recommended fiscal and financial
stability policies would create scope for further
relaxation. In particular, phased increases in
the required minima for core tier 1 bank
capital, and the strong fiscal stance

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

ISRAEL

recommended could slow activity—which
monetary policy should anticipate. Any
remaining concerns with renewed housing
inflation should be addressed with
macroprudential tools.
91.
Alongside, the monetary framework
should continue to be enhanced. Options
include lengthening the horizon of published
inflation and GDP forecasts, and increased
emphasis on the mid-point of the inflation
target range as the goal for policy. In this
connection, the arrangements for
remuneration of Bank of Israel staff should be
reviewed as they raise concerns with effective
independence of monetary and supervisory
policy.
92.
Furthermore, with the shekel broadly at
its equilibrium, a de facto free floating
exchange rate regime should be maintained.
But the option to intervene to sustain orderly
conditions, if necessary, is appropriately
warranted.
93.
On the financial stability side, “normal”
risks appear contained. Banks and other
financial institutions would likely be able to
withstand even a severe downturn including a
domestic housing crash, and heightened credit
risk in the corporate sector.
94.
Nevertheless further steps are
warranted, including plans to raise bank capital
ratios and to strengthen liquidity requirements
in accord with Basle III. A stronger financial
crisis management framework and
preparations for shocks outside of historical
experience should be implemented. The use of

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

the BoI’s emergency liquidity facilities and the
legal framework for early intervention and
resolution powers should both be reviewed
urgently. The risks arising from the bankruptcy
of one or more of the large corporate groups
should be studied. And finally, the
establishment of an FSC—comprising all the
main supervisors—could help substantially in
facilitating a more systemic approach to
financial sector policy. But if this FSC does not
succeed in addressing coordination challenges
amongst supervisors, the architectural layout
of financial sector supervisors may need to be
recast.
95.
But even with all this, stability in Israel
in the long run will not be assured unless labor
participation rates—notably the Arab-Israeli
and Haredi communities—are raised. These
exact a heavy toll on output, fiscal revenues,
and inequality, and this toll is set to rise as the
share of these populations rises towards half in
coming decades. Actions needed include
provision of basic child care and
transportation, accommodation for both
groups in the defense/civic services, business
establishment in both communities, and
imaginative reform of education. And social
benefits to both groups, including child care,
should be increasingly tied to employment.
Steps are underway in this direction, but much
more is needed to secure the long-term
sustainability of the Israeli economy, and with
it, the welfare of all of its citizens.
96.
Staff recommends that Israel should
remain on the standard 12-month consultation
cycle.

Box 1. 2011 Social Protest and the Trajtenberg Committee Recommendations
In July 2011, a nationwide protest movement
happened, initially focused on rising house prices,
but subsequently encompassing broader social
issues and the cost of living. Protestors, pitching
tents in main streets in large cities such as Tel Aviv,
demanded lower indirect and higher direct taxes,
free education and childcare, suspension of
privatization, and investment in social housing and
public transport. Though initially small, their

numbers swelled to some 400,000 (five percent of
the population) and they stayed through September.
The Trajtenberg committee, which the government
established to address issues raised recommended
several measures that have budgetary implications.
On December 6, 2011, the Knesset passed legislative

Box 2. Measures to Stabilize the Real Estate Sector

August 2009: A regulatory alert for caution
in extending adjustable rate housing loans.
Intended to reduce potential losses in case of
borrower’s payback difficulties as a result of an
increase in interest rate.


May 2011: limiting the adjustable-interestrate component of housing loans to 1/3 of the
total loan. Intended to reduce the likelihood that
borrowers’ repayment ability would impaired as
interest rates rise.


March 2010: New treatment for credit to a
“purchasing group”—individuals who organize
themselves for the joint purchase of land rights
in part to get tax benefits. Credit allocated to
purchasing groups must be classified as
“construction and real estate” credits that
embed higher risk. Intended to reflect the true
risk inherent in the business.


Detailed reporting requirement on
residential mortgage loans including: loan-tovalue, payment-to-income etc.

July 2010: Supplemental reserve for high
leveraged housing loans. Additional reserve of
at least 0.75 percent for new loans with loan-tovalue (LTV) ratio exceeding 60 percent–intended
to increase bank reserves to absorb losses when
adverse developments in the housing market
and real economy occurs.


October 2010: higher capital requirements
for high leveraged housing loans. Applying a
risk-weighted factor of 100 percent for housing
loans where the amount indexed to a floating
interest rate is over 25 percent & LTV of at least
60 percent. This regulation does not apply to
loans less than NIS 800,000.

portfolio; enhancing supervision of banks
practices (off-site and on-site) and a monthly
monitoring of developments in consumer
market and residential mortgage loans’ market;
and enhancing BOI cooperation with the

Construction & Housing concerning the
residential housing market and its potential
impact on financial stability.

Increasing the supply of land by Israel Land
Authority, and raising taxation of the second

Box 3.: BoI Foreign Exchange Policy 2010–11
After a long period without intervention, the BoI
resumed the purchase of foreign currency from
March 2008, in an effort to moderate the pace of
currency appreciation and maintain orderly
conditions in markets. However, no purchases have
been made since August 2011. Over this period, the
shekel has weakened against the dollar, sliding by
more than 9 percent.


The Bank also announced the imposition of
a 10 percent reserve requirement on
nonresidents’ NIS/foreign currency swap
transactions and foreign currency forwards. This
was done to reduce the profitability of
nonresidents’ short-term capital inflow into
Israel, and thereby to moderate the appreciation
caused by such inflows.

At the beginning of 2011 the Bank of Israel
introduced additional measures in the foreign
currency market:


At the same time, the Ministry of Finance
announced that it intended to abolish the tax
exemption of nonresidents’ profits from
investments in makam and short-term
government bonds––thus bringing this taxation
in line with that on Israeli residents––with the
intention of making such investments less
attractive.


It imposed reporting requirements on
swaps and NIS/foreign currency forwards, and
on nonresidents’ transactions in makam and
short-term government bonds.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

ISRAEL

Box 4. Exchange Rate Assessment
In 2011 the shekel experienced moderate
volatility relative to peers amid strong capital
inflows. Israel’s real effective exchange rate (REER)
appreciated throughout 2010 and the first half
of 2011, apart from a temporary weakening in
January 2011 that resulted from heightened
geopolitical uncertainty in the region. Currency
interventions and the introduction of macro
prudential measures to limit short-term capital
inflows helped stabilize the exchange rate in the rest
of 2011. Overall, the shekel weakened by 3½ percent
in real effective terms from December 2011 to
October 2011.
The real exchange rate is broadly in line with its
1987-2010 average, but its equilibrium value has
depreciated further below the historical mean
due to worsened terms of trade. The equilibrium
exchange rate approach based on staff’s panel-data
CGER estimates indicates that the exchange rate is

overvalued 18 percent, largely reflecting the
expectation of a significant decrease in public
consumption relative to GDP in the staff’s forecast—
which pushes up the long-run current account norm
as this is expected to reduce the price of nontradables relative to tradables over time. Given hefty
spending on defense relative to non-defense as well
as the high share of tradables in defense spending in
Israel, the CGER-ERER based estimates may be
overstating the effect of public consumption on the
real exchange rate and thus this misalignment
should be interpreted with care. On the other hand,
the projected medium-term CA balance is broadly in
line with the CA balance norm and is larger than the
NFA-stabilizing CA balance, implying a broadly
balanced MB estimate and a moderate
undervaluation according to the ES approach.

Staff’s view is that the shekel is around the rate
suggested by fundamentals. Although the formal
CGER indicators of competitiveness remain
dispersed as they have been since 2009, the gap
between the various measures is closing, with two
out of three measures now indicating that the shekel
is at or above fundamentals. Besides, both the macro

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

balance and external stability indicators latter
measures may exaggerate competitiveness in Israel,
notably as both reflect an assumption that the
impact on savings rates of the continued phased
pension reforms has ended, even though the
phasing itself has many years to run.

ISRAEL

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 5. Medium Term Fiscal Projections and the Fiscal Rules
In 2010 Israel adopted a new a new framework of
fiscal rules, with the implicit aim of reducing the ratio
of public debt to 60 percent GDP by 2020. These
rules are:

An expenditure rule, which limits real
expenditure growth to average real GDP growth
over the past 10 years adjusted downwards for
the gap between public debt and the desired
target of 60 per cent. Thus, with public debt at
75 percent of GDP compared to the target of
60 per cent, the average real GDP growth of
4 percent is adjusted down by one-third to
provide the 2.6 percent real expenditure growth
limit for 2010.

A deficit ceiling rule, with the central
government deficit limited to 3 percent of GDP
in 2011, 2 percent in 2012, 1½ percent of GDP in
2013 and 1 percent thereafter.

Given the revenue outlook, the latter rule binds on
the determination of the deficit target in practice.
But deficit outturns in 2011 breached the ceiling
because with expenditures as appropriated, revenue
shortfalls have occurred. These are expected to
continue in 2012. Accordingly, securing the deficit
target for 2013 would require a significant fiscal
adjustment – 2 percentage points of GDP equivalent
to a 4 percentage point increase in the VAT rate.
If this fiscal adjustment was implemented, the ratio
of public debt to GDP would continue to fall as the
authorities originally projected, with debt ratios
eventually falling to the implicit 60 percent target
(Box 5 Figures 1 and 2). However, such a fiscal
adjustment could hurt growth in the context of
global slowdown—a pro-cyclical fiscal action. Given
Israel’s relatively sound fiscal outcomes over the past
few years and the degree of market confidence, a
procyclical policy of this magnitude does not seem
warranted.

If instead, the authorities simply focused on meeting
the expenditure rule in 2013 and beyond, while
keeping revenue ratios at the 2012 levels, debt
would still remain on a downward trajectory, but
deficits would remain elevated for some time, with a
much shallower trajectory of debt reduction (Box 5
Figures 2 and 3).
However, the downside risks to potential growth
over the medium-term from demographic factors
(SIP Chapter I), can cause major problems on the
fiscal side. If potential growth fell to 3.2 percent (as
the Bank of Israel currently assumes), deficits would
remain above 3 percent for another 5 years before
the real expenditure growth rule began to bite, and
public debt would remain largely unchanged (Chart
4). If trend growth was reduced further to 2.6 per
cent, due for instance to demographic issues, debt
would actually resume an upward trajectory.
A middle path is suggested. Staff projections are
based on the continuation of the real expenditure
growth rule, combined with an assumed 1 percent of
GDP revenue adjustment in 2013–still a significant
adjustment. A fiscal adjustment of this magnitude
would be sufficient to bring medium-term deficits
within the 1-2 percent of GDP range that results in
public debt falling to the 60 percent target within
the decade (Charts 1 and 2).
The evolution of public debt under a no-policy
change scenario (where the assumed revenue
adjustment does not occur), as well as a range of
other standard fiscal shocks, including interest rate,
exchange rate, GDP growth and contingent liability
shocks are presented in Figure 9 and Table 8. These
shocks demonstrate that while debt to GDP is fairly
robust to shocks in Israel (particularly if the
expenditure rule is implemented, which requires any
increase in interest expenditure to be offset by
savings elsewhere), there is considerable sensitivity
to lower GDP growth, as well as from any realization
of contingent liabilities (as of end 2009, direct
government guarantees were equivalent to around
½ a percent of GDP).

High



Global growth momentum, notably in the
United States and the euro area, could
deteriorate sharply, leading to a decline
in global trade.



Activity in the United States might suffer
a further blow from a political impasse
over fiscal consolidation and a weak
housing market. The financial turmoil in
the currently most vulnerable European
countries could spread to larger euro area
countries.



As a small open economy, with substantial
integration into global financial and goods markets,
Israel’s growth is highly dependent on the
performance of the global economy, although its
performance during the global crisis was reassuring.



Israel has strong fundamentals with foreign
exchange reserves amounting to $76 billion
(equivalent to 120 percent of short-term external
debts) and a positive net international
investment position.



Highly-leveraged large conglomerates dominate a
large share of Israeli economic activities. The
multiple failures of these conglomerates would
distract supply chains, adversely affecting growth,
and would also hit the banking system hard.



Israel’s institutional framework has been
strengthened, with a new fiscal rule, and a new
central bank law.



Israel has ample space to ease monetary policy,
[with use of discretionary foreign exchange
intervention.]

Banks

High
Low





Major banks proved to be resilient
through the global crisis. However,
sudden failure of one bank for
idiosyncratic reasons cannot be ruled out.

2011 FSAP Update found that the banking system
is robust. However, the banking system is
concentrated, and bankruptcies of large
borrowers would erode bank capital significantly.

Medium
Insurers and pension funds experienced
losses during the crisis. Their
performance remains sensitive to
financial market developments and
insurance risks.

 The BoI has signaled its intention to raise the
minimum capital requirements at a faster pace
than Basel III timeline.

 The institutional framework for cooperation
among supervisory agencies remains weak. In
particular, a formal macroprudential oversight
mechanism does not exist.

Non-bank financial institutions



Medium

Medium



Insurers and pension funds are not prone to acute
liquidity crises, and solvency requirements for
insurers are being tightened.

 There also remains ambiguity in crisis
management framework, including the BoI’s
emergency liquidity assistance framework and a
financial support mechanism in crisis prevention
and resolution.

3. Sharp reversal of a
housing boom

Many firms, which relied heavily on bond
financing, would face credit crunch.



A sharp fall in house prices would dampen real
estate demand, leading to financial difficulty in
the construction sector.



Banks’ loan losses would increase and their
profitability will fall through: (i) the direct impact
of an increase in nonperforming loans to
households and construction sectors; and (ii) an
indirect impact through weaker economic growth.



On the contrary, expected monetary easing could
risk a further increase in house prices.



If house prices fall sharply, reversing
macroprudential policies that the BoI
implemented in recent years could help support
housing markets.



If house prices continue to rise, a further
tightening in macroprudential policies would be
required.

4. Severe escalation in
regional geopolitical
security concerns



The political and security situation in the
Middle East and North Africa region
remains highly uncertain.



The Israeli economy has proven resilient to past
episodes of heightened regional tensions.



Severe escalation in regional security concerns
could hit the Israeli tourism sector, consumer
confidence, and possibly capital inflows. In the
extreme, banks could face deposit withdrawals.

5. Re-escalation in social



The government is formulating a package of new

Were social protests to re-escalate, the
government would expand fiscal policy. The
government could abandon the existing fiscal
rules, undermining fiscal credibility.

Annex II. Authorities’ Response to Past IMF Policy Recommendations
(Scale―fully consistent, broadly consistent, or marginally consistent)

IMF 2010 Article IV Policy Recommendations

Authorities’ Response

Background
Inflation expectations have risen towards the upper end of the target band, nominal house prices
have boomed, and the shekel has appreciated significantly. Against this background, the 2010 Article
IV called for additional policy tightening to keep them under control.
Fiscal policy
Fiscal policy should carry the burden of the additional
policy tightening, so a stronger than planned structural
fiscal consolidation is recommended for 2011 and
2012.

Not consistent
The budget outturn underperformed in
2011, in part reflecting optimistic revenue
projections.

Monetary policy
The policy interest rate should be raised.

Fully consistent
The BoI continued to raise the policy
through June 2011. Since 2011, the BoI has
turned to a monetary easing cycle.

Foreign exchange policy
Foreign exchange intervention can play a supportive
role, but intervention should be symmetric over a long
time horizon

Fully consistent
The BoI has stopped intervention since
June 2011.

Financial sector policy
The development of stress testing procedures focusing
on systemic risk, and the enhancement of the
collaboration between and within supervisory
institutions is strongly encouraged. Supervision of nonbanks might be further strengthened by locating it
outside the Ministry of Finance.

Broadly consistent
For the FSAP Update, stress tests were
conducted jointly with IMF staff. An interagency Financial Stability Group has been
established, although further work is
needed to strengthen a cooperation
framework. There is no consensus about
where to locate the non-bank supervision
function.

Structural reform
Further strengthening of structural reforms, including in
education, research, the business environment, and
infrastructure, effective management of natural gas
resources will also be necessary.

Marginally consistent
The authorities have decided to set up a
Sovereign Wealth Fund and review natural
resource tax regime.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

According to OECD, there has not been
much progress in education and labor
market reform.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of February 29, 2012)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Macroeconomic statistics are of generally high quality and broadly adequate for surveillance,
although there are few shortcomings particularly in monetary and government finance statistics. A Report
on the Observance of Standards and Codes—Data Module, a Detailed Assessments Using the Data
Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF), and a Response by the Authorities were published on the IMF
website on March 24, 2006 (IMF Country Report No. 06/125).
National Accounts: No issues to report.
Price statistics: No issues to report.
Government finance statistics: The methodology underlying the reported overall annual fiscal balance
is not in conformity with internationally accepted best practice, as interest expenditure excludes the
inflation component. The authorities are gradually moving toward implementation of the methodology
that is standard in other countries, so that the discrepancy will decline over time. Quarterly data
submitted by the Central Bureau of Statistics broadly follows the GFSM 2001 format. However, for
financial assets and liabilities, only transaction data are currently submitted, although a financial balance
sheet (stocks of financial assets and liabilities) is under preparation. Within-year monthly reports on
central government operations—compiled by the MoF—cover only the main aggregates of budgetary
accounts, not broken down by components.
Monetary statistics: Banking statistics are not based on balance sheet reporting, but instead on a
selection of data reported by banks to the regulatory authorities. Current information does not permit full
sectorization of the economy in the monetary statistics, and more detailed information on instruments
also would be useful.
Balance of payments: Balance of payments and international investment position data are compiled on
a quarterly basis and follow the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. External sector data were
not examined in the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes
II. Data Standards and Quality
Participant in the Special Data Dissemination
System (SDDS) since April 1996, and in full
observance of the SDDS’s prescriptions for data
coverage, periodicity and timeliness, and for the
dissemination of advance release calendars.

Data ROSC published on March 24, 2006.

III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
Data are regularly reported for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook and in the IFS.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
April 2, 2012

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with Israel
On March 27, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the 2012 Article IV consultation with Israel. 1
Background
Israel’s economy remains strong with GDP growing 4.7 percent in 2011, led by robust private
consumption and buoyant investment. However, the global downturn is slowing Israeli growth,
with 2012 GDP growth expected at 2.8 percent. Nevertheless, Israel’s fundamentals are strong:
inflation and inflation expectations are squarely within the 1–3 percent target range,
unemployment is at historic lows, the net international investment position is a surplus, and
public debt has fallen steadily to below 75 percent of GDP. These strengths are also
underpinned by Israel’s sound institutional frameworks, including fiscal rules and a new central
bank law. Furthermore, following recent discoveries of natural gas fields, Israel may become a
net energy exporter in coming years.
With the global and domestic economy slowing, the Bank of Israel (BoI) began monetary easing
cycle from September 2011, cutting the policy interest rate from 3.25 percent to 2.5 percent in
steps. On the fiscal side, automatic stabilizers are operating fully, and the economic slowdown
in the latter half of 2011 resulted in lower-than-projected revenue collections and a smaller-thantargeted headline fiscal consolidation. The budget deficit was 3.3 percent of GDP in 2011 and is
projected at around 3.4 percent of GDP in 2012, exceeding the target almost 1½ percentage
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the

points of GDP. Meanwhile, appreciation pressures on the shekel have eased, and now the
shekel is judged at around equilibrium.
The Financial Stability Assessment Program (FSSA) Update concludes that the financial system
is stable, with the BoI maintaining strongly proactive supervisory practices, which have
preempted the systemic risks. Banks’ cross border activities are limited, with negligible direct
exposures to peripheral advanced European countries. However, real estate markets boomed
over the past several years, and banks have significantly increased their exposures to housing
and construction sectors. Moreover, some large corporate groups face rising risk premia in
bond markets and sizable debt refinancing needs in the coming period.
Poverty remains among the highest in OECD countries, despite strong growth. This primary
reflects low labor force participation rates among the Arab-Israeli and Haredi minority
populations.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for sound macroeconomic management and
policy frameworks that have underpinned Israel’s strong economic performance in recent years.
Directors noted, however, that global uncertainties and elevated regional strains pose risks to
the outlook, and that longer-term domestic challenges underscore the need to push ahead with
the reform agenda.
Directors considered that near-term economic prospects remain favorable. In the face of a weak
external environment, reductions in the policy interest rate and the free play of the automatic
stabilizers in the context of the two-year budget have appropriately supported activity, although
the 2012 deficit target will be overshot.
Directors stressed that fiscal policy should remain focused on reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio
over the medium term. Accordingly, the total spending limits in this year’s budget and the
ceilings under the expenditure rule for the 2013 and 2014 budgets should be respected, and a
sizeable consolidation should be secured in 2013–14. In that context, further revenue
mobilization would be appropriate.
Considering further reforms to the fiscal frameworks, Directors recommended that the deficit
targets should be adjusted to take account of cyclical factors. Most Directors supported
establishing an autonomous Fiscal Council to reinforce the momentum toward medium-term
sustainability. In addition, Directors commended the authorities’ plan to place natural resource
revenues in a sovereign wealth fund.

3
Directors noted that the FSSA Update confirmed the soundness of Israel’s financial institutions.
However, given global risks, high concentration in the financial sector, and elevated house
prices, they welcomed continued proactive supervision and plans to raise bank capital ratios.
Directors also encouraged a review of the financial crisis management framework, as well as
the establishment of a Financial Stability Committee to improve the coordination of supervisory
agencies.
Directors noted that fiscal tightening would create space for further monetary easing. However,
such easing would have to be evaluated against wage trends and second round effects of rising
oil prices, with house price concerns addressed via macroprudential tools. Directors
encouraged further strengthening of the monetary framework, including enhancement of central
bank autonomy over remuneration of its staff and lengthening the horizon of published
forecasts. They also agreed that, with the exchange rate broadly at its equilibrium level, a de
facto free floating exchange rate regime should be maintained, although the option to intervene
to sustain orderly conditions continues to be viable.
Directors emphasized macro-social concerns, notably that labor participation among the ArabIsraeli and Haredi populations is low, with adverse effects on growth prospects, poverty
reduction, and fiscal sustainability. They welcomed recent reforms to address these concerns,
while emphasizing that more is needed.

Statement by Menno Snel, Executive Director for Israel
and Amit Friedman, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
March 27, 2012
We would like to thank staff participating in both the FSAP and Article IV missions for
their professional and candid assessments and their constructive recommendations.
Macroeconomic performance and outlook
The Israeli economy grew by 4.7 percent in 2011, which is substantially higher than the
average in other advanced economies. A mild recession in 2009, followed by high growth
rates in 2010 and 2011, resulted in a near-potential level of economic activity. The rate of
unemployment fell to 5.4 percent in the fourth quarter, the lowest level since the early
1980s.
The relatively good performance in recent years is the result of many factors, including
successful economic policies before and during the crisis. Fiscal discipline, a responsive
monetary policy, a conservative banking sector, and a strong external position had
positioned the economy at a strong starting point as the global crisis unfolded, and these
factors also supported the rapid recovery.
The local and international trust in the Israeli economy was reflected in the relatively low
CDS spreads throughout 2011 and in a substantial increase in the level of Foreign Direct
Investment. The credit rating upgrade to A+ by S&P in September, in a period when
credit ratings in many countries were downgraded, stands out.
However, as the slowdown in global markets intensified, export growth stopped and even
turned negative in the last quarter of 2011, and growth slowed. The growth rates
decreased monotonically throughout the year to 3.2 percent in 2011Q4. The current
account, which had been in surplus since 2003, turned slightly negative in the fourth
quarter.
The sentiment at the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange deteriorated during the year. Geopolitical
developments and the inability of some large borrowers to service their debt led to a
series of debt restructurings, which resulted in higher spreads in the corporate bond
market. Share prices declined by about 20 percent relative to the levels in early 2011.
Although the unemployment rate fell to a 30-year low, and although the economy was at
that point growing at nearly 4 percent, a surge of social unrest swept the country during
the summer. The protest focused on rising housing costs and food prices. Mass peaceful
demonstrations led to the establishment of the Trajtenberg committee – a public
committee that recommended a comprehensive set of policy measures to respond to the

demands of the protestors. The government announced its intention to implement the
proposals of the Trajtenberg committee, and has begun to do so.
Following the negative local and international developments during the year, the Israeli
authorities have revised the outlook for 2012 downward, and it currently ranges between
3.2 percent (MOF) and 2.8 percent (BOI), which bracket the Fund’s 2.9 percent outlook.
As these rates are lower than potential growth, unemployment is expected to increase.
Additional risks to the forecast include geo-political risks, possible further increases in oil
prices, and an intensifying recession in Europe, as Israel is an export-led economy.
Fiscal Policy
Fiscal consolidation in 2011 was broadly on track, as the budget deficit in 2011declined
to 3.3 percent of GDP, after reaching 5.1 percent in 2009. Although the deficit was
reduced substantially, lower than expected tax revenues led to a slightly higher deficit
than the originally planned 3 percent target. Public debt fell to 74.2 percent of GDP,
lower than the OECD average.
The robustness of the fiscal position was well reflected in the bond issuance of US$1.5
billion for 10.5 years at yield as low as 4.1 percent, in January 2012 in New York. This
yield spread, at 205 bp spread over 10-year US treasury bonds, is the lowest-ever pricing
achieved by Israel in issues of dollar-denominated bonds.
Fiscal policy in Israel is currently implemented through a two-year budget framework.
This mechanism, first adopted in 2009-2010, has proven to be an important instrument to
restore market confidence during the economic crisis, while at the same time allowing
governmental units, as well as the parliament, to focus on longer-term issues.
Thus, fiscal expenditure in 2012 is executed according to the 2011-2012 budget, which
was approved in late 2010. As tax revenue projections today are lower than originally
envisaged and automatic stabilizers are fully at work, the deficit for 2012 is expected to
be higher than the 2 percent ceiling. The current projection is that it will reach 3.4
percent.
The deficit targets for 2013 and 2014 pose a complicated challenge. It seems that the
deficit targets for these years, previously set at 1.5 and 1 percent, respectively, may be
too contractionary, given the lower growth outlook. The new targets, which balance the
need to consolidate, support economic activity, and comply with previous obligations,
will be set in place in the next few months.
Although a decrease in the pace of consolidation is expected, the authorities are fully
aware of the importance of continued consolidation, and have reiterated that reducing the
public debt-to-GDP ratio remains a major goal of the government’s economic agenda.
This commitment is backed-up by an effective fiscal toolkit that includes an expenditure

cap along with a deficit target. The expenditure rule, introduced in 2010, sets the increase
in real government spending to be lower than potential growth, which is calculated as 10year average growth, as long as the debt-to-GDP ratio is above its target. This rule is
designed to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio to 60 percent by 2020.
As noted above, in response to the social unrest that emerged last summer, the
government established the Trajtenberg committee. Following its recommendations, the
tax cut program, according to which tax rates were to have been further reduced from
2012 on, was cancelled. This, along with other measures, will allow financing a series of
steps that will address social demands, at least partially. However, the authorities do not
envisage at this stage increasing the VAT.
Large natural gas fields were discovered in recent years. In 2011, a new ‘superprofit’ tax
was legislated, and in February 2012, the government approved the general framework
for establishing a sovereign wealth fund, which is expected to begin to accumulate
revenues by the end of the decade. This fund, which will be invested in international
capital markets, will restrain the possible “Dutch disease’ effects and strengthen the fiscal
position.
Monetary Policy
Monetary policy changed course in 2011. In the first half of the year, the Bank of Israel
continued its policy of restoring the nominal interest rate to "normal" levels, which had
begun in 2009. The increases were justified by the relatively high - above target - actual
and expected inflation rates and a near-potential level of economic activity. In addition,
the housing market was showing signs of overheating. By June, the Bank of Israel
interest rate had reached the level of 3.25 percent.
However, as the severity of the European debt crisis intensified, the market sentiment in
global and local markets turned negative, and economic activity showed signs of
weakness, the BOI has gradually reduced its key rate to 2.5 percent. The inflation rate
decreased from 4 percent in early 2011 to 1.7 percent today, below the midpoint of the
inflation target range. Expected inflation for the next 12 months, as derived from capital
markets, is now 2.5 percent, implying that the real interest rate is about zero. The Bank of
Israel (BOI) assesses that given the evident slowdown in growth, the current interest rate,
which is expansionary, is consistent with inflation being around the midpoint of the target
range, while at the same time leaving ample ‘firepower’ in case further risks materialize.
In order to curb capital inflows, the BOI and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) took a few
coordinated measures in 2011. In January, the BOI imposed a 10 percent reserve
requirement on banks, when engaging in currency swaps and forward foreign exchange
transactions with non-Israeli residents. In March, the MOF canceled the tax arbitrage
between local and foreign investors in the makam - a short-term zero-coupon debt
instrument issued by the BOI, targeted by the carry-trade foreign investors who were tax

exempt. In July, the BOI imposed a regulation, according to which forward foreign
exchange transactions above a threshold have to be reported. These policy measures
contributed to lowering the pressure on the new Israeli shekel (the NIS), which has eased
further as the BOI reduced its key rate and a ‘risk-off’ mood started to take over markets.
Consequently, foreign exchange purchases, which were used to restrain overvaluation
forces in recent years, have stopped, and since August 2011, the NIS has been freely
floating.
A new and modern Bank of Israel Law was legislated by the Knesset In March 2010. The
new law, which formally defines the de-facto independence of the BOI, states that price
stability is the prime goal of the central bank. Based on the new law, a Monetary Policy
Committee (MPC), which includes the Governor of the BOI as chairmen, two additional
BOI members and three external members, began operating in October 2011.The BOI
will carefully study the staff's suggestions regarding possible improvements in the
practices and procedures of the MPC’s work. On the subject of emphasizing the midpoint
of the inflation target band of 1 to 3 percent, given the high volatility of inflation, the
band allows the BOI to credibly balance between its objectives.
Financial Sector Stability Assessment
Overview
The financial sector was assessed thoroughly by the FSAP team, after more than a decade
since the previous (and first) FSAP was conducted. At the outset, the Israeli authorities
would like to express their appreciation to staff for their dedicated work, and to the Fund
for devoting resources to this task, given the current condition of the global economy.
The Israeli supervising authorities – the MOF, the BOI and the Israeli Securities
Authority (ISA) – have all found the process useful and effective. The worldwide
experience of the IMF and the use of common methodologies have delivered important
insight into the current state of financial markets and supervision.
The authorities generally share the overall assessment. The results indicate a high level of
observance of the international standards of supervision. The stress tests that were jointly
conducted by the authorities and the FSAP team reaffirm the robustness of the financial
system, banks and nonbanks alike, and confirm that the current buffers can shield the
system even from severe shocks. However, the risks facing the financial system are
exceptionally high.
Market Structure and Concentration
The financial system has changed considerably since the previous FSAP assessment. The
Bachar reform of 2005 – which required the banks to divest their asset management

activities – triggered a structural change, which led to the rapid growth of the non-bank
sector. At the same time, a flourishing corporate bond market has evolved.
The soundness of the new structure and institutes was stress-tested during the economic
crisis. The stability of the major financial players – banks, insurance companies, and
institutional investors – was maintained. Some weaknesses in the corporate bond market
emerged, as the primary market dried up in late 2008 and the spreads rose dramatically.
Following the crisis, the Treasury in 2010 established a committee (the Hodak
committee) to suggest measures to strengthen the robustness of the market. These
measures were implemented and increased the degree of transparency in the market and
the quality of issuers. In addition, the supervisor of Capital Markets Insurance and
Savings Division (CMISD), located in the Treasury, issued tougher regulations regarding
the investment of institutional investors in corporate bonds.
The banking industry, the nonbank financial sector, and the nonfinancial sector are all
relatively concentrated. Therefore, many financial institutions, and even nonfinancial
business groups, can have systemic importance. The supervisors are well aware of risks
that stem from this market structure, and apply “hands-on”, stringent and sometimes
intrusive policies to offset the excess risk. The CMISD will strengthen group supervision
as part of the adoption of the Solvency II regulatory paradigm, following the publication
of global supervisory standards in this matter.
The Concentration Committee, an ad-hoc public committee that has recently finalized its
report, has recommended that no individual can be a controlling shareholder in both a
financial and a real company, and has in addition recommended steps to limit the extent
of pyramidical structures that in the past have enabled shareholders to in effect operate
with extremely high leverage in controlling companies.
The adoption of the committee’s recommendations will lead to a reduction of excess
concentration in the future, and to a flattening of pyramidal ownership structures.
However, given clear evidence of economics of scale in many industries, some degree of
concentration is almost inevitable in a small economy. Excessive market fragmentation
could eventually lead to an even less efficient industrial structure.
Institutional Changes
The new Bank of Israel Law (2010) strengthened the institutional framework by defining
financial stability as a major objective of the BOI, and by giving it the authority to act as
lender of last resort to non-bank financial institutions if it should judge that to be
necessary for financial stability.
Following the previous FSAP recommendations, the BOI has set up a real time gross
settlement (RTGS) payment system, which is now operational. This has enabled the BOI

to strengthen its control over the payment systems, and to join the CLS system, turning
the NIS into a fully convertible currency.
As part of a strategic plan to strengthen the supervision of nonbanks, the CMISD has
tightened its regulation, monitoring, and oversight. Manpower and budget increased, and
two new departments, Solvency II implementation and enforcement, were established.
The authorities realize the importance of strengthening the framework for conducting
coordinated macroprudential policy. The Banking Supervision Department (BSD),
CMISD and ISA are currently examining possible ways to implement the Fund’s
recommendation to institutionalize their cooperation, which has improved since the crisis,
by establishing an FSC in a way that will add real value to the supervisory frameworks
while adhering to the existing legal structure of three separate supervisory bodies.
The BOI concurs that the framework for early intervention and orderly resolution of
problem banks, including the legal basis, should be overhauled. The overhauled
framework for dealing with problem banks, which should include early intervention,
going-concern resolution, and gone-concern resolution, would allow the BOI to deal
effectively with emerging problems and to address major problems promptly and
decisively.
The ISA has proposed to amend the securities law so that underwriters will be subject to
broader scrutiny at the time of registration, and that underwriters acting as distributors in
the offering process will be subject to liability for misleading or defective statements in a
prospectus. In addition, ISA has established an internal working group dedicated to
examine and propose a legislative framework to regulate the broker-dealer activity in
Israel.
Banking System Stability and Basel III implementation
Israel's banking system is conservative, tightly regulated and closely monitored, all of
which helped the system remain sound and resilient throughout the global financial crisis.
The banks are well capitalized and profitable, especially when taking into account that
Israeli banks use the conservative standardized approach to calculating CAR’s; their asset
portfolios are of high quality; and their operation consists mostly of traditional banking.
As the Israeli banks are net lenders to foreign banks abroad, the opening of spreads and
difficulties in attracting wholesale funding did not much affect them in the global crisis.
The banks’ buffers have increased following the crisis. In June 2010, the Supervisor of
Banks issued a directive ordering banks to increase core capital to at least 7.5 percent by
the end of 2011, and prohibiting dividend distribution before this target is met. By the
end of September 2010, all five of the largest banking groups achieved the target.

As of 2011Q3, the total capital ratio was 13.5 percent, Tier 1 core capital was 7.8 percent
and ROE was 10 percent, similar to the long-term average. Banking credit grew by 7
percent in the first 3 quarters of 2011. The banks' credit portfolio quality is high, as
indicated by the low, 2.0 percent, non-performing loans ratio and by the low provision
expense for credit losses, 0.4 percent of total loans. The total exposure to the Euro zone is
1.6 percent, and to the most vulnerable countries only 0.2 percent.
The new draft rules for implementation of Basel III were published on March 14, 2012.
The minimum core capital requirement will be raised to 9 percent by January 1st, 2015.
For banks holding more than 20 percent of total banking sector assets, it will be further
raised to 10 percent as of January 1st, 2017. This differential treatment, which is driven
by macroprudential considerations, is expected to affect the two largest banks in Israel,
which currently each hold about 30 percent of the assets in the banking system.
The gradual increase in core capital is designed to balance the need to strengthen the
banking system with minimizing the negative macroeconomic effects of deleveraging.
According to the BSD’s assessment, banks will be able to meet the new capital
requirements while expanding their credit portfolios at a rate that is similar to or slightly
below potential growth.
The Housing Market
The BOI assesses that the risk related to elevated house prices is contained. House prices
have risen considerably during the past few years; this can be attributed in part to initial
levels in 2007, when house prices relative to wages or rent prices were exceptionally low,
and to the very low interest rates in place during and after the global crisis. The current
price-rent ratio implies a rate of return of 4 percent.
That said, the BOI took active macro-prudential measures to contain the risks of price
correction, the Ministry of Housing and Construction has taken steps to increase the
supply of land, and the MOF has increased the purchase tax on second properties. These
policies seem to have been effective in easing the pressure in the housing market, as
house prices leveled off since April 2011 and the share of second-property transactions
fell sharply.
In March 2011, the BSD limited the floating interest rate component of housing loans to
1/3 of the total loan. Competition among the banks in supplying this type of mortgage,
linked to the Bank of Israel rate, had led to the spread over the BOI rate falling to only 60
bp. The constraint on the share of this type of loan in the total financing package for a
house was imposed to reduce the risks attendant with this type of financing when the
Bank of Israel rate would rise. The issuance of this directive was immediately followed
by on-site supervisory actions that ensured that it is fully implemented.

This step has slowed the growth of mortgages, decreased the share of non-indexed
floating rate loans, and decreased LTVs to previous levels. Since it was implemented, 58
percent of new residential loans are at an LTV of up to 60 percent, and only 7.1 percent
of loans are at an LTV of over 75 percent. High-risk mortgages, with high LTV
combined with high payment-to-income ratio, amount to 0.5 percent of the outstanding
balance. Thus, the tails of LTV ratios are not significant.
Limited lending on floating interest rates, combined with low LTVs, implies that the
banking sector most likely will remain unscathed in the event of a price correction in the
housing market.
Long-run issues: Participation of minorities in the Labor Force
In this report, staff has expanded the review to one of the most difficult socio-economic
challenges that Israel is likely to face in the years to come – how to integrate minority
groups, which are becoming relatively larger over time, into the labor market. Staff has
done a service to Israeli society by adding its considerable weight to the discussion and
analysis of the issues, and by emphasizing the urgency of accelerating the pace of
reforms.
The Israeli authorities as well as the Israeli public – including the minority groups – fully
understand that the current rates of participation of the ultraorthodox men and Arab
women in the labor force are unsustainable.
The low participation rate of ultraorthodox men is a complicated phenomenon. A
combination of the strong desire to ring-fence themselves from the influences of the
Jewish secular society – including through not doing military service – and economic
incentives, have resulted in a full-time entrenchment to religious studies – for life. As this
starts from a very young age, ultraorthodox boys do not acquire basic knowledge and
skills that are necessary in the modern labor market.
Although political difficulties and a feeling that the issue could be put off to a future date
resulted in slow progress, recent evidence suggests that employment rates of
ultraorthodox men have increased from 39 percent in 2009 to 45 percent in 2011.
In order to speed up this process, and to achieve the 63 percent by 2020, a target that was
set by the government in 2008, the incentives for the community have to change. The
community also has to take responsibility by introducing core secular subjects, including
science, mathematics and English into its school curricula and by signaling to its
members that participating in the labor market is not inferior to being a full-time student
of religion.
A Supreme Court ruling in February 2012 that the law under which ultraorthodox men
can work while being exempted from military service (the ‘Tal law’) does not comply

with Israeli Fundamental laws, which have a constitutional status, has given the political
system six months to come up with a solution. This also creates an opportunity to better
incentivize the community to speed up the pace of reform.
In addition, the Ministry of Education intends to acknowledge the special external exams
in ultraorthodox girls’ high schools, where the curriculum covers also general studies, as
eligible for credit towards completing either the matriculation exams or professional
exams in the public education system. This will allow ultraorthodox women to apply for
tertiary education.
A number of policy steps were taken recently in order to encourage the participation of
Arab women in the labor force. The Prime Minister’s Office and the Ministry of
Transportation added public transportation lines within major Arab towns, and between
Arab towns and central cities. Following the Trajtenberg committee recommendations,
the government decided that mandatory and free education will be gradually provided
from age 3 on (vs. 5 today) and to expand the public provision of subsidized and
regulated daycare services for younger children, especially from low-income families.
These steps will increase female labor supply in general, and will be particularly
beneficial to Arab women, who have more children, and whose participation rates are
found to be substantially affected by childcare support.
