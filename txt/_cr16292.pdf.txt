IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Kiribati
On September 7, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Kiribati.
Kiribati’s recent economic performance has been strong. Growth is estimated to have reached
3.5 percent in 2015, supported by record high fishing revenue, donor financed infrastructure
projects and reconstruction in the aftermath of cyclone Pam. Growth is projected to moderate
somewhat to around 3 percent this year, while inflation remains subdued owing to low food and
commodity prices.
The fiscal position has improved markedly in recent years. High fishing revenue contributed to a
recurrent fiscal balance of almost 50 percent of GDP in 2015, more than offsetting the increase
in government recurrent spending of 13 percent. Public debt increased from less than 10 percent
of GDP in 2014 to 23 percent of GDP at the end of 2015 owing to the commencement of the
Bonriki International Airport repair and upgrade project, financed by development partner
concessional loans. The current account surplus reached 40 percent of GDP in 2015, with fishing
revenue and a recovery in seamen remittances more than offsetting elevated imports related to
donor financed projects.
Growth is projected to weaken further over the medium term with the projected decline in
fishing revenue and the completion of large infrastructure projects. Climate change can have an
impact on long-run prospects given the country’s low elevation. Global financial market turmoil
may feed into the domestic economy through the exposure to foreign assets of the Revenue
Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF) and the Kiribati Provident Fund (KPF), the country’s two
main savings vehicles.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the strengthening of Kiribati’s current account and the balance of
the Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF), and commended the good progress on
structural reforms. They observed, however, that Kiribati faces development challenges
stemming from its geographic location, the lack of economies of scale, and its vulnerability to
climate change. Directors emphasized that building fiscal buffers and continued support from
development partners will be important to mitigate the risks to economic growth.
Directors underscored that prudent management of public resources in the context of a mediumterm fiscal framework remains the key policy priority. They considered a balanced structural
budget an appropriate fiscal anchor in light of the projected decline in fishing revenue. Directors
encouraged the authorities to formulate a target-level and a rule-based withdrawal mechanism
for the RERF, which would enhance its role as an endowment fund for both current and future
generations. They also underscored the importance of further enhancing tax collection and
public financial management to facilitate the needed growth-friendly fiscal adjustment.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to improve Kiribati’s resilience to climate change.
They highlighted that explicitly recognizing climate change adaptation costs and infrastructure
maintenance needs in the budget would help ensure adequate provision of resources, including
from development partners.
Directors noted the need to enhance financial deepening and address deficiencies in financial
supervision. They encouraged steps to facilitate private sector access to credit while
safeguarding the long-run sustainability of public financial institutions, given their critical role
in the financial sector.
Directors emphasized that private sector development is vital to achieving more sustained and
inclusive growth. They commended the progress on state-owned enterprise reforms and
encouraged the authorities to maintain the momentum. Directors recommended further
improvement in infrastructure, including air transportation and shipping services, enhancing the
business climate by streamlining business licensing processes and improving land registration,
as well as investing in human capital to better harness Kiribati’s resources.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

KIRIBATI
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
August 23, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context. Kiribati is a small and fragile state vulnerable to climate change. Record high
fishing revenue in recent years has boosted growth, improved the current account, and
strengthened the balance of the sovereign wealth fund, the primary vehicle for
intergenerational saving. However, fishing revenue has declined in the early months of
2016 and is projected to remain at more modest levels over the medium term. Building
fiscal buffers to enhance resilience and continued support from development partners
are essential to mitigate downside risks to growth.
Key policy recommendations.


Fiscal policy. Accommodating Kiribati’s considerable public spending needs in a
fiscally sustainable way calls for a strengthened fiscal framework. This should include
committing to a balanced structural budget over the medium term in light of the
declining fishing revenue, strengthening the role of the sovereign wealth fund as an
anchor for long run fiscal sustainability, and maintaining an appropriately-sized cash
reserve buffer to cope with revenue volatility and external shocks.



Climate change. Continued efforts are needed to enhance resilience to climate
change and mitigate its negative impact on long run growth. Budget provision
should explicitly recognize climate change adaption costs and infrastructure
maintenance needs.



Structural reforms. Achieving more sustained and inclusive growth depends on
creating conditions for private sector growth and employment. Key elements in this
area include further strengthening of the SOEs’ commercial mandate, continued
investment in business climate and infrastructure and enhancing human capital to
better harness Kiribati’s marine resources.



Financial deepening. Public financial institutions have a critical role in enhancing
financial deepening. Ensuring their long-term sustainability calls for strengthened
risk monitoring, addressing deficiencies in financial supervision and better aligning
operations with their institutional roles.

CONTEXT
1.
Kiribati is a small and fragile state. The country faces development challenges due to its
geographical disadvantage and vulnerability to climate change. With a population of roughly
120,000 sharing a territory of 33 remote islands spread over 3.5 million square kilometers of ocean,
lack of scale and high transportation cost limit production opportunities. Growth averaged around
1.8 percent in 1998-2014, compared to the average growth of 2.1 percent in other small island states
in the Pacific. With the lowest income per capita in the region, about a fifth of the population lives
below the basic needs poverty line and access to clean water and sanitation remains restricted for
many. Long-run prospects are further clouded by sea level rise—low elevation of the atolls
(1.8 meters on average) make them particularly vulnerable to coastal erosion and groundwater
contamination.
2.
Extreme remoteness and large dispersion underpin the high cost of public service
delivery in Kiribati. The public sector dominates the economy (text chart), while private sector
activity—mostly fishery, subsistence agriculture and retail trade—remains limited. Weaknesses in
infrastructure (text chart), business climate and financial intermediation pose further development
obstacles. Limited job opportunities in the private sector, coupled with the fast growing labor force,
has led to a high youth unemployment rate at around 50 percent.1

3.
Fishing license fees and development partner assistance contribute the bulk of
Kiribati’s income. The Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF), Kiribati’s sovereign wealth fund,
serves as the primary vehicle for intergenerational saving. Revenue from fishing license fees are
historically volatile, but regional cooperation through the introduction of the Vessel Day Scheme
(VDS) 2 and favorable weather conditions have significantly improved its performance in recent years
(text chart). As the fishing license fees are collected in the U.S. dollar, the strengthening of the dollar

The VDS, established under the eight-country Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA) in 2012, limits the number of
days that fishing vessels are licensed to fish in PNA waters and sets the minimum fee for the VDS days ($8,000 for
2015–16). The majority of Kiribati’s fishing license fees are subject to the scheme, but it also has separate bilateral and
multilateral agreements with other countries, including the European Union and the United States. The latter two
agreements formed roughly 10 percent of Kiribati’s total revenue from fishing agreements in 2014.

vis-a-vis the Australian dollar (A$), Kiribati’s legal tender, also contributed to higher fees. The strong
revenue in 2015, nearly 100 percent of GDP (A$220 million), halted a prolonged period of relying on
drawdowns from the RERF to finance the budget deficit (text chart). Nonetheless, following lower
receipts in early-2016, the authorities forecast the license revenue to halve to around A$100 million
in 2016, in line with the historical average of the last seven years, leading to a decline in real gross
national income (GNI) of about 20 percent following several years of strong growth. Donor grants
amounted to nearly 50 percent of GDP in 2015, the highest in the Pacific region (Figure 1).

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK AND RISKS
4.
Growth remained strong at 3½ percent in 2015, thanks to the record high fishing
revenue. Donor-financed infrastructure investment and reconstruction in the aftermath of cyclone
Pam further supported growth. Inflation remained contained at around 0.5 percent owing to low
food and commodity prices, in line with the global trends.
5.
High fishing revenue contributed to a recurrent fiscal balance of almost 50 percent of
GDP in 2015, more than offsetting the increase in government recurrent spending of 13 percent.
Public debt increased from less than 10 percent of GDP in 2014 to 23 percent of GDP at the end of
2015 owing to the commencement of the Bonriki International Airport repair and upgrade project,

terms to below the historical average. Nonetheless, competitiveness remains hindered by structural
factors (Box 1).
7.
A new government took office in March 2016 following the general and presidential
elections. Mr. Taneti Maamau, a former finance secretary and candidate of the Tobwann Kiribati
Party, became the country’s fifth president since its independence in 1979. The new government
pledged to pursue a more even distribution of sovereign wealth between the current and future
generations, implying an increase in current spending and less savings into the RERF. The 2016
budget passed in May envisaged an increase in recurrent spending by 9 percent, mostly due to
increased subsidies and grants including a doubling of the copra subsidy program3.
8.
Growth is projected to moderate to around 3 percent in 2016 as several large
infrastructure projects come to completion and fishing revenue is projected to decline sharply.
Inflation is expected to remain low at around 1.5 percent in 2016, while picking up to around
2.5 percent over the medium term, in line with trading partner inflation and international food and
fuel price dynamics (the bulk of Kiribati’s consumer price basket comprises imported items). With the
expected fall in fishing license fees, the current account is expected to reverse to a deficit of
7 percent of GDP in 2016 and to converge to a near balanced position over the medium term.
9.
Risks to the outlook are on the downside (Annex I). Changing climate cycle could
increase uncertainty for fishing revenue over the medium term, as the VDS has not been tested in a
low revenue environment for Kiribati since its implementation. Global financial market turmoil can
feed into the domestic economy through the exposure to foreign assets of the RERF and the Kiribati
Provident Fund (KPF), the country’s two main savings vehicles. Given Kiribati’s high reliance on
imported goods, commodity price shocks and volatility in the Australian dollar could swing imports
in ways hard to accommodate. Without a central bank, fiscal policy is the only macroeconomic policy
lever and buffer against such shocks.
Authorities’ views
10.
The authorities broadly shared staff’s assessment of Kiribati’s economic outlook. They
pointed out that fishing revenue could be highly volatile with risks on both sides. They felt that it was
appropriate to aim for a modest increase in public spending on subsidies, education, and health for
long run economic and social returns. They also noted that the recent increase in copra subsidies was
important to support more inclusive growth, including by providing income opportunities in the
outer islands, and could help reduce health care costs due to overcrowding on Tarawa. They
acknowledged Kiribati’s vulnerability to natural disasters and climate change related shocks and were
mindful of the need to maintain buffers against such shocks.

3

Copra subsidies serve mainly as a livelihood subsidy to support inhabitants of outer islands. Previous Article IV
consultations have concluded that, without job creation on the outer islands, alternative social transfer schemes are
unlikely to reduce the cost in a significant way.

feasible due to data limitations.
Beyond the exogenous factors, Kiribati’s competitiveness hinges on continued efforts to boost
private sector development and addressing long-standing structural impediments. Lack of scale, high
transportation costs and infrastructure deficits remain key structural challenges. Kiribati also continues to lag
Pacific island countries on average under several of the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business rankings.
Securing grant instead of loan financing for development investment remains critical for containing risks to
external sustainability.
The use of Australian dollar as the legal tender remains appropriate. It provides a strong nominal
anchor given close trade and financial linkages with Australia (high share of RERF assets are invested in
Australian markets) and limited capacity to run an independent monetary institution. Kiribati has accepted
the obligations under Article VIII of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement and maintains an exchange system free
of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions.

ENHANCING SUSTAINABILITY AND RESILIENCE
11.
Prudent management of public resources remains the key policy priority. The
authorities have made remarkable progress in strengthening the fiscal position. Reforms to improve
the RERF governance have also been important steps towards better aligning its investment strategy
with the fund’s long-term objectives. Nonetheless, the conditions underlying the strong fishing
activity have started to wane. To support the government’s long run development agenda, budget
decisions need to be taken in the context of a medium term fiscal framework with prudent
assessment of spending goals, revenue projections and wealth management targets. Given the
expected decline in fishing revenue and Kiribati’s susceptibility to climate change related shocks, this
framework should embed adequate fiscal buffers which would likely imply saving much of the fishing
revenue windfall. Further strengthening the RERF would also support the fund’s capacity to provide
sustainable future income for intergenerational equity.

KIRIBATI

A. Strengthening the Fiscal Framework
12.
Accommodating Kiribati’s considerable public spending needs in a fiscally sustainable
way requires embedding policies in a medium-term fiscal framework. While the government’s
balance sheet is currently strong owing to large RERF assets and relatively low public debt, available
fiscal space is limited by the projected decline in fishing revenue and Kiribati’s continued high risk of
debt distress. To support implementation of the authorities’ development plan in a fiscally
sustainable way, this fiscal framework should include: (i) committing to a balanced structural budget
over the medium term; (ii) strengthening the RERF as an anchor for long run fiscal sustainability by
formulating a rule-based withdrawal mechanism; and (iii) maintaining an appropriately-sized cash
reserve buffer to cope with revenue volatility and external shocks.


Committing to a balanced structural budget over the medium term. Steps are needed to
ensure fiscal sustainability in the face of a projected moderation of annual fishing license fees to
the A$100 million range over the medium term.4 On current policies, staff’s baseline projections
envisage a widening of the recurrent deficit to around 10 percent of GDP over the medium term,
resulting in a gradual depletion of the RERF (Box 2). A more sustainable outturn would be
achieved by targeting a structurally balanced budget over the medium term, based on assumed
fishing license fees of A$100 million (text table below). This would require fiscal adjustment of
around 4½ percentage points of GDP in 2017 rising to 8½ percentage points by 2021 compared
to the baseline scenario. The adjustment could comprise efforts to boost revenue collection (e.g.,
by phasing out VAT exemptions to restore tax revenue collection to the 2015 level) and steps to
limit recurrent spending growth to under 1.5 percent per year. Staff advise to cap nominal
spending on copra subsidies at the 2016 level and refrain from any increase in subsidies and
grants beyond the 2016 budget commitment. Wage increases should also be set within the
current wage policy framework which allows for a “wage drift” from the automatic promotion
process without additional increases in salaries. The recommended structural budgeting
approach would insulate spending from potential volatility in fishing license fees. In the event of
a temporary surge in fees, the resulting fiscal surplus should be saved in the RERF, while any
shortfall in fees relative to the A$100 million baseline could be met by transfers to the budget
from the reserve buffer. As additional information is accumulated on license fee trends, the
A$100 million baseline can be gradually adjusted, while preserving a structural balance to ensure
fiscal sustainability.

This projection is consistent with projected 2016 receipts and with the expected reversal of recently favorable
climatic conditions. While the impact of the different factors contributing to strong fishing license revenue
performance cannot be clearly delineated, the recent strong El Niño effect is believed to have attracted tuna to
Kiribati’s warmer waters, contributing to higher catch volumes and greater demand for Vessel Days. Since the peak at
end-2015, the sea surface temperatures in Kiribati waters have started to rapidly cool. Forecasts of the El Niño
Southern Oscillation cycle are highly uncertain due to historical irregularity, but the opposite phases of El Niño
(implying warmer than normal surface water temperatures for Kiribati) and La Niña (cooler waters) occur on average
every two to seven years. Prolonged peak episodes may last for years.



Formulating a target-level for the RERF and a rule-based withdrawal mechanism. After
strengthening the RERF, the structural balance target discussed above could be adjusted over the
longer term to allow moderate annual financing from the RERF. This process should be rulebased and transparent, to simplify budget planning and to ensure that the RERF is maintained as
an endowment fund that can provide the population with a permanent and stable stream of
income. The sustainable level of the RERF drawdown depends on the government’s wealth
management target (see Box 2 for a scenario analysis of the RERF). If the goal is to preserve the
real value of the fund after reaching a certain level, the withdrawal rate should be limited to
around 1–2 percent of the overall balance, assuming an average return rate on the fund of 3–

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KIRIBATI

5 percent5 and a long run inflation rate of 2.5 percent. The withdrawal could also be indexed to
nominal GDP based on the projected long run average growth rate and the targeted return rate
of the fund—under this approach the withdraw would be a more stable source of public
financing, but it could also make the RERF balance more volatile depending on the return of the
fund. In either case the drawdown from the RERF could be gradually adjusted if needed to
preserve the real value of the fund in the event of shortfalls in investment returns. Maintaining
the real value of the fund over the long run would also be consistent with the authorities’ policy
to ensure a more equitable distribution of the income from the RERF between generations while
protecting the capital growth of the fund.


Limiting the complementary cash reserve buffer to three months of recurrent expenditure.
The sizeable cash reserves from the 2014–15 fishing license revenue in excess of this amount
should be transferred to the RERF as soon as possible. On the basis of the 2016 level of current
expenditure, this would leave a cash reserves buffer of roughly A$40 million (40 percent of the
projected fishing revenue) against future temporary revenue shortfalls and external shocks. The
policy of drawdowns from the cash buffer should be transparent and also ensure its
replenishment when revenue exceeds expectations. Any fiscal surplus after replenishing the cash
reserve buffer should be transferred to the RERF to expand its principal base.

13.
The VAT introduced in 2014 was a key element in fiscal reforms to reverse a decline in
the non-fishing revenue since 2008. Implementation of the VAT has been broadly successful in
diversifying the revenue base, but there remains scope for further improvement. The revenue
outcomes in 2014–15 were in line with expectations and the new tax also had positive spillover
effects on other revenue collection through improved record keeping and tax compliance. However,
the VAT implementation was partially hampered by reintroduced SOE exemptions in late 2015, which
was estimated to have reduced VAT collection by around 15 percent in 2016. As such, staff urge the
authorities to phase out the SOE exemptions to ensure the credibility of the tax system and maintain
a level playing field for public and private entities. Further training of tax office staff, greater
utilization of improved IT systems and increased emphasis on tax payer assistance would also
improve the overall performance of revenue collection.
14.
Kiribati remains at high risk of debt distress despite of the RERF assets. As the RERF
serves as a vehicle for intergenerational saving, it is not viewed as buffer against debt distress risk. In
this regard, containing the risk of debt distress will require ensuring fiscal sustainability and securing
grants to finance the country’s large development needs. Government borrowing through
concessional loans should be closely monitored to safeguard long run debt sustainability.

The projected RERF return rate reflects the more conservative investment strategy of the fund after its restructuring.

Box 2. Kiribati: Fishing Revenue and the Impact on the RERF
The RERF forms the primary savings vehicle for the Kiribati people. It was initially capitalized with
revenue from phosphate mining royalties until deposits were exhausted in 1979 and continued to grow
through its investment returns and modest drawdowns. However, acceleration in drawdowns to finance a
sharp increase in current expenditure since the turn of the millennium and periods of negative investment
returns in early 2000s and during the global financial crisis significantly eroded the fund’s capital base until
recently.
Future growth of the fund will depend heavily on fishing revenue. Staff’s simulations indicate that in the
baseline scenario, due to the projected decline in
fishing revenue to around A$100 million dollars leading
to a widening deficit that needs to be financed by RERF

drawdowns, the RERF nominal balance will decline

by 2021 thanks to the accumulation of investment
returns. If the authorities set the target to preserve the
real value of the fund at the A$1 billion level, this would
allow a 1.5 percent annual withdrawal equivalent to 5.5

percent of GDP in 2021. On the other hand, if fishing revenue declines to A$60 million (average level since
2001), the current pace of spending would be unsustainable, leading to a depletion of the RERF in about 15
years.
Preservation of the RERF’s real value would still imply some erosion in its value in per capita terms.
Tolerance to this cost would ultimately depend on the authorities’ policy preferences for intergenerational
income distribution and would need to be weighed against investment needs for economic and social
development. At the current low-yield environment, a real per capita target would limit any drawdowns
from the RERF given the projected long-run annual rate of population growth of 1.5–2 percent.

15.
Any new investment expenditure plans should also be carefully framed within a
stronger PFM framework. Given limited resources, priorities of public investment should be placed
on functions that yield high economic and social returns, namely, infrastructure investment,
regulatory framework and business facilitation services. Scaling up of infrastructure spending
through the budget should be assessed on a case-by-case basis. Consideration should also be given
to enhancing the monitoring and reporting of fishing revenue and further improving the monitoring
and auditing of SOE and joint-venture liabilities.
Authorities’ Views
16.
The authorities welcomed staff’s analysis on the medium term fiscal position and noted
that the government had implicitly targeted a balanced budget historically. While the new
government was still formulating its medium term fiscal framework, they saw drawings from the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RERF as a last resort and then only for development, rather than recurrent, purposes. They welcomed
staff’s recommendation for a rule-based withdrawal mechanism for the RERF and would consider it
in the context of the government’s fiscal and development strategy. The authorities also expressed
their intent to transfer the current cash reserves in excess of three months of recurrent spending to
the RERF, a process that had been temporarily delayed given a change in wealth managers, in line
with staff recommendations.

B. Enhancing Resilience to Climate Change
17.
Climate change and natural disasters are macro critical for Kiribati. Kiribati’s land area
consists almost entirely of low elevation coral atolls and with limited fresh water supply, making it
vulnerable to sea level rise. Although the probability of natural disaster occurrences in Kiribati is less
than 10 percent, half the regional average of around 20 percent, the cost tends to be large relative to
the size of the economy: the 2015 Budget included one-off expenditures—mainly for Cyclone Pam
related damages—equivalent to around 4 percent of GDP. Staff’s analysis of potential growth
suggests that growth is likely to be 0.1 percent lower than the historical average of 1.8 percent over
the long run due to climate change (Box 3).
18.
Staff support the authorities’ efforts to improve Kiribati’s climate change resiliency,
including through more explicit recognition of adaption costs. The authorities’ adaption
approach is embedded in the Kiribati Joint Implementation Plan for Climate Change and Disaster
Risk Management 2014–23 (KJIP) that seeks to integrate climate change and disaster risk sensitivities
and impacts across sectors, identify measures to reduce vulnerabilities and coordinate priorities for
action. The 2016-19 Kiribati Development Plan (KDP) also identifies climate change as one of the key
priority areas, in line with the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In support
of this approach, staff recommend that the budget include an explicit provision for climate change
adaption costs and that outturns be monitored. The allocation would cover coastal protection,
damage repairing, and soil desalinization, and should amount to around 2 percent of GDP annually
over the medium term. Tracking of spending on climate change adaptation would help ensure
adequate provision of resources, and would help in seeking donor funding for climate change
projects. Additional room within the budget envelope is also needed to accommodate maintenance
costs of the newly constructed infrastructure (about 0.5 percent of GDP). The cash reserve buffer as
outlined above can enhance Kiribati’s ex-ante readiness to respond to natural disasters, backstopped
by the RERF as a last-resort measure.
Authorities’ Views
19.
The authorities were open to identifying climate change adaption cost in the budget,
noting that current adaption projects, largely financed by development partners, were probably
already at or above 2 percent of GDP. They also agreed that budget plans need to consider the
infrastructure maintenance cost. They noted the challenges of catalyzing external climate change
financing sources, including capacity constraints to meeting the access requirements.

Box 3. Kiribati: The Growth Impact of Climate Change
Given Kiribati’s susceptibility to climate change and natural disasters, staff’s analysis of the baseline
should explicitly reflect their long run impact. To the extent that the historical average growth already
captures the average impact of periodical natural disasters1, the key question is how to quantify the growth
impact of climate change. AsDB (2013)2 estimated that climate change is likely to have significant impact on
agriculture, fisheries, tourism, environment
protection and health, costing the Pacific 0.5–

government sector, agriculture and fishing has
the second largest share of economic activity. Due to higher incidences of climate related disasters, the
output from the primary sector is declining and its share in total GDP has declined from one third in the
1990s to around 25 percent. An alarming issue is seawater intrusion from storm surges and high tides. This
increases the saline content in soil (also a source of potable water for the people of Kiribati). The mining and
quarrying industry is also affected by this. As arable and resource rich land depletes by rising sea waters,
other sources of income generating activites are sought putting more strain on other sectors of the
economy. Performance of other industries that are related to agriculture and fishing, and tourism, such as
real estate, and wholesale and retail trade can be negatively affected. However, stronger aggregate demand
places upward pressure on output thereby negating some, if not all of the unwanted spillovers.

PROMOTING PRIVATE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT
20.
Achieving more sustained and inclusive growth in Kiribati depends on creating
conditions for private sector growth and expanding employment opportunities. Building on the
success of recent reforms, the newly launched Kiribati Development Plan (2016–19) identifies key
medium-term priority areas staging a pathway toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals
(Table 5). The focus of the new Plan remains on investing in human capital, expanding connectivity
infrastructure, building climate change resilience and strengthening public sector reforms.

KIRIBATI

A. Maintaining the Momentum of SOE Reforms
21.
SOE reforms are important for creating space and a level playing field for private
commercial operation and employment. The authorities have made commendable progress in
SOE reforms through the adoption of the SOE Act in 2013, closure of underperforming SOEs, and
measures to commercialize and improve operational efficiency (Box 4). Nonetheless, the costs of
basic utilities—electricity, water and sanitation—remains high by regional standards, and improving
the delivery of public utilities services is a key priority.
Box 4. Kiribati: Progress in SOE Reforms and Future Priorities1
The SOEs serve a vital role in the Kiribati economy. Kiribati has sixteen active SOEs involved in a range of
commercial activities including utilities, transport, communication and finance. In 2014 the SOEs represented
18 percent of the total capital stock of the country and contributed 12 percent to GDP. Kiribati’s SOE
portfolio also achieved an average return on equity (ROE) of 3.8 percent and return on assets (ROA) of
2.9 percent for 2010–14, making the country a top performer in the region over that period.
The authorities have made substantial progress in improving SOE performance and reducing large
and ad hoc subsidies. Most notable reforms include the reduction in operational SOEs from twenty-five to
currently sixteen by 2016, the merger of the two SOEs in the copra sector, and the privatization of the
telecom company. The government also plans to further reduce the number of SOEs to twelve over the next
five years.
Considerations should be given to improve the compliance of the Community Service Obligations
(CSO) policy. The lack of adequate compensation for CSOs has led to a flat trend in portfolio profitability in
SOEs. While the SOE Act requires CSOs to be properly documented, and a price agreed with the
government, it does not stipulate that the price allow SOEs to fully recover costs, including the cost of
capital. Seven SOEs lodged CSO claims totaling $7 million for the 2014 financial year. Despite government
allocating $4.5 million in the 2014 budget to fund CSOs, by October 2015 only $0.9 million had been paid.
Inadequate funding and low utilization have hindered the government’s efforts to improve SOE performance
and service delivery. In this regard, regular learning events and briefings for government officials and senior
civil servants will ensure that there is ongoing political and bureaucratic support for the CSO policy .

22.
Maintaining the momentum of SOE reforms is also important to contain the risk of
contingent spillovers to the budget. The lack of funding for community service obligations
(CSOs)—non-commercial services “purchased” by the government from the SOEs—remains a major
issue undermining SOE performances. Although the budget recognized the subsidy to SOEs of
A$5 million, it can fall short to cover the full cost of the CSOs based on previous years’ experience.
The financing gap for SOEs to breakeven may widen even further due to rising commodity prices.
Against this background, the authorities should consider strengthening the commercial mandate of
the SOEs and consolidating SOE ownership responsibility under a single minister for both the

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KIRIBATI

operational goals of SOEs and their financial management. Continued divestment and outsourcing of
SOE activities to the private sector will also help improve efficiency and strengthen public finances.
Authorities’ Views
23.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to continuing SOE reforms with an aim to
further reducing the number of SOEs while improving SOE performance and financial returns. They
noted that the recent merger of the two SOEs in the copra sector would generate savings, partly
offsetting the increased spending on copra subsidy.

B. Enhancing Infrastructure and Human Capital
24.
Continued investment in business climate and infrastructure remain the key pillars for
private sector growth and employment. Despite the substantial progress in improving physical
infrastructure and connectivity, transportation needs still remain considerable while additional room for
infrastructure spending within the budget envelope is needed. Promoting air transportation and shipping
services could facilitate development of tourism as well as support recent private sector efforts to develop
fishing and agricultural industries, while thorough feasibility analyses are needed to assess the economic
benefits against the cost. Efforts to improve physical infrastructure should also go hand in hand with
improving business climate, in particular through further streamlining of business licensing process by
improving land registration.
25.
Human resource development is one the key priorities of the government’s structural
reform agenda. The authorities have launched a new strategic plan for the education sector, developed
in collaboration with Kiribati’s development partners, focusing on improving the quality of teaching,
refining the curriculum and improving related infrastructure. Staff welcome the authorities’ focus on
improving the quality of education and training. Given the growth potential in the fishing industry,
building human capital especially through vocational and technical training would help Kiribati better
utilize its marine resources. Further development in other domestic sectors including tourism and routine
infrastructure maintenance would also offer employment possibilities. Finally, international labor mobility
presents a substantial opportunity for overcoming geographical constraints to employment. Improving
workforce skills and strengthening institutional framework could help increase Kiribati’s participation in
the overseas seasonal work schemes.
Authorities’ Views
26.
The authorities vigorously agreed on the importance of further improving infrastructure and
the business climate for private sector development. They placed high priority on promoting air
transportation and shipping services and agreed that the costs and benefits of any investment in this area
would need to be carefully assessed. Here they noted the importance of development partner support to get
multiple viewpoints and to make informed decisions. They emphasized challenges remaining in land
registration given the customary land ownership system. They also saw ongoing efforts to improve
educational outcomes as a key stepping stone for promoting private sector growth, including through
intensive community involvement to ensure that graduating students are better suited to workforce demands.

29.
A more comprehensive approach is needed to address the KPF’s persistent funding
deficit. Broadly positive investment performance over recent years has failed to close the KPF’s
sizeable funding deficit that opened as result of negative returns incurred in 2008 (Box 5). To shore up
the KPF’s long-term sustainability, staff encourage consideration of a more rules-based crediting policy
linking the interest rates on member balances more closely to the fund’s investment returns.

Box 5. Kiribati: Addressing the Financing Deficit of the Kiribati Provident Fund
The Kiribati Provident Fund (KPF) is a national compulsory saving scheme set up in 1977 and is de
facto served as a savings fund for its participating members. Participation in the KPF is mandatory for all
citizens employed in the public or private sector and the plan is funded by equal contributions from the
employee as well as the employer. Citizens employed outside Kiribati, the unemployed, or the selfemployed can participate on voluntary basis. KPF is the second-largest sovereign fund of Kiribati after the
RERF, with most of the assets managed and invested overseas by external fund managers.
The persistence of the deficit reflects KPF’s high crediting rates that are inconsistent with sustainable
rate of return on its investments. The KPF operates similarly to a cash-balance pension plan, where
members are in effect owners of a balance that is carried forward year to year and accrues interest at rate
determined annually by the KPF Board (crediting rate). Notwithstanding the fund’s persistent deficit, recent
years’ crediting rates have been set substantially above the minimum rate of 4 percent, with the latest rate
for 2015 set at 7.5 percent. In nominal terms interest on KPF members’ accounts amounted to AUD
9.5 million in 2015, substantially above the AUD 3 million increase in total investment assets, contributing to
the widening deficit in 2015 to nearly A$18 million, roughly 15 percent of KPF’s total investments.
KPF’s investment returns are unlikely to remain

Introduction of a rules-based crediting policy could therefore be considered to secure the KPF’s longterm sustainability. As the KPF operates on a cash-balance basis, additional member contributions would
be ineffective in reducing the deficit, since they simply increase the fund’s liabilities by the same amount.
The deficit could in principle be eliminated by recapitalization by the government, but the fund’s financial
position would remain vulnerable to further shocks in absence of additional measures to address the
underlying drivers of its asset-liability imbalance. Crediting rates should therefore be explicitly linked to the
fund’s investment returns to secure its long-term sustainability. To reduce annual volatility, the rates could
be guided by multi-year average investment returns, e.g. over a 3-year period. In view of past volatility in
returns, this may require lowering the minimum floor below its current 4 percent level, as well as
symmetrically introducing a maximum cap that allows the fund to be replenished in years of high returns.
Concerning KPF’s overseas investments, consideration should be given to switching to a fully passive
and potentially more conservative asset allocation. Vast majority (nearly 90 percent) of KPF’s investments
are in diversified overseas portfolio and under external management. In light of the recent performance of
the fund, a more conservative investment strategy may be more appropriate for KPF’s institutional investor
role, where determination of risk-tolerance should put more emphasis on the need to protect the value of
its assets, particularly in current absence of financial buffers to absorb losses. A fully passive mandate for
both managers could also help reduce management fees.

Under such a policy the crediting rates could be guided by multi-year average returns to reduce yearto-year volatility. The minimum floor for the crediting rate could be accompanied by a maximum cap
to allow for the fund’s replenishment in years of higher returns. Staff also recommend reviewing the
KPF’s investment strategy to ensure its consistency with the KPF’s institutional role and closely
monitoring the recent growth in the KPF’s exposure to the domestic economy, particularly through the
small loans scheme offered to its members against their accrued balances.
30.
While DBK’s recent performance has been positive, slow progress in addressing legacy
doubtful loans raise concerns over asset quality. Further efforts are needed to address the
persistently high share of doubtful loans in DBK’s loan portfolio, standing at roughly 23 percent of
total loan stock (A$2.6 million) at the end of 2015. Staff also recommend reviewing that these loans’
current provisioning practice adequately reflects their expected rate of recovery. Further
commercialization of DBK into deposit taking should accordingly be carefully weighed against its
current risk monitoring capacity, including its ability to meet potentially correlated depositor
demands in periods of stress, and limited reserves. Commercialization would also warrant
development of the regulatory and supervisory frameworks and an assessment how it fits with the
bank’s developmental objectives, including ensuring continued affordable access to financial
services.
Authorities’ Views
31.
The authorities saw the need to address the issues of the public financial institutions
including the DBK’s financial situation and the sustainability gap of the KPF. They also pointed
out that most household borrowings were backed by their provident fund savings and therefore did
not constitute a systemic risk to financial stability. They stressed the importance of further enhancing
financial deepening especially for the outer islanders.

STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
Kiribati’s recent economic performance has been strong. Record high fishing revenue has
boosted growth, improved the fiscal position and strengthened the current account. Growth is
projected to moderate somewhat to around 3 percent this year, while inflation is projected to remain
subdued owing to low food and commodity prices. Risks to the economic outlook are largely related
to external factors and on the downside.
33.
Prudent management of public resources remains the key policy priority, especially
against the projected decline in fishing revenue. Budget decisions need to be taken in the context
of a medium term fiscal framework that could entail achieving a balanced structural budget in the
medium term, strengthening the RERF as an anchor for long run fiscal sustainability, and maintaining
a cash reserve buffer to deal with revenue volatility and external shocks. After strengthening RERF
balances, the authorities should consider formulating a rule-based mechanism for RERF withdrawal
with the aim to preserving the RERF as an endowment fund that can provide the population with a
permanent and stable stream of income, with the government’s spending plans aligned to this
mechanism.

34.
Budget provision needs to explicitly recognize climate change adaption costs.
Additional room within the budget envelope is also needed to accommodate infrastructure
maintenance. Given the fiscal constraint and the high risks of debt distress, Kiribati needs continued
support from development partners.
35.
Maintaining the momentum of SOE reforms is important to support private sector
growth. The authorities should consider further strengthening the commercial mandate of the SOEs
and consolidating SOE ownership responsibility under a single minister responsible for both the
operational goals of SOEs and their financial management. Continued divestment and outsourcing of
SOE activities to the private sector will help improve efficiency and strengthen public finances.
36.
Further improvement in infrastructure, business climate and human capital remains
critical for private sector development and employment. This includes promoting air
transportation and shipping services, streamlining business licensing process and improving land
registration. Building human capital especially through vocational and technical training would help
Kiribati harness its marine resources. Further development in other domestic sectors including
tourism and routine infrastructure maintenance would also offer employment possibilities.
37.
Financial deepening needs to be implemented in a more sustainable way. Long-term
sustainability of the operations of public financial institutions calls for strengthened risk monitoring
and addressing deficiencies in financial supervision. Plans to expand the DBK activities into deposit
taking should be carefully assessed against its track record in recovering nonperforming loans and its
capacity to assume the increased liability risk, while the crediting rates for KPF member balances
should be more closely guided by its investment returns to address the financing deficit.

Development expenditure equals grants plus loans for development projects.
Current balance excludes grants and development expenditure (see footnote 2 above).
Overall balance in the table is different from official budget because loans are classified as financing.
Projections assume the custodial account maintains cash reserves buffer of three months of current expenditure.

The spillover impact could be largerthan-expected, and would reverberate
largely through the trade channel as
well as through contagion to global
financial markets.

Medium
Fishing license fees and seamen’s remittances could be
negatively affected if demand for fish and shipping declines
due to weaker than expected global growth. A decline in
global returns and valuations would have a negative impact
on RERF assets.
In addition to fiscal adjustment to preserve the RERF (see
above), structural reforms should be accelerated to underpin
competitiveness.

Medium
Reduced financial services by
global/regional banks (“de-risking”).

Low/Medium
The withdrawal of correspondent banking relations has been
associated with higher transaction cost for remittances in
small island countries in the Pacific.
In the short run, fiscal deficits from lower fishing fees can be
financed through RERF drawdowns. If license fees decline on
a sustained basis, steps should be taken to strengthen the
budget through additional revenues and expenditure savings.

1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to
materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline
(“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a
probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the
time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly. “Short term” and
“medium term” are meant to indicate that the risk could materialize within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

Annex II. Main Recommendations of the 2015 Article IV Consultation
Fund Recommendations

Policy Actions

Fiscal Policy


Contain nominal expenditure
growth to around 1½ per annum
over the next five years.



The 2016 Budget envisaged a 9 percent increase in
nominal current expenditure. The authorities, however,
expressed their intention to maintain a balanced
budget going forward.



Transfer the excess reserve buffer
into the RERF.



The authorities expressed their intent to transfer the
current cash reserves in excess of three months of
recurrent spending to the RERF, a process that had
been temporarily delayed given a change in wealth
managers, in line with staff recommendations.



Improve the management of
RERF.



The authorities have made remarkable progress in
improving the management of the RERF. New asset
managers have assumed the management of the RERF
portfolios.



Improve tax compliance and
collection.



Implementation of the VAT was partially hampered by
reintroduced SOE exemptions in late 2015.

Other Policies


Implement SOE reforms.



The authorities have made commendable progress in
SOE reforms through the adoption of the SOE Act
in 2013, closure of underperforming SOEs, and
measures to commercialize and improve operational
efficiency.



Invest in human capital.



The 2016 Budget included a free education subsidy of
A$2.6 million.

RELATIONS WITH THE PACIFIC FINANCIAL TECHNICAL
ASSISTANCE CENTRE (PFTAC)1
(As of 31 May, 2016)
During the current funding cycle (May 2011 to May 2016), PFTAC assistance to Kiribati has included
39 advisory missions. Kiribati also sent 47 officials to regional seminars and workshops.

Tax Administration and Policy
There is generally a strong commitment to reforming tax administration in Kiribati with many of
PFTAC’s recommendations having either been completed or currently being acted upon. Significant
achievements include the design and implementation of a new function-based structure which
includes a bigger focus on taxpayer services, new position descriptions and a plan to improve core
tax functions. The Kiribati Tax Department maintains that these changes are already positively
impacting on operations and an increase in revenue collections.
Although VAT, introduced in April 1, 2014, is performing well and exceeded budget projections in
2015, compliance remains an issue with a high percentage of outstanding returns and increasing
debt levels. PFTAC technical assistance to mitigate these risks has been provided and is currently
being acted upon by the authorities. Additional PFTAC technical assistance in FY2017 will be
provided to develop a Compliance Improvement Strategy and increase audit capability.

Public Financial Management (PFM)
An August 2011 mission to Kiribati assisted the Ministry of Finance in prioritizing its PFM reform
activities (RBM 1.2), and provided a framework for the current joint AusAid/AsDB long-term TA. Prior
to the inception of that TA, two PFTAC/IMF missions worked with the Ministry of Finance officials to
modify their chart-of-accounts (RBM 1.4) to capture more information on donor-funded projects, to
improve the integration of planning and budgeting (RBM 1.5), and to provide options for better
cash and debt management (RBMs 1.3 & 1.6). In addition, PFTAC’s PFM Advisors participated in the
August 2012 AsDB/AusDFAT Technical Assistance inception mission, and a concurrent donor forum.
During 2013 several missions were conducted with multiple focuses including training budget
analysts (RBM 1.5) in the National Economic Planning Office (NEPO), recommending a new
organizational structure for NEPO, supporting the Team Leader of the joint Australia/ADB Treasury
Reform TA (RBM 1.4), and assisting the authorities to develop an improved debt/cash management

PFTAC in Suva, Fiji is a multi-donor TA institution, financed by IMF, AsDB, AusDFAT, Korea and NZAID, with the IMF
as Executing Agency. The Centre’s aim is to build skills and institutional capacity for effective economic and financial
management that can be sustained at the national level. Member countries are: Cook Islands, Federated States of
Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau,
Tonga, Timor-Leste, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.

policy (RBMs 1.3 & 1.6) with support from IMF’s APD and MCM Divisions. PFTAC PFM Advisors have
also participated in interview/CV review teams for both Australian and EU-funded TA.
A PEFA review is tentatively scheduled for early 2017.
PFTAC is ready to provide additional technical support on budget preparation, cash/debt
management, and other aspects of budget execution. Officials from Kiribati have regularly
participated in PFTAC’s regional PFM Workshops.

Financial Sector Regulation and Supervision
The Resident Technical Advisor is engaged with the Registrar of Credit Unions with the
implementation of the Credit Union Act, which became in force on January 1, 2015. A mission was
held in January 2015, aimed at introducing a credit union financial reporting system. A number of
workshops were held on this topic and the Registrar’s staff received training on how to properly
complete the reports. While the credit unions are being registered with the Ministry, the Registrar is
implementing the reporting program. An additional mission is planned for 2017 to review the
progress of the implementation of the Act and the reporting system. It is anticipated that more
workshops will be held on the subject of financial reporting and analysis.
It was further recommended that Kiribati consider establishing a Banking Commission which could
undertake the oversight of the financial sector. Discussions will be held with the Ministry of Finance
on this approach to sector surveillance.

Economic and Financial Statistics
GDDS metadata was first published on the IMF website in April 2004 and subsequently updated in
March 2013, following assistance by PFTAC. The balance of payments (BOP) compiler benefited from
training provided in regional courses in 2005 and 2010. PFTAC provided TA on balance of payments
in 2008, 2010 and 2012, improving compilation methods and use of source data, as well as
providing training, and helping with the transition to BPM6. From 2012 to 2015, TA was provided on
BOP and government finance statistics (GFS was provided by related IMF JSA projects).
PFTAC has provided regular TA on national accounts since 2008, assisting the authorities in making
significant improvements in methodology and use of source data. Beginning in 2012, PFTAC has
increased its TA with the development of an expenditure measure of GDP and with the preparation
of statistical procedures for the incorporation of VAT data; the last mission was in late 2015.
However, progress has been slow due to resource and capacity constraints. The NA compilers
benefited from regional courses in 2009, 2012, 2013, and 2014. PFTAC also sponsored a one-month
attachment for the BOP compiler with Statistics New Zealand in May 2009.

Macroeconomic Analysis
Two missions in 2011 provided assistance in building capacity related to basic forecasting
techniques, using the medium-term fiscal framework developed as part of AsDB assistance, and
assessing sustainable levels of draw-downs from Kiribati’s Reserve Equalization Reserve Fund.
A regional financial programming workshop held jointly in 2012 by PFTAC and the Singapore
Regional Training Institute provided training in financial programming techniques to two
economists of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development. In 2015 PFTAC supported
authorities during the IMF Article IV consultation and discussed TA and training going forward in
particular following the departure in 2016 of a DFAT funded resident advisor, who is heading the
National Economic Planning Office. Economists from the Ministry of Finance and Economic
Development participated in workshops on incorporating disaster risk into fiscal planning,
forecasting tax revenues and medium-term planning for sustainable development in 2015 and 2016.

BANK-FUND COLLABORATION2
A. World Bank-IMF Collaboration
(As of May 31, 2016)
The Fund and the Bank teams maintain close cooperation in various areas and consult frequently.
During the current cycle, the Bank staff has joined the IMF missions, including IMF staff visits and the
2015 and 2016 Article IV missions. The IMF staff and the World Bank staff maintained continuing
close dialogue on economic developments and all aspects of the government reform program.
During the current cycle, the teams have produced a Joint DSA. The IMF team provided analysis and
advice on the overall macroeconomic and fiscal framework, including fiscal and RERF sustainability.
The IMF and World Bank have also been engaged in provision of technical assistance and advice in
public financial management and debt management and policy. The Fund also provided technical
assistance on tax administration and policy, budget management, and on statistical issues, including
Government Finance Statistics and Balance of Payments. The Bank has been engaged in various
infrastructure projects, including road rehabilitation, airport improvement, solar energy, and
adaptation to climate change. Bank staff provided technical assistance on government expenditures,
reforms of copra subsidy, liberalization of telecommunication sector, and management of the RERF.
During this cycle the Bank has continued to work closely with the government on the
comprehensive program of priority economic reforms and building resilience against external
shocks, and supported coordination of donor TA around the reform agenda. Reforms identified
through this process are now being supported under joint donor budget support, coordinated by
the World Bank, with the third operation currently prepared in close consultation with the
Government and donors.
The IMF and World Bank teams will continue close cooperation going forward, in particular in the
context of the government reform program. As agreed earlier, the Fund will continue to lead on
macro issues, in particular overall macroeconomic framework, including in the medium-and-longer
term, and the Bank on macro-critical structural reform issues. The Fund and the Bank staff will also
continue to cooperate with regard to follow up TA, including on the RERF management and public
financial and debt management.

B. Relations with the World Bank Group
Kiribati became a member of the World Bank Group (WBG) in 1986. Since then, the WBG has
provided strong support to Kiribati, including 13 IDA/ IBRD, Global Environment Fund, and
Institutional Development Fund projects in different sectors totaling US $114 million.

The World Bank is currently preparing a Regional Partnership Framework for 9 Pacific Islands,
including Kiribati. The new Framework will focus around three broad themes: (i) fully exploiting the
limited set of economic opportunities available to the PIC9, (ii) enhancing access to public services
and employment opportunities; and, (iii) protecting incomes and livelihoods.
Both IDA and IFC are significantly increasing engagement. Consistent with Kiribati’s limited
repayment capacity highlighted in the DSA, IDA-financing are being provided on 100 percent grant
terms. IFC is playing an important role in strengthening investment climate in countries across the
Pacific, and is similarly scaling up technical assistance to Kiribati to strengthen the business
environment and to support specific PPP transactions or asset sales as the government moves to
rationalize SOEs.
Key components of WBG engagement include:


Supporting better fiscal and natural resource management. Through a programmatic budget
support operation, the World Bank has supported the Government’s implementation of a
medium-term strategy to restore the country’s fiscal sustainability. The first and second
operations have been completed in 2014–15. The third and fourth operations are currently being
prepared in close consultation with the Government and other donors. The operations will
support two main policy priorities—first, fiscal sustainability by encouraging greater
transparency in managing fisheries revenue and the RERF, and second, private sector led growth
by improving the quality and expanding the coverage of essential public services (electricity,
water, sewage, and telecommunications).



Improving connective infrastructure. To mitigate Kiribati’s geographical disadvantage, the World
Bank has scaled up support for basic infrastructure that connects the people of Kiribati to the
outside world. Infrastructure investments integrating climate change adaptation planning has
started in parallel with efforts to develop coordinated and more comprehensive multi-donor
adaptation interventions. A South Tarawa road improvement investment (US$26 million in IDA
and Trust Fund financing) is being undertaken jointly with the Asian Development Bank. The
World Bank has also mobilized significant grant resources with New Zealand and other
development partners to help bring Kiribati airports up to international safety standards.



Building climate resilience. Since 2003, the World Bank has been supporting climate change
mitigation through the Kiribati Adaptation Program, with activities such as seawall construction,
mangrove planting, and water conservation. Beyond climate change adaptation, the World Bank
has been committed to addressing wider issues of vulnerability in Kiribati, including supporting
renewable energy generation to reduce reliance on volatile imported diesel.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK3
The Asian Development Bank has approved eight project loans to Kiribati amounting to
US$34.7 million, all from Asian Development Fund (ADF) resources since Kiribati joined the AsDB in
1974. In addition, TA amounting to US$37.3 million has been provided for 46 projects. The latest
AsDB loan to Kiribati, for South Tarawa Sanitation Improvement Sector project, was approved in
October 2011. The AsDB most recently approved an US$0.8 million TA grant for enhancing
economic competitiveness through state-owned enterprise (SOE) reform in October 2013.
In line with the broad objective of the Kiribati Development Plan 2016-19, which focuses on a better
educated, healthier, more prosperous nation with a higher quality of life, ADB’s engagement aims to
strengthen governance, improve infrastructure, maintain a stable macroeconomic framework,
improve access to basic services, strengthen climate change adaptation and reduce poverty. As
many infrastructure services are provided by SOEs, improving corporate governance arrangements
and the commercial focus of these enterprises is a key objective of ADB’s support to the
government’s structural reform program. Technical assistance to improve economic management
and public sector reform has helped improve SOE performance. In October 2011, ADB approved a
loan for the South Tarawa Sanitation Improvement Sector Project that has improved sanitation and
hygiene practices in South Tarawa and will increase access to sanitation from 64 percent to
80 percent by 2019. Additional financing of $610,000 was approved in 2014. The Road Rehabilitation
Project, approved in December 2010, has rehabilitated 32.5 kilometers of main roads and about
8 kilometers of feeder roads on South Tarawa. Additional financing of $8.4 million in 2015 and 2016
will help complete the rehabilitation and allow the upgrade of the road network on Betio, the largest
township on South Tarawa and the site of the country’s main port. Cofinanced by the Government
of Australia, the World Bank and the Pacific Regional Infrastructure Facility, the project will improve
socioeconomic conditions for the people of South Tarawa. ADB also provided its first policy grant of
$3m to Kiribati in 2014, which focused on helping Kiribati increase fiscal sustainability by improving
public expenditure quality, revenue performance, management of public assets and liabilities, and
the business environment.
ADB’s strategic engagement in Kiribati in the medium term will continue to focus on major
transformative infrastructure investments with the scope to mobilize significant co-financing, and
given the improvement in Kiribati’s fiscal situation, limited policy financing to further build buffers
and demonstrate confidence in the government’s reform agenda.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
(As of July 11, 2016)
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Balance of
Payments and to some extent Government Finance Statistics could be further improved.
National Accounts: With PTFAC assistance, GDP estimates have improved. There was one TA mission in
2015 to improve the national data accounting system, with updates and revisions to GDP data for 2012–
14. However, further capacity building would be needed to continue to improve the quality of GDP
estimates, particularly expenditure-based GDP estimates. Presently, only current and constant 2006 prices
GDP data is compiled using the Value-Added approach.
Price statistics: The monthly retail price index (2006=100) is produced with a short lag (about a month),
based on a survey in South Tarawa (a national index is not available). There are no producer, wholesale, or
trade price indices.
Government finance statistics: A Government Finance Statistics mission took place in June 2014 to
integrate GFS requirements into the ongoing Chart of Accounts and approaches to extend coverage to
include donor-financed projects. The mission also explored possibilities to reclassify existing GFS data for
consolidated central government to create a historical time series. While a complete review of government
units, statutory extra budgetary units, and state-owned enterprises (SOE) was completed, a gap still
remains regarding donor-financed project funds. A PEFA review is tentatively scheduled for early 2017.
Monetary statistics: The balance sheets of all the financial institutions (Bank of Kiribati, Development
Bank of Kiribati, Kiribati Provident Fund, and Kiribati Insurance Corporation) are available with lags, but the
consolidated balance sheet of the financial sector is not available. Data on interest rates are reported with
a long lag.
Balance of payments: Kiribati is part of the Pacific Region module of the JSA project on Improvement of
External Sector Statistics (ESS) in the Asia and Pacific region. Three ESS missions were undertaken during
2014. Data are compiled quarterly in the BPM6 format. However, the quality of the data is improving only
marginally due to capacity constraints, and quality of source data. The shortcomings pertain to
adjustments to trade data, recording of investments income, direct investment and foreign aid data.

August 23, 2016

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION—
DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By
Patrizia Tumbarello and
Peter Allum (IMF) and
Mathew Verghis (IDA)

Prepared by the Staff of the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank

This update of the Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) indicates that Kiribati remains at high risk
of debt distress. While the fiscal position has improved, underpinned by robust fisheries sector
revenue, containing the risk of debt distress will require continued fiscal sustainability through
further progress in structural and fiscal reforms; securing grants to finance the country’s large
development needs will also be needed.

KIRIBATI

BACKGROUND
1.
Kiribati is a Pacific microstate and one of the remotest nations in the world. It consists
of 33 geographically dispersed coral atolls and islands over an ocean area of 3½ million square
kilometers giving the country one of the largest Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs). It has a population
of around 120,000, with the population growth rate projected to decline from the current 2 percent
to below 1.5 percent over the long run. The country’s narrow production and export base, limited to
tuna fishing and copra, makes it highly dependent on fishing license fees and donor support.
Kiribati’s sovereign wealth fund, the Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF), was established
in 1956 from phosphate mining proceeds. Mining ceased in 1979 and in recent years, fishing
revenues have been used to replenish the fund.
2.
Climate change continues to pose significant challenges. Kiribati is one of the island
states which stands to lose the most from the effects of climate change, including but not limited to
drought, heightened incidences of natural disasters, loss of groundwater, and rising sea levels
leading to coastal erosion. This could potentially lead to the relocation of people from the most
affected parts of Kiribati to neighboring Pacific Islands. To this end, the previous government had
purchased land for resettlement in Fiji in 2014. The costs of mitigating the adverse effects of climate
change can partially be met by Kiribati’s operating budget. Capital projects, however, require
continued support from development partners.

THE BASELINE SCENARIO
3.
Under the baseline scenario, it is assumed that the government will continue with
structural and other economic reforms; while the major source of revenue, fishing license fees, is
based on historical averages. The following are the key macroeconomic assumptions used for the
baseline scenario:


GDP and population growth are projected to moderate over the long run. Economic growth is
expected at 3.1 percent in 2016, decelerating to 2.0 percent in the medium term, and
moderating to 1.7 percent over the long run, underpinned by the negative impact of climate
change on long run growth. Population growth is projected to decline from 2 percent to below
1.5 percent over the long run (based on the United Nations’ World Population Prospects).



Prices are anticipated to rise, albeit marginally in the short term but to increase and remain
stable in the long run. Inflation is projected at 1.5 percent in 2016, increasing to 2.5 percent in
the long term. This is in line with trading partner inflation and international food and fuel price
dynamics, given that the bulk of Kiribati’s consumer price basket comprises imported items.



Following strong growth in the past four years, fishing revenue is expected to moderate in the
medium term. Fishing license receipts grew at an average rate of 65 percent during 2012–15.
This is partly due to the mid-2012 implementation of the Vessel Day Scheme and its proper

KIRIBATI

management thereafter; and a stronger U.S. dollar recently.1 In 2015, fishing revenue was
around 97 percent of GDP, however, it is expected to decline to around 45 percent of GDP this
year as the positive effects of the El Niño phenomenon have started to wane. Fishing revenue is
assumed to normalize at around A$100 million in the medium to long term. While staff
projections place fishing license fees at a stable level, it should be noted that tuna is a highly
migratory species, and therefore receipts from the sector can be volatile.


Some improvement in government’s fiscal position in the short run but weak position in the
medium to long term. After registering more than a decade of deficit, the government’s fiscal
position improved since 2013. Overall balance stood at 23.5 and 40.1 percent of GDP,
respectively in 2014 and 2015. This was consistent with government’s efforts to rein-in
expenditure, supported by large external grants; and tax reforms, particularly the introduction of
Value Added Tax (VAT). Fiscal position is expected to deteriorate in the near term due to the
projected fall in fishing revenue. In the long run, fiscal outturns will likely be weaker stemming
from relatively higher spending growth. RERF drawdown is expected to provide 70–80 percent of
government’s financing needs. RERF returns are expected at 3.0–5.0 percent in the longer term.2



External grants are projected to decline from 58 percent of GDP in 2016 to around 30 percent of
GDP over the medium term as many donor-supported projects are near completion, and to
stabilize at around 20 percent of GDP in the long run.



Higher recurrent spending. Operating expenditure is projected to grow at 9 percent in 2016, and
at average rate of 3.6 percent until 2020. In the long run, recurrent spending is projected to grow
in line with nominal GDP. Operating expenditure related to climate change contingencies,
together with new infrastructure maintenance costs are collectively assumed at around 2–
3 percent of GDP.



Development expenditure will fall in the medium term. Development expenditure is estimated at
45 percent of GDP in 2015 with a significant portion financed by external grants and around
10 percent by external borrowing. Development expenditure is assumed to increase to 67 of
GDP this year, average around 37 percent of GDP in the medium term as many donor-supported
projects are near completion, and stabilize at around 25 percent of GDP in the long run. The
grant element of new borrowing is anticipated at 50 percent in the medium to long term.



External balance. The current account surplus widened post 2013 underpinned by strong fishing
license fees; but will weaken considerably in 2016–17 following the projected slowdown in the
fisheries sector. In the medium term, the current account balance will likely improve on account
of relatively higher investment returns from RERF and modest increase in fishing license fees. In
addition, the completion of large donor financed infrastructure projects will see imports fall in
the medium term.

RESULTS
4.
As in previous Article IV findings, the current DSA analysis indicates that Kiribati
continues to be at high risk of debt distress.


Historically, Kiribati’s debt portfolio constituted mainly external debt. On average 94 percent of
overall debt, equivalent to 22 percent of GDP in 2015 included foreign currency denominated
debt, while domestic debt averaged around 3.5 percent of GDP as reflected in the text table.
Government cleared domestic debt by end-2015 with the sale of the state telecom company.
The DSA does not include potential SOE liabilities related to the Community Service Obligations
(CSO).



Sensitivity analyses of external debt alludes to higher relative risk. In 2014–15, the present value
(PV) of external debt rose substantially as a result of increased loan disbursements. The growth
trajectory remains the same however, it will slow down in the medium term. Consequently, the
baseline results show that the PV of the external debt-to-GDP ratio breaches the indicative
threshold (30 percent) by 2026; while the PV of external-debt-to-exports ratio breaches the
threshold (100 percent) after 2036. The expected trend is due mainly to high imports as a
percent of GDP as well as the dependence on external financing for development investment.



Anticipated extreme shocks tend to weigh significantly on external debt stress projections. Under
the extreme stress test scenario, the PV of debt-to-GDP and PV of debt-to-export ratios breach

projected to breach its indicative threshold (38 percent of GDP) before 2031, under the baseline
scenario.


Public debt is unsustainable under the extreme shock scenario. The most extreme stress test
scenario predicts the PV of public-sector-debt-to-GDP ratio breaches the threshold by 2017; and
will likely double in the following decade. This is attributed to higher projected borrowings and
financing needs of the government.

CONCLUSION
5.
Risks of debt distress remain high. The DSA results continue to suggest that Kiribati has
limited scope for external borrowing. To build fiscal buffers, immediate to medium term focus
should be on revenue management (tax administration and compliance related to VAT), recurrent
expenditure restraints, financing of capital expenditure by increasing grant element, and progressing
with structural reforms. Windfall revenue from fishing license fees should be invested in RERF to
build its long term sustainability and for intergenerational equity. There is significant scope for
Kiribati to support its fiscal stance and climate adaptation projects through additional finance from
global climate funds, but this may require investment in terms of readiness programs specific to
climate financing modalities, and project proposals and management.
6.
The authorities broadly agreed with this assessment. They expressed strong commitment
to preserving the net value of RERF by efficient management; avoiding non-concessional external
borrowing; strongly pursuing state-owned-enterprise (SOE) reforms; and mapping and following a
prudent fiscal path.

Statement by Barry Sterland, Executive Director for Kiribati
and Chris Stewart, Advisor
September 7, 2016
We thank the staff for their report, the high quality of engagement – both in terms of the
thoughtful analysis as well as the open attitude of the team in their dialogue with our
authorities. We welcome the past and continuing assistance of the IMF, other
international financial institutions and Kiribati’s development partners. The new
Government largely agrees with the staff's analysis and would like to highlight a number
of points.
Context
Kiribati consists of 33 small islands spread over a vast area of the Pacific Ocean; there
is about 4,500km between the eastern and western zones. High transaction costs between
the outer islands and South Tarawa, due to isolation and infrastructure needs, affect
development. Growth to a large extent depends on the fortunes of the fishing industry. Half
the population is located in and around the capital, South Tarawa. The vast majority of
Kiribati is only a few metres above sea level, and having a relatively limited supply of fresh
drinking water, the country is highly vulnerable to climate change as well as both El Niño
and La Niña events. In facing these challenges, Kiribati has a good record of stable
democracy and orderly transitions between governments, social cohesion, good relations
with donors and prudent economic management. Building on recent reforms, the new
Government is also committed to taking a prudent approach to economic management.
Economic Outlook
The authorities agree with staff that the underlying drivers of economic growth are
moderating and risks are generally to the downside. At the same time, upside risks are
present, including growth flowing from continued construction activity at the airport, water
and sanitation projects, and an upgrade to the causeway running between the two most
heavily populated islands. The authorities agree that inflation is expected to remain low.
Fiscal Policy
The authorities welcome the IMF's analysis of the fiscal position, and will carefully
consider the IMF’s advice in putting together the medium-term fiscal framework. The
new Government intends to maintain a balanced budget over the medium term. It will
consider carefully the recommendations to target structural balances, so fluctuations are
treated symmetrically. Some flexibility in the framework is appropriate in order to
respond to large variations in fishing license revenue. The Government also intends to
carefully manage Kiribati’s balance sheet. It intends only to draw on the Revenue
Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF) as a last resort and not for recurrent spending.
The Government has recently announced a number of fiscal measures that will both
improve social inclusion as well as reduce costs in the longer-term. In particular, early
evidence suggests that people are migrating back to the outer islands in response to the
increase in copra prices; this is helping to reduce both economic and social issues in South
Tarawa. The Government has also recently committed to reviewing some expenditures,
including SOEs and public financial management, and is considering civil service reforms

2
including outsourcing. The Government has also provided a modest increase in spending on
education and health to address critical social needs. Furthermore, the 2016 Budget Speech
noted that the Government will seek to increase maintenance spending in the coming years to
a level proportionate with the needs of the nation so as to reduce long-run repair costs. It
should be noted that last year’s increase in public sector wage costs was driven by a one-off
change in the mechanism by which home leave payments were provided.
The Government is undertaking a number of actions to improve revenues. Most
importantly, the authorities are working to improve compliance with the new VAT system.
In particular, the newly established Taxpayer Services Division will work on improving the
collection rate as well as the timeliness of collections. The Government recognizes the
revenue implications of exempting SOEs from the VAT. At the same time, these exemptions
are important in keeping costs down for outer islanders (especially as the exemptions
primarily relate to household necessities). The Government is considering introducing new
measures to widen the tax base.
The authorities carefully consider potential climate change mitigation and adaption
costs and are examining the feasibility of explicitly recognizing these costs in the
budget. This information can already be obtained from the budget and identifying it more
explicitly would help underline the need for assistance. Kiribati has also been at the
forefront of efforts to highlight the need to address climate change on a global level. It will
continue to seek assistance from the international community in adjusting to climate change.
SWF and Cash Reserves
The Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF), Kiribati’s sovereign wealth fund,
has significant financial assets and will be managed prudently for both current and
future generations. Protecting the capital value of the RERF is a key priority of the
Government and the authorities are developing a framework for achieving this. The
Government will consider a rules-based withdrawal mechanism using the IMF’s research as
an input. Since the finalisation of the staff report, the Government has moved AUD$70
million into the RERF arising from strong recent returns from fishing. The authorities agree
with staff’s proposals to maintain a buffer of around 3 months of recurrent spending.
Structural Reforms
The authorities remain firmly committed to their reform efforts and welcome staff’s
acknowledgement of the progress made in recent years. This has made good use of
the technical assistance provided by the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank
since 2009. Beyond the significant reduction in the number of SOEs, there has been a
marked change in the strategic direction of the remaining SOEs towards a more
commercial focus. The Government is currently undertaking the second stage of these
reforms. This has two main elements. First, major decisions affecting SOEs will now be
joint decisions between the portfolio minister and the Minister of Finance, rather than just
the portfolio minister. Second, a number of additional SOEs are in the process of being
privatized. Each of these are at a separate stage but the direction of travel is clear. The
new government looks forward to the negotiations with the corporatized SOEs on the
appropriate size of any community service obligation (CSO) payments now that the
budget is out of the way. In progressing this, it will be important for these entities to

3
improve their competitiveness - especially given that many are now in monopoly
positions.
The Government will carefully assess proposals to promote air transportation and
shipping services. This will help ensure that any expansions are sustainable and the best use
of resources when considered in a holistic manner. Given the complexity of such decisions,
the authorities will also ensure that they seek a number of different perspectives, including
expertise from international financial institutions and development partners.
The authorities agree on the need to address issues with the Development Bank of
Kiribati (DBK) and the Kiribati Provident Fund (KPF) and note that this is under
active consideration. Policy initiatives in these areas will aim to strengthen the resilience of
these institutions while, at the same time, continuing to improve the population’s access to
finance. The latter is especially important as financial development in Kiribati significantly
lags behind that in similar countries. Any expansion of the DBK into commercial banking
will only be done after careful analysis. Likewise, the authorities intend to approach PFTAC
for technical assistance on KPF investment policies and operations, noting that ‘crediting
rates’ provided to KPF members have fallen over time and are subject to periodic review.
Private Sector Development
The authorities recognize that encouraging growth in the private sector is vital. To
facilitate this, the Government finalized a Private Sector Development Strategy in 2015. This
strategy focused on creating an enabling environment for the private sector as well as
generating business opportunities for small-, micro-, and medium-enterprises. This, in turn, is
supported through actions ranging from improving infrastructure and the availability of
capital to updating business registration processes. These tasks remain important today and,
as such, the authorities plan to review progress and update this strategy where gaps are
found. On land registration, this is a long running challenge for both Kiribati and other
Pacific countries given the customary land system.
Longer term, improved educational outcomes are a key plank of the new Government's
plan to help private sector growth. The new strategic plan for the education sector – itself
coming out of the recently released 2016-19 Development Plan – will allow students to better
capitalize on employment opportunities both domestically and overseas, through improving
both the quality of teaching and infrastructure. This has been developed with considerable
input from Kiribati's development partners and intensive business community involvement to
help ensure that students are best suited to workforce. Beyond this, the authorities are
working with Australia and New Zealand to increase both temporary and permanent
opportunities for i-Kiribati workers.
