Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2009 Consultation with Norway
Approved by Juha Kähkönen and David Marston
January 5, 2010
Discussions: Oslo, Norway, November 12–23, 2009. The mission met with Finance Minister
Sigbjørn Johnsen, Norges Bank Governor Svein Gjedrem, FSA Director General Bjørn
Skogstad Aamo, other senior officials, and representatives from labor and business
organizations, financial institutions, and academia. Mr. Bergo (OED) participated in some of
the meetings. A press conference was held at the end of the mission. The mission’s
concluding statement was published on November 23, 2009 and can be found at:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/ms/2009/112309.htm
Staff team: Ms. Iakova (head), Messrs. Meier, Surti, and Tulin (all EUR).
Political situation: Norway’s center-left government coalition won a second term in
September 2009 general elections.
Executive summary: Norway’s economy has returned to growth after a comparatively short
and mild recession. The financial sector has withstood the crisis well, although credit risks
remain elevated. The discussions focused on policies to support a sustained economic
recovery and preserve the stability of the financial system. Staff advocated: (i) a gradual
withdrawal of fiscal and monetary stimulus as the economic recovery takes hold; (ii)
reducing the structural nonoil deficit to the fiscal target within the current term of Parliament;
(iii) effective steps to curb large inflows into sickness and disability benefit schemes; (iv)
further strengthening of the prudential framework for the financial sector. The authorities
agreed with the mission on the key policy priorities.
Context of past surveillance: In line with past Fund advice, the authorities combined tighter
monetary policy with relative fiscal restraint to curb demand pressures during the preLehman boom in the domestic economy. By contrast, past policy advice on addressing the
problem of very high enrollment for sickness and disability benefits has not yet led to a
lasting solution.
Exchange rate: Norway has a freely floating exchange rate. The exchange system is free of
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions
other than restrictions notified to the Fund in accordance with Decision No. 144-(52/51).
Official development assistance: Norway has continued to provide generous ODA,
amounting to 0.9 percent of national income in 2008 and 1 percent in 2009.

domestic financial sector (Figure 1).

2.
The mission’s discussions focused on policies to ensure a sustained economic
recovery and preserve the stability of the financial system. In the near term, the main task
is to manage the exit from very loose macroeconomic policies as the recovery takes hold.
While the overall policy stance should remain supportive, the relatively limited degree of
spare capacity calls for a gradual withdrawal of stimulus. Looking further ahead, Norway
faces the challenge of maintaining strong economic performance under potentially more
difficult conditions. In recent years, the economy has benefited from significant terms-oftrade gains, rising asset prices, benign demographics, and low global macroeconomic
volatility. Going forward, these favorable trends cannot be taken for granted. To maintain the
economy’s flexibility and resilience, it is crucial that competitiveness remain strong, fiscal
space be regained to deal with future shocks and aging-related spending pressures, and the
prudential framework be strengthened to preserve a stable financial system.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
3.
The economy entered the crisis from a very strong cyclical position. Brisk oil
sector activity, rising asset prices, and rapid credit growth had boosted domestic demand. The
unemployment rate dropped to 2.5 percent, despite a rise in labor force participation and
strong net immigration. Rapid wage growth and surging commodity prices pushed inflation
well above the 2.5-percent target by early 2008 (Tables 1 and 2). Output growth slowed
sharply only in the second half of 2008 as the global crisis intensified (Figures 2 and 3).
1

Large offshore oil and gas reserves have underpinned Norway’s rise to become one of the world’s richest
economies since exploitation began in 1971. The sector contributed an average 27 percent to total value added
in the economy during 2005–08, accounting for nearly half of total exports and about one-third of general
government revenue. A large part of the revenue is saved in a sovereign wealth fund which invests the money in
international financial markets.

4

Figure 1. Norway's Relative Performance During the Crisis
Norway experienced a less pronounced recession than
most industrialized economies, including its Nordic
neighbors.

Large policy rate cuts proved very effective by providing quick
relief to borrowers, given the dominance of variable-rate
mortgages.

4.
The downturn has reduced the pressure on capacity constraints, with some slack
emerging in 2009. The authorities responded forcefully to the economic slowdown. They cut
interest rates decisively, adopted large fiscal stimulus, and put in place a number of timely
measures aimed at shoring up financial intermediation (Annex I). At the same time, the sharp
depreciation of the currency in late 2008 supported net exports. Together, these factors have
helped keep the recession relatively shallow and short-lived, despite a softening of private
consumption and a sharp decline in nonoil private fixed investment. On the production side,
construction and manufacturing have contracted significantly and remain subdued, while the
decline in service output has been very mild. Unemployment has increased only modestly to
about 3 percent and employment has held up, helped by continued net hiring in the public
sector.2 Still, measures of labor market tightness and capacity utilization suggest that the
level of output is now somewhat below potential (Figure 4). Wage pressures have eased, and
both headline and core CPI inflation have fallen below the target.

A. Households and Corporations
5.
The private sector is highly indebted. Household debt was close to 200 percent of
disposable income at end-2008, one of the highest levels among developed economies.
Consumers responded to the combination of falling asset prices and rising uncertainty in
late 2008 by raising their saving rates significantly, but improving confidence has recently
caused consumption growth to resume. 3 Corporate debt has also increased rapidly during the
boom years (Figure 5 and Table 3). In the current environment of low interest rates and
continued low unemployment, the debt servicing capacity of households remains relatively
strong, but it could deteriorate if downside risks to growth were to materialize or if interest
rates rose sharply—more than 90 percent of mortgage loans are at variable rates.
2

The share of public sector employment in total employment is around 30 percent.

3

The saving rate rose to 8 percent by the third quarter of 2009, from a trough of -1 percent in early 2008.

Residential house prices have recovered after a short-lived correction, but the
commercial real estate market remains weak. Prices fell 9 percent below their mid-2007
peak by end-2008, but have rebounded strongly since then.4 There is no country-wide index
of commercial property prices, but market reports for Oslo suggest that both prices and
volumes have fallen in 2008 and remain subdued in 2009. Commercial property accounts for
about one third of all corporate loans and the risk on these loans has increased markedly.
Since a larger share of commercial property loans are fixed-rate, interest rate reductions have
provided less of a respite than in the case of household mortgages.

B. Financial Institutions
7.
Wide-ranging policy actions have helped contain the effect of the crisis on the
domestic financial system. Domestic financial institutions experienced a severe liquidity
shortage, although there were no solvency issues. Norway’s banks rely on US dollar
interbank markets—they fund themselves through a combination of dollar loans and crosscurrency swaps. With the drying up of these markets in the wake of Lehman’s bankruptcy,
the availability of term funding diminished sharply and spreads surged. The domestic
corporate bond market also became highly illiquid. To ease liquidity conditions, the
authorities introduced a number of measures, including extended maturities and relaxed
collateral requirements for Norges Bank loans, a swap program to provide banks with
government securities in exchange for covered bonds, and direct provision of foreigncurrency loans. A Government Bond Fund has been set up to support liquidity and pricing in
the corporate bond market. These measures—along with similar steps undertaken in other
economies—have helped stabilize financial markets. Interbank lending spreads have come
down, and demand for bonds has returned.

4

Based on the methodology used in the April 2008 World Economic Outlook, Norway’s house prices appeared
to be 5 to 10 percent overvalued in mid-2009.

11
8.
Financial institutions have also benefited from a stable domestic economy, low
exposure to toxic assets, and a relatively conservative regulatory regime. The strong
macroeconomic stimulus has mitigated the economic downturn and supported borrowers’
ability to service their debt. In addition,

the relative resilience of domestic
financial institutions.
9.
Looking ahead, a cyclical deterioration of credit quality remains a concern. The
banking system has large exposure to cyclically-sensitive sectors such as shipping and
commercial property. In addition, some of Norway’s largest resident banks have operations
in recession-hit neighboring economies, although the exposures are relatively small (Box 1).
Nonperforming loans have increased only modestly so far (from about ½ percent prior to the
crisis to just above 1 percent of all loans in the third quarter of 2009), but could rise further as
the shipping industry faces significant global excess capacity and commercial real estate
markets remain subdued (Figure 7 and Table 4).5 In addition, households’ high indebtedness,
combined with a richly valued housing market, makes bank portfolios vulnerable to adverse
economic shocks.

Box 1. Structure and Cross-Border Linkages of the Norwegian Banking System

The global financial crisis has highlighted vulnerabilities related to cross-border banking activity.
Norway’s banking system is integrated into the broader Nordic market, but cross-border exposures remain
limited compared to other advanced countries. A key risk is the banks’ reliance on foreign wholesale
funding, which caused a liquidity squeeze at the peak of the post-Lehman turmoil.
Banks and mortgage credit institutions (MCIs) dominate Norway’s financial landscape, accounting
for nearly 80 percent of total sector assets at end-September 2009 (Table 5). Partly government-owned DnB
NOR is by far the largest player, controlling almost 38 percent of overall bank/MCI assets. The remainder
of the sector consists of a few mid-sized banks and a large number of small (savings) banks.
Despite significant regional linkages, Norway’s banking system features limited cross-border
exposure by international comparison:


About one-third of the domestic banking system is foreign-owned. This includes a few relatively
large lenders with parents from other Nordic countries. Some of these entities operate through
branches, heightening the risk of spillovers from foreign markets in which the parent companies
conduct business. Indeed, there is anecdotal evidence of some credit retrenchment by foreign-owned
branches at the height of the global crisis.1



Among the Norwegian-owned banks, only DnB NOR has nonnegligible foreign operations. Some
25 percent of DnB NOR’s total lending is outside of Norway, again mostly in the Nordic region.
Around one-fifth of this exposure relates to a Danish subsidiary with operations in the Baltic countries,
including crisis-hit Latvia. Despite significant loss rates from these operations, DnB NOR’s overall
exposure appears limited (text table). More generally, the external claims of the consolidated
Norwegian banking system are rather small by international comparison.

Dependence on foreign funding markets represents the Achilles’ heel of Norway’s banking
system. Norwegian banks rely extensively on short-term funding from abroad. As a result, some banks
faced a significant liquidity squeeze when these markets seized up in the wake of the Lehman
bankruptcy. The Norwegian authorities responded by providing extensive liquidity in domestic and
foreign currency, and creating a covered bond swap program. Nonetheless, dependence on foreign
wholesale markets remains a structural vulnerability.

The Icelandic bank Kaupthing also had a small branch in Norway. It was successfully unwound––not causing
any losses to domestic creditors––in late 2008.

C. Credit Developments
10.
Credit standards have started to ease, although the growth of banks’ corporate
lending remains subdued (Figures 8 and 9). Norges Bank’s survey of bank lending shows
that credit standards for both households and corporations started to ease in the second half
of 2009 after tightening considerably during the global crisis. The growth of credit to the
corporate sector has declined sharply, partly due to weaker demand. Meanwhile, household
credit growth has moderated, but remains robust at an annual rate of nearly 7 percent.
Looking ahead, banks envisage no further tightening of credit standards and expect some
increase in loan demand. Lending rates have fallen broadly in line with the reduction of the
policy rate. Corporate bond issuance has strengthened in 2009, boosted by government
support measures and returning risk appetite.
D. Public Sector
11.
Fiscal policy was relatively restrained during 2006–07, but turned very
expansionary with the onset of the global crisis. The government maintained a broadly
neutral fiscal stance during the period of high economic growth in the first half of its
previous four-year term. This relative fiscal restraint, along with rapid asset accumulation in
the nation’s wealth fund, helped reduce the structural nonoil deficit slightly below 4 percent
of wealth fund capital (the benchmark under Norway’s fiscal guidelines). Policy rapidly
shifted to an expansionary stance as the global crisis set in, with discretionary stimulus close
to 3 percent of mainland GDP in 2009. Despite the simultaneous drop in hydrocarbon and
cyclical tax revenue, Norway continues to post a significant overall fiscal surplus (Tables 6
and 7).
E. External Position

Segment's share in global manufacturing (food) trade
(percent change, 2003-08)

12.
Norway’s external
position is strong. The overall
current account remains in large
surplus, although it narrowed
in 2009, mainly reflecting lower
prices and volumes of
hydrocarbon exports (Table 8 and
Figure 10). In recent years, a
number of Norway’s key
manufacturing and food exports
have gained market share,
indicating continued strong
international competitiveness.
Norway’s net foreign assets have
continued to grow in 2008,
supported by large inflows into
the sovereign wealth fund.

13.
The value of the krone appears to be broadly in line with fundamentals. The
nominal exchange rate depreciated sharply in late 2008 as oil prices dropped and foreign
investors sold Norwegian assets in the post-Lehman flight to liquidity. However, the krone
has steadily appreciated in the course of 2009, recouping most of the earlier losses.
Equilibrium estimates based on CGER methodologies, adjusted for the fact that Norway is an
oil and gas exporter, suggest that the krone is now close to equilibrium (Box 2). The
CPI-based real effective exchange rate was also close to its long-term average in the third
quarter of 2009. The manufacturing ULC-based real effective exchange rate has appreciated
more strongly in recent years, reflecting high domestic wage growth. Given very favorable
terms-of-trade developments, the resulting cost pressures appear not to have undermined
export performance so far. However, continued high wage growth could cause strains in
some export-oriented sectors going forward, especially if the terms of trade were to turn
around.

and the firmer krone, although tight cyclical
conditions are set to reemerge sooner than in many other advanced economies.
15.
The uncertainty around the central forecast is, however, substantial. Mainland
growth could pick up faster if the recent rebound in consumer confidence prompted
households to considerably lower their saving rates again. A more rapid global recovery
would provide a greater boost to exports. Conversely, a renewed weakening of global
demand could undermine the recovery, especially if commodity prices were to fall back
significantly, dampening offshore investment. Staff analysis also shows that spillovers from
financial shocks abroad have a significant effect on Norway’s economic growth (Annex III).
The main risks to the inflation outlook relate to uncertainty about the speed with which
output will return to potential and to exchange rate fluctuations.
Against this background, the mission discussions focused on policies to support a sustained
economic recovery and preserve the stability of the financial system.

20

Box 2. Real Effective Exchange Rate Assessment
Staff estimates suggest that the Norwegian
krone is broadly in line with fundamentals. The
evaluation has been done using the
macroeconomic balance approach (MB) and the
external sustainability (ES) approach (adjusted for
temporary export revenues).

Norway: CGER-Based Assessment
(In percent)

The MB estimates indicate that the exchange
rate is close to equilibrium. The equilibrium
current account surplus is around 14 percent of
GDP, reflecting relatively high hydrocarbon
exports and fiscal balances. Staff’s medium-term
current account projections are in line with this
norm.
The standard ERER and ES approaches
are not well suited to assessing the krone.
These approaches do not take into account the
temporary nature of hydrocarbon revenues,
and incorrectly interpret large medium-term
current account surpluses and net foreign
assets (NFA) positions as signs of significant
undervaluation.
The adjusted ES approach, in turn, points
to a modest overvaluation.1 The adjustment
incorporates the effect of hydrocarbon
reserves depletion on the current account path.
Initially, there is a build-up of NFA. When the
hydrocarbon resources are exhausted, however,
the current account surplus and NFA will
decline. The calculated equilibrium exchange
rate ensures constant real per capita income
from hydrocarbon revenues. The approach
suggests overvaluation of 2 percent, based on
conservative assumptions about hydrocarbon
wealth.2
The ULC-based real effective exchange rate
appreciation has been somewhat stronger in
recent years, reflecting high wage growth in a
favorable terms-of-trade environment.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Macroeconomic Policies
Fiscal Policy
16.
The 2009 fiscal stimulus has
been effective in mitigating the
economic downturn (Figure 11). The
stimulus package was well designed,
with an emphasis on timely and, for
the most part, temporary spending
measures, including stepped-up
maintenance work and new public
infrastructure investment. The
discretionary impulse (3 percent of
mainland GDP) supplemented
automatic stabilizers estimated at
2¼ percent of mainland GDP.

17.
The 2010 budget envisages modest additional stimulus. The choice to expand the
structural nonoil deficit by a further ½ percent of mainland GDP partly reflects the remaining
uncertainties about the strength of the recovery. However, staff noted with concern that many
of the temporary expenditure measures introduced in 2009 have been replaced by more
permanent spending increases, especially for welfare benefits. Given the relatively limited
slack in the economy and high nonoil deficit, the mission advocated strict expenditure control
in the budget implementation and using any positive revenue surprises for deficit reduction.
The authorities concurred that such restraint would also help ensure a more consistent fiscalmonetary policy mix, reducing the risk of excessive exchange rate appreciation. Negative
economic surprises, in turn, could be addressed predominantly through monetary policy.
18.
Looking beyond 2010, there was agreement that a key policy priority is to reduce
the nonoil deficit to the fiscal target. The 2009–10 stimulus has increased the structural
nonoil deficit to 5.7 percent of the wealth fund capital, essentially bringing forward the entire
fiscal expansion originally envisaged over the next decade under Norway’s fiscal guidelines.6
Staff and the authorities agreed that reducing the deficit to the 4 percent target in the medium
term was important in order to strengthen the credibility of the guidelines, help contain
economy-wide cost pressures, regain fiscal space to respond to future adverse shocks, and
6

Norway’s fiscal guidelines require the structural nonoil deficit of the central government to be at 4 percent of
the (growing) wealth fund capital over time. The goal of the framework is to shield the economy from year-toyear oil price fluctuations, while gradually phasing in the permanent income associated with Norway’s
hydrocarbon wealth. In addition to allowing free operation of automatic stabilizers, the guidelines permit
temporary under- and overshooting of the target for discretionary countercyclical measures. As elaborated in
IMF WP 2007/241, the guidelines are broadly appropriate, although staff has cautioned that the implied fiscal
expansion over the next decade will necessitate some tightening over the long term to cover the costs of aging.

prepare for future aging-related spending increases. Indeed, the Finance Minister publicly
announced at the conclusion of the mission that his government is committed to achieving
the necessary fiscal consolidation, and that he had an ambition of completing it within the
current term of Parliament (by 2013). Staff emphasized that the credibility of this
commitment would be strengthened by the early identification of concrete measures. In this
context, the government’s pledge not to raise the real burden of taxation implies a focus on
expenditure-side adjustment.
19.
As a general rule, the flexibility provided under Norway’s fiscal guidelines
should be used symmetrically. The experience of recent years suggests that fiscal loosening
during downturns tends to be much more aggressive than the corresponding tightening during
good times, implying a slight expansionary bias relative to the 4-percent target. Looking
ahead, staff stressed that it was crucial to avoid using the full resource envelope implied by
the fiscal guidelines at times of cyclical strength and/or unusually high growth in the fund
capital. The authorities agreed and noted that there had been an effort to restrain budget
deficits during the boom years.

To preserve long-term fiscal sustainability and increase labor supply, the
pension reform will need to be supplemented by adjustments in the sickness and
disability benefit schemes. Despite the strong current state of Norway’s public finances, the

21.
Staff recommended tighter conditionality and enhanced incentives for employees
and employers to improve the targeting of benefit schemes. Sickness benefits currently
accrue at 100 percent of salaries (up to a cap) and are paid by employers for the first 16 days
and by social security thereafter. In line with OECD recommendations, reform efforts could
combine stronger oversight by social security physicians, extended employer co-financing,
7

Based on the authorities’ projections in the 2010 budget, a financing gap on the order of 6 percent of mainland
GDP will emerge by 2060, even after successful implementation of the pension reform. Although these
projections are highly sensitive to specific assumptions about oil prices, asset returns, and labor market trends,
the projection underscores the need for continued fiscal prudence.

and possibly a moderate reduction in salary replacement rates. Disability benefits should be
subject to tighter eligibility requirements, along with more frequent use of partial and
temporary benefit awards. The authorities agreed with staff on the urgency of the problem
and noted that they are seeking concrete steps to reduce benefit enrollment rates in their
negotiations with social partners under the Inclusive Workplace Agreement (to be renewed
by March 2010).

standards. As noted
in recent Norges Bank communications, this tax distortion could be a contributing factor to
the rich valuation of housing and the high mortgage debt levels in Norway.8 To promote
efficient private investment decisions and attenuate macroeconomic risk, staff recommended
a gradual increase in real estate taxes offset by tax reductions elsewhere. The authorities
agreed that such an approach had a theoretical appeal and pointed to changes in the 2010
budget that will bring tax assessments more closely in line with market valuations of
housing. Staff welcomed these changes, but noted that as a result of an increase in the taxfree threshold, the net effect was nonetheless a further small cut in effective real estate taxes.
Monetary Policy
23.
Norges Bank responded appropriately to the sharp turn of events in 2008–09 by
switching from a fairly tight to a very loose stance within a few months. Through a rapid
series of cuts, rates were brought down to a historic low of 1.25 percent by June 2009. The

8

This view is consistent with the findings of a recent FAD Board paper “Debt Bias and Other Distortions—
Crisis-Related Issues in Tax Policy” (SM/09/129, May 2009).

25
expansionary stance has had a considerable stabilizing effect on activity by providing quick
relief to the household sector, whose debt is predominantly at variable rates.
24.
Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term before gradually returning
to target. CPI inflation has recently fallen to 2 percent, although core measures have
remained closer to the 2.5 percent target. A strengthening exchange rate, moderating wage
growth, and still-subdued demand conditions are expected to keep inflation low over coming
months. Looking further ahead, inflation trends will depend on the speed with which the
economy returns toward potential and on future exchange rate developments. Under staff’s
central scenario, inflation would gradually converge to target by end-2011 (Figure 12).
Consistent with this outlook, medium-term inflation expectations have remained wellanchored, underscoring the credibility of Norway’s monetary policy framework.
25.
The strengthening macroeconomic outlook calls for a gradual move to a tighter
stance in the coming months. Reflecting Norway’s more favorable cyclical position,
Norges Bank was among the first central banks to start raising rates again, with two
consecutive 25 basis point hikes in October and December 2009. Prospects for a continued
economic recovery, a relatively tight labor market, and the macroeconomic risks associated
with strong house price appreciation all warrant some further normalization of policy rates
over the coming quarters, as foreshadowed in recent Norges Bank communications.
However, the tightening should be gradual to avoid undermining the recovery amid stillsignificant uncertainty. Staff also noted that policy rates above the lower bound and a wellfunctioning transmission mechanism imply that monetary policy remains a powerful tool to
deal with possible negative demand shocks.
B. Strengthening the Financial System

weaker profitability in commercial
real estate may also prompt higher credit losses. These two sectors together account for about
half of all commercial loans.
27.
Another potential vulnerability is the high household indebtedness, combined
with a richly valued housing market. Banks view mortgage loans as individually safe,
given full recourse and historically low default rates. In fact, nearly a quarter of all newly
originated mortgages, excluding refinancing, have loan-to-value ratios above 100 percent.
However, there is a considerable systemic risk: even if households continue to service their
mortgages in the case

of a negative economic shock, the implied retrenchment of consumption could amplify the
downturn, with adverse effects on banks’ broader credit portfolios. To contain this risk, staff
recommended the introduction of targeted prudential measures, along with a phasing-out of
the existing large tax incentives for housing investment. The authorities agreed in principle
with the need for macroprudential safeguards.
28.
Against this backdrop, banks have taken steps to raise additional capital in
recent months. In September 2009, a number of institutions announced their intention to
raise capital, both from private sources and from the State Finance Fund.9 Stress tests
reported in Norges Bank’s December 2009 Financial Stability Report suggest that under its
baseline macroeconomic scenario (which is close to staff’s projections), bank capitalization
will remain quite strong. Even in the very low-probability stress scenario, the tier 1 ratio for
all large banks would remain above the regulatory minimum over the next three years
(Annex IV). Overall, with the strengthening of capital buffers, banks sector appear well
placed to absorb possible credit losses, while maintaining credit provision for worthy
borrowers.
29.
There is scope for further strengthening of Norway’s general prudential
framework. Norway already implements all relevant European Union directives. Given the
regional character of the Nordic financial market, there is a case for seeking even higher
common standards across the region where appropriate. A key lesson from the crisis is that
there should be greater emphasis on the management of liquidity risks. In addition, excessive
balance sheet growth needs to be restrained, for example through the adoption a maximum
gross leverage ratio. The authorities confirmed their support for EU-wide initiatives in these
areas, and emphasized that any further enhancements in the prudential framework would be
most effective if implemented simultaneously across the whole Nordic region.
30.
The crisis has also highlighted the need for close cross-country cooperation in
the supervision, regulation, and resolution of internationally active banks. The
Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) on cross-border financial stability and the agreements
within the Nordic-Baltic region and between Norway and the European Union should
provide a good foundation for close collaboration. The authorities agreed with staff that it
would be especially important for supervisors and regulators across countries to join forces to
identify emerging problems early and take coordinated preventive action.
31.
With the normalization of market conditions, most crisis measures have already
been phased out. The provision of longer-term NOK loans and exceptional foreignexchange funding contributed to the stabilization of market conditions, allowing Norges
Bank to stop these operations in early 2009. In October 2009, Norges Bank announced that
the temporary relaxation of collateral requirements would be reversed shortly. Finally, the

The authorities set up the State Finance Fund in early 2009 to provide public capital to qualifying banks on a
voluntary basis. Thirty four banks, accounting for 15 percent of total assets of the banking system, applied for a
total of NOK 6.7 billion (US$1.16 billion) of public capital by the end-September deadline. Separately, two of
the largest banks—DnB Nor and Sparebank 1 SR—have announced plans to raise US$2.6 billion through rights
issues and private placements (increasing their respective capital ratios by about 1½–2 percentage points).

government's covered bond swap program, which had exhausted about two-thirds of the
maximum allocation, was terminated in late 2009. Staff welcomed these timely exit decisions
and suggested that plans should be made for winding down the corporate bond purchase
program.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
The Norwegian economy has already returned to growth after a relatively mild
recession. The economy’s resilience has been bolstered by substantial fiscal and monetary
stimulus, strong activity in the oil and gas sector, limited dependence on the hardest-hit
segments of manufacturing, high public-sector employment, and a relatively stable financial
system.
33.
Looking ahead, the economic recovery is expected to continue. Mainland real
GDP is projected to grow at around 2¼ percent in 2010, with private domestic demand
progressively replacing public spending as the main driver of growth. Private consumption
should strengthen as households continue to benefit from low interest rates, steady
employment, and higher asset prices. A turn in the inventory cycle should also support
activity. Uncertainty about the strength of the global recovery is the main risk to the outlook.
34.
Model-based assessments suggest that the value of the krone is broadly in line
with fundamentals. In addition, the CPI-based real effective exchange rate was close to its
long-term average in the third quarter of 2009. However, the manufacturing ULC-based real
effective exchange rate has appreciated more strongly in recent years, reflecting high
domestic wage growth is a favorable terms-of-trade environment. Continued increase in
wage costs could cause strains in some export-oriented sectors in the future, especially if the
terms of trade were to turn around.
35.
The large fiscal stimulus implemented in 2009 has been effective in softening the
economic downturn, but may prove difficult to rein in. The 2009 stimulus was timely and
well-designed, with an emphasis on expenditure measures. However, it is unfortunate that
many of the temporary spending measures introduced in 2009 have been replaced by more
permanent expenditure increases in the 2010 budget. The expected rise in social security
spending is particularly large. Given the relatively limited slack in the economy and the high
nonoil deficit, strict expenditure control in the 2010 budget implementation is warranted. In
particular, any upside surprises to revenue should be used to reduce the deficit. Spending
restraint will also help ensure a consistent fiscal-monetary policy mix.
36.
In the medium term, a steady reduction of the nonoil deficit will be appropriate
as the economic recovery takes hold. To reaffirm commitment to the fiscal guidelines,
regain flexibility for discretionary action in response to adverse shocks, and help preserve
competitiveness, future budget plans should aim to reduce the structural nonoil deficit to the
4-percent target, preferably within the current term of Parliament. The credibility of fiscal
plans will be enhanced by the early identification of concrete measures to achieve the desired
consolidation. An emphasis on expenditure-side measures, as implied by the government’s
commitment not to raise the real level of taxes, appears appropriate.

29
37.
Effective reform of the sickness and disability benefit schemes will be critical to
contain expenditure growth. The authorities’ pension reform appropriately aims to
encourage longer working lives and contain the rise of pension outlays by tying benefits to
demographic developments. For the reform to be successful in achieving these goals,
however, it will need to be supplemented by concrete steps to curb the very high inflows into
sickness and disability benefit schemes. Measures have to be geared toward improving the
incentives of employees and employers, in both the private and the public sector, and could
include greater use of cost-sharing and increased reliance on specialized social insurance
physicians in assessing and verifying eligibility for benefits.
38.
Once deficits have been brought down to 4 percent, the flexibility to deviate
temporarily from the fiscal target for stabilization purposes should be used more
symmetrically. Norway’s fiscal guidelines provide a good general fiscal framework. In their
implementation, it is important to aim for a more restrictive fiscal stance during periods of
strong economic activity to ensure that the 4-percent target is met over time. Excessive
public spending can push up already-high cost levels further, with adverse consequences for
the competitiveness of the broader economy.
39.
Given the relatively favorable cyclical position of Norway’s economy, Norges
Bank appropriately has been one of the first central banks to start raising rates again.
The strengthening outlook, a relatively tight labor market, and the macroeconomic risks
implied by strong house price appreciation all point to the need for a continuing withdrawal
of the extraordinary monetary stimulus in the period ahead, as envisaged in the October 2009
monetary policy report. Nonetheless, the tightening should proceed at a gradual pace to avoid
undermining the economic recovery.
40.
The financial system has weathered the global financial crisis well, but
vulnerabilities remain. The timely measures taken by the authorities to support liquidity and
bank capital have helped limit the domestic fallout from the global crisis. Norway’s financial
institutions have also benefited from a robust domestic economy, low exposure to toxic
assets, and a sound prudential framework. However, a further deterioration of credit quality
in shipping and commercial real estate remains a risk. Against this backdrop, recent efforts to
increase capital buffers in the banking system are welcome. With stronger capital positions,
banks should be able to absorb possible credit losses, while maintaining credit provision for
worthy borrowers. To contain the macroprudential risks associated with high household debt
and high loan-to-value ratios for mortgage loans, targeted prudential measures could be
considered. The distortion that arises from large existing tax incentives for housing
investment also needs to be addressed directly, for example through an increase of property
taxes offset by tax reductions elsewhere.
41.
Further strengthening of the prudential framework and closer cross-country
cooperation in supervision and regulation will enhance the resilience of the financial
system. Efforts in this area should be based on international practices as promulgated by the
Basel Committee and embodied in amended European Union Directives. Given the regional
character of the Nordic financial market, close coordination with Norway’s neighbors could
be used to ensure higher common standards as appropriate. In this context, particular priority
should be placed on strengthening the management of liquidity risks. To limit excessive

30
balance sheet growth, supplementing existing capital adequacy rules with a maximum gross
leverage ratio could be considered. Finally, enhanced cross-country cooperation would help
identify emerging problems early and take coordinated preventive action.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the usual 24-month cycle.

ANNEX I. AUTHORITIES’ RESPONSE TO THE CRISIS10
Macroeconomic policies


Between October 2008 and June 2009, Norges Bank cut the policy rate by 450 basis
points to 1.25 percent.



The revised 2009 Budget programs discretionary fiscal stimulus equivalent to
3 percent of mainland GDP. An additional 0.6 percent of mainland GDP is foreseen in
the 2010 budget.

Measures to shore up banks’ NOK liquidity position


In October 2008, Norges Bank eased collateral requirements—by waiving
requirements related to minimum credit ratings, listing on an exchange, and minimum
volumes outstanding—to increase banks’ access to its liquidity facilities. In
October 2009, Norges Bank announced its intention to reverse these changes in the near
future.



In order to ease banks’ funding operations, the authorities created a NOK 350 billion
bond swap program under which banks could obtain government securities in
exchange for covered bonds. The securities could be sold, used as collateral for
obtaining funding, or just kept to strengthen the balance sheet of the banks. The program
was phased out in December 2009, with a total utilization of NOK 230 billion.



In order to ease liquidity conditions for small banks, Norges Bank established a
longer-term F-Loan program, with maturities up to three years. The last such auction
took place in February 2009.



Norges Bank temporarily provided NOK liquidity through cross-currency swaps.



The Norwegian government granted a special deposit guarantee to depositors in the
Norwegian branch of Kaupthing Bank up to the amount guaranteed by the Icelandic
deposit guarantee scheme. In the event, Kaupthing’s Norwegian assets were sufficient to
cover all liabilities.

Measures to reduce stress in US$ funding markets


Backed by a swap agreement with the U.S. Federal Reserve, Norges Bank provided
banks with US$ liquidity through cross-currency swaps and term loans (with
maturity of 84 days). The program was discontinued in October 2009.

Measures to strengthen banks’ capital and avert a credit crunch
In March 2009, the government set up the State Finance Fund to provide core capital
support of up to NOK 50 billion to banks. The public capital injection takes the form of
Tier I preference shares or hybrid Tier I capital. 34 banks applied for a total of NOK
6.7 billion from the Fund by the September 30 deadline. The capital injections are
scheduled to be finalized by January 15, 2010.

40


In March 2009, the government also created the Government Bond Fund in order to
address illiquidity in the domestic corporate bond market. The Fund is buying corporate
bonds in the primary and secondary markets up to a maximum amount of NOK
50 billion. As of August 17, the Fund had invested NOK 6.2 billion.



The government increased the export guarantee scheme of the central government
export guarantee agency (GIEK) by NOK 50 billion. It also extended a loan agreement
for NOK 50 billion to Eksportfinans (semi-private export finance institution) to support
the extension of CIRR-loans.

Measures to curb disruptive market speculation
A ban on short-selling of bank and insurance sector shares was imposed in October 2008 in
order to prevent excess market volatility. The ban was lifted in September 2009.

ANNEX II. COLLAPSE THEN—CALM TODAY: WHAT HAS CHANGED SINCE THE 1988–93
BANKING CRISIS?11
Norway’s banking system suffered a protracted crisis during 1988-93, which at its peak led
to the nationalization of three large banks. Recent years have seen a credit and asset price
boom reminiscent of developments leading up to that earlier crisis. Why then has Norway
fared so much better during the latest global financial turmoil? This annex highlights
improvements in risk management and prudential standards, yet the key difference is a more
flexible and responsive macroeconomic framework. Even so, the banking system faces
important vulnerabilities today, underscoring the need for policymakers to remain vigilant
and heed the lessons from past crises.
Mounting losses on bad loans pushed Norway’s banking system into financial crisis two
decades ago. The crisis started with an economic slowdown amid sharply falling real estate
prices in 1988. It initially affected only smaller banks, whose failures could be handled by
the existing private bank guarantee funds. Over time, however, larger banks also came under
pressure, especially from their sizeable exposures to commercial real estate. By the fall
of 1991, the rate of bad loans had risen to 9 percent, and the country’s three largest
commercial banks—accounting for more than half of total lending—had effectively depleted
most or all of their equity capital. In its rescue operation, the government wiped out private
shareholders (though none of the creditors, including those with subordinated claims), and
recapitalized the banks under public ownership. Loan losses continued to rise for another
year, and more public capital was injected in 1992, but conditions started gradually
improving from there.
The crisis followed several years of a credit-fuelled asset boom in a newly deregulated
market. In 1984, the authorities started to phase out long-standing regulations that had put
limits on credit growth. Large pent-up loan demand subsequently coincided with strong
competition among banks and low real interest rates, driving real credit growth up
above 20 percent. The credit boom fueled, and was in turn reinforced by, a surge in real
estate prices, especially for commercial property. Yet, banks were conducting their expansion
from a limited capital base, including strong reliance on subordinated debt instruments. At
the same time, supervisory standards were lagging behind, reflecting the long history of a
relatively safe and sheltered banking system. Indeed, on-site supervision had been all but
abandoned in favor of off-site monitoring by the mid-1980s.
Norway’s most recent credit and asset price boom bears some parallels with trends in
the mid-1980s, but the banking system has avoided a solvency crisis this time.
Residential house prices rose by a cumulative 50 percent in real terms from end-2003
through end-2007, underpinned by real credit growth on the same order of magnitude. As a
result, household debt reached 190 percent of disposable income by end-2007, one of the
highest ratios among OECD countries. Although data on commercial real estate are more
limited, there are clear indications that the boom in this market was even stronger. The trend
11

42
only turned when successive interest rate hikes and a weaker economy significantly cooled
demand in late 2007, prompting a correction in prices (if only short-lived in the case of the
residential market). Still, banks have not faced any significant asset quality problems during
the current downturn, and have maintained capital adequacy even as many of their peers in
other advanced economies suffered severe solvency risks.
The system’s resilience today is partly due to lessons learnt from the previous crisis. On
the regulatory side, the crisis of the early 1990s ushered in a period of relative conservatism.
Although generally following Basle and European Union standards, the Norwegian
authorities imposed slightly tighter constraints on domestic banks in some areas. They have
limited, for example, banks’ freedom to count subordinated debt toward their capital
requirements, ensuring better average quality of bank capital. In addition, the FSA has
maintained a strong emphasis on capital buffers above minimum requirements, while
practicing a conservative approach to the approval of IRB models. Similarly, the authorities
have taken a restrictive approach on securitization, effectively precluding any issuance of
products other than covered bonds. The greater conservatism on the regulator’s side may
have been matched by a relatively cautious practice in banks, as at least some of the risk
managers in charge today still have personal memories of the previous crisis. Thus,
Norwegian banks did not have, for instance, any significant exposure to the toxic foreign
securities which triggered the global financial crisis. Corporate borrowers, in turn, have
generally maintained higher equity ratios than during the 1980s, providing a buffer for
adverse shocks and limiting loan losses during the downturn.
However, some of the earlier tightening of prudential standards and risk management
practices has been partially reversed in recent years. Although the Norwegian authorities
adopted a particularly conservative approach following Norway’s financial crisis of 1988–93,
some of this extra conservatism may have gradually worn off again under pressure from
regulatory competition associated with foreign bank branches operating in Norway. A
relevant example is the FSA’s decision in 2001 to reverse an earlier tightening of restrictions
on subordinated debt. Around the same time, the FSA also raised the maximum loan-to-value
ratio for loans with a 50 percent capital risk weight. On the banks’ side, recent years have
seen a boom in more risky lending practices, including mortgages with loan-to-value ratios of
100 percent or more. Many banks also feature quite large exposures to certain vulnerable
sectors, notably shipping.
Indeed, changes in the macroeconomic policy framework are likely to have been a more
important reason for the benign outcome in 2008/09. At the time of the domestic financial
crisis 20 years ago, macroeconomic policy was in the straitjacket of an exchange rate peg
(against the ECU) that provided no room for monetary easing as the economy slid into
recession. In fact, the subsequent rise in German policy rates (to moderate the boom
associated with reunification) imposed a strongly procyclical tightening on the Norwegian
economy at the height of the crisis. Fiscal policy also turned expansionary only in the later
stages of the crisis. This experience contrasts markedly with the swift policy response since
late 2008, which has combined large fiscal stimulus with significant policy rate cuts.

43
The strongly expansionary policy response in 2008/09 kept Norway’s recession shallow,
effectively averting a real stress test of the financial sector. Given the nature of the
residential mortgage market with full-recourse loans at variable interest rates, significant
default rates are very unlikely as long as both unemployment and interest rates stay low.
Commercial real estate markets, in turn, also derive a strong boost from robust domestic
demand and low policy rates, even though the share of fixed-rate loans in this market is
somewhat higher. Accordingly, it is not very surprising that banks have faced limited asset
quality problems thus far. Without downplaying the direct contribution from sound risk
management and regulation, it seems fair to state that the Norwegian banking system simply
has not been put to a very harsh macroeconomic stress test this time.
In conclusion, sound prudential standards and a strong macroeconomic policy
framework represent significant advances, but challenges remain. Despite the greater
resilience of the system, banks are vulnerable to credit risk from their exposures to
commercial real estate and certain cyclically-weak sectors, notably shipping. Moreover,
households’ high debt levels could work as an amplifier of any adverse macroeconomic
shock. Indeed, such systemic vulnerabilities may be increasing further to the extent that the
current low interest rates induce borrowers to ramp up, rather than reduce, their indebtedness.
The swift turnaround in residential house prices, which are now slightly above their mid2007 peak, is one warning sign in this regard.
This underscores the need for policymakers to remain vigilant and proactive, including
in the area of macroprudential regulation. Efforts to preserve financial stability should
concentrate, first, on finding appropriate tools to avoid excessive price and debt dynamics in
the housing market. Monetary policy should take such risks into account, given their
potential to affect future macroeconomic outcomes, but the policy rate alone is not a perfect
instrument. For one thing, tail risks to the inflation outlook (as implied by asset price/credit
booms) will not always guide monetary policy in the same direction as the baseline inflation
outlook. There is, consequently, a case for adopting other tools, including macroprudential
regulation or tax policy measures, to try and engineer a soft landing in the real estate market.
In addition, policymakers will need to maintain high standards of microprudential regulation
and supervision, with continued emphasis on on-site supervisory work and close contact with
top management. Staying vigilant obviously poses a challenge the more memories of
Norway’s financial crisis in the early 1990s recede. However, the experience of global
financial turmoil in recent months surely serves to recall the importance of the task.

ANNEX III. SPILLOVERS FROM THE EURO AREA TO NORWAY—THE ROLE OF FINANCIAL
SHOCKS12
This annex analyzes spillovers from the euro area to Norway through financial and
trade channels. Norway has strong trade and financial linkages with the euro area:

Norway’s banks rely heavily on foreign wholesale financing.

Foreigners hold more than 60 percent of all outstanding debt securities and a
significant share of domestic equities.

The euro area’s share in Norway’s non-oil exports is about 40 percent (with
another 20 percent going to other European economies). Practically all Norwegian energy
exports are destined to Europe, with nearly half going to euro area economies. Import shares
have a similar geographic profile.

The analysis is based on a structural
VAR model. The model includes four
variables: euro area and Norway’s mainland
real GDP growth, oil price growth, and a
measure of financial stress for the euro
area.13 The financial stress index relies on
price movements relative to past levels or
trend to proxy for the presence of strains in
financial markets or on intermediation.14
The index is constructed so that a value of
zero implies neutral financial market
conditions, while positive values indicate

Variables for the euro area and the oil price are assumed to be exogenous with respect to Norwegian
variables. The data cover the period 1991Q1-2007Q4 at a quarterly frequency. The results are robust to the
inclusion of additional variables, such as inflation, the real exchange rate and domestic financial stress.

financial strain. One unit of the index is equivalent to one standard deviation from average
conditions.
The results suggest that external financial shocks have a significant effect on Norway’s
growth. A one unit shock to the euro area’s financial stress index reduces Norway’s
mainland GDP growth by about 0.5 percentage points in three quarters. The final chart
presents a decomposition of the financial shock impact into financial and trade channels. The
trade channel is proxied by the effect of the change in euro area growth caused by the
financial shock on Norway’s growth. The financial channel is the direct effect of the
financial shock on Norway’s growth (excluding the indirect effect working through the
change in euro area growth and export demand). One can think of the latter as Norwegian
banks and corporations facing adverse financing conditions. The decomposition suggests that
external financial stress is transmitted predominantly through financial channels.

Despite the historically strong influence of external financial conditions on the domestic
economy, Norway has weathered the global financial crisis very well. This underscores

ANNEX IV. RECENT STRESS TESTS OF NORWEGIAN BANKS’ PORTFOLIOS1
Norges Bank reported the results of stress tests of Norwegian banks in its
December 2009 Financial Stability Report. The baseline scenario corresponds to Norges
Bank’s baseline macroeconomic scenario described in Monetary Policy Report 3/09. The
stress scenario assumes a relatively low-probability outcome— a very prolonged and weak
recovery and a 20 percent fall in house prices (see text table). Banks incur increasing losses
over the period 2010-12 due to depressed lending margins, low volume growth, and rising
loan losses.

Under the baseline scenario, tier I and equity ratios of the major banks are comfortably
above 8 percent and 5½ percent respectively (see table). More importantly, in the stress
scenario, tier I ratios also are expected to remain well above the minimum requirement of
4 percent through 2012 (see last column). The second column in the table shows the capital
ratios after the recent capital raising effort (by DnB NOR and Sparebank 1-SR). With the
additional capital, tier I capital would remain above 6 percent of risk-weighted assets through
the forecast horizon.

VII. Exchange Rate Arrangement: The present exchange rate arrangement for the
krone is classified as an independent float, following the adoption of an inflation
targeting regime on March 29, 2001. Norway maintains an exchange system that is free
of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions, except for exchange restrictions maintained for security reasons that have
been notified to the Fund pursuant to Decision No. 144-(51/52) (August 14, 1952).
Norges Bank has not intervened in the foreign exchange market since January 1999.
VIII. Article IV Consultation: Discussions for the 2009 Article IV Consultation were
held in Oslo during November 12–23, 2009. The Staff Report will be considered by the
Executive Board on January 22, 2010.
Norway has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Articles
of Agreement. Norway subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard and its
economic statistics are satisfactory for surveillance purposes. Norway is a member of the

3
European Economic Area, which provides for free movement of goods, services, labor,

Norway maintains high standards in the provision of economic data, which are adequate
for surveillance purposes. In some instances, including oil wealth, in particular, the GPFGlobal, and SOEs, transparency is very strong by international standards. For example,
the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy and Statistics Norway regularly publish data on
energy resources and activity while Norges Bank, the manager of the GPF-Global,
regularly publishes detailed (quarterly and annual) reports on the portfolio and
performance of the fund. The Ministry of Trade and Industry regularly publishes state
ownership reports.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation
with Norway
On January 22, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Norway. 1
Background
Norway was affected by the global financial crisis, but less severely than most other
advanced economies. Falling asset prices and a sharp rise in uncertainty pulled down private
demand in the second half of 2008. However, the ensuing recession was comparatively
shallow, with mainland GDP already returning to growth in the second quarter of 2009.
Unemployment has increased only modestly to about 3 percent and consumer confidence
has recovered strongly, in sync with a rebound in the housing market. Still, the economic
downturn has reduced earlier pressures on capacity constraints. Wage growth has eased,
and CPI inflation has fallen below the target.
The authorities’ response to the slowdown was forceful and effective. Norges Bank cut
interest rates by a cumulative 450 basis points through June 2009. At the same time, a large
fiscal stimulus was implemented and a number of timely measures to support financial
stability were put in place. Norway’s resilience has also been underpinned by buoyant activity
in the offshore hydrocarbon sector, limited dependence on the hardest-hit segments of global
manufacturing, and the temporary depreciation of the krone in late 2008.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
The Norwegian financial system has held up well. The authorities’ stepped-up liquidity
support after Lehman’s bankruptcy helped contain the effect of the global crisis on domestic
financial institutions. Norwegian banks did not face solvency issues, the rise in
non-performing loans has been limited so far, and profitability has strengthened in the course
of 2009. Credit conditions have recently started to ease, after a sharp tightening in late 2008.
Banks’ good performance reflects low exposure to toxic assets, a robust domestic economy,
and a relatively conservative prudential framework. Still, credit risks remain elevated as the
banking system has large credit exposures to the shipping and commercial real estate
sectors.
Looking ahead, the economic recovery is expected to continue, with private domestic
demand progressively replacing public spending as the main driver of growth. Private
consumption is projected to strengthen further as households continue to benefit from low
interest rates, limited unemployment, and improved asset valuations. A turn in the inventory
cycle should also support activity, while fixed investment may remain subdued somewhat
longer, and net exports are likely to weaken. On balance, mainland GDP is expected to grow
by 2¼ percent in 2010. Near-term inflation should be kept in check by slower wage growth
and regained krone strength, although tight cyclical conditions are set to reemerge sooner
than in many other advanced economies. The outlook for Norway’s economy is, however,
subject to significant uncertainty related to future developments in global demand, commodity
prices, and the exchange rate.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors observed that Norway entered the global financial crisis from a strong
macroeconomic position and has faced a relatively mild downturn. The economy’s resilience
has been bolstered by effective fiscal and monetary stimulus, a favorable industrial structure,
and a relatively stable financial system. Directors expected the economic recovery to
continue, while recognizing that uncertainty about the global economic environment posed a
risk to the outlook. The near-term policy challenge will be to manage the gradual withdrawal
of stimulus as the recovery takes hold.
Directors considered the large fiscal stimulus implemented in 2009 timely and well designed.
However, they expressed concern that many of the temporary spending measures introduced
in 2009 have been replaced by more permanent expenditure increases in the 2010 budget.
Given the relatively limited slack in the economy and the high non-oil deficit, Directors called
for strict expenditure control in the 2010 budget implementation.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to steadily reduce the non-oil deficit to the
4-percent target as the economic recovery takes hold. Fiscal consolidation will reaffirm
commitment to Norway’s fiscal guidelines, help preserve competitiveness, and restore
flexibility to deal with future adverse shocks. Directors called for early identification of
concrete measures to help enhance the credibility of consolidation plans, and supported the
authorities’ emphasis on expenditure-side adjustment. They viewed the fiscal guidelines as
appropriate but stressed that the flexibility to temporarily deviate from the fiscal target should
be used symmetrically.
Directors commended the authorities’ pension reform, which aims to encourage longer
working lives and contain the rise of pension outlays by tying benefits to demographic
developments. The reform should be supplemented by concrete actions to reduce the high

3
inflows into sickness and disability benefit schemes, with measures enhancing the incentives
of both employees and employers.
Directors noted that aggressive monetary policy easing through mid-2009 has played an
important role in mitigating the domestic recession. The moderate interest rate hikes in
late 2009 are an appropriate response to the stabilization of the situation. Looking ahead, the
strengthening outlook, a relatively tight labor market, and the macroeconomic risks implied by
strong house price appreciation all point to the need for a gradual further withdrawal of the
extraordinary monetary stimulus.
Directors considered that Norway’s financial sector has weathered the crisis well but
vulnerabilities remain. They welcomed the authorities’ targeted measures to support banking
sector liquidity and improve the functioning of the corporate bond market, which helped
preserve financial stability during the crisis. Recent efforts to strengthen banks’ capital
buffers, including through capital injections from the State Finance Fund, will allow banks to
continue lending to creditworthy customers.
Directors saw scope for a further strengthening of Norway’s general prudential framework.
Priorities in this area are strengthening the management of liquidity risks and the adoption of
measures to limit excessive balance sheet growth. To contain the systemic risk associated
with large household debt and high loan-to-value mortgages, Directors recommended
reducing tax subsidies for housing investment and adopting targeted macroprudential
measures. While regulatory improvements should be based on international practices,
Directors pointed out that close coordination with Norway’s neighbors could be used to
ensure higher common standards across the Nordic financial region as appropriate.

Statement by Jarle Bergo, Executive Director for Norway
January 22, 2010
On behalf of my Norwegian authorities, I would like to thank staff for a thorough and
well-written report on the Norwegian economy. My authorities broadly concur with
staff’s analysis.
Economic developments
As noted by staff, the Norwegian economy has been relatively mildly hit by the financial
crisis and the subsequent contraction in world economic activity. Mainland-GDP is
estimated to have fallen by just over 1 percent in 2009, while the authorities project
growth in 2010 to be just above 2 percent – around ½ percentage point below the trend
rate of growth. Employment has declined considerably over the past year, but in
combination with a fall in labor supply, the increase in unemployment has been moderate.
The unemployment rate is currently 3.2 percent (September-November 2009), up from
the very low level of 2½ percent in 2008.
Underlying inflation is currently close to the inflation target, but is expected to fall
somewhat in the coming months, partly as a result of weak international price impulses
and a stronger Norwegian currency. Wage growth is moderated by bleak profits in the
competitive sector, which traditionally provide a norm for wage growth in other sectors of
the economy.
Fiscal policy
The Norwegian fiscal framework aims at a gradual increase in the spending of petroleum
revenues to a sustainable level. Over time the structural non-oil deficit shall correspond to
the expected annual real rate of return on the Government Pension Fund – Global (GPF),
estimated at 4 percent. In the shorter run, the guidelines also allow fiscal policy to be used
actively to counter fluctuations in economic activity. In a cyclical expansion, fiscal policy
restraint relative to the 4 percent spending rule is called for, whereas in a cyclical
downturn, higher spending of oil revenues is justified to stabilize the economy.
After the Lehman Brothers crisis in September 2008 there was a dramatic change in the
outlook for the Norwegian economy. It was necessary to draw on both monetary and
fiscal policy to prevent too strong a downturn in mainland activity, and action was also
taken through targeted measures to reduce the problems in financial markets.
An extraordinary January 2009 stimulus package increased the fiscal impulse from 0.7 to
2.4 percent of mainland GDP. The January package was mainly targeted at public
infrastructure (both maintenance and investments), supplemented by temporary tax
reductions for businesses. In May 2009, in the Revised National Budget, fiscal policy was
made even more expansionary, mainly as a result of higher estimated growth in
expenditures in the social security system and estimated lower dividends from stateowned companies. In the Final Budget Revision for 2009, in late November, the

2

estimated public spending was revised somewhat down and structural taxes somewhat up,
resulting in a downward revision of the estimated fiscal impulse in 2009 from 3.0 to 2.7
percent of mainland GDP.
Uncertainty about future economic developments was gradually reduced in the course of
the summer and autumn of 2009, but risks were still pronounced when the 2010 Budget
was presented in early October 2009. Thus, the 2010 Fiscal Budget included a further ½
percentage point expansionary fiscal impulse.
The extraordinary fiscal escalation to counteract the effects of the financial crisis and the
global recession has brought spending of petroleum revenues to a high level. The
structural, non-oil deficit for 2010 is estimated at NOK 148.5 billion, or 7.8 percent of
trend GDP for mainland Norway. The 2010-figure is NOK 45 billion above the 4 percent
path and in line with the expected real return on the Fund for 2018.
The Norwegian Government has stated that spending of petroleum revenues should be
brought back to the 4-percent path as the economic outlook brightens and economic
growth picks up again. In this way fiscal policy leeway can be restored, and public
finances will be better bolstered to meet the expenditure increases that will accompany an
aging population. Furthermore, a return to the 4 percent path will ease pressure on
monetary policy, reducing the risk of a too strong exchange rate for mainland industries
exposed to international competition.
The fiscal guidelines ensure that the petroleum wealth will make a lasting contribution to
financing public welfare schemes, in benefit of today’s young people and future
generations. The market value of the GPF, including both the international and domestic
part, is estimated at NOK 2 700 billion or 115 percent of GDP at the end of 2009, making
it one of the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds. Nevertheless, the capital in the Fund
is considerably lower than the old age pension obligations under the National Insurance
Scheme. Long-term budget challenges, due to future increases in pension costs in the
National Insurance Scheme and other age-related expenses, underline the need for a
prudent fiscal policy and continued reform to curb growth in public expenditures.
Monetary policy
The Norwegian authorities generally concur with staff’s assessment of monetary policy.
The strengthening macroeconomic outlook calls for a gradual move to a tighter monetary
policy stance. As markets returned to normal, most of the unconventional monetary
policy measures were phased out during autumn 2009. Norges Bank is one of the first
central banks to start raising policy rates, having increased rates by a total of 50 bp in
October and December to 1.75 percent. According to the latest assessments by Norges
Bank’s Executive Board, the key policy rate should be in the interval of 1.25 percent to
2.25 percent in the period up to the publication of the next Monetary Policy Report on
March 24, 2010. After that, Norges Bank projects the key policy rate to be raised
gradually to around 2.75 percent by the end of the year.

The Bank has emphasized that there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the interest
rate projections. Even though the upturn seems to have gained firmer footing both
internationally and in Norway, the pace of the recovery is still uncertain. Higher capacity
utilization or a weaker krone – for instance as a result of falling oil prices - may on the
one hand result in higher than projected inflation. On the other hand, inflation may be
lower than expected if the krone remains strong or productivity picks up rapidly. In an
environment of very low interest rates internationally, higher interest rates in Norway
may lead to an appreciation of the krone. In its latest communications, Norges Bank has
pointed out that “should the krone appreciate considerably more than projected, the
interest rate may be increased to a lesser extent or later than currently envisaged.”
The authorities take note of staff’s assessment of the real effective exchange rate.
Calculations done by the IMF staff suggest a slight overvaluation of the krone based on
conservative assumptions about the petroleum wealth. Such calculations are, however,
uncertain and sensitive to small changes in the assumptions. To conclude with any degree
of confidence that the real exchange rate is misaligned, the actual rate has to deviate
significantly from the estimated rate.
Measured in relative wages in a common currency, the real effective krone exchange rate
has strengthened considerably in recent years and is now approximately 15 percent higher
than its long term average.
Financial stability
The authorities agree with staff that “the financial system in Norway has weathered the
global financial crisis well, but vulnerabilities remain”. Norwegian financial institutions
had limited exposure to risky assets, partly due to sound regulation. Extensive monetary
and fiscal policy measures have limited the decline in activity and bank losses, and it
seems unlikely that the financial crisis will lead to a solvency crisis in Norwegian banks.
Banks are now bolstering their Tier I capital, which will make it easier for them to
procure new loans, bear losses, and provide credit.
Norwegian banks still face challenges. They have to take account of credit risk on loans
to the commercial property and shipping sectors. Also, the household debt burden (debt
as a percentage of disposable income) is high and is expected to edge up. Banks’ loan
losses are likely to increase. However, unless the Norwegian economy is exposed to new
severe shocks, bank results are expected to remain favorable. Stress tests indicate that
banks will satisfy the capital adequacy requirements also in a case where economic
developments prove to be considerably worse than expected.
The crisis has demonstrated the importance of sound financial market regulation and
supervision. Norway has, inter alia, emphasized uniform capital requirements for all types
of financial institutions, conservative treatment of subsidiaries, off balance sheet assets
and securitization, and a single supervisor which combines supervision of individual
entities with macro-economic surveillance. A good deposit insurance scheme helped
avoid run on banks, and it was not necessary to increase the coverage level or provide a

4

government guarantee for banks. Further strengthening of the prudential framework is
foreseen in line with new recommendations from international fora like the BIS and
through implementation of new EU provision through the EEA Agreement. The scope for
Nordic cooperation on stricter prudential rules is also explored.
Pension reform and benefit entitlements
Fundamentals in the Norwegian labor market are healthy with low unemployment and
high participation rates, especially among women and older workers. A key to sustainable
public finances in the long run is to keep labor supply high or preferably to increase it.
This may be challenging with an ageing population and an increasing inflow into sick
leave and disability schemes.
The Norwegian authorities share staff’s concern about the high proportion of the working
population on sick leave, disability and other health-related benefits, and agree that
measures should be taken to bring these numbers down. Together with the social partners,
the Government is currently working to revise the existing agreement on sick leave that
was introduced in 2001. The intention is to reduce the actual absentee level and curb
expenditure growth. Both administrative measures and extended employer co-financing
are being discussed.
The Norwegian pension system is undergoing fundamental reform. An important reform
element is the introduction, in the National Insurance Scheme from January 1, 2011, of a
flexible retirement age from 62 years which is actuarially neutral with respect to
retirement age. A similar reform of the early retirement system in the private sector is
almost completed. However, some elements of the reform are still to be decided on. In
particular, that includes necessary adjustments of disability pensions, where the
Government will present a proposal to Parliament this year based on the Disability
Commission’s report from 2007.
