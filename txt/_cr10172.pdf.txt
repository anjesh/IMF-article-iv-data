EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background and outlook

Sound macroeconomic management, underpinned by strong institutions and good
governance, has sustained Botswana’s strong macroeconomic performance in recent years.
Real GDP growth averaged 4 percent over the past five years, with average fiscal and
current account surpluses of 5 and 11 percent of GDP, respectively, over this period.

However, the current global economic crisis has reduced demand for diamonds and
contributed to a significant deterioration in the economic outlook. The economy is now
projected to contract sharply in 2009, and large fiscal and external deficits are anticipated.
Inflation has slowed considerably and is projected to fall to 7 percent by the end of 2009. In
the medium-term, real GDP is expected to rebound as diamond output recovers, and two
large electricity generation projects begin production.
Policy issues and authorities’ response

In light of rapid growth in spending in recent years, staff raised concerns about the
quality of expenditure and the need to reduce it to a more sustainable level over the medium
term. The authorities acknowledged there was some scope to improve spending efficiency,
but emphasized the exceptional circumstances facing the country in 2009, and explained that
development spending would decline as on-going infrastructure projects are completed.

Staff recommended an alternative fiscal rule based on the nonmining primary deficit
(NMPD) as a share of nonmining GDP rather than the current limit on overall expenditure
relative to total GDP. This would provide a clearer indication of the underlying fiscal stance
and medium-term fiscal sustainability. The authorities indicated that a revision to their fiscal
rule to incorporate a link to non-mining GDP was being considered, but did not commit to an
NMPD target.

Staff concurred with the authorities’ view that the weak outlook for growth and
expected decline in inflation should allow further monetary policy easing.

The financial sector has weathered the global economic downturn thus far, although
non-performing loans have edged up. The authorities indicated that they are closely
monitoring banks’ loan portfolios and will be taking further steps to improve supervision of
nonbank financial institutions.

The sharp contraction in real GDP expected in 2009 underscores the need to
accelerate structural reforms to increase productivity and economic diversification. The
authorities’ diversification strategy focuses on improving infrastructure in key sectors and
investing in education and health to build up human capital and boost productivity.

6
I. BACKGROUND
1.
Sound macroeconomic management, supported by strong institutions and good
governance, has underpinned strong economic growth in Botswana for the past four
decades. Annual real GDP growth averaged nearly 10 percent per year from 1960 through
2008, supported by increased mining production and more recently by stronger growth in the
nonmining economy as the mining sector has matured (Figure 1). As a result, real per capita
income increased from US$250 in 1960 to US$4,800 in 2008 (in constant 2000 US$).
2.
Prudent management of diamond revenues, together with high minerals’ prices,
resulted in large fiscal and external surpluses in recent years. International reserves rose
to 21 months of imports of goods and services by end-2008, boosted by the accumulation of
sizable fiscal savings.
3.
Despite this impressive progress, considerable social challenges remain.
HIV/AIDS is a serious problem, while poverty, unemployment, and income inequality are all
high for a middle-income country (see Text Tables 1 and 2). In addition, the economy
continues to rely heavily on diamond mining, which is expected to decline after 2020.
Greater progress on economic diversification will be critical to sustain high growth and
reduce poverty and inequality.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
After several years of robust growth, real GDP growth slowed to 2.9 percent
in 2008 due to a decline in mining output (Figure 2). Value added in the mining sector
decreased by 3.7 percent in 2008 as demand for diamonds fell sharply in the fourth quarter.
With demand for diamonds remaining weak in early 2009 and a significant amount of
inventory accumulating, diamond mining was suspended from January through mid-April
(Box 1).
5.
The decline in diamond exports, together with a large increase in public
infrastructure-related imports, reduced the current account surplus to 7 percent of
GDP in 2008. This compared with an average surplus of 15.6 percent of GDP during 20052007. International reserves declined from US$10 billion in mid-2008 to US$8.1 billion in
March 2009, equivalent to 16 months of imports of goods and services.

Box 1. Recent Developments in the Diamond Sector
Botswana is one of the world’s leading diamond producers, with a market share of about 20 percent. Production
is conducted almost exclusively by Debswana, a 50-50 joint venture of DeBeers and Botswana; Botswana also
holds a 15 percent stake in DeBeers. Botswana’s diamond production has increased steadily in recent years, and
in 2008 contributed about 40 percent of fiscal revenues, 35 percent of GDP, and 62 percent of total exports. As a
step toward development of a local downstream diamond industry, the Diamond Trading Company Botswana
was launched in 2008 to sort and aggregate diamonds locally.
The global financial crisis caused a significant decline in demand for diamonds in the fourth quarter of 2008 and
early 2009. As a result, Debswana suspended production in early 2009; in April the mines at Jwaneng, Orapa #1
and Letlhakane resumed production, though at reduced capacity, while the mines at Damtshaa and Orapa #2 will
remain closed through December. Diamond prices also fell sharply in the fourth quarter of 2008. Total diamond
production in 2009 is estimated to be 20 million carats, nearly 40 percent less than in 2008. Debswana expects
output to return to full capacity by 2012 as the global economy strengthens, but there is considerable uncertainty
about when a sustained recovery in demand will occur.

The nonmining primary deficit (NMPD)1 amounted to 28.6 percent of nonmining GDP in 2008/09, well above the 16.8 percent NMPD in 2007/08 (Figure 3). The
larger deficit mostly reflected a surge in spending to 63 percent of nonmining GDP from
52.5 percent in 2007/08. Current expenditure rose 12.5 percent in real terms, reflecting a
further increase in the public sector wage bill, while development spending increased by
54 percent in real terms as the government accelerated the construction of airports, roads,
dams, schools and the Morupule electricity generation project. Increased spending also

The NMPD is calculated as the difference between nonmining revenue and expenditure (excluding interest
receipts and interest payments).

12
reflected a public works program to provide income support for vulnerable groups and
measures to offset higher food prices.
7.
The NMPD is projected to remain broadly unchanged in 2009/10. The original
2009/10 budget had proposed a further real spending increase of 4 percent over the revised
budget, which would have raised the NMPD to 34 percent of non-mining GDP. However, the
government has announced plans to scale back recurrent spending by 7 percent and
development spending by 5 percent, which staff projects would stabilize the NMPD at
28.3 percent of non-mining GDP. The overall deficit of 11.1 percent of GDP is expected to
be fully financed by an AfDB budget support loan (US$1.5 billion).
8.
Botswana continues to peg the pula to a basket of the rand and the SDR in an
effort to maintain a stable real effective exchange rate (REER). The rate of crawl is
determined on the basis of the difference between domestic inflation and trading partner
inflation.2 The real effective exchange rate has stabilized since the shift to the crawling peg
regime in May 2005, although Botswana’s higher inflation vis-à-vis its trading partners
resulted in a modest appreciation in 2008 and early 2009.
9.
The twelve-month inflation rate fell to 8.4 percent in May 2009 from 15 percent
in mid-2008, mostly reflecting reduced pressure on fuel and food prices. Inflation is
expected to decline further toward the upper end of the Bank of Botswana’s (BoB) mediumterm (three-year) inflation objective of 3–6 percent. With inflationary pressures easing, the
BoB has reduced its main interest rate by 250 basis points since December 2008 with a view
to stimulating economic activity. The outstanding stock of Bank of Botswana Certificates
(BoBCs), which are used for liquidity management purposes, has declined since mid-2008
due to increased issuance of government domestic debt and reduced foreign inflows.3
10.
Thus far, the financial sector has been relatively unscathed by the turmoil in
international financial markets. Conservative lending practices and limited international
exposure appear to have insulated commercial banks, and they remain well-capitalized,
liquid and profitable (Figure 4). Nonperforming loans are at very low levels despite a modest
increase in late 2008 and early 2009, although a weaker economy and rising unemployment
could lead to a further deterioration in asset quality. As elsewhere, the global financial crisis
has adversely affected the value of assets held by domestic pension and insurance funds, but
these funds remain financially sound and profitable.

The Bank of Botswana Annual Report of 2008 notes that “the annual rate of crawl is determined on the basis
of the differential between Botswana’s inflation objective and forecast inflation for trading partner countries.”

The government issued a total of P2 billion (equal to 2.2 percent of GDP) in September 2008 and March 2009
as part of its P5 billion Government Note Issue program to help develop the domestic capital market.

III. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
11.
Real GDP is projected to contract by 10 percent in 2009 as diamond production
declines (see Text Table 3). Diamond output is expected to fall by 40 percent, reflecting the
marked weakening in external demand since late 2008. The downturn in the diamond sector
is also likely to contribute to slower growth in the nonmining sector, although large public
expenditures for several ongoing infrastructure projects should help sustain nonmining
growth of 5 percent in 2009. A modest rebound is projected for 2010, with a stronger
recovery in 2011-12 as diamond output returns to full capacity. In addition, two large
electricity generation projects (Morupule and Mmamabula) should boost growth after 2012.

12.
The external position is projected to deteriorate in 2009-10, but should improve
thereafter. Botswana’s current account balance is expected to shift to a deficit of 8.2 percent
of GDP in 2009, and widen further to 16.6 percent of GDP in 2010 because of the decline in
diamond exports and an increase in imports related to the construction of the two power
stations. However, by 2013 the current account is expected to shift to a surplus as these
projects are completed and diamond production returns to full capacity. Gross international
reserves are projected to remain at least 16 months of import cover throughout the projection
period.
13.
Despite the rapid build-up of external debt in 2009, Botswana is at little risk of
debt distress (see Debt Sustainability Analysis in the Informational Annex). External debt is
expected to reach nearly 50 percent of GDP by 2012 to finance construction of the two
power stations, but would stay below 60 percent of GDP in the stress-test scenarios. Public
debt would rise to 25 percent of GDP by 2010, before falling to 15 percent by 2014. If
growth and the primary balance were to return to recent levels, however, Botswana would be
able to repay its public debt by 2012.

14.
There are significant downside risks to the economic outlook over the next
several years. Staff considered two alternative scenarios: (i) a larger reduction (54 percent)
in diamond production in 2009 with a slower recovery in international demand; and (ii) that
the Mmamabula project, does not move forward (Box 2). Both scenarios would have a
significant impact on the fiscal and external positions. The authorities broadly shared staff’s
assessment of the outlook and noted there was a risk that a recovery of diamond production
to pre-crisis levels could take several years.
15.
The fall in diamond production expected after 2020 clouds the longer-term
outlook. Although there has been some progress toward diversification, the nonmining
sector continues to be heavily influenced by government expenditure, highlighting the
importance of diversification for sustaining long-term growth and mitigating risks to the
outlook. Improving competitiveness and productivity remains key to achieving broad-based
long-term growth and reducing high structural unemployment.

16
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
16.
Against the background of the global economic crisis, the discussions focused on:
preserving medium-term fiscal sustainability; the appropriate monetary and exchange rate
policy stance; the status of the financial sector; and medium-term diversification.
Box 3. Implementation of Previous Fund Policy Advice
The authorities have generally agreed with Fund staff on Botswana’s main economic
challenges. During the 2007 Article IV consultation, staff recommended containing
expenditure, strengthening non-diamond revenues, implementing recommendations from the
2007 FSAP and accelerating diversification. The authorities strengthened VAT collection in
2008/09, although implementation of the FSAP recommendations has been uneven. Public
spending has increased significantly over the past two years owing to a large infrastructure
investment plan to support diversification.
A. Fiscal Policy
17.
The substantial increase in expenditures during 2007/08 and 2008/09 raises
concerns about its quality. The staff, therefore, welcomed the authorities’ intention to
reduce expenditures from the original 2009/10 budget and focus on improving spending
efficiency. Although spending will remain high even after the cuts, the authorities explained
that the increase in development expenditure is largely temporary, and should decline
in 2010/11 as ongoing infrastructure projects are completed. They also emphasized the
exceptional circumstances facing the economy in 2009/10 due to the global economic
downturn, and considered that the increase in spending would help mitigate the large
contraction in the diamond sector. The authorities acknowledged that the wage bill had
increased rapidly in recent years and pointed to recent measures to limit further growth,
including the decision to forgo a cost of living adjustment in 2009/10. They also agreed that
the recurrent costs associated with the completed infrastructure projects would add to
pressure on current spending, and indicated that they are examining options for more costeffective public service delivery.
18.
The staff also recommended strengthening nonmining revenues over the
medium term given the considerable uncertainty surrounding mining and SACU
revenues. In addition to strengthening tax administration, staff encouraged the authorities to
consider raising the VAT and the fuel levy to regional rates over the medium term. The
authorities indicated that raising the VAT was one of several options, but cautioned that the
higher rate could undermine compliance and increase demand for exemptions. They
observed, therefore, that for now they will concentrate on improving tax administration.

17
19.
Staff recommended that the authorities consider an alternative fiscal rule based
on the NMPD as a share of nonmining GDP. The current fiscal rule sets a ceiling on
overall expenditure of 40 percent of GDP. The NMPD provides a clearer picture of the
underlying fiscal stance and is a better measure of longer-term fiscal sustainability and the
government’s ability to finance ongoing expenditures. The authorities noted they were
considering revising their fiscal rule to incorporate a link to nonmining GDP, although this
could be relative to expenditure rather than the level of NMPD. They indicated that such a
revision to the fiscal rule could be introduced as part of National Development Plan 10
(NDP10)4.
20.
Achieving fiscal sustainability would require reducing the NMPD to 8 percent in
the longer term, based on the permanent income hypothesis (PIH) (see Text Table 4,
scenario (a)).5 To avoid sharp cuts in expenditures that could be destabilizing in the short and
medium term, the staff encouraged the authorities to reduce the NMPD to at least 14 percent
of nonmining GDP within the next five years (compared to the baseline projection of 17.8
percent in 2015/16). This would require keeping recurrent expenditures roughly constant in
real terms, as development expenditures decline once current infrastructure projects are
completed. The authorities did not identify a specific target for the NMPD, noting that there
was still considerable need for spending to meet their development objectives, which could
have a rate of return higher than savings in financial assets.
21.
To improve public expenditure management and increase spending efficiency,
staff encouraged the authorities to consider developing a Medium-Term Expenditure
Framework (MTEF). The MTEF would provide a rolling three-year framework for
implementing the six-year National Development Plans, in terms of which annual budgets
would be formulated. The MTEF should be anchored in a regularly updated macroeconomic
framework that would also provide the basis for growth and revenue forecasts - major
weaknesses in the current process of budget formulation. The authorities indicated that
improving the macroeconomic framework for budget preparation was a priority, and that
they would welcome technical assistance in this area.

5

NDP10 will be finalized later this year, to cover 2009-2016.

The permanent income hypothesis argues in favor of saving excess receipts in order to smooth expenditures as
mineral receipts decline over the medium term. In this model, permanent income is calculated by annuitizing the
present value of expected future diamond revenues. The mission’s calculations are based on keeping the annuity
value constant as a share of nonmining GDP until mining-related wealth is exhausted in 2050.

Revenue projections assume a slow increase in non-mineral revenues and a decrease in mineral
revenues in terms of GDP. Expenditure projections assume that capital expenditure fall after 2010/11
and then stabilize over the medium term.
(a) Assumes a real interest rate of 3 percent. In comparison, the Norwegian Government Pension
Fund has earned an annualized net real return of 4.6 percent since 1997.
(b) Assumes a real interest rate of about 4½ percent. Being more optimistic concerning the return on
assets allows for somewhat larger non-mineral deficits and lower overall balances relative to (a).
(c) Assumes a slower decline in the path of mineral revenues after 2020; this changes the value of the
annuity and thereby allows for higher non-mineral deficits relative to (b). This scenario also assumes
stronger growth in non-mining revenues relative to (a) and (b).
(d) Programming the annuity to stay constant in real terms (rather than in terms of non-mining GDP)
yields lower initial savings and assumes a more back-loaded adjustment.

19
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
22.
The authorities and staff agreed that there appears to be scope for the BoB to
lower interest rates further provided that government spending in 2009/10 is scaled
back as planned6. Inflation is expected to continue to decline in line with projections for
South Africa, from which Botswana imports most of its inflation. The authorities are mindful
that too rapid an expansion in government spending after the large increase in 2008/09 could
add to inflationary pressure and limit the scope for further interest rate cuts.
23.
The authorities indicated that the crawling peg regime has continued to serve
Botswana well. They noted that they are continuing to strengthen their inflation forecasting
model, but were not yet in a position to move to a full-fledged inflation-targeting framework.
Staff noted that greater exchange rate flexibility would be required if the inflation objective
were to become the primary monetary policy anchor over the medium-term.
24.
Staff’s analysis suggests a modest overvaluation of the real exchange rate (Box
4). In any event, there appears to be limited scope for real exchange rate adjustment to
improve prospects for nonmining exports. The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s
assessment, and acknowledged that while ensuring stability of the REER is important to the
competitiveness of Botswana’s nonmining sector, other factors such as raising productivity
by deepening structural reforms, and improving the business climate are also significant.

6

Although the crawling peg remains the primary operational target, the lack of well-developed financial markets
to permit full arbitrage has provided the authorities some scope to retain an independent interest rate policy.

20
Box 4. Exchange Rate and Competitiveness Assessment
The assessment relies on three different but complementary approaches1:



An econometric analysis of determinants of the equilibrium real effective exchange rate (EREER), which takes into
account the real interest rate differential between Botswana and its trading partners; the terms of trade; government
consumption; and relative productivity against Botswana’s main trading partners, indicates that Botswana’s REER was
overvalued by about 2 percent at the end of 2008.

 A forward-looking assessment of external sustainability shows that by 2014 the projected current account surplus
would be below its long-run sustainable level, suggesting an overvaluation of 3-6 percent, depending on the assumption
used for trade elasticity, and highlighting the need for fiscal consolidation. A large part of the projected deficits in the
interim reflect imports related to the two electricity projects.

Structural measures of competitiveness suggest that Botswana continues to lead most countries in the world in various
aspects of governance, but faces declining labor productivity, high cost of trade across its borders, difficulties in business
start-ups, and a travel and tourism industry that does not compete effectively in the region (Figure 5).

C. Financial Sector
25.
To mitigate against risks from the deteriorating economy, banks have increased
their provisioning, focused on lending to established clients and tightened the approval
process for new clients. In the current environment, the authorities concurred with staff on the
need for closer monitoring of loan portfolios and more frequent on-site inspections. In this
context, they conduct routine stress tests and have developed guidelines on supervision of
distressed banks.
26.
Progress on implementing the recommendations of the 2007 FSAP mission has
been uneven (Box 5). There has been notable progress on supervision of the nonbanking
financial sector. The Nonbank Financial Institutions Regulatory Authority (NBFIRA) began
operating in April 2008 and the BoB is planning to transfer various supervisory responsibilities
for nonbank financial institutions to the NBFIRA by end-2009. Looking ahead, the NBFIRA
intends to embark on an ambitious reform agenda—including amending the insurance and
pension acts, designing a risk-based framework for on-site inspection, and collecting and
analyzing statutory returns for off-site inspections.
Box 5. The 2007 FSAP Recommendations
Implementation of the recommendations has been uneven, but there are plans to
address most remaining issues:


Systemic liquidity is being addressed by (i) increasing issuance of government
debt and (ii) strengthening the liquidity forecasting framework.



The authorities intend to amend the Banking Act to grant limited power to the
BoB to vet “significant” and “controlling” shareholders.



Cooperation with cross-border supervisors has improved, and internal guidelines
have been drafted for dealing with problem banks and instituting contingency
plans for crisis management.



A Securities Bill is expected to be tabled in Parliament before end-2009.



Anti-money laundering issues are being tackled through a Financial Intelligence
Agency Bill that makes financing of terrorism a financial offence; the bill was
approved by Parliament in April 2009 and is awaiting the President’s signature.
The BoB will be closely monitoring compliance as part of their effort to address
recommendations from the 2007 World Bank AML/CFT mission. A Financial
Intelligence Agency is to be established at the Ministry of Finance and
Development Planning by end-2009.



The BoB does not yet have full power to supervise stated-owned statutory
banks, while legislation to improve the institutional basis and financial
soundness of Saving and Credit Cooperatives is still to be updated.

23
D. Medium-Term Diversification
27. The sharp diamond-related contraction in real GDP highlights the need for greater
economic diversification. The current downturn offers a window of opportunity for
accelerating the structural reforms needed to achieve these objectives. Key elements of the
authorities’ strategy for diversification are summarized in Box 6.
Box 6. Economic Diversification
The authorities’ strategy for diversification centers on infrastructure investment to facilitate
the development of key sectors:

Mining and energy: The Diamond Hub seeks to increase value-added in downstream
activities such as cutting, polishing, and jewelry making. In addition, the planned Morupule
and Mmamabula power stations aim to take advantage of Botswana’s coal deposits to meet
domestic electricity demand and further diversify exports.

Education and health: The authorities intend to strengthen human capital and
productivity by improving access to education and the quality of tertiary instruction in key
areas such as science, technology and medicine.

Transport, agriculture and tourism: The Transport Hub aims to provide a corridor
to Namibia and improve transport links to tourist areas. The Agricultural Hub aims to
improve agricultural productivity and diversity. A number of new lodge sites have been
awarded and the marketing activities of the Tourism Board expanded in order to support
development of the tourist sector.
28.
Strengthening the investment climate also remains a key priority. Staff encouraged
the authorities to address structural aspects of competitiveness where Botswana lags behind
other countries (Figure 5) and improve access to land and the provision of work permits for
expatriates. Progress on privatization has been limited in recent years, but plans are underway
to privatize the National Development Bank and revise the regulatory framework to facilitate
privatization of several parastatals.
29.
There has been some progress toward reducing the incidence of HIV/AIDS, but it
remains a significant medium-term challenge. The authorities plan to further increase access
to Anti-Retroviral (ARV) treatment, as well as expanding a campaign to raise public
awareness. Reducing the high HIV/AIDS prevalence rate will be key to improving labor
productivity.
E. Data Issues
30. Botswana has significantly improved the quality of economic statistics in recent
years, but there is scope for further improvements, especially with regard to timeliness.

24
31. Staff commended the considerable progress in the balance of payments and national
accounts data and encouraged the authorities to complete the remaining steps necessary to
move from the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) to the Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS). The authorities emphasized their intention to move to SDDS, but indicated a
need to further enhance capacity in order to be able to meet SDDS requirements on an ongoing
basis.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
32. Botswana’s near-term macroeconomic outlook is uncertain, with significant
downside risks. Diamond exports are expected to be sluggish through at least 2010, with large
fiscal and external deficits likely to persist for the next several years. A protracted recovery in
diamond demand would add to pressure on the external and fiscal positions. The two electricity
generation projects should boost output as they come online in 2012–13, but the fall in
diamond production expected after 2020 clouds the longer-term outlook.
33. The marked increase in expenditures in the last two years raises concerns about the
quality of spending, as well as fiscal sustainability. A large part of the increase in
expenditure reflects outlays for infrastructure investment, which should facilitate a return to a
more sustainable level of spending as these projects are completed. The authorities will also
need to rein in growth in the public sector wage bill, however, in order to create fiscal space for
the recurrent costs associated with the completed projects. On current policies the fiscal
position would deviate substantially from the recommended sustainability benchmark,
suggesting the need for a larger than currently envisaged fiscal adjustment in the medium term.
34. An alternative fiscal rule based on the NMPD as a share of nonmining GDP could
be considered. The NMPD provides a clearer picture of the underlying fiscal stance and is a
better indicator of longer-term fiscal sustainability.
35. The weak outlook for growth and easing of inflationary pressures should allow
further monetary policy easing in 2009. A further increase in international fuel prices could
limit the downward trend in inflation, but domestic price pressures remain limited and food
prices should continue to moderate. The limited scope for real exchange rate adjustment, given
the large share of imported inflation, highlights the need for fiscal consolidation to ensure
medium-term external stability.
36. The abrupt contraction in real GDP in 2009 underscores the need for Botswana to
accelerate greater economic diversification. The authorities have significantly increased
spending on infrastructure, education and health, and it will be important to ensure that
outcomes are commensurate with these additional expenditures. Moreover, it is critical to move
quickly on key structural reforms to reduce the cost of doing business and enhance productivity
37. The global financial crisis has not had a significant adverse impact on the banking
sector to date, but the authorities will need to remain vigilant. The sizable contraction
in 2009 can be expected to increase stress on the banking system. The establishment of the

25
NBFIRA is a welcome start, but further steps to enhance its capacity are essential, including
through technical assistance, given the sizable reform agenda ahead. Remaining issues from the
FSAP recommendations should also be addressed.
38. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

III. STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision is adequate to conduct surveillance, but there are some shortcomings.
The accuracy of data, particularly for the national accounts and balance of payments, needs
improvement. National accounts are now prepared on a calendar basis rather than the JulyJune schedule. Historical data have been adjusted accordingly
2.
A ROSC reassessment took place October 31–November 13, 2006 and the report,
along with the authorities’ response, was published on April 6, 2007. Cross-cutting
recommendations were to monitor the consistency of the main macroeconomic datasets and
reconcile differences regularly; establish a list of institutional units consistent with
sectorization in the 1993 System of National Accounts (1993 SNA), to be applied consistently
across all datasets; and support greater use of preliminary data by formalizing revision
policies and implementing regular revision cycles.
3.
As one of 22 countries participating in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS) Project for Anglophone African Countries, Botswana has undertaken to use
the GDDS as framework for the development of its national statistical system. Also, in
preparation for eventual SDDS subscription, Botswana is participating in the monetary and
financial statistics modules of the Anglophone Africa project (funded by the U.K.
Department for International Development (DFID)). This project aims to assist participating
countries to implement plans for improvement identified in the metadata, which were posted
on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board on October 24, 2002. Recent
advances include the publication of the National Summary Data Page on the BoB website
and the dissemination of advance release calendars for key macroeconomic data.
National accounts and prices
4.
Using the production and expenditure approaches, national accounts are now
principally based on the concepts and definitions recommended by the 1993 SNA, in line
with the strong commitment of the authorities to migrate to the 1993 SNA, but some changes
are needed for full observance. For instance, classification and sector breakdowns are still
broadly in line with 1968 SNA. Staff welcomes the authorities recent decision to harmonize
the accounting period for national accounts It would be important to conduct comprehensive
enterprise surveys every few years and introduce estimates for the informal sector. Detailed
recommendations are contained in the April 2007 ROSC report.
5.
The consumer price index is comprehensive and provides breakdowns between urban
and rural areas and between tradable (domestic and imported) and nontradables. The
Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose (COICOP) in the rebased CPI
(September 2006) broadly conforms with the guidelines of 1993 SNA and the CPI Manual,
although there are still deviations with respect to the imputation of rents and owner-occupied
housing. Estimates from the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) are used for
the weights of market expenditure for goods and services. With respect to the wholesale price
index (WPI), the ROSC mission recommended the development of concepts and definitions
to meet the needs of data users. The Central Statistics Office is to decide whether to produce

9
an output index (PPI), an Intermediate Consumption Index or a Supply Price Index.
Currently, the WPI of industrial output is not representative of industrial production, because
it measures changes in the prices of only six product groups.
Fiscal accounts
6.
The concepts and definitions used in compiling central government finance statistics
generally follow the methodology of the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics Manual
(GFSM 1986) but cover only budgetary central government activities. No fiscal statistics are
compiled for extrabudgetary institutions and consolidated central government. The
classification used for budgetary central government partially follows the concepts of GFSM
1986. Detail on some components of current spending is lacking. Transactions are recorded
on a cash basis consistent with the GFSM 1986 guidelines. In general, the statistics
disseminated in official publications are presented clearly and are made available to all users
simultaneously. The data ROSC mission recommended at least annual compilation and
dissemination of GFS for extrabudgetary institutions, and the consolidated general
government. The authorities have yet to decide on a suitable “migration path” to adopt the
GFSM 2001 methodology. The authorities regularly report monthly data on budgetary central
government for inclusion in the International Financial Statistics (IFS), but no data are
reported for inclusion in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook.
7.
The periodicity of central government finance statistics meets GDDS standards,
except for timeliness. It should be noted that information is available to permit compilation
and dissemination of government finance statistics within the GDDS recommendations.
Monetary accounts
8.
The Bank of Botswana’s (BoB) compilation of the depository corporations survey is
generally consistent with the methodology recommended in the Fund’s Monetary and
Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). The survey covers BoB and all other depository
corporations, excluding Savings and Credit Cooperatives, that issue liabilities included in the
national definition of broad money as recommended in the MFSM. Classification and
sectorization are largely consistent with MFSM, except for the classification of financial
derivatives. In addition, some nonbudgetary central government units are classified as
nonfinancial public corporations and accrued interest is not consistently presented together
with the underlying instrument.
9.
Monetary data for publication in International Financial Statistics are reported
regularly using Standardized Report Forms. Although reporting is more timely, data
concerning the central bank are still being reported to STA with a longer lag than those for
the other depository corporations.
External sector statistics
10.
The concepts, structure and definitions of the balance of payments statistics follow
the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Statistics Manual (BPM5). Institutional
classifications generally follow BPM5, although data sources raise minor issues, in

10
particular, administrative sources using definitions and classifications that deviate from
BPM5. Source data are adequate, but International Transaction Reporting System (ITRS)
data, used mostly for services, have become unreliable, and alternative data sources are
needed. Data compilation, estimation, and adjustments mostly employ sound techniques.
However, the methods for estimating missing data and calculating flows from stock data are
inadequate.
11.
Balance of payments statistics are compiled and published in the BoB’s monthly
statistical bulletin and the Annual Report, thus meeting GDDS periodicity and timeliness
recommendations, although only annual balance of payments statistics are reported to STA
for publication. There are discrepancies with national accounts statistics concerning imports,
exports, and payments related to settlements within the Southern African Customs Union
(SACU), mainly due to different data sources and valuation methods. A recent TA mission
has identified gaps in recording of portfolio investments and services.

IV. PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
The public sector debt sustainability analysis (DSA) shows little risk of debt distress, even
under various stress tests. Despite the sizeable increase in public debt expected during 200910, the DSA indicates that Botswana’s public debt would remain sustainable over the
medium term. However, continued large fiscal deficit over the medium term would worsen
the debt indicators considerably, underscoring the need for fiscal measures.
1.
At end-2008, Botswana’s public debt is estimated at about P5.1 billion, (5.6 percent
of GDP). About 30 percent of the debt is owed to bilateral and multilateral foreign creditors,
while the rest is domestic debt. Botswana has a historically low level of public debt thanks to
sound fiscal policies, which has led to fiscal surpluses and an accumulation of government
reserves. However, the global financial crisis and the resulting lower demand for diamond
has contributed to a sharp decline in government mineral revenues. This, combined with a
significant rise in public spending, would result in a large fiscal deficit of 11.1 percent of
GDP in FY 2009/10, which is expected to be more than fully financed by a budget support
loan from the African Development Bank (AfDB), amounting to about 13 percent of GDP.
On current projections, the debt-to-GDP ratio would rise from 5.6 percent of GDP in 2008 to
24.4 percent of GDP by 2010, driven largely by rising external debt and a decline in GDP by
10.3 percent in 2009, before declining thereafter to reach 15 percent of GDP by 2014.
2.
The baseline scenario underlying the macroeconomic framework assumes that the
central government primary budget balance moves from a substantial surplus in 2007 to a
deficit in 2008, and remains so through 2011 before returning into a surplus during 20122014. Revenue and grants are projected to remain stable around 33 percent of GDP in the
medium term, while primary expenditure is projected to increase by 8.5 percentage point of
GDP in 2009, as the government undertakes large infrastructure projects. Expenditures
would gradually decline in the medium term, as ongoing infrastructure projects are
completed. Reflecting the more expansionary fiscal stance, the public debt-to-revenue ratio,
which was 17.1 percent in 2008, would increase to 46.4 percent of GDP by 2014.
3.
Table 1 presents two additional scenarios. The first scenario shows the fiscal outcome
if real GDP growth, real interest rates, and the primary balance are maintained at their
historical 10 year averages. In this case, the public debt-to-GDP ratio would drop to zero by
2012, reflecting strong economic growth, as well as the prudent fiscal stance in the recent
past. The second scenario shows the outcome if the government’s policies remain unchanged,
with the result that the primary deficit for the projection period remains at the unprecedented
level of 9.5 percent of GDP. In this case, debt indicators would worsen considerably, with
public debt rising to 48.2 percent of GDP by the end of the forecast period, underscoring the
need to reduce expenditures to sustainable levels.
4.
The bounds tests illustrate the sensitivity of the fiscal position to exogenous shocks
(Figure 1). The results show that with different levels of standard deviation shock to key

13
indicators, the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase by between 3 to 12 percentage
points of GDP depending on the shock. The most benign shock is that from the real interest
rate, which nevertheless could result in up to 3.4 percentage points increase in the debt-toGDP ratio relative to the baseline scenario, while a worsening in the 10 year historical
average primary balance by one standard deviation results in a 11.7 percentage points
increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio.

V. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
The external debt sustainability analysis indicates that Botswana’s external debt would
remain sustainable in the medium term even under various stress tests. Total external debt is
projected to increase substantially, although from a very low level at present, reflecting
external budget support and financing of the power plant projects.
1.
Botswana’s gross
external debt stood at $1.2
billion (11.2 percent of GDP)
at the end of 2008, with shortterm debt accounting for onefifth of total external debt.
Public external debt was at a
low level of 2.7 percent of
GDP in 2008.

trend downward thereafter to
40.8 percent of GDP by 2014.
This reflects primarily the new loan from the AfDB (US$1.5 billion) and the external
borrowing related to the Morupule (US$750 million) and Mmamabula (US$2.4 billion)
power plant projects. The initial increase in 2009 is also explained by the projected 10.3
percent contraction in real GDP due to significantly lower diamond production. The current
account surplus, excluding interest payments, is expected to turn into a deficit during 200911, largely owing to a drop in external demand for diamonds in 2009 and a rise in imports
related to the power plant projects. Current account surpluses are expected during 2013-14,
reflecting a recovery in the diamond sector and electricity exports to South Africa. The
external debt-to-export ratio is projected to rise significantly beginning in 2009 and to reach a
peak of 121.1 percent in 2011 before gradually falling to 86.5 percent by 2014.
3.
The bounds tests suggest that Botswana’s external debt position would remain
sustainable even if there are shocks. Botswana’s external debt-to-GDP ratio is robust to
growth and interest rate shocks, but appears more sensitive to a current account shock and an
exchange rate shock (a 30 percent depreciation), and to a combination of growth, interest
rate, and current account shocks.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
June 1, 2010

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with
Botswana
On July 20, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Botswana.
Background
Sound macroeconomic management, supported by strong institutions and good governance,
has underpinned strong economic growth in Botswana for the past four decades. Annual real
gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged nearly 10 percent per year from 1960 through
2008, supported by increased mining production and more recently by stronger growth in the
nonmining economy as the mining sector has matured. As a result, real per capita income
increased from US$250 in 1960 to US$4,800 in 2008 (in constant 2000 US$).
Prudent management of diamond revenues, together with high minerals prices, resulted in large
fiscal and external surpluses in recent years. International reserves amounted to 21 months of
imports of goods and services by end-2008, boosted by the accumulation of sizable fiscal
savings.
Despite this impressive progress, considerable social challenges remain. HIV/AIDS is a serious
problem, while poverty, unemployment, and income inequality are all high for a middle-income
country. In addition, the economy continues to rely heavily on diamond mining, which is
expected to decline after 2020.
After several years of robust growth, real GDP growth slowed to 2.9 percent in 2008 due to a
decline in mining output. The decline in diamond exports, together with a large increase in
public infrastructure-related imports, reduced the current account surplus to 7 percent of GDP in
2008 from an average surplus of 15.6 percent of GDP during 2005-2007. The nonmining
primary deficit (NMPD) increased to 28.6 percent of non-mining GDP in 2008/09 from 16.8
percent in 2007/08, reflecting a large increase in public investment and further growth in the
wage bill.

2

The real effective exchange rate has stabilized since the shift to the crawling peg regime in May
2005, although Botswana’s higher inflation vis-à-vis its trading partners resulted in a modest
appreciation in 2008 and early 2009. The 12-month inflation rate fell to 8.4 percent in May 2009
from 15 percent in mid-2008, mostly reflecting reduced pressure on fuel and food prices. With
inflationary pressures easing, the Bank of Botswana has reduced its main interest rate by 400
basis points since December 2008 with a view to stimulating economic activity.
The financial sector has weathered the global economic downturn thus far, although nonperforming loans have edged up in late 2008 and early 2009. There has been notable progress
on supervision of the nonbanking financial sector, including the establishment of a Non-Bank
Financial Institutions Regulatory Authority (NBFIRA). There are still several recommendations
from the 2007 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) mission that remain on the
agenda.
The current global economic crisis has reduced demand for diamonds and contributed to a
significant deterioration in the economic outlook. The economy is now projected to contract
sharply in 2009, and large fiscal and external deficits are anticipated. Inflation has slowed
considerably and is projected to fall to 7 percent by the end of 2009. Looking ahead,
Botswana’s near-term macroeconomic outlook is uncertain, with significant downside risks in
the event of a slower than expected recovery in diamond demand. Two large electricity
generation projects should boost output as they come online in 2012–13.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They commended the
authorities for their prudent macroeconomic management, underpinned by strong institutions
and good governance, which has contributed to rapid growth, large fiscal and external
surpluses, and a significant build up of international reserves. Directors observed that the
current global economic crisis has contributed to a significant deterioration in the economic
outlook for Botswana with near-term downside risks. With a recovery in diamond exports
expected to be sluggish, large fiscal and external deficits are likely to persist for the next several
years. A slower-than-expected recovery in diamond demand would add to pressure on the
external and fiscal positions. Directors noted that Botswana also faces the challenge of
diversifying from diamond production and tackling high unemployment, HIV/AIDS prevalence,
and income inequality.
Directors agreed that the recent marked increase in expenditures raises concerns about
spending quality and fiscal sustainability. As a large part of this increase reflected outlays for
infrastructure investment, a return to a more sustainable level of spending could take place as
these projects are completed. They called for the authorities to scale back the public sector
wage bill to create fiscal space for the recurrent costs associated with the completed projects,
as well as for social spending. Directors noted that on current fiscal policies, the fiscal
adjustment to achieve fiscal sustainability in the medium term would be larger than currently
envisaged.

3

Directors encouraged the authorities to consider a fiscal rule that is based on the nonmining
primary deficit as a share of nonmining GDP rather than the present rule, which limits overall
expenditure relative to GDP. They noted that such a rule would provide a clearer picture of the
underlying fiscal stance and be a better indicator of longer-term fiscal sustainability. Directors
also encouraged the authorities to develop a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework in order to
improve public expenditure management and increase spending efficiency.
Directors agreed that the weak outlook for growth and easing of inflationary pressures had
provided room for easing monetary policy in 2009. Directors generally welcomed the recent
easing of monetary policy. They encouraged the authorities to continue to weigh carefully the
balance of inflation risk in their monetary policy decision.
Directors noted that the crawling peg has resulted in greater stability of the real effective
exchange rate. They also noted staff’s assessment that the real effective exchange rate is
modestly overvalued. The limited scope for real exchange rate adjustment underscores the
need for fiscal consolidation and structural reform to ensure medium-term external stability and
competitiveness. Over the medium term, a few Directors encouraged greater exchange rate
flexibility if the inflation objective were to become the primary monetary policy anchor.
Directors observed that the global financial crisis has not had a significant adverse impact on
the banking sector to date. Nevertheless, they urged the authorities to remain vigilant, as the
marked economic contraction expected in 2009 could increase stress on bank balance sheets.
Directors welcomed the establishment of the Non-Bank Financial Institutions Regulatory
Authority, but noted that further steps are needed to enhance its capacity, including through
technical assistance, given the sizable reform agenda ahead. They encouraged the authorities
to address the remaining issues from the FSAP recommendations.
Directors noted that Botswana needs to accelerate economic diversification in order to reduce
vulnerability to shocks in the diamond trade. They urged the authorities to ensure that the
increased spending on infrastructure, education, and health results in outcomes that are
commensurate with these additional expenditures. They also called on the authorities to
accelerate key structural reforms, which would reduce the cost of doing business and enhance
productivity.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Mr. Itam on Botswana
July 20, 2009
Introduction
On behalf of my Botswana authorities, I would like to thank staff for the candid and
productive discussions during the Article IV mission. I also thank the Executive Board
and Management for their continued support. The authorities value the advice proffered
by the Fund and are in general agreement with the thrust of the staff reports.
Following decades of high and sustained growth, which was supported by prudent
economic management, the Botswana economy has been hard hit by the effects of the
global recession, which has negatively affected growth through reduced diamond output.
The slowdown in the diamond sector also affected the fiscal and external sector
performance through lower revenues and exports, respectively. In the short term, the
authorities have implemented some infrastructure projects to stimulate domestic demand
and alleviate the impact of the recession on growth, while in the medium to long run they
plan to facilitate diversification of the economy in order to reduce vulnerability to
external shocks.
The authorities remain committed to the implementation of prudent policies, which have
supported the country’s strong economic performance over the years, in order to preserve
macroeconomic stability and promote sustainable economic growth.
Recent economic developments and outlook
The effects of the global recession on the Botswana economic performance and outlook
have been transmitted primarily through the diamond sector, which continues to be the
mainstay of the economy. Economic growth slowed down from an average of 4 percent
over the last five years to about 3 percent in 2008, with the value added in diamond
mining falling significantly in the last quarter.
A sharp economic contraction, coupled with the widening of the fiscal and external
deficits, is expected in 2009 as activities were suspended during the first four months of
2009 because of weak demand. Total production for the year is projected at only half of
that realized in 2008. However, the economic slowdown is expected to be dampened by
construction activities emanating from a number of ongoing government infrastructure
projects.
Due to the country’s openness and susceptibility to shocks, inflation has, for the most
part, remained above the Central Bank target range of 3-6 percent. In 2008, inflation was
driven largely by high fuel and food prices. Since then, inflation has been on a downward
trend and is expected to continue to move towards the upper end of the target in line with
easing of food and fuel prices.

Fiscal performance has deteriorated, with the overall balance shifting into deficit in
FY2008/09 as a result of a fall in revenues due to lower global demand for diamonds
coupled with high public spending, including major infrastructure projects. The overall
fiscal deficit is expected to widen in FY 2009/10, as government revenue continues to be
adversely effected by the global crisis and as SACU revenue possibly declines on account
of lower regional imports. The overall budget deficit of some 11 percent of GDP is
expected to be financed largely by an AfDB budget support loan.
The balance of payments position is expected to deteriorate in 2009 and 2010, with the
current account balance shifting to deficit as a result of lower diamond exports and
increased imports to support the construction of power projects. However, the situation is
expected to improve in the medium term as the demand for diamonds recovers and
capital imports level off. Consequently, the level of international reserves is expected to
remain comfortable, at 16 months of import cover or higher during the short to medium
term.
Macroeconomic policies
Fiscal policy
The authorities are committed to sound fiscal policies, which have led to fiscal surpluses
and facilitated significant accumulation of reserves. The authorities are cognizant of the
need to contain spending in order to ensure fiscal sustainability in light of the recent
setbacks. However, they are of the view that increased spending at this time will be
beneficial in mitigating the effects of the contraction in the diamond sector. The increase
in infrastructure spending is considered to be temporary and is expected to fall as the
ongoing projects are completed. The authorities are focusing on improving the efficiency
of public expenditure. In this regard they have scaled down current expenditures from the
original 2009/10 budget. They are also examining options for more cost effective public
service delivery, in order to help contain further recurrent spending. The authorities are
also open to the idea of revising their fiscal rule to incorporate a link to non-mining GDP.
Such a revision will be considered as part of the National Development Plan 10 (NDP
10). On the revenue front, the authorities plan to concentrate on improving tax
administration in order to strengthen nonmining tax revenues over the medium term.
Monetary policy and financial sector issues
Monetary policy will continue to aim at containing inflation within the medium-term
target range of 3-6 percent. However, the Bank of Botswana is also mindful of the need
to support domestic demand in response to the global recession. In this regard, the easing
of inflation, although still above the target range, has allowed some loosening of
monetary policy. The authorities have continued to strengthen their inflation forecasting
model, but do not plan to move to a full fledged inflation targeting framework
immediately.

The effect of the global financial crisis on the financial sector has thus far been minimal.
Commercial banks continue to be well capitalized, liquid and profitable. Non-performing
loans are low but could rise as economic conditions deteriorate. The authorities are
closely monitoring the situation and have developed supervision guidelines for distressed
banks. The authorities are making some progress in implementing the FSAP mission
recommendations, notably on improving supervision of nonbank financial sector. The
Nonbank Financial Institutions Regulatory Authority (NBFIRA) has been established and
is expected to assume supervisory responsibilities for the nonbank sector by the end of
the year. The authorities are committed to the implementation of the remaining FSAP
recommendations.
Growth policies
Diversification of the economy, with the aim of boosting growth and reducing
vulnerability to external shocks, is high on the authorities’ development agenda. The need
for diversification has been heightened by the recent abrupt economic contraction which
emanated primarily from the effect of the global slowdown on the diamond mining
sector. In the short term, the authorities have increased spending on infrastructure to
boost domestic demand and dampen the effects of the global economic downturn.
For the medium term, the authorities have developed the new development plan (NDP
10) whose implementation is expected to begin in April next year. The main emphasis of
the plan is economic diversification, job creation and poverty alleviation. The
diversification strategy will concentrate on infrastructure investment and development of
the agriculture, transport, tourism, education and health sectors as well as the downstream
activities in the diamond sector, and improvement of the energy sector. The authorities
will also enhance the investment climate by addressing the structural aspects of
competitiveness.
Conclusion
In conclusion, I wish to reaffirm the authorities’ commitment to the prudent
macroeconomic management which has facilitated macroeconomic stability and
impressive growth in the past. Diversification of the economy remains high on the
agenda. The authorities appreciate the support of the Fund and the international
community in their development endeavors.
