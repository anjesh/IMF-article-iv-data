IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation
with the United Kingdom
On June 15, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with the United Kingdom.
The UK economy has performed relatively well in recent years, with economic growth
consistently near the top among major advanced economies and the employment rate at a record
high. However, growth has slowed somewhat in the first part of 2016, as heightened uncertainty
ahead of the referendum on EU membership appears to be weighing on investment and hiring
decisions.
In a baseline scenario in which the UK remains in the EU, growth is expected to recover in late
2016, as referendum-related effects wane, and to average around 2.2 percent over the medium
term. Inflation is expected to rise gradually from its current low level (0.3 percent as of May
2016), as disinflationary effects from past commodity price falls dissipate and as tighter labor
markets and minimum wage hikes help push up wages.
However, this broadly positive baseline scenario is subject to risks, including those related to the
referendum; the current account deficit, which reached a record high in 2015; uncertainty about
the degree to which productivity growth, which has been low since the crisis, will recover; and
vulnerabilities associated with property markets, which have been buoyant in recent years.
Economic policy has aimed to increase resilience while maintaining steady and sustainable
growth. The overall fiscal deficit has been cut to about 4 percent of GDP in FY15/16, down from
a peak of over 10 percent of GDP in FY09/10. Monetary policy has stayed accommodative, with
the policy rate unchanged at 0.5 percent, given subdued inflationary pressures and helping to
support growth. Structural reforms have aimed to boost potential output by, for example, efforts
to ease regulatory impediments to housing construction.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
Major financial sector reforms have been adopted since the crisis, helping to bolster resilience
and requiring banks to increase buffers in their balance sheets. This progress was assessed in
detail during this Article IV consultation as part of the IMF’s Financial Sector Assessment
Program (FSAP), which analyzes financial sector health and associated policies. The FSAP’s
findings are summarized in the accompanying Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA).
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the United Kingdom’s strong economic performance in recent
years and the progress made in the post-crisis repair of the economy. They expected steady
growth to continue under staff’s baseline scenario in which the United Kingdom remains in the
EU. At the same time, Directors noted that this relatively positive outlook is subject to risks and
uncertainties, including those related to the global environment, low productivity growth, a weak
external position, and still-high levels of household debt. They encouraged the authorities to
remain vigilant to the challenges ahead and to continue their policy efforts to promote growth
and further boost resilience.
Directors viewed the upcoming EU membership referendum as the main near-term economic
uncertainty. While recognizing that this choice is for U.K. voters to make and that their decisions
will reflect both economic and noneconomic factors, Directors agreed that the net economic
effects of leaving the EU would likely be negative and substantial. In the event of a vote to leave,
Directors recommended that policies be geared toward supporting stability and reducing
uncertainty. In the event of a vote to remain in the EU, Directors concurred that macroeconomic
policies should focus on promoting steady growth and continuing to reduce vulnerabilities.
While recognizing the substantial fiscal consolidation efforts made to date, Directors supported
the authorities’ plans to further bolster the public finances and rebuild buffers through gradual
deficit reduction. They also supported maintaining an accommodative monetary policy until
inflationary pressures become clearer, although vigilance to financial stability risks should be
maintained. Directors agreed that a policy mix of tight fiscal and accommodative monetary
policies should assist external rebalancing.
Directors emphasized that policies will also need to respond flexibly to shocks. In the event of
protracted demand weakness and inflation undershooting, monetary and fiscal policies should be
eased, taking into account the benefits and potential costs of such a move. Conversely, monetary
tightening may need to be initiated earlier than currently envisaged if core inflation or wage

Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

growth in excess of productivity growth begins to rise sharply. Directors stressed that careful
communication of policy changes will be particularly important in this environment.
Directors welcomed the notable improvement in financial sector soundness since the crisis,
owing in large part to post-crisis regulatory reform. A robust and intrusive approach to prudential
supervision and regulation will be essential as the financial cycle matures. Directors concurred
with the findings and recommendations of the Financial System Stability Assessment, including
the need to further strengthen analysis on interconnectedness, ensure close scrutiny of banks’
internal models, and complete the resolution reform agenda. Directors also welcomed the
authorities’ efforts to deepen their understanding of the “de-risking” phenomenon and
encouraged them to develop tailored responses.
Directors noted that macroprudential policy will need to remain alert to emerging risks. In
particular, mortgage-related macroprudential policies would need to be tightened later this year if
housing and mortgage markets remain buoyant, with similar types of limits applied also to the
buy-to-let market. The authorities should actively use the countercyclical capital buffer, which
may need to be increased later this year. Directors noted that ensuring that macroprudential
policies are sufficiently tight would also support private-sector saving.
Directors agreed that structural reforms should continue to complement macroeconomic policy
to help sustain growth, raise productivity, and strengthen external sector performance. Priorities
include continued efforts to boost housing supply, increase investment in infrastructure and
human capital, enhance labor force participation, reduce distortionary tax expenditures and the
debt bias in the tax code, and reform pensions. Directors also encouraged the authorities to build
on recent reforms to further enhance corporate transparency, including in UK overseas financial
centers, and combat financial crimes.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
The UK economy has performed well in recent years, but it faces important challenges
and risks. Economic growth has consistently been near the top among major advanced
economies, the employment rate has risen to a record high, the fiscal deficit has been
reduced, and major financial sector reforms have been adopted. Nonetheless, the economy
still faces vulnerabilities, including those related to possible shocks to global growth and
asset prices; property markets that have been buoyant in recent years; a wide current
account deficit and low household saving rate; and uncertainty about the degree to which
productivity growth will recover.
In the near term, the largest risks and uncertainties relate to the upcoming EU
referendum. Given the importance of the referendum, this report and the accompanying
Selected Issues paper include analysis of the referendum’s potential macroeconomic
implications for the UK and the global economy, while recognizing that this choice is for UK
voters to make and that their decisions will reflect both economic and noneconomic factors.
This analysis finds that the economic effects of an exit would likely be negative and
substantial for the UK. In this event of a vote to leave the EU, policies should be geared
toward supporting stability and reducing uncertainty.
In the event the UK stays in the EU, steady growth is expected to continue over the
next few years. Growth is projected to strengthen in late 2016 as referendum-related
effects, which appear to have weighed on growth so far this year, wane and then to average
around 2¼ percent over the medium term. Inflation is expected to return gradually to target
as effects of past commodity price falls dissipate and as low unemployment helps push up
wages. However, this broadly positive baseline forecast is subject to risks, as noted above.
Macroeconomic policies in the baseline should focus on promoting continued steady
growth while reducing vulnerabilities. In particular, monetary policy should remain on
hold until inflationary pressures are clearer and to help offset headwinds from fiscal
consolidation. The latter should remain sufficiently gradual to avoid overburdening monetary
policy and be supported by further efforts to make the composition of fiscal consolidation
more pro-growth and pro-stability. To ensure financial stability, it will be important to
complete implementation of the ambitious financial supervisory reform agenda and to have
a robust and intrusive approach to supervision and regulation as the financial cycle matures
and memories of the crisis fade. In particular, mortgage-related macroprudential policies will
need to be tightened later this year if the recent re-acceleration of housing and mortgage
markets persists. Such a monetary, fiscal, and macroprudential policy mix should help
maintain growth while reducing vulnerabilities, including by supporting orderly current
account adjustment, and should be reinforced by structural reforms to boost productivity
and incomes. Policies will also need to remain flexible, adjusting as necessary if
circumstances change and risks are realized.

FOCUS OF THE CONSULTATION
1.
The UK economy has performed well in recent years, but it faces important challenges
and risks.


Economic growth has consistently been near the top among major advanced economies, while
the employment rate has risen to a record high.



At the same time, economic policies have been broadly in line with past Fund advice: gradual
fiscal consolidation has cut the deficit by more than half; monetary policy has remained
accommodative, helping to support growth and offset headwinds from fiscal consolidation;
financial sector policies have required banks to increase buffers in their balance sheets; and
structural reforms have aimed to boost potential output, for example through efforts to ease
regulatory impediments to housing construction.1



Nonetheless, the economy still faces important challenges and risks: productivity growth is still
well below pre-crisis rates; the current account deficit widened to a record high in 2015, driven
in part by a further decline in the already-low household saving rate; and loan-to-income ratios
on new mortgages are again rising.



Perhaps most importantly, UK voters face a momentous choice on June 23, 2016, when a
referendum will be held on whether the UK should remain in the EU—a choice that is expected
to have important economic implications for the UK, the rest of Europe, and the global
economy.

2.

Against this background, the consultation focused on the following issues:



How have macroeconomic conditions evolved recently?



What is the outlook for the economy? What are the main risks?



How can the UK’s economic policies support growth and limit risks, both for the UK and
globally?

1

For more detail on the authorities’ response to IMF policy recommendations over the last few years, see Annex 4 of
the 2015 UK Article IV report. Key macroeconomic policy changes since the last Article IV consultation include the
adjustments to the fiscal path in the March 2016 budget (see subsequent discussion on fiscal policy), which were
broadly in line with Fund advice for adjustment to be gradual and calibrated to economic conditions, and the raising
of the countercyclical capital buffer in March (see subsequent section on financial sector policies), which was also
broadly in line with past Fund advice.

MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT
The economy continued to grow steadily in 2015, with the output gap almost closed. However, nearterm uncertainty has risen substantially due to various factors—most notably the forthcoming
referendum—and appears to have slowed growth somewhat this year. Under staff’s baseline scenario,
which assumes that the UK remains in the EU, growth is projected to recover later this year as
referendum-related effects fade. Growth is then expected to average near its estimated potential rate
of about 2.2 percent over the medium term. Inflation is projected to rise gradually back to the
2 percent target as effects from past commodity price falls dissipate and as wages rise in response to
tighter labor markets. However, this relatively benign baseline scenario is subject to major risks,
including those related to the referendum, productivity growth, the buoyant housing market and
household debt, and the large current account deficit.

A. Macroeconomic Developments and Outlook
3.
The UK economy continued to expand steadily in 2015. Output grew by 2.3 percent, the
third straight year of growth in the 2–3 percent range. Growth has been driven by strong private
domestic demand, which has more than offset headwinds from gradual fiscal consolidation and
persistently weak external demand (Tables 1–2; Figure 1).
4.
Key indicators point to an ongoing post-crisis normalization of macroeconomic and
macrofinancial conditions.


Standard models suggest that the output gap is now nearly closed, as capacity utilization and
the unemployment rate have returned to pre-crisis levels (Figure 2) while the employment rate
has reached a record high.



Credit conditions continue to turn more expansionary, with net lending by monetary financial
institutions (MFI) to nonfinancial corporates turning positive for the first time since the crisis—
helping to support higher business investment in 2015—and with mortgage rates falling to new
lows (Figure 3).

UK: News-Based Economic Policy Uncertainty Index

5.
However, several factors heightened
uncertainty in the first half of 2016. Foremost
among these is the referendum on EU
membership. Volatility in global financial
markets in early 2016 and downgrades to the
global growth outlook alongside increasing
concerns about global risks, such as secular
stagnation in advanced economies, have further
heightened uncertainty.

6.
Amidst this uncertainty, annual growth is expected to be slower in 2016. Heightened
uncertainty appears to be weighing on confidence and investment, with growth slowing to
1.6 percent (saar) in Q1 and PMI surveys suggesting a further slowdown in April. Under staff’s
baseline, which is based on a scenario in which the UK remains in the EU, growth is projected to
rebound somewhat in the second half of 2016 as lingering referendum-related effects dissipate, with
growth reaching 1.9 percent for the full-year 2016.
7.
Growth is then projected to average around 2.2 percent—approximately staff’s
estimate of the UK’s potential growth rate—over the medium term (Table 2). However,
medium-term growth prospects are heavily dependent on the degree to which labor productivity
growth recovers.


Labor productivity growth has been very weak in the UK during the recovery, recently running
around 0.8 percent (Table 2). Part of the post-crisis decline in productivity growth likely reflects
temporary cyclical factors, such as the post-crisis impairment of credit markets inhibiting the
flow of investment to more productive sectors (see 2015 Selected Issues). As the economy nears
full employment, employment growth should also ease, helping to raise productivity as tighter
labor markets spur more efficient labor utilization and as employment growth is driven more by
labor force growth and less by the hiring of the unemployed, who tend to have below-average
productivity. However, part of the decline in productivity growth also likely reflects more
permanent structural factors, given a broad-based productivity slowdown across most advanced
economies that is not fully understood and may reflect factors such as changes in the nature of
technological progress and/or increased difficulties in measuring it.



As cyclical effects wane, staff projects productivity growth to rise over the medium term to
around 1.6 percent but to remain well below its pre-crisis historical average of 2.2 percent
(1960–2007). However, such projections are uncertain, and moderate deviations could result in
substantial differences in output levels over the long run.

8.
From a demand-side perspective, a number of offsetting forces are expected to have a
roughly neutral effect on growth over the next few years. Growth in the baseline is expected to
be supported by a reduction in uncertainty following a Remain vote, by the recent run-up in

residential and commercial real estate prices (encouraging investment in these sectors), and by
gradually rising global growth (supporting net exports), with ongoing monetary policy
accommodation and supportive financial conditions helping to offset broadly unchanged headwinds
from steady fiscal consolidation (Table 3).
9.

Inflationary pressures remain subdued.



As of April 2016, headline inflation remained low at 0.3 percent; core inflation was also subdued
at 1.2 percent.



Low headline inflation partly reflects the large drop in commodity import prices since mid-2014.
However, domestic drivers of inflation have also been muted, with nominal private-sector wages
growing by only 2.3 percent as of March 2016 (Figure 1). Even if productivity growth remains in
the range of only 0.8 percent, this pace of wage growth would still be consistent with underlying
inflation of only around 1.5 percent.



Consequently, markets do not expect the BoE to raise its policy rate (currently 0.5 percent) for
several years. Under this scenario, staff expects inflation to rise gradually to 2 percent by early
2018, as effects from past commodity price declines dissipate and assuming a gradual rise in
wage growth in response to tighter labor markets. A planned gradual increase in the minimum
wage of 34 percent during 2015–20 will also contribute to higher wage and price inflation.

The current account deficit has risen substantially in recent years, reaching 5.2 percent

However, the post-crisis deterioration in the
income balance is not expected to be entirely permanent, suggesting a somewhat smaller
underlying current account deficit and smaller current account gap than implied by the EBA
current account model. Taking into account this effect, as well as the somewhat smaller gaps
implied by the EBA REER models—both of which estimate overvaluation of 12 percent—and
adding uncertainty around these estimates yields an estimated current account gap of -1.5 to
-4.5 percent of GDP and REER overvaluation of 5–20 percent in 2015.



However, as of April 2016, the REER had depreciated by 7 percent relative to its average 2015
level, possibly unwinding a portion of the estimated overvaluation in 2015.



Part of the estimated current account gap (1.1 percentage points) reflects the fiscal balance
currently being looser than its optimal medium-term level. Part of the gap also reflects a
relatively low household saving rate, which fell to 4.3 percent in 2015 (Table 2).



It is important to note that this external assessment and the estimated degree of overvaluation
in 2015 are conditional on the baseline scenario in which the UK remains in the EU. An
alternative scenario entailing higher trade barriers could reduce the equilibrium exchange rate
(as a more competitive exchange rate would be required to raise demand for UK exports to
offset the reduced demand from the EU due to higher barriers), implying that additional
depreciation from 2015 levels—beyond that implied by staff’s assessment of overvalution in
2015—would be required to restore equilibrium in such a scenario.

12.
Some factors mitigate risks associated with the current account deficit. In particular, the
BoE’s well-established inflation-targeting framework should help keep inflation expectations
anchored in the event that an unwinding of the current account deficit leads to exchange rate
depreciation, absent a major regime shift such as an exit from the EU, which would pose a higher
risk of de-stabilizing inflation expectations. In addition, the currency composition of the net
international investment position (NIIP) helps act as an automatic stabilizer, as foreign assets have a
higher foreign-currency component than do foreign liabilities, such that sterling depreciation
automatically improves the NIIP and income flows via valuation effects. A variety of valuation effects
have also kept the NIIP at a relatively neutral level (-3.5 percent of GDP at end-2015; Table 7)
despite persistent large current account deficits in recent years, and the authorities estimate that the
NIIP would be higher if FDI were fully valued at market prices.
13.
Nonetheless, the high and persistent current account deficit is a source of concern. The
deficit’s sheer size and its general usefulness as an indicator of underlying imbalances and
heightened risks suggests some cause for caution. Although the UK has not had difficulties in

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED KINGDOM

financing its deficits so far, events could change market sentiment, triggering abrupt capital
outflows. Rapid outflows could in turn adversely affect domestic investment and hence growth, with
negative outward spillovers via cross-border linkages. A persistent, high current account deficit is
thus best avoided, and policies that assist orderly and gradual external adjustment would be helpful.

C. Risks and Spillovers
14.
The relatively benign baseline scenario is subject to a number of important risks.
Specific risks are elaborated upon in the Risk Assessment Matrix (Annex 2), including risks related to
the current account deficit discussed above in the context of the external assessment. Other risks
include the following:
Globally originating risks


Global downturn: The outlook for global growth is uncertain, including because global demand
may prove too weak to support solid growth, as discussed in the April 2016 WEO, and global
markets remain subject to sudden movements, as seen in early 2016. A downturn in global
growth would depress exports; tighter global financial conditions (i.e., higher risk premia and
lower asset prices) would further depress GDP growth by weighing also on domestic
consumption and investment.



Persistently low energy prices: Energy prices could remain persistently low if global supplydemand imbalances last longer than expected. Persistently low energy prices would likely have
modest positive net effects on growth, with the boost to consumption from higher household
disposable income slightly offsetting negative effects on investment in the energy sector.
Headline inflation would remain lower for longer. If this results in second-round deflationary
effects, this may require more accommodative monetary policy to ensure that inflation
expectations remain anchored near the target.

UK-specific risks


Medium-term productivity growth. As noted above, productivity growth remains well below its
pre-crisis rates, and the degree to which it will recover over the medium term is uncertain. A lack
of recovery would have a major adverse effect on long-run output and would also put upward
pressure on inflation, while a return to pre-crisis rates would result in substantially higher output
than projected in staff’s baseline.



Real estate market-related risks. House-price growth has risen to more than three times income
growth, and loan-to-income ratios on new mortgages are again rising. A continuation of these
trends would increase households and banks’ vulnerabilities to house-price, income, and
interest-rate shocks (see later section for further details on recent real estate market
developments and related macroprudential policies).

15.
However, the largest near-term risk relates to the referendum on EU membership. A
vote to leave the EU would create uncertainty about the nature of the UK’s long-term economic
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

UNITED KINGDOM

relationship with the EU and the rest of the world. It would also have the potential to crystallize
some of the baseline risks noted above. Given the importance of the referendum, staff analyzes
some of the possible economic effects of a decision to leave the EU in its accompanying Selected
Issues paper, while recognizing that the choice of whether to remain in the EU is for UK voters to
make and that their decisions will reflect both economic and noneconomic factors. Key points from
staff’s analysis are summarized below.
Possible economic effects of an exit from the EU
16.

A vote for exit would be followed by a long process with uncertain outcomes.



Following a decision to exit, the UK would need to negotiate the terms of its withdrawal and a
new relationship with the EU—unless it abandoned single market access and relied on WTO
rules, which would significantly raise trade barriers. The process governing exit from the EU is
untested, and ratification of a new deal could require unanimous support depending on the
nature of the agreement, making it subject to considerable political risks.3



As EU-level agreements also cover the UK’s trading relationship with 60 non-EU economies (and
prospective arrangements with another 67 countries are in the works), the UK would also need
to simultaneously renegotiate these arrangements, or else see them revert to WTO rules.



These processes could last many years, given the wide range of issues and countries involved
and given that relatively simple bilateral trade agreements have typically taken 3 or more years
to negotiate.



The UK could unilaterally determine the date of its exit, but a decision to exit would most likely
be irrevocable. Once triggered, Article 50 of the EU Treaty provides for a two-year process for
negotiating the terms of the departing state’s withdrawal and its future relations with the EU,
but there is no requirement for remaining EU countries to reach agreement with an exiting
party. An extension to negotiations could be granted, but would require unanimous consent
from other EU governments.

17.
A protracted period of uncertainty could weigh on confidence and investment and
increase financial market volatility.


Uncertainty about the outcome of new trade, migration, and regulatory arrangements could
discourage investment over the medium term and weigh on consumer sentiment. A change in
the UK’s EU membership status could also cause abrupt disruptions to trade and financial flows
if new arrangements are not adopted in a timely and smooth manner.

3

An agreement focused solely on trade would need to be approved by the European Parliament and a qualified
majority of the European Council. A broader agreement that provided for wider cooperation would need to be
agreed by the European Parliament and unanimously by the European Council.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED KINGDOM



Another risk is that markets may anticipate significant negative economic effects from an exit
and bring them forward via an adverse market reaction in the immediate aftermath of an exit
vote. Such a risk scenario could involve some combination of higher borrowing costs for
households and individuals due to higher risk premia, downward pressure on equity and house
prices, and even a sudden stop of investment inflows into key sectors such as commercial real
estate and finance. The UK’s record-high current account deficit and attendant reliance on
external financing exacerbates these risks. Such market reactions would adversely affect
economic activity, further dampening asset prices in a self-reinforcing cycle that would be only
partly offset by expenditure-switching toward net exports in response to abrupt exchange rate
depreciation, which could cause inflation to rise above target for some time. Contagion effects
could result in spillovers to regional and global markets, though the main effects would be felt
domestically.



Indeed, such concerns may have already begun to affect UK markets in recent months. For
example, in the commercial real estate market, transactions plunged about 40 percent in the first
quarter of 2016. Although the residential real estate market remains buoyant, this may reflect
temporary effects due to tax changes, as discussed in more detail later in this report. In financial
markets, the UK’s nominal effective exchange rate depreciated 9 percent between November
2015 and April 2016, UK sovereign CDS spreads have risen more sharply than the G7 average,
and the cost of hedging exchange rate volatility around the time of the referendum has spiked.

That said, uncertainty around the market reaction to a Leave vote is wide, as the historical
experience with similar events is limited. At the same time, the reaction is expected to be
negative and could be severe.

18.
The potential steady-state arrangements following an exit fall within a wide range of
outcomes.


One end of the spectrum would entail being outside the EU but remaining in the European
Economic Area, as is currently the case for Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway. However, such an
arrangement would grant the UK little change in sovereignty, as the UK would still have to
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

UNITED KINGDOM

maintain EU regulations governing the free movement of persons, goods, services, and capital,
but with greatly reduced influence in determining these regulations.


The other end of the spectrum would entail reverting to WTO rules for trade. However, this
would significantly curtail access to the EU’s single market and create other non-tariff barriers
not covered by WTO rules (such as from no longer being part of the customs union).



Between these two extremes is a range of possible outcomes. In general, there would be a
trade-off between the UK‘s access to EU markets and the degree to which it could unilaterally
set regulatory conditions.

19.
The steady-state economic effects of an exit would occur via several channels,
including the following:


Reduced trade and financial flows. An exit is likely to increase barriers to trade and financial
flows between the UK and EU, curtailing the benefits from such cooperation and integration,
such as those resulting from economies of scale, efficient specialization, and trade-related
productivity gains. Such restrictions may also reduce the attractiveness of the UK as an
investment destination, including by possibly triggering some activities to relocate elsewhere in
the EU. For example, UK financial firms may lose their “passport” to provide financial services to
the single market, and much euro-denominated business may eventually move to the
continent.4 Such effects could over time erode London’s status as Europe’s preeminent financial
center. (See Appendix II of the accompanying Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) and
the Selected Issues paper for further discussion of the potential effects of a vote to leave the EU
on the UK’s financial system.)



Regulatory changes. Some exit proponents argue that the UK would be able to adopt a more
pro-growth regulatory policy once free of EU restrictions. However, as noted above, maintaining
substantial access to the EU’s single market may still require alignment of many UK regulations
with those of the EU. Moreover, many EU regulations simply implement global agreements and
practices (e.g., Basel III financial-sector regulations and global environmental agreements) that
would most likely be maintained even after an exit. The UK also already has relatively flexible
labor and product market regulations, so the scope for making these regulations more flexible
and pro-growth is somewhat limited. Indeed, some of the UK’s most growth-constraining
regulations, such as those on housing construction, are already under domestic control. The fact
that regulations heavily affected by EU rules are less restrictive than key regulations under
domestic control (e.g., restrictions on housing construction) highlights that regulations could
actually become more restrictive and less pro-growth after an exit, as domestic special interests
may be able to more easily capture regulatory decision-making following an exit.

4

UK banks would retain their passport if the UK were to remain a member of the EEA. In this case, however, the UK
would still have to maintain EU regulations governing the free movement of persons, goods, services, and capital, but
with greatly reduced influence in determining these regulations, as noted in the previous discussion.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED KINGDOM



Fiscal effects. The UK would save its net contributions to the EU budget (around ⅓ percent of
UK GDP) if it left the EU. It is unlikely that the UK would save more than this, as the UK budget
would likely need to cover some activities currently financed by the EU, such as agricultural
support, regional development, and R&D. Moreover, these savings would likely be more than
offset by fiscal losses from output declines resulting from reduced trade and investment.
Specifically, if steady-state output falls by just 1 percent or more (most estimates are above
this—see below), the associated revenue loss would exceed the fiscal savings from not
contributing to the EU budget.

20.
On balance, the net economic costs of an exit are likely negative and substantial,
though there is significant uncertainty about their precise magnitude.






Quantifying the effects of an exit with much
certainty is difficult, including because the
outcome will depend in part on the postexit arrangements, which are unknown.
Qualitatively, however, the considerations
discussed above suggest that an exit is very
likely to adversely affect the UK economy.
In line with this assessment, the vast
majority of quantitative estimates by
various analysts point to sizeable long-run
losses, as increased barriers reduce trade,
investment, and productivity. The wide
range of estimated losses does not
represent fundamental disagreement
among most experts that exit would be
costly, but largely reflects differing
assumptions about the UK’s future
economic relationships with the EU and the
rest of the world.
Several studies examine the likely short- and
medium-term effects and find that they
would also likely be negative. These include
illustrative scenarios by IMF staff in the
accompanying Selected Issues paper in
which the level of output is 1½ percent
below the baseline at its peak deviation in
2019 in a scenario of limited uncertainty
effects and 5½ percent below the baseline in
a more adverse scenario.

21.
An exit would also have important spillovers. Though the UK would be most affected by
an exit, other EU economies would similarly experience reduced gains from trade, less efficient
matching of capital and labor, and heightened uncertainty during the transition, to varying degrees
depending on existing linkages with the UK. Losses from reduced trade and economic integration
may rise further if a UK exit increases support for higher barriers elsewhere in Europe. Any effects on
the UK financial sector and financial markets may also have outward spillovers to Europe and
beyond, given the importance of London as a global financial center. For further discussion of
spillovers and other issues related to the referendum, see the accompanying Selected Issues paper.
22.
On the other hand, a Remain vote could strengthen the outlook. As noted above, staff’s
baseline scenario assumes that referendum-related uncertainty effects dissipate and that effects on
financial markets in the run-up to the referendum reverse following a Remain vote, helping to
support a rebound in growth in late 2016. Over time, effects could be stronger than assumed in
staff’s baseline, posing an upside risk, as enhanced institutional stability could foster stronger
growth.

due to a softer global outlook. The OBR
also revised down medium-term potential and actual growth by about ¼ percentage point due to
continued weak productivity growth. The OBR’s projections are now very close to those of IMF staff,
the BoE, and consensus forecasts. Staff’s external assessment was viewed as reasonable. On the
referendum, the authorities agreed that this posed the largest near-term uncertainty for the outlook.
HM Treasury published its estimates of the long-term effects of an exit from the EU in April 2016,
while the BoE discussed how EU membership affects the BoE’s ability to achieve monetary and
financial stability in a report in October 2015 and discussed possible short-term implications of a
vote to leave for monetary policy in its May 2016 Inflation Report.

POLICIES TO PROMOTE GROWTH AND STABILITY
Under the baseline of a Remain vote, policies should focus on promoting steady growth while reducing
vulnerabilities. In particular, monetary policy should remain on hold until inflationary pressures are
clearer and to help offset headwinds from fiscal consolidation. The latter should remain sufficiently
gradual to avoid overburdening monetary policy and be supported by further efforts to make the
composition of fiscal consolidation more pro-growth and pro-stability. To ensure financial stability, it
will be important to complete implementation of the ambitious financial supervisory reform agenda
and to have a robust and intrusive approach to supervision and regulation as the financial cycle
matures and memories of the crisis fade. Of note, mortgage-related macroprudential policies will need
to tighten later this year if the recent re-acceleration of housing and mortgage markets persists. Such a
monetary, fiscal, and macroprudential policy mix should help maintain growth while reducing
vulnerabilities, including by supporting orderly current account adjustment, and should be reinforced
by structural reforms to boost productivity and incomes. Policies will also need to remain flexible and
adjust appropriately if circumstances change and risks are realized.

A. Monetary Policy
24.
Monetary conditions remain accommodative. Current monetary policy settings—a policy
rate of 0.5 percent and QE assets of £375 billion (20 percent of GDP)—have been unchanged since
2012.
25.

Monetary policy should stay on hold until inflationary pressures are clearer.



Both headline and core inflation are below target. Forward-looking indicators—such as inflation
expectations and wage growth in excess of productivity growth—are also well-contained, with
market-based inflation expectations continuing to drift downward in recent months (Figure 1).



While the output gap is nearly closed, continued monetary policy accommodation is likely to be
needed to keep the output gap from re-opening, given headwinds from ongoing fiscal
consolidation.
UK: Sovereign Yield Curve



In addition, the very low level of longterm interest rates (the 30-year yield on
government bonds was 2.2 percent as of
end-May) suggests that the neutral
interest rate may be much lower than in
the past. Consequently, the current policy
rate may not be providing as much
monetary stimulus as it may initially
appear.



Moreover, risks to policy errors are asymmetric, as the costs associated with inflation
undershooting likely exceed those of overshooting due to the increased complications related to
easing monetary policy when interest rates are near the effective lower bound.



Current monetary policy settings thus remain appropriate until inflationary pressures become
stronger. However, policy should also stay data dependent and may need to adjust quickly if
conditions change. If upside risks are realized, monetary tightening may need to be initiated
earlier than expected, especially if core inflation or wage growth in excess of productivity growth
rises quickly. On the other hand, further easing—which could take the form of policy rate cuts to
at least zero, possibly in steps and followed if necessary by additional quantitative easing—is
likely to be necessary if demand is weaker than expected and inflation undershooting persists.

Authorities’ views
26.
Monetary policy settings were viewed as appropriate. When the MPC judges it
appropriate to raise Bank Rate, careful communication will be important to ensure a smooth lift-off.
The BoE reiterated that the process of normalizing monetary policy should begin with rises in Bank
Rate and proceed gradually—with the neutral rate likely to remain below levels seen prior to the
financial crisis—and that QE asset sales should only be considered once Bank Rate had reached a
level from which it could be cut materially in the face of a negative shock. The authorities agreed
that in the event of protracted weak demand and price growth there was some scope to further
ease monetary policy through cuts to policy rates, further quantitative easing, or a combination of
the two.



The March budget avoided undertaking additional tightening in the near term to offset lower
revenue projections, following the growth downgrade by the OBR. This lack of an active nearterm response implied a modest easing of the pace of structural fiscal adjustment in FY16/17,
given that part of the growth downgrade was deemed to be structural.



Instead, additional adjustment was
backloaded to FY19/20. This allowed
the budget to remain consistent with

1/ The CAPB is adjusted by taking out the effect of the change in corporation
tax payment dates for companies with taxable profits over £20 million.

Under the new fiscal path, the pace of
consolidation is now broadly constant
at around 1 percentage point of GDP per year through FY19/20, especially after adjusting for the
effects of shifts in the timing of corporation tax payments (blue dotted line in the text chart),
which affects the officially measured pace of adjustment but is unlikely to have substantive
effects on economic activity. Public sector net debt is projected to start declining as a percent of
GDP from FY16/17 onward (Table 3).

29.
Consolidation remains mostly expenditure-based, with new measures in the 2016
budget having only modest fiscal effects. Notable measures include higher taxes on commercial
property, tighter restrictions on tax avoidance,

30.
The smoothing of the adjustment path and increased backloading of consolidation
was appropriate. The lack of additional discretionary tightening in the near term in response to
larger deficit projections was appropriate given the weaker near-term outlook, the need to support
demand, and the heightened near-term uncertainty. This new pace of structural adjustment, which is
essentially unchanged from last year, is appropriate in a baseline in which growth strengthens later
this year following a Remain vote, given that the output gap is essentially closed, the employment
rate is at a record high, and financial conditions continue to ease in line with stronger bank balance
sheets. Moderate fiscal consolidation in such a scenario will help rebuild fiscal buffers to allow a
more forceful countercyclical response during the next downturn. More generally, the pace of
consolidation should be broadly calibrated to cyclical conditions.
31.
In this context, the UK has fiscal space to ease further if this becomes necessary. The
UK has room to ease in the sense that, in the baseline of a Remain vote, a moderate fiscal easing is
unlikely to trigger a significant rise in sovereign bond yields. In the event of an extended period of
sluggish demand growth and inflation undershooting, the government should use this fiscal space
and the flexibility in its fiscal framework to halt structural adjustment and, if necessary, move to
stimulus.6 Automatic stabilizers should also be allowed to operate freely and symmetrically. In
addition, the envisaged reductions in some categories of expenditure remain sizable, and the
government may need to show flexibility in finding alternative fiscal measures if anticipated
spending efficiency gains fail to materialize.
Structural fiscal reforms
32.
Pro-growth and pro-stability aspects of the consolidation could be further
strengthened. Specific reform options include the following:
Boosting infrastructure. Spending on
infrastructure has been increased in
recent budgets, but further efforts
could be made in this direction, given
that needs in this area are still high and
given that public investment is still
below the average in other advanced
economies. Higher infrastructure
spending could be funded by reforms
such as those below.

Reforming taxes
o

Scaling back distortionary tax expenditures (e.g., nonstandard zero VAT rates) could improve
efficiency, increase tax neutrality, and free up resources for growth-enhancing expenditure.7

o

Property tax reform, along the lines recommended in the Mirrlees Review, could help reduce
vulnerabilities in the housing market by easing supply constraints. For example, rebalancing
taxation away from transactions and towards property values could boost mobility and
encourage more efficient use of the housing stock. The 2016 budget announced reforms to
transaction taxes on commercial properties that aim to eliminate cliff-edges in marginal tax
rates, in line with recent reforms to transaction taxes on residential properties. These reforms
helpfully reduce some distortions in the current system, but the fundamental problem of
high reliance on transaction taxes remains (see 2015 Selected Issues).

o

Reducing the tax code’s bias toward debt could also promote financial stability. This could
be achieved by, for example, adopting an Allowance for Corporate Equity, with offsetting
changes in other corporate tax parameters to ensure revenue neutrality.

Reforming pensions. State pensions are currently subject to a “triple-lock” guarantee, which
requires that they rise each year by the

33.
The authorities viewed their fiscal plans as key to bolstering buffers against shocks.
They emphasized that responsible fiscal policy requires building buffers while growth rates remain
near potential and the output gap is closed, in order to provide flexibility to allow the automatic
stabilizers to operate freely in the event of future shocks. In this context, they agreed with the need
to maintain fiscal flexibility in the event of large shocks and noted that their fiscal framework
requiring a budget surplus starting in FY19/20 provides for such flexibility, given both its “comply or

explain” nature and its explicit escape clause in the event that the economy is hit by a significant
negative shock. On the composition of consolidation, the authorities viewed their plans as
supporting growth by facilitating a competitive, lower-tax economic environment while prioritizing
spending in key areas such as health, science, education, and infrastructure investment, as well as
foreign development assistance.

C. Financial Sector Policies
34.
The UK has a large, complex, and globally interconnected financial sector. Total
financial assets of UK domiciled banks and nonbank financial institutions are about ten times UK
GDP. Four banks and two insurers in the UK are classified as globally systemically important. The UK
insurance sector is the largest in Europe and the third largest globally. The UK hosts the largest fund
management industry and many of the most important equity trading platforms in Europe, as well
as two of the largest central counterparties (CCPs) in the world. As such, effectively monitoring and
mitigating risks impinging on and emanating from the UK’s financial sector is of crucial domestic
and global importance. Against this background, IMF staff undertook an assessment of the UK’s
financial sector in 2016 under the IMF’s Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), following up
on the previous FSAP assessment in 2011. The main findings of the FSAP are summarized in the
accompanying FSSA.
35.
The accompanying FSSA finds that the balance sheets of UK banks continue to
strengthen, in line with tougher regulatory capital and liquidity requirements.
Since the global financial crisis, UK banks have
significantly strengthened their capital ratios
and liquidity positions (text table below,
Figure 5). Indeed, the major UK banks had an
aggregate common equity Tier 1 capital ratio
of 12.6 percent and an aggregate Basel III
leverage ratio of 4.8 percent at end-2015,
both well above regulatory minima.8 Capital
ratios of UK banks were also broadly in line
with those of their European peers. UK banks
had an aggregate nonperforming loan ratio
of 1.4 percent at end-2015, about a third of
its post-crisis peak.



As such, UK banks’ balance sheets are better
able to support the real economy, with bank
credit growth continuing to normalize and
projected to converge to nominal GDP
growth over the medium term (Table 2),
now that the bank credit-to-GDP ratio has
returned near pre-boom levels (i.e.,
circa 2000). Accommodative monetary
policy has helped support this recovery in
credit growth.



Nevertheless, the profitability of UK banks remains low relative to historic levels, due to lower
trading income, lower net interest income, and still-high legacy misconduct costs. As a result,
the major UK banks were not immune to the reductions in equity prices and rises in CDS spreads
that hit European banks on profitability concerns in early 2016.

Recent stress tests suggest that the main subsectors of the UK financial sector are
individually resilient to severe but plausible shocks:


Banks. Solvency stress tests conducted by the BoE in 2015 and by the IMF FSAP team in 2016
indicate that the major UK banks would continue to simultaneously satisfy regulatory capital
requirements and domestic bank credit demand under severe but plausible adverse scenarios.
The BoE stress test scenario considered a global macroeconomic downturn with financial market
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

UNITED KINGDOM

disruptions concentrated in emerging Asia and the euro area, while the IMF FSAP scenario
featured a disorderly normalization of the stance of US monetary policy triggering abrupt asset
price falls in the UK. Liquidity stress tests conducted in 2016 also indicate that the major UK
banks are resilient to sizeable withdrawals of funding.


Nonbank financial sector. Though not as detailed or comprehensive as the bank stress tests,
separate analyses by the BoE, PRA, FCA, EU financial authorities, and the FSAP paint a relatively
reassuring picture of the underlying strength and resilience of U.K. insurers, asset managers, and
CCPs. In each of these areas, however, there is scope to improve the set of available data,
analytical models, and supervisory risk monitoring tools.

In spite of this individual resilience to shocks, interconnectedness across these subsectors of the UK
financial sector has the potential to amplify and propagate destabilizing effects. Further developing
analytical tools to assess risks due to interconnectedness should therefore be a priority.
37.
This apparent resilience of the UK financial sector largely reflects extensive regulatory
reforms in the wake of the global financial crisis. These regulatory reforms were designed to
increase the resilience of the UK financial sector by reducing the likelihood that financial institutions
fail, while lowering the cost of failure to the economy and taxpayer. They have generally been
aligned with the global regulatory reform agenda, in which the UK has played a leading role. They
were also complemented by steps to enhance the governance of financial firms—a crucial step for
restoring the confidence of the British public to the financial system—as well as to ring-fence retail
banking operations from other, riskier activities. These reforms are well established in law—many are
embedded in EU Directives and Regulations—although key components, such as ring-fencing, will
require more time to be fully implemented.
38.
Key specific elements of the post-crisis regulatory reform agenda include reforms to
strengthen macroprudential and microprudential oversight:


22

Macroprudential oversight. A new macroprudential framework, centered on the Financial Policy
Committee (FPC), assigns clear roles and responsibilities, provides adequate powers and
accountability, and promotes effective coordination across agencies. This institutional setup is
well designed and has an encouraging, albeit still short, track record. Notable steps taken by the
FPC include measures in mid-2014 to reduce risks related to the housing market and household
debt (see next section on real estate markets for details). More recently, in March 2016 the FPC
raised the countercyclical capital buffer (CCB) from 0 to 0.5 percent, effective one year later. This
CCB increase will not raise overall regulatory capital buffers for most banks in 2017 due to
offsetting reductions in Pillar 2 supervisory capital buffers judged to cover overlapping risks.
Rather, the FPC justified the CCB increase as desirable to improve the transparency of existing
buffers rather than being needed to increase overall capital levels. Going forward, it will be
important to continue tightening the CCB pro-actively in line with the financial cycle. In this
regard, further tightening will likely be needed later this year if near-term uncertainty is resolved
and macro-financial conditions remain stable, as assumed in staff’s baseline scenario. More
generally, as the financial cycle shifts, external resistance to action is likely to rise, and resources

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED KINGDOM

for financial stability issues could face competing demands. The authorities need to maintain
their focus and willingness to act on financial stability risks, as well as continue their efforts to
promote a better understanding by the general public of the FPC’s role and responsibilities.


Microprudential oversight. The microprudential supervision of banks, insurers, and large
investment firms was consolidated under the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) in the BoE,
while the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is responsible for the microprudential supervision of
other financial institutions and is the conduct supervisor for all financial institutions. The focus of
supervisory effort and resources on the resilience of the most important firms is appropriate
from a systemic perspective. However, it inevitably implies less individual attention to small and
mid-size companies, for which supervisors rely more on data monitoring, thematic reviews, and
outlier analysis. This tradeoff warrants constant vigilance, because the business models of
smaller firms tend to be correlated and, regardless of their systemic impact, failures of even
small firms can be a source of reputational risk for the supervisor. Going forward, it will be
important to have a robust and intrusive approach to supervision as the financial cycle
matures. This includes continuing to take a prudent approach to reviewing dividend payouts,
intensifying on-site inspections and the scrutiny of asset quality on less systemically important
banks, broadening and intensifying the supervisory review of banks’ internal models, and
seeking international agreement on maintaining effective standards for risk-weights.

39.
The regulatory reform agenda has also focused on ensuring that financial institutions
can fail in the UK without threatening financial stability or exposing taxpayers to losses:


The special resolution regime was overhauled in a series of steps, most recently through the
transposition of the EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive into UK law, and is now broadly
aligned with international standards. The available resolution powers and tools are now much
stronger than before the crisis, as are the coordination arrangements for crisis management,
both domestically and cross-border. But remaining differences with resolution regimes in other
jurisdictions could still impede orderly cross-border resolution, and the UK authorities are
playing a leading role internationally in addressing this issue.



The key challenge now is to complete the implementation of the revamped bank resolution
framework in the UK, involving the introduction of ring-fencing requirements for the core retail
activities of large banks, as well as the phasing-in of minimum requirements for own funds and
eligible liabilities (MREL) for all banks. Going forward, continuous efforts will be required to
ensure the resolvability of large, complex, and globally interconnected financial institutions as
their business models evolve. Towards this end, the authorities should build on current
arrangements to develop operational principles for funding of firms in resolution and should
work with international partners to develop an effective resolution regime for insurance firms
that could be systemically significant at the point of failure.

40.
The authorities should continue to improve their understanding of the scale and
drivers of the “de-risking” phenomenon. Based on this analysis, the authorities should also
develop tailored responses to mitigate potential adverse effects (Box 1).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

UNITED KINGDOM

Box 1. De-risking in the UK
Global banks, including those based in the UK, have been scaling back correspondent banking
relationships (CBRs). While the number of CBRs has been declining, there are some indications that
the global volume of transactions may be rising overall. Nonetheless, the curtailment of CBRs could
potentially impair cross-border financial intermediation (including remittance transfers and trade
finance) with certain jurisdictions and may cause customers and/or activities to migrate to less
transparent and unregulated service providers.
As part of this trend, UK global banks have been reviewing their customer base and business
lines. As a result, certain categories of customers have had accounts terminated, notably money
transmitters, non-profit organizations, FinTech firms, defense-related firms, and politically-exposed
persons. Loss of accounts by money transmitters and non-profit organizations could potentially impair
remittances, notably across the Somalia-UK corridor, and aid flows to conflict zones, creating spillover
risks.
The potential drivers behind the withdrawal of financial services are multiple. These drivers may
relate to business strategy and/or cost-benefit analysis, including in the context of enforcement of
regulatory obligations (e.g., capital and liquidity rules), AML/CFT, economic and trade sanctions, and
tax transparency. In some instances, the withdrawal of services has been the result of conflicting
regulations between jurisdictions (e.g., between data privacy and AML/CFT) that prevent correspondent
banks from conducting adequate customer due diligence. Banks cited as a further factor the
unevenness in the way international standards are applied and enforced globally, rather than the lack
of clarity in the laws that implement the standards.
The authorities have taken steps to understand the scale and drivers of these trends and have
engaged with concerned stakeholders. Going forward, the authorities should continue these efforts
to understand the issue and use this information to develop responses to mitigate potential adverse
impacts, including by further promoting dialogue with stakeholders; encouraging banks to further work
with their customers (e.g., respondent banks, money transmitters) on strengthening their AML/CFT
controls; clarifying regulatory expectations, notably in regard to the management of higher risk
customers; enhancing AML/CFT supervision of money transmitters; and working with other jurisdictions
to resolve conflicting regulations that impede cross-border information-sharing between
correspondent banks and their respondents.

Authorities’ Views
41.
The authorities welcomed the analysis in the FSAP and broadly agreed with its main
recommendations. They agreed that post-crisis reforms had significantly bolstered financial sector
resilience, though challenges remain and financial sector supervision and regulation would need to
remain vigilant as the financial cycle matured. The FPC expected to gradually raise the
countercyclical capital buffer over time, as it considered a buffer of 1 percent to be the appropriate
level for the normal phase of the financial cycle. The authorities also noted that non-traditional risks,
such as those related to cyber-security, were gaining prominence and required close attention. On
“de-risking,” the authorities agreed that it was important to better understand the drivers of this
phenomenon and were undertaking substantial analysis in this area.

D. Real Estate Markets and Related Macroprudential Policies
42.

Housing and mortgage markets have re-accelerated since mid-2015.



Between mid-2014 and mid-2015, house-price growth decelerated somewhat, and the
percentage of new mortgages with high loan-to-value (LTV) or high loan-to-income (LTI) ratios
declined (Figure 3). This moderate deceleration in housing and mortgage markets may have
partly reflected policy actions in mid-2014, including tougher mortgage lending requirements
(the FCA’s Mortgage Market Review) and an FPC restriction that no more than 15 percent of a
lender’s new mortgages be at or above a loan-to-income ratio of 4.5. Though the latter
restriction was not binding for the vast majority of lenders, it may have had a signaling effect
that prompted them to reduce high loan-to-income mortgages.



In recent months, however, house-price growth has re-accelerated, reaching 9 percent in March
2016—more than three times income growth. The share of new mortgages at high LTI ratios has
also started to tick back up (Figure 3) and remains well above pre-boom levels (i.e., circa 2000),
as does the aggregate household debt-to-income ratio, which is above the levels in other G-7
countries and whose rate of decline has recently slowed. Such high leverage significantly
exposes banks and households to interest-rate, income, and house-price shocks.

However, the recent acceleration in
housing markets could partly be a temporary
response to tax changes. In particular, the
acceleration may reflect an increased urgency to
purchase dwellings before the April 1, 2016,
implementation of a three percent stamp duty
surcharge on properties that are not primary
residences (e.g., buy-to-let properties). This view is
supported by RICS data on expected house prices,
which suggest a cooling of house prices going
forward.

Macroprudential policies will need to be tightened later this year if the acceleration
does not prove temporary. Given the uncertainty regarding the effects of recent tax changes and
the referendum on EU membership on the housing market, it is prudent to wait for greater clarity on
market conditions before taking further macroprudential tightening. However, if mortgage markets
remain buoyant beyond this period, further macroprudential tightening (tighter LTI and/or LTV limits
on new mortgages) will be needed later this year. Priority should also be given to the consolidation
of household-level credit data to allow a shift from LTI limits to debt-to-income ones, which cannot
be evaded by taking out multiple loans. Ensuring that macroprudential policies remain sufficiently
tight to support financial stability should also promote higher household saving and current account
adjustment.
45.
The buy-to-let (BTL) segment, which has grown rapidly in recent years, needs to be
put on an equal regulatory footing with the owner-occupied segment. Since 2012, the stock of
outstanding BTL mortgages has grown approximately four times as fast as the stock of mortgages in
the owner-occupied segment, with BTL accounting for more than one-third of gross mortgage
growth since 2012. The segment is dominated by small-scale landlords (owning 3 properties or less),
who are significantly more sensitive to interest-rate increases than owner occupiers. The decline in
rental yields, shown by the divergence between rents and house prices, magnifies this sensitivity, as
BTL borrowers tend to rely on rental income to cover mortgage payments. Studies also find that the
probability of default on BTL mortgages is higher than for owner-occupied mortgages and that BTL
mortgages are typically extended on interest-only terms (BoE, 2015; McCann, 2014; HMT, 2015).

Against this background, the authorities should extend the FPC’s powers of direction to the BTL
market, as proposed by a recent Treasury consultation paper, to avoid biasing the market toward
the BTL segment. The powers of direction should mirror those the FPC currently has over the owneroccupied market. Minimum underwriting standards for BTL mortgages should also be strengthened,
as proposed by a recent PRA consultation paper. The proposed standards would include guidelines
for testing the affordability of interest payments, including a minimum stressed interest rate to be
used when lenders conduct affordability tests. Finally, the authorities should work to disseminate
data on rental prices that are differentiated by region and the type of rented property in order to
advance the analysis of the rental market, buy vs. rent decisions, and the extent of house price
overvaluation.

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED KINGDOM

46.
Efforts should also continue to address supply constraints. A key cause of persistent high
growth in house prices is constrained supply due to restrictive planning and the post-recession loss
of building capacity. Increased housing supply would support near-term growth, reduce the need
for excessive household leverage, and promote social cohesion by lessening wealth inequality. The
government should thus build upon the recently undertaken initiatives to boost housing supply by
further exploring ways in which mobilization of unused publicly-owned lands and property tax
reform (see fiscal section above and 2015 Selected Issues) could ease supply constraints.

corporate credit constraints and reduce
business investment and economic activity. A sharp reversal of CRE prices could also adversely affect
financial stability via banks’ exposure to commercial real estate, though this channel has been
lessened by a post-crisis rebalancing of CRE funding away from domestic banks towards
international investors and nonbanks. However, this implies that adverse shocks to CRE may have
significant negative outward spillovers via the sector’s cross-border financial linkages.
Authorities’ Views
48.
The authorities noted that they continue to monitor real-estate related financial
stability risks closely and will take further action as warranted. The authorities emphasized that
the recent stamp duty change, action by the PRA (e.g., its consultation on BTL underwriting
standards), and possible referendum-related effects made it difficult to ascertain underlying trends
in the residential and commercial real estate markets and that the picture may clarify later this year.
On the BTL market, the FPC has requested powers of direction. Following its recently completed
consultation on the matter, the Treasury expected to publish a consultation response document,
including final legislation, in the coming months. The PRA also expected to follow-up soon on its
consultation on minimum underwriting standards for BTL mortgages.

E. Structural Reforms
49.
Structural reforms are an important complement to other macroeconomic policies. UK
goods and labor markets are some of the most competitive among advanced economies, with few
major barriers to entry. Nevertheless, structural reforms in certain key areas could help boost
potential growth, improve competitiveness and thus assist external adjustment, and help address
regional disparities. Structural reform priorities include the following:


Fiscal structural reforms. As elaborated upon in the fiscal section, priorities include tax reform,
pension reform, and boosting investment in infrastructure. On the latter, transport bottlenecks
constraining domestic regional development and external trade are especially notable. Recent
efforts to boost infrastructure spending, including the formation last year of a nonpartisan
National Infrastructure Commission, whose mandate is to lay out long-term plans for northern
connectivity, London transport, and energy policy and to depoliticize the process, are thus
welcome.



Housing supply. As elaborated upon in the section on real estate market developments, efforts
should continue to further boost housing supply, including by easing planning restrictions,
mobilizing unused publicly-owned lands for construction, and reforming property taxes to
encourage more efficient use of the housing stock. Boosting housing supply is an important
macroeconomic objective, because it supports growth by fostering construction, lubricates the
labor market by facilitating mobility, and bolsters financial stability by increasing home
affordability, thereby reducing households’ need to take on high debt.



Vocational training. Only four-fifths of those aged 15–19 are enrolled in education, below the

below the OECD average, should continue,
including increased support for childcare.

Corporate transparency
50.
The government recently adopted a comprehensive set of reforms to enhance
corporate transparency and combat tax evasion, corruption, and other financial crimes but
more should be done. Among other measures, these reforms include the establishment of a
register of people with significant control (i.e., beneficial ownership) of UK companies and limited
liability partnerships and a new initiative for the automatic sharing of beneficial ownership
information between countries. These reforms should be complemented by enhancing AML/CFT
regulatory compliance among trust and company service providers, lawyers, and accountants,
including by strengthening the effectiveness of their AML/CFT supervision.
51.
The government should further engage the Crown Dependencies (CDs) and British
Overseas Territories (BOTs) on enhancing corporate transparency and access to beneficial
ownership information. In setting their financial services and AML/CFT regulation, the CDs and
BOTs with financial centers have committed to establishing central beneficial ownership registries, or
equivalent systems, for entities incorporated in their jurisdictions. The government has also
concluded arrangements with these CDs and BOTs on the effective and unrestricted access to this
information by law enforcement and tax authorities. Key to the success of these initiatives will be
ensuring the quality of beneficial ownership information contained in these registries, or equivalent
systems, including by making them publicly accessible, through adequate enforcement, and by
pursuing similar initiatives with respect to trusts.
Authorities’ Views
52.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s structural reform priorities and noted that
significant actions had been taken in many of these areas. For example, the recently formed
National Infrastructure Commission was expected to further strengthen the quality of infrastructure
investment; much had already been done to boost housing supply, including significant reforms to
the planning system, with the authorities committed to going further; childcare benefits had been
adjusted in the 2015 Autumn Statement to support those on low incomes; and apprenticeship
opportunities had been expanded. On enhancing transparency of beneficial ownership, the
authorities noted that major reforms had been adopted over the past year, putting the UK at the
forefront of such efforts. And, while the authorities were actively engaging with CDs and BOTs to
strengthen transparency also in these jurisdictions, the authorities stressed that it was important to
recognize that CDs and BOTs set their own their financial services and AML/CFT regulation, in line
with self-governance arrangements.

F. Contingency Planning
53.
Macroeconomic policies will need to remain flexible and adjust if circumstances
change. Specific policy adjustments will need to be tailored to the specific scenario (Appendix II), as
in, for example, the following scenarios:

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

29

UNITED KINGDOM



An exit from the EU. If exit occurs, policies should be geared toward supporting stability and
reducing uncertainty. If markets reacted sharply and adversely, it would be important to ensure
that the financial system has adequate liquidity. In this regard, the BoE has appropriately
announced plans to hold additional liquidity auctions in the weeks around the referendum.
There may also be a need to activate swap facilities with other major central banks in the event
of a shortfall of foreign exchange liquidity. The implications for macroeconomic policies are not
clear cut, as the authorities may face a trade-off between stabilizing inflation and output: the
scope for macroeconomic policies to cushion a fall in economic activity will depend on an
assessment of supply and demand and the extent to which longer-run inflation expectations
remain well-anchored. At the same time, plans for additional medium-term budget
consolidation may need to be developed to offset the longer-run adverse fiscal effects.



Protracted demand shortfall and hysteresis. In the event of a protracted shortfall in aggregate
demand and weakening of potential output due to hysteresis effects, further demand support
should be provided by cutting interest rates, restarting quantitative easing, and using the
flexibility in the fiscal framework to halt structural fiscal adjustment (and, if necessary, move to
stimulus). Structural reform efforts, along the lines proposed in the previous section, should also
be redoubled to boost potential output.

Authorities’ Views
54.
The authorities stand ready to provide tailored responses to a wide range of shocks. In
the event of a vote to leave the EU, the macroeconomic response would depend on the relative
magnitudes of supply and demand effects, which the authorities view as difficult to judge
beforehand, and on the impact of the expected currency depreciation on prices and inflation
expectations. As such, they may face a trade-off between stabilizing inflation on the one hand and,
on the other, stabilizing output and employment. Similarly, the response to a protracted period of
slow growth would depend on whether this appeared to be mainly a result of deficient demand or
continued weak productivity growth. If the latter, tightening may be required to contain inflation
pressures and adjust to the adverse fiscal effects resulting from lower potential output.

STAFF APPRAISAL
55.
The UK economy has performed well in recent years. Economic growth has consistently
been near the top among major advanced economies, the employment rate has risen to a record
high, the fiscal deficit has been reduced, and major financial sector reforms have been adopted.
56.
Steady growth is expected to continue over the next few years under the baseline
scenario, with inflation gradually returning to target. Under staff’s baseline, which assumes that
the UK votes to remain in the EU, growth is projected to strengthen in late 2016 as referendumrelated effects wane and then to average near the potential rate over the medium term, given that
the output gap appears nearly closed. Inflation is expected to return gradually to target as effects of

30

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED KINGDOM

past commodity price falls dissipate and as low unemployment and minimum wage increases help
push up wages.
57.
However, this broadly positive baseline forecast is subject to notable risks. Key
vulnerabilities include possible shocks to global growth and asset prices; a low household saving
rate and still-high levels of household debt, despite a substantial reduction in the latter since the
crisis; a possible reversal of recently buoyant residential and commercial real estate markets; a wide
current account deficit; and risks that productivity growth may remain low for an extended period.
58.
In the near-term, the largest risks and uncertainties relate to the upcoming EU
referendum.


This year’s Article IV consultation occurs as the British people prepare to make a momentous
decision. Given the importance of the EU membership referendum, staff has analyzed its
potential macroeconomic implications, while recognizing that the choice of whether to remain in
the EU is for UK voters to make and that their decisions will reflect both economic and
noneconomic factors.



While there is much uncertainty about the precise economic effects of an exit from the EU, they
are likely negative and substantial. An exit would precipitate a protracted period of heightened
uncertainty that could weigh on confidence and investment and increase financial market
volatility, as negotiations on new arrangements could remain unresolved for years. The long-run
effects on UK output and incomes would also likely be negative and substantial, as increased
barriers would reduce trade, investment, and productivity. In addition, markets may bring
forward such medium- and long-term negative effects via an adverse reaction in the immediate
aftermath of a vote. Contagion effects could result in spillovers to regional and global markets,
although the primary impact would be felt domestically.



In the event of a Leave vote, policies should be geared toward supporting stability and reducing
uncertainty.

59.
In the baseline of a vote to remain in the EU, macroeconomic policies should focus on
promoting steady growth while reducing vulnerabilities. Monetary policy should remain
accommodative to support demand, while fiscal consolidation—which will help rebuild buffers—
should remain sufficiently gradual to avoid overburdening monetary policy. In this context, the
decision in the March budget to avoid near-term tightening was appropriate given the present
growth weakness and heightened uncertainty. At the same time, macroprudential policies should
remain sufficiently tight to mitigate financial stability risks that could arise if financial conditions turn
overly expansionary. In particular, mortgage-related macroprudential policies (e.g., LTI/LTV limits)
will need to be tightened later this year if housing and mortgage markets remain buoyant, with
similar limits applied also to the buy-to-let market. In addition, the authorities should actively use
the countercyclical capital buffer, which may well need to be increased later this year.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

31

UNITED KINGDOM

60.
Macroeconomic policies will also need to respond flexibly to any shocks. In the event of
protracted demand weakness and inflation undershooting, monetary and fiscal policies should be
eased. Conversely, monetary tightening may need to be initiated earlier than currently envisaged if
core inflation or wage growth in excess of productivity growth begins to rise sharply.
61.
It will be imperative to have a robust and intrusive approach to prudential supervision
and regulation as the financial cycle matures and memories of the crisis fade. Financial sector
soundness has improved notably since the crisis, owing in large part to a wave of welcome postcrisis regulatory reforms, and stress tests suggest that the major elements of the financial system
appear resilient to shocks. Ensuring the safety of the UK financial sector is not only a domestic
concern, but is also critical to maintaining global financial stability, given the UK’s importance as a
global financial center. In line with the recommendations of the accompanying FSSA, priorities
include the following:


Interconnectedness across financial system sectors has the potential to amplify shocks and turn
sector-specific distress systemic. One priority is thus to further strengthen analysis and data on
interconnectedness and related risks.



Further efforts are also needed to complete the resolution reform agenda. In particular, the
authorities should build on current arrangements to develop operational principles for funding
of firms in resolution and work with international partners to develop an effective resolution
regime for insurance firms that could be systemically significant at the point of failure.



The authorities should also ensure close scrutiny of banks’ internal models and seek
international agreement on maintaining effective standards for risk weights.

62.
The authorities should continue efforts to deepen their understanding of the “derisking” phenomenon and develop tailored responses. Such responses could include further
promoting dialogue with stakeholders; clarifying regulatory expectations, notably in regard to the
management of higher risk customers; and enhancing AML/CFT supervision of money transmitters.
63.
Further structural reforms are necessary to complement the macroeconomic policy
mix and promote growth and stability. One priority is to boost housing supply, including by
further easing planning restrictions, mobilizing unused publicly-owned land for construction, and
reforming property taxes to encourage more efficient use of the housing stock. Other priorities
including increasing investment in infrastructure, reducing distortionary tax expenditures and the
debt bias in the tax code, boosting skills by further expanding vocational training, raising labor force
participation through increased childcare support, and building on recent reforms to further
enhance corporate transparency and combat financial crimes.
64.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12month cycle.

Foreign asset
and liability
position and
trajectory

Background. The net international investment position (NIIP) stood at -3.5 percent of GDP at
end-2015. Staff projections for the current account and GDP suggest that the official NIIP to
GDP ratio would fall moderately over the medium term, though the importance of uncertain
valuation effects implies significant uncertainty to these estimates.1/ Gross assets and liabilities
are more than 500 percent of GDP, reflecting the international activities of large financial
institutions.
Assessment. The NIIP and sustainability issues are not yet a concern. But fluctuations in the
underlying gross positions are a source of external vulnerability to the extent that they could
lead to large changes in the net position.

Current
account

Background. During the recovery from the crisis, the CA balance deteriorated from
-1.7 percent of GDP in 2011 to -5.1 percent of GDP in 2014. The decline in the CA balance was
accounted for primarily by a lower income balance, reflecting a fall in earnings on the UK’s
foreign direct investment abroad, notably earnings on investment exposed to the euro area. In
contrast, the trade balance has been stable at around -2 percent of GDP. In 2015, the current
account balance stayed broadly unchanged at -5.2 percent of GDP. Terms of trade effects have
been negligible.
From a savings-investment perspective, the current account deficit partly reflects a relatively
high general government deficit (4.4 percent of GDP in 2015) and a low household saving rate
(4.3 percent in 2015).

Overall Assessment:
The external position in
2015 was weaker than
implied by medium-term
fundamentals and desirable
policy settings.
External deficits reflect
insufficient public and
private saving rates. The
REER depreciation that has
occurred in early 2016 goes
in the direction of reducing
overvaluation. However,
uncertainty about the
outcome of the
forthcoming referendum
and its possible effects on
growth, trade flows, and the
labor market have created a
wider range of uncertainty
in assessing the external
position.
Potential policy responses:
Sustaining strong and
durable growth in the UK
requires rebalancing toward
greater reliance on external
demand. The current fiscal

UNITED KINGDOM

Assessment. The EBA CA regression approach estimates a CA gap of -4.2 percent of GDP for
2015. However, the post-crisis deterioration in the income balance is not expected to be all
permanent, suggesting a smaller underlying CA deficit and smaller CA gap than implied by the
EBA model. 2/ In comparison to previous years, the CA assessment is also subject to a wider
margin of uncertainty due to uncertainty about the outcome of the June 2016 referendum on
EU membership and its possible effects on projected current accounts and the CA norm.
Taking this and other factors (such as the CA gaps implied by the REER regressions discussed
below) into account, staff assesses the 2015 cyclically-adjusted CA balance to be 1.5 to
4.5 percent of GDP weaker than the current account norm.

Overall Assessment

Annex I. External Sector Assessment

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

United Kingdom

Real exchange
rate

Background. The UK’s average REER for 2015 was 15 percent more appreciated than in 2013.
This appreciation may reflect the UK’s relatively strong domestic demand and differences in
interest rates (both current and prospective) between the UK and many advanced economies.
However, as of April 2016, the REER had depreciated 7 percent relative to its average for 2015,
which may reflect some unwinding of the overvaluation in 2015, as well as heightened
uncertainty ahead of the June 2016 referendum.
Assessment. For 2015, the EBA exchange rate assessment implied by the EBA CA regression
model indicates an overvaluation of 18 percent. Both EBA REER regressions estimate an
overvaluation of 12 percent. Staff assesses the 2015 REER as 5 to 20 percent above the level
consistent with fundamentals and desirable policy settings; this assessment is informed by and
consistent with the staff’s CA assessment.
Background. Given the UK’s role as an international financial center, portfolio investment and
financial derivatives are the key components of the financial account.

FX
intervention
and reserves
level

Background. The pound has the status of a global reserve currency.

Technical
Background
Notes

1/ The official NIIP data might understate the true position—attempts to value FDI at market
values suggest a higher NIIP. Market value estimates of FDI assets assume that values move in
line with equity market indices in the UK and abroad. These estimates are uncertain, as actual
FDI market values could evolve differently from equity markets.

Assessment. Large fluctuations in capital flows are inherent to financial transactions in
countries with a large financial services sector. This volatility is a potential source of
vulnerability.

Assessment. Reserves held by the UK are typically low relative to standard metrics, and the
currency is free floating.

2/ The income balance is expected to rise somewhat as net returns on foreign investments rise
as unusually low returns partially mean-revert. See the February 2016 UK Selected Issues paper
for further discussion.

British voters elect to leave the EU in their June 23rd

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the
view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a
probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The
RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually
exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Annex III. Debt Sustainability Analysis1
Public sector gross debt stands at about 92 percent of GDP in FY15/16 and is projected to decline
steadily to around 78 percent of GDP by FY21/22. Fiscal consolidation will need to continue in the
medium term to ensure the debt ratio stays on a downward path and to rebuild buffers over time.
All debt profile vulnerabilities are below early warning benchmarks, but the projected debt
trajectory is susceptible to various shocks, especially a negative real GDP growth shock.

Baseline and Realism of Projections


Macroeconomic assumptions. Real GDP in FY16/17 is projected to grow by 1.9 percent,
supported by private domestic demand. In subsequent years, growth is projected to stay around
2.1 percent. Inflation is projected to gradually rise closer to 2.0 percent in the medium term.
Short-term interest rates are projected to start rising several years from now, gradually
increasing by a total of 70 basis points by FY21/22.



Fiscal adjustment. The authorities aim to eliminate the overall budget deficit by FY19/20. In
staff’s baseline projections, the primary balance strengthens over the medium term from a
deficit of 1.0 percent of GDP in FY16/17 to a surplus of 2.3 percent of GDP in FY21/22.



Heat map and debt profile vulnerabilities. Risks from the debt level are deemed high by
DSA standards, as the level of debt exceeds the benchmark of 85 percent of GDP under the
baseline and stress scenarios. However, gross financing needs—estimated at around
11 percent of GDP in FY15/16—remain comfortably below the benchmark of 20 percent of
GDP, and all debt profile vulnerability indicators are below early warning thresholds.2 Interest
rates and CDS spreads also suggest that markets view debt vulnerabilities as low.



Realism of baseline assumptions. The median forecast errors for real GDP growth and
inflation (actual minus projection) during FY07/08–FY15/16 are -0.2 percent and -0.4 percent,
respectively, suggesting a slight upward bias in staff’s past projections. The median forecast
error for the primary balance is -0.3 percent of GDP, suggesting that staff projections have
been slightly optimistic. The cross-country experience suggests that the envisaged CAPB
adjustment of about 3.5 percentage points of GDP in FY17/18–FY19/20 appears to be slightly
ambitious. However, given the authorities’ commitment to fiscal consolidation, the path
appears credible provided that output continues to grow in line with the baseline projections.

The data are presented on fiscal year (April-March) basis with ratios calculated using fiscal year GDP (not
centered-fiscal year GDP). Public debt series include housing associations starting from FY08/09.

Gross financing needs are defined as overall new borrowing requirement plus debt maturing during the year
(including short-term debt).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UNITED KINGDOM

Shocks and Stress Tests
The DSA suggests that medium-term debt dynamics are not highly sensitive to interest rate
shocks given the long average maturity of government debt (about 14 years), but remain
susceptible to growth shocks.


Growth shock. In this scenario, real output growth rates are lowered by one standard
deviation in FY17/18 and FY18/19 (the cumulative growth shock is nearly as much as the
cumulative growth shock in the adverse scenario in the accompanying Selected Issues paper,
though the latter contains additional effects beyond GDP shocks). The primary balance
improves more slowly than in the baseline, reaching a surplus of 0.4 percent of GDP only in
FY19/20. Under these assumptions, the debt-to-GDP ratio rises to about 93 percent of GDP
by FY18/19 and declines only gradually thereafter. Gross financing needs rise slightly to
about 11 percent of GDP by FY18/19 and stays at a similar level through FY21/22.



Primary balance shock. This scenario assumes that fiscal consolidation stalls between
FY16/17 and FY17/18, with no change in the primary balance. The debt-to GDP ratio falls
more slowly than the baseline, reaching about 81 percent of GDP by FY21/22, roughly
3 percentage points of GDP higher than the baseline. Gross financing needs also rise to
around 10 percent of GDP by FY17/18.



Interest rate shock. In this scenario, a 215 basis points increase in interest rates is assumed
from FY17/18 on. The effective interest rate edges up to 3.2 percent by FY21/22, but only
½ percentage points higher than the baseline. The impacts on debt and gross financing
needs are expected to be mild.



Combined macro-fiscal scenario. This scenario aggregates shocks to real growth, the
interest rate, and the primary balance. Under these assumptions, the debt-to-GDP ratio
reaches close to 95 percent of GDP in FY18/19 and declines only gradually to around
91 percent of GDP by FY21/22. Gross financing needs would rise to 12 percent by FY21/22.



Contingent fiscal shock. This scenario assumes, hypothetically, that a banking crisis leads to
one-time bail out of the financial sector, raising non-interest expenditure by 3 percent of
banking sector assets in FY17/18. Real GDP is also reduced by one standard deviation for two
years. Under this hypothetical scenario, the debt-to-GDP ratio would rise to 103 percent of
GDP in FY18/19, and gross financing needs would reach 20 percent of GDP at their peak.



Stagnant growth and low inflation scenario. This scenario assumes that real growth would
slow and remain stagnant while inflation also stays well below the inflation target throughout
the projection period. This event could be triggered by globally weak demand and
persistently low inflation in advanced economies. With subdued growth rates, the revenueto-GDP ratio would be lower than in the baseline by one percentage point of GDP. Debt
would not be put on a clear downward path, with the debt ratio staying above the FY16/17
level. Gross financing needs would hover around 10 percent of GDP.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
The UK authorities maintain a free floating regime.
The UK accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 on February 15, 1961. It
maintains an exchange system free of multiple currency practices and restrictions on payments and
transfer for current international transactions, except for exchange restrictions imposed solely for
the preservation of national or international security. The UK notifies the Fund of the maintenance of
measures imposed solely for the preservation of national and international security under Executive
Board Decision No. 144–(52/51). The last of these notifications was made on January 9, 2012
(EBD/12/2).

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Economic and financial data provided to the Fund are considered adequate for surveillance
purposes. The UK subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and meets the
SDDS specifications for the coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of data. SDDS metadata are posted
on the Dissemination Standard Bulletin Board (DSBB). The UK has adopted the European System of
National and Regional Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010) and the Balance of Payment and International
Investment Position Manual, sixth edition (BPM6).
The UK government has commissioned a review of the UK’s current and future statistical needs and
the capacity to meet those needs, prompted by increasing difficulty in measuring output and
productivity and a perception that official data could be improved.
An interim report, published in December 2015, found that conventional statistical measures and
methods are increasingly challenged as the UK economy becomes more service oriented, as
businesses operate more across national borders, as digitization of economic activities increases,
and as the boundaries between market and home production become more blurred. These issues
are relevant to a number of advanced and transition economies. The interim report recommends a
number of specific steps, such as greater integration of data sources and use of administrative data,
addressing shortcomings to national accounts and flow of funds measures, and improvements to UK
trade, construction, and CPI statistics. Staff welcomes these recommendations.
The final report was published on March 11, 2016. The report made six strategic recommendations
regarding measuring the economy, ONS capability and performance, and governance of statistics.
The recommendations are as follows:


Address established statistical limitations.



Become more agile in the provision of statistics that properly reflect the changing structure and
characteristics of the economy.



Refocus the culture of ONS towards better meeting user needs.



Make the most of existing and new data sources and the technologies for dealing with them.



Become better at understanding and interrogating data.



Strengthen the governance framework so as to help support the production of high-quality
economic statistics.
