MALTA
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
March 6, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context: After a strong recovery in 2010, the economy has continued to perform well
amidst considerable turbulence in the euro area. While spillovers have remained
contained to date, Malta’s large financial sector (above eight times GDP, see Box 1) and
highly open economy heighten contagion and financial stability risks. The government,
which has a one-seat majority in Parliament, narrowly survived a vote of no confidence
in January. The policy challenge now is to maintain growth and employment, while
building buffers against a highly uncertain international environment.
Fiscal policy: Following a significant fiscal effort that reduced the deficit to 3 percent of
GDP in 2011, a gradual deficit reduction path of structural annual adjustment of
½ percentage point of GDP would be appropriate. This will help offset the headwinds
facing the economy in the near term, while achieving debt sustainability over the
medium term. At the same time, better governance and restructuring of public
corporations are necessary to reduce contingent liabilities.
Financial sector policy: Safeguarding financial sector stability in this challenging
international environment requires sound governance, effective supervision, and robust
financial buffers. Improving the framework for financial crisis management and bank
resolution and strengthening the deposit compensation scheme could help limit the
impact of contagion. Financial stability will benefit from upgrading the macroprudential policy framework. It is crucial to improve systemic risk monitoring,
particularly of spillover risks posed by international banks, and design contingency
plans accordingly.
Structural reforms: Longer-term policy challenges remain pressing, including those
related to population ageing, labor force participation, and energy policy. These
challenges underscore the need to deepen and broaden the reforms so far, raise
productivity growth, and further improve competitiveness. Building on progress already
made, pensions reform will contribute to resolving anticipated long-term fiscal
imbalances and support medium-term growth.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

MALTA

BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Malta is the smallest euro area
economy, highly dependent on trade and
tourism. Foreign-owned nonfinancial
corporations dominate the domestic market
and the economy relies on FDI flows and EU
funds for investment. These factors make the
economy vulnerable to external shocks.
2.
In addition, Malta has a large
financial sector with substantial
international linkages (Box 1). The banking
sector, whose assets are eight times GDP, is
segmented into: (i) domestically-oriented
banks (about 2½ times GDP), half of which are
foreign owned, with sound capital and liquidity
buffers, low leverage, and a conservative
funding model (deposit-to-loan ratio above
100 percent); and (ii) internationally-oriented
banks, including subsidiaries of EU banks, with
limited involvement in the local economy.
3.
Spillovers from the ongoing euro
area debt crisis have, nonetheless, remained
contained to date. After a strong recovery
in 2010, the economy has continued to
perform well amidst considerable turbulence
across the euro area and North Africa
(Figures 1–6). Despite weakening external
demand in the second half of the year, real
GDP growth is estimated at 2 percent in 2011,
supported by private consumption and strong
growth in tourism and services exports. In
contrast with other euro economies, Malta’s
real GDP is 1.5 percent above its pre-crisis

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

peak (compared to 2 percent below for the
euro area). Labor market indicators improved
and the unemployment rate receded to
6.4 percent (from the crisis peak of
6.9 percent), well below the euro area average
of 10 percent.
Contrary to other euro area economies, Malta's real
GDP is above its pre-crisis peak.

4.
Financial contagion has also
remained contained. Market reaction to the
recent rating downgrades affecting Malta and
a number of euro area economies was muted,
as Maltese government debt is predominantly
held domestically. In fact, bond yields declined
slightly during 2011 on robust demand. In
turn, the sensitivity of the Maltese banking
sector to sovereign risk events in Europe is
low. This reflects Maltese banks’ very low
exposures to EU periphery debt, as well as
domestic banks’ reliance on a traditional retail
deposit-based banking model.

MALTA 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 1. Structure of the Maltese Banking Sector
Within the euro area, Malta ranks among the highest
in terms of banking sector assets to GDP. Malta’s
banking sector, with total assets of almost eight
times GDP, is composed of seven domesticallyoriented and nineteen international banks, of which
some are connected with the domestic economy

Domestically-oriented banks, with total assets of
244 percent of GDP, are a set of seven banks, which
are important for domestic financial stability. Three
are domestically-owned and four are subsidiaries of
other EU banks. These banks operate a traditional
business model and have limited exposure to
troubled euro area countries and did not invest in
ABS or other subprime securities. Deposit-loan ratios
were above 125 percent in the first half of 2011,
which suggests no direct (wholesale) funding
pressures. Regulatory capital stood at 15.8 percent
and the tier 1 ratio was 12.3 percent, well above
market and EBA benchmarks, while leverage was
relatively contained at 9 times total assets in the
third quarter of 2011. Return on equity was
9.4 percent. Their main vulnerabilities are credit risk,
stemming from high loan exposures to construction,
real estate activities and mortgages; and spillover
effects from the euro area crisis.
The international banking sector refers to a diverse
group of banks with assets totaling about
550 percent of GDP. This segment can be further
broken down into one which interacts in a limited
way with Maltese residents (about 80 percent of

GDP) and one with no links (about 470 percent of
GDP). Ten of these banks are subsidiaries of foreign
banks (of which seven from other EU countries), six
domestic, and three organized as branches (of which
two non-EU). Some of these institutions are very
small, with assets of only €8 million, while the two
largest have combined assets of nearly €20 billion.
Most of their activity is focused on non-resident
business (trade finance, investment banking, intragroup, international money transfer, custodian
services). However, the sector’s interaction with
domestic financing of the economy appears to be on
the rise, mainly through deposit-taking, bond
issuance and participation in ECB operations, and as
such may also affect domestic financial stability. The
average Tier 1 capital ratio for international banks
amounted to 97.5 percent in June 2011 (40 percent
excluding one outlier). Profitability was generally
higher than for domestically-oriented banks. The
sector’s main sources of risk are potential crossborder deleveraging pressures and sensitivity to
international financial market trends (due to high
reliance on market/wholesale funding, including
intra-group), possibly affecting activities in Malta.
For Malta as a financial sector hub, there may be
reputation risks if one of these banks were to find
itself in difficulties, as the country prides itself of a
flexible yet robust supervisory regime.

Compared to euro area peers,
Maltese banks continue to outperform in
terms of profits and capital adequacy
(Figures 7–8). Bank profitability declined
during 2011, but remains strong (Annex III).
Interest income remains broadly stable thanks
to a wide interest margin and a moderate
pass-through of ECB policy rate changes.
Credit growth fell in 2011, but remains well
above the euro area’s loan growth rate (Box 2).
Capital buffers for domestic banks remain
sound, with a core Tier 1 ratio of 12.3 percent
and low leverage (deposit to loan ratio of
127 percent). One Maltese bank was selected
to participate in the 2010–11 EBA stress tests
and passed, with a core tier 1 ratio of
10.4 percent. As a follow-up, all Maltese
domestic banks were subject to similar stress
tests by the authorities, with positive results.

external competitiveness. As discussed in

Box 2. Credit Growth, Bank Lending Conditions and Private Sector Deleveraging

Overall credit growth in 2011 was 3.5 percent, down
from 4.2 percent in 2010. Lending to non-financial
corporates (NFCs) grew at a negative rate in the first
eight months of 2011, but subsequently firmed up to
2.9 percent in December 2011 (year on year). Loans
to households fell slightly, from 6.6 percent in 2010
to 6.2 percent in 2011. These different credit growth
patterns are also visible when expressed as
a percentage of GDP. NFC lending appears volatile
and procyclical, accelerating when global growth

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
8.
The economy now faces a worsening
external environment that is creating new
risks to growth and financial stability. The
fragile global macroeconomic environment
and sustained market volatility are expected to
dampen real export growth in 2012. Domestic
sources of growth may not be sufficient to
offset the drop in external demand, given
headwinds from a soft real estate market and
the ongoing fiscal consolidation. Combined
with increased uncertainty, this will also keep
private consumption subdued. In turn, private
investment is projected to fall further on
deteriorating business confidence. With the
euro area expected to go into a mild recession
this year, staff projects Malta’s real GDP
growth in 2012 to be a modest 1 percent.
Growth is expected to rebound in 2013 and
remain near the potential growth rate of
2 percent over the medium-term.

Downside risks to the baseline
reflect the potential for spillovers from an
intensification of the euro area crisis.
Malta’s high degree of trade openness and
very large financial sector heighten contagion
risks.


Risks to growth. A deeper than expected
downturn in the euro area could have a
significant impact on growth through trade
and tourism. Staff analysis suggests that
Malta’s growth is particularly affected by

MALTA 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

spillovers from shocks in Italy, France, and
the UK. A concurrent decline of trading
partners’ growth by half a standard
deviation could lower Malta’s growth by
0.5–0.7 percentage points in 2012 (Box 3).
In addition, domestic uncertainty in
economic policy could adversely affect
growth if investment decisions and
structural reforms are put on hold.


Risks to financial stability. Financial
contagion could shake the confidence in
the entire banking sector. Although the
domestically-oriented banks are wellcapitalized and funded by retail deposits, a
massive retrenchment by parent banks in
Europe could disproportionally affect the
Maltese economy, whose size is negligible
relative to parent banks’ balance sheets.
And although a liquidity shock on
internationally-oriented banks that rely on
cross-border (mostly parent) wholesale
funding would not materially impact the
domestic economy, given their very low

market share, it could have negative
effects on the Maltese banking sector
through confidence and reputational
effects. These vulnerabilities are
aggravated by an inadequately funded
deposit compensation scheme, coupled by
concerns about too-big-to-save and fiscal
sustainability in case of default or deposit
run that required the government to step
in.
Authorities’ views
10.
The authorities shared the views on
key risks, but remain “cautiously optimistic”
on the growth outlook. The authorities
underscored the country’s ability so far to
weather the euro area crisis well, attributed in
their view, to the diversified nature of the
Maltese economy. They highlighted that
continued FDI inflows, increased tourism
activity, resumption of trade with Libya, and
sustained growth of financial and business
services would support growth in 2012.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
11.
Malta’s resilience to date cannot be
taken for granted. The main policy challenge
in 2012 will be to navigate a highly uncertain
macroeconomic environment with a
deteriorating economic outlook and the
ongoing banking and sovereign crisis in
Europe. Staff emphasized the need for
contingency planning for the event that

growth is substantially worse than expected or
there is financial contagion from a potential
intensification of the euro area crisis. At the
same time, the authorities need to balance
concerns over a slowing economy, which calls
for accommodative policies, against increased
risks that require more prudent fiscal
management.

A. Ensuring Fiscal Sustainability While Supporting Growth
12.
In an impressive turnaround, the
authorities delivered a strong structural
adjustment in 2011. The general government
deficit narrowed to 3 percent of GDP in 2011,

down from 3.7 percent of GDP in 2010, and
the primary balance was in surplus for the first
time since 2007 (Figure 6). After adjusting for

Data are from 2000Q1 to 2011Q3.

Malta’s high degree of openness exposes the
country to external shocks. Historically, Malta’s
growth has been relatively volatile and driven mostly
by domestic components. However, growth has
increasingly co-moved with that in the euro area
since the start of the global financial crisis, reflecting
increasing trade and financial integration supported
by the Euro adoption in 2008. A VAR-based growth
spillover analysis suggests that the large downturn
during the 2008–09 crisis was mostly attributable to

negative spillovers from other economies. In turn,
the recent recovery was supported by improved
external conditions. Going forward, Malta’s growth
dynamics are expected to be aligned with its foreign
counterparts, whereas domestic shocks will continue
to be a drag. It is estimated that a concurrent decline
of trading partners’ growth by half a standard
deviation (equivalent to 1.2 percentage points of
GDP) could lower Malta’s growth by
0.5–0.7 percentage point in 2012.

13.
Nonetheless, the composition of
adjustment remains suboptimal. Tax
buoyancy and revenue measures, including
increases in excise duties and a revision of VAT
rates on accommodation, accounted for most
of the improvement in the fiscal balance
in 2011. In contrast, total expenditure-to-GDP
remained largely unchanged, as savings from
the expiration of the 2010 stimulus measures
and limits on recruitment in the public sector
were offset by increases in social transfers and
goods and services. As in recent years, the
absorption capacity of EU funds related to
capital expenditures remains a problem, with
less than two-thirds of the allocated amount
utilized.
14.
The government’s commitment to
return to fiscal balance over the medium
term remains essential. Further fiscal
consolidation is required to ensure sustainable
debt dynamics, thus reducing fiscal risks to
manageable levels. The pace and composition
of adjustment should be attuned to the

economic cycle. After the strong effort in 2011,
a gradual deficit reduction path of structural
annual adjustment of ½ percentage points of
GDP, while letting automatic stabilizers
operate in full, would be appropriate. Given
the projected weakening of the economy, this
may imply a slightly lower adjustment in
nominal terms.
15.
This moderate adjustment path
would strike the right balance between the
growth and debt sustainability objectives.
More specifically, it would:


Offset somewhat the headwinds facing the
economy in the near term. A larger fiscal
contraction in 2012 would be detrimental
to growth in light of the cyclical
deceleration and Malta’s high exposure to
countries also planning relatively large
fiscal contractions.



Still achieve debt sustainability over the
medium term. The suggested consolidation
would put debt on a downward trend

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALTA

starting in 2013, reaching a debt-to-GDP
ratio of 60 percent by 2018. This would
allow Malta to cope with future adverse
shocks and demographic-related spending
pressures.
But notwithstanding Malta’s favorable debt
management policies, it will be important to
avoid the recent “stop-go” pattern of fiscal
policy to ensure continued confidence in
Malta’s public finances. Malta’s sovereign debt
is predominantly (97 percent) held by
residents, its average maturity is relatively high
(7 years), and rollover risks are manageable
with strong demand for government paper
and a strategy to smooth the maturity profile.

16.
To be credible, the adjustment
should be backed by concrete measures and
focused on containing spending. Staff
projects the deficit to narrow by
0.3 percentage points of GDP (or
½ percentage points in structural terms) to

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

2.7 percent of GDP in 2012. The difference with
the authorities’ target of 2.3 percent of GDP is
explained by staff’s cautious assessment of the
measures in the 2012 budget and spending
review, more conservative growth projections
(with widening output gap), and higher
estimated outturn in 2011. The size of the
projected adjustment is appropriate, in light of
the weakening economy. However, the
consolidation remains largely revenue-based.
Further increases in excise duties, incentives to
reduce tax arrears, and increases in social
security contributions are expected to drive
the adjustment effort. Indeed, expenditure-toGDP is projected to increase, as announced
tightening measures (0.6 percent of GDP) will
be more than offset by increases in public
investment and capital transfers—largely
related to the planned Air Malta capital
injection. Sound measures underpinning the
fiscal effort beyond 2012 need to be specified
for the consolidation to be credible.
17.
Bold policy actions are necessary to
reduce contingent liabilities arising from
the public corporations. Governmentguaranteed debt amounts to 17 percent of
GDP, 60 percent of which is accounted for by
Enemalta—the public energy utility
corporation. This may increase further as
Enemalta’s planned investments over the next
three years amount to 6 percent of GDP. Staff
indicated that sustained high oil prices may
require tariff increases if the company is to
avoid losses or government assistance. Better
governance and restructuring of Air Malta and
Enemalta will help staunch losses and limit
subsidies, although the latter may entail some
upfront fiscal costs.1 It is essential to agree on
a medium to long term strategic plan and

permit professional independent management
to lead these entities, subject to sound
governance and performance targets.
18.
Building on progress already made,
further pensions reform will contribute to
resolving anticipated long-term fiscal
imbalances and support medium-term
growth. The projected increase in ageingrelated expenditures is twice the EU average,
reflecting an expected sharp rise in
dependency ratios that renders the current
pay-as-you-go system unsustainable. Staff
recommended that the authorities build the
necessary consensus to push forward the main
recommendations of the Pensions Working
Group, notably: (i) indexing the retirement age
to longevity; and (ii) introducing a mandatory
privately funded second pillar and voluntary
third pillar. Consideration could also be given
to introducing a notional defined contribution
first pension and to accelerating the planned
gradual increase in the retirement age to 65.

new EU fiscal guidelines. They concurred with
staff’s recommendation to balance growth and
debt sustainability considerations, but were
confident that the 2012 target would be met.
To this end, there had been an early budget
review (instead of mid-year), which identified
additional spending measures. Regarding
composition of the fiscal adjustment, the
authorities noted that one-off revenue
measures reflected to some extent one-off
spending items. The authorities acknowledged
the long-run fiscal challenges. Pension reform
is currently under review to increase the
scheme adequacy and sustainability. The
authorities highlighted some concerns
associated with implementing a second pillar
pension, including the fall in the value of
pension funds world-wide as a result of the
global financial crisis and the potential impact
on employers (higher contribution costs) and
employees (less disposable income). The
authorities stressed that new EU requirements
on budgetary frameworks and governance
would add credibility to their consolidation
effort (Annex II).

The authorities reiterated their
commitment to fiscal discipline and the

B. Improving Financial System Soundness
20.
The financial sector has continued to
perform strongly, but—given the large
external risks—it is important to strengthen
the sector’s resilience further. As noted in
section I, the banking sector appears healthy,
but the sector’s sheer size and large foreign
ownership represent a number of risks to
financial stability and fiscal sustainability.
These include concerns about too-big-to-save
and the adequacy of backstopping resources
in case of default or deposit run, the capacity
to deal with the impact of a banking sector
shock on the economy, and supervisory

challenges. The size of the non-bank financial
sector is, on the other hand, relatively small
and risks appear limited.
21.
Maintaining financial sector stability
requires a multi-faceted approach,
encompassing macro-prudential policies and
surveillance, micro-prudential regulation and
supervision, and contingency planning, safety
net, and crisis management (Annex IV).

MALTA

Macro-prudential Policy and Systemic Risk
Monitoring
22.
The authorities are clarifying the
institutional architecture for macroprudential policy. In line with recent ESRB
recommendations and IMF staff analysis2, this
should include:


Determining the institution or forum with
ultimate decision-making powers to
recommend and enforce macro-prudential
polices. The Maltese authorities are
considering a joint financial stability
committee between the Central Bank of
Malta (CBM) and the Maltese Financial
Services Authority (MFSA).



Defining the tasks, powers, and
instruments of the macro-prudential
authority.



Establishing clear lines of accountability.



Ensuring operational independence from
political bodies and from the financial
industry.

23.
Macro-prudential policy requires a
capacity to identify systemic risks early
enough so timely action can be taken to
support financial stability. Staff
recommended further strengthening the
analysis of risks posed by the financial sector,
particularly the internationally-oriented banks
that have or intend to grow their Maltese

footprints, especially by taking deposits locally
and investing them internationally. In this
context, staff commended the Central Bank of
Malta (CBM) and the Malta Financial Services
Authority (MFSA) for extending the EU-wide
stress testing exercise to all domestic banks,
and for extensively participating in EU-wide
insurance sector stress tests.
Micro-prudential Regulation and
Supervision
24.
Malta’s financial regulatory and
supervisory framework should keep pace
with the demands and risks of a
sophisticated and fast-growing financial
market. As part of its self-imposed quality
controls, in 2010 the MFSA commissioned an
independent assessment of regulation and
supervision of banking, insurance, and
securities markets against the respective
international standards (Box 1, Annex IV). The
assessment concluded that progress had been
made since the 2003 IMF Financial Stability
Assessment Program (FSAP), but weaknesses
remained in supervisory capacity (notably
staffing), definition and monitoring of
connected party transactions, and internal
audit functions. The increase in recruitment of
qualified staff, the creation of an enforcement
unit, and work in the area of concentration risk
represent commendable progress. Continuing
efforts along the report’s recommendations
are needed to more fully comply with
international sound practice. A review of the
MFSA’s consumer protection and business
conduct functions could be considered to
secure consumer protection, promote
efficiency, and enhance the integrity of the
financial system.
25.
Substantial credit concentration in
the banking sector and rising credit risks

MALTA 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

warrant close supervisory scrutiny and
strong financial buffers. Lending is highly
concentrated in housing and construction,
loan quality has deteriorated3, and the number
of restructured loans increased. Worryingly,
provisioning is a mere 19 percent of nonperforming loans, substantially below the euro
area average. Bank profitability may suffer if
loan losses were to increase further, due to
declines in real estate prices or a fall in growth
(Annex III). Furthermore, Maltese banks may be
adversely affected by the forthcoming EU
Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV).
Preliminary estimates by the MFSA and CBM
indicate that Maltese banks could face liquidity
shortfalls under current proposals. Against this
background:


Banks with riskier profiles should be
encouraged to increase provisioning and
restrain dividend payout policies to
strengthen capital buffers.



Further improvement in the MFSA’s
assessment of the robustness of banks’
processes for loan classification,
impairment determination, and
provisioning are needed, and plans to
enhance these aspects of supervision are
welcome.

profile of their deposit base as they still
rely largely on demand deposits.
Anecdotal evidence indicates that this is
already underway as various banks are
offering multi-year deposits and new
products at attractive rates.
Financial Sector Safety Net
26.
In light of the ongoing euro area
crisis, it is imperative to ensure a sound
financial safety net.


Contingency planning for crisis
preparedness should move to the
forefront of the policy agenda and involve:
(i) stress testing to assess the adequacy of
financial buffers; (ii) the development of
scenarios for key material risks;
(iii) performing crisis simulation exercises
regularly, covering all systemically relevant
institutions, as well as cross-border
dimensions; and (iv) reviewing existing
coordination arrangements between the
key institutions. It would be advisable for
the MFSA to incorporate these techniques
as standard components of its supervisory
approach.



The range of resolution tools will be
broadened once new European regulations
come in place. These encompass prompt
corrective action, partial purchase and

the establishment of a resolution fund.

Authorities’ views
27.
The authorities shared the mission’s
emphasis on prudent management of the

financial sector. As a precaution, the central
bank has called on banks to maintain
conservative dividend policies and increase
provisioning. The authorities noted that the
large size of the banking sector draws
attention, but cause of alarm is mitigated by
specific features of the structure of the sector.
They stressed that the domestic-oriented
banking segment is safe and sound, and the
internationally-oriented segment poses no
material risks for Malta. The authorities agreed
with staff on the need to strengthen the
Deposit Compensation Scheme, and plan to
align their framework with the anticipated EU
rules. In relation to the mission’s concerns
about concentration risk on fixed property, the
MFSA noted that Malta’s small size limits the
ability of the banking sector to diversify.
Regulators take the issue of concentration risk
into account under Pillar 2 of Basel II. The
MFSA noted that staff’s recommendation to
increase provisioning and to address
shortcomings in the regulation relating to
asset classification and provisioning will give
new impetus to the authorities’ initiatives to
improve supervision in this area.

C. A Strong Structural Reform Agenda to Secure Long-Term Growth

higher in Malta than the EU average. Fostering
participation of women in the labor market is
another major challenge, given Malta’s lowest
female employment rate in the EU. And so is
raising the labor force skills: Malta has the
highest rate of early school-leavers and
records a low share of people with a tertiary
level of education. Malta is also dependent on
imported oil for energy, making the economy
vulnerable to oil price shocks. Furthermore,
current electricity production is both cost- and

resolve anticipated long-term fiscal
imbalances. These steps should be supported
by a cautious settlement of wage negotiations
at the firm-level to ensure better alignment of
wage and productivity developments. The
ongoing review of the wage indexation
formula is welcome. Overall nominal wage
increases below those of Malta’s main trading
partners will underpin confidence and secure
recent gains in competitiveness.

29.
These challenges underscore the
need to deepen and broaden the reforms so
far, raise productivity growth, and further
improve competitiveness. Policies should
focus on further diversifying the economy into
high value-added activities, reducing the
economy’s dependence on energy imports,
and strengthening female labor force
participation and education attainment. A

30.
Malta’s National Reform
Programme sets out ambitious targets and
a policy action plan to address longer-term
challenges. The authorities pointed to four
strengths supporting future growth. These
include: the increase in education levels,
female labor force expansion facilitated by
child and tax-friendly policies, oil search and
energy policy reform, and continued wage
moderation. As to the latter, the authorities
agreed with staff’s recommendation of

aligning wage increases with productivity
growth, but underscored that the current wage
indexation mechanism did not generally result
in full inflation-indexation and was granted in
absolute terms and only on a base salary. They
also indicated that sectoral analysis of wage
dynamics showed significant amount of
flexibility.

STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
After a strong recovery in 2010, the
economy has continued to perform well
amidst considerable turbulence across the
euro area. Spillovers from the euro area crisis
have remained contained to date. The growth
momentum continued through 2011 and labor
indicators improved. Despite the recent rating
downgrades, sovereign bond spreads remain
contained as government debt is
predominantly held domestically. In turn, the
sensitivity of the Maltese banking sector to
sovereign risk events in Europe is low given
very low direct exposures to EU periphery
debt, though indirect exposures may be larger.
32.
The fragile external environment has
created new risks to growth and financial
stability. Malta’s high degree of trade
openness and very large financial sector
heighten contagion risks. The fragile global
macroeconomic environment and sustained
market volatility are expected to dampen real
export growth in 2012. Domestic sources of
growth may not be sufficient to offset the drop
in external demand, given headwinds from a
soft real estate market, deteriorating
confidence, and ongoing fiscal consolidation.
At the same time, uncertainty in economic
policy could adversely affect growth if
investment decisions and structural reforms
are put on hold. With the euro area expected
to go into a mild recession in 2012, Malta’s
real GDP growth in 2012 will be relatively
modest. Risks and uncertainty around this
scenario are significant, reflecting the potential
for large negative spillovers from the euro area
crisis.
33.
Contingency planning needs to
move to the forefront of the policy agenda.
Malta’s resilience to date cannot be taken for

granted. The main policy challenge now is to
maintain growth and employment, while
building buffers against a highly uncertain
international environment. At the same time,
the authorities need to balance concerns over
a slowing economy, which calls for
accommodative policies, against increased
risks that require more prudent fiscal
management.
34.
Malta has taken effective action to
correct its excessive deficit, shoring up
confidence in Malta’s public finances. The
structural fiscal adjustment in 2011 was one of
the largest among advanced countries. The
deficit is estimated to have narrowed to
3 percent of GDP and the primary balance
turned into surplus for the first time
since 2007. Following the announcement of
the 2012 budget and additional expenditure
measures in January, the fiscal deficit is
expected to fall further this year. Nonetheless,
the composition of adjustment remains
suboptimal, relying excessively on one-off and
revenue measures.
35.
Returning to fiscal balance over the
medium run remains essential. Further fiscal
consolidation is required to ensure sustainable
debt dynamics, thus reducing fiscal risks to
manageable levels. After the strong effort
in 2011, a gradual deficit reduction path of
structural annual adjustment of ½ percentage

stabilizers operate in full, would be
appropriate. This adjustment path would help
offset the headwinds facing the economy in
the near term, while achieving debt
sustainability over the medium term. The

regulatory and supervisory frameworks with
international standards.

36.
Bold policy actions are necessary to
reduce contingent liabilities and address
Malta’s long-run fiscal challenges. Better
governance and restructuring of the public
corporations will help staunch losses and limit
subsidies. With a large projected increase in
ageing-related expenditures, it is crucial to
build broad public consensus for further
pension and health care reform aimed at
increasing the adequacy and sustainability of
the current schemes.

38.
Financial stability will further benefit
from establishing a formal framework for
macro-prudential policy. Such a framework
should define the tasks, powers, and
instruments of the macro-prudential authority;
establish clear lines of accountability; and
ensure operational independence from
political bodies and from the financial industry.
It is crucial to improve systemic risk
monitoring, particularly of spillover risks posed
by international banks, and design
contingency plans accordingly.

37.
Given the large external risks, it is
important to strengthen the financial
sector’s resilience further. The financial
sector has continued to perform strongly, but
its sheer size and large foreign ownership
represent a number of risks to financial
stability and fiscal sustainability. These include
concerns about too-big-to-save and the
adequacy of backstopping resources in case of
default or deposit run, the capacity to deal
with the impact of a banking shock on the
economy, as well as supervisory challenges.
Improving the framework for financial crisis
management and bank resolution and
strengthening the deposit compensation
scheme could help limit contagion risks.
Ongoing efforts to strengthen financial buffers
and tighten supervision relating to asset
quality are welcome. Commendable progress
has also been made to better align the

39.
Longer-term policy challenges
remain pressing. Challenges related to
population ageing, labor force participation,
education, and energy policy underscore the
need to broaden the reforms so far, raise
productivity growth, and further improve
competitiveness. Reforms to secure these
objectives include further diversifying the
economy into high value-added activities,
reducing the economy’s dependence on
energy imports, and strengthening female
labor force participation and education
attainment. These steps should be supported
by a cautious settlement of wage negotiations

Malta has successfully upgraded its export structure in recent years. It continues to gain
competitiveness among new high-value-added export activities, particularly financial and business
services and remote gaming. Market liberalization, a favorable tax regime, and a highly-skilled work
force have facilitated these shifts. Going forward, Malta will need to continue enhancing its
productivity by focusing on education, research and development as well as aligning wages with labor
productivity in order to preserve its recent gain in competitiveness and sustain growth.
1.
Malta has seen a significant gain in
competitiveness in recent years through a
sectoral shift toward export-oriented
services.1Services exports grew at double-digit
rates during 2004–07. While negatively
affected by the global financial crisis in 2009,
the sector has steadily recovered. Overall,
exports of services have tripled in size over the
last decade and the share of services exports
to total exports reached 60 percent in 2010, up
from 30 percent in 2004. As a consequence,
the current account deficit has shrunk by half
over the past five years. The price and cost
competitiveness indicators have also showed a
correction after the 2008–09 financial crisis.
2.
This note discusses recent
developments in Malta’s competitiveness
based on both price and non-price
measures and policy recommendations. In
particular, to further improve its
competitiveness, it is essential for Malta to
continue to diversify the economy into high
value-added activities, raise productivity
growth through the improvement of labor
force skills, as well as strengthen female labor
force participation. These steps should be
supported by a cautious settlement of wage
negotiations to ensure better alignment of
wage and productivity developments.

Measuring Malta’s Competitiveness
3.
Traditional cost and price
competitiveness measures have improved
recently. A decrease in unit labor costs and
narrowing inflation differentials vis-à-vis
trading partners translated into a real
depreciation of about 4–5 percent on pricebased competitive measures in 2011. Malta’s
wage setting mechanism comprises the costof-living-adjustment (COLA) and other wage
agreements. COLA consists of a base wage,
indexed with the annual average retail price
index (RPI) inflation. Although COLA has been
applied at the national level, firm-level wage
agreements could overwrite the COLA
increase. It is evident that during the past crisis
the Maltese social partners agreed on wage
moderation—a 0.6 percent decline in wages
and salaries in 2010 among the main sectors
including industry, construction, and services,
thus contributing to a correction in Malta’s
competitiveness and maintaining employment
through labor hoarding.

The current account deficit
narrowed significantly over the last two
years, on account of strong export growth.
The current account deficit narrowed to
4¼ percent of GDP in 2010 and to 3 percent of
GDP in 2011 (from 7¾ percent of GDP
in 2009). Exports of merchandised goods
surged to around 35 percent in 2010 and
continued to grow by the same pace in the
first half of 2011. Exports of services, including
business travel, communication and financial
services, increased by 8.5 percent in 2010,
though growth slowed down in the first half
of 2011. Imports rose at a much slower pace,
(19 percent for goods and 5 percent for
services). As a result, the trade balance
registered a surplus of 3.4 percent of GDP, the
largest over the past decade. On the other
hand, the net income account continued to
record a large outflow of 7 percent of GDP,
reflecting the repatriation of benefits by
foreign companies, particularly banks which
showed very positive results.

Estimates of the competitiveness
gap also present significant improvement.
The CGER-type estimates of exchange rate
valuation are broadly in line with

fundamentals.26All three approaches point
toward the same trend. The correction in the
real exchange rate overvaluation was about
4 percent for the macrobalance and external
sustainability approaches, and about
10 percent for the equilibrium real exchange
rate approach. The decline in the real
exchange rate gap is in line with recent
development in wages and price, as well as the
large swing in the current account deficit from
7.8 percent in 2009 to 3 percent in 2011 which
sharply narrows the medium-term current
account projections.

emerged as a new growth engine (Box 1). As
of 2010, the sector reached 50 percent of GDP
and hired about a fifth of the total work force.
Remote gaming, financial services, call centers,

particular, Malta’s banking sector is one of the
largest in the EU in relation to GDP and has

been resilient throughout the crisis. Malta is
also home to a number of hedge funds and
numerous administrations of funds and
insurances. Furthermore, Malta’s tourism share
continues to increase, benefiting last year from
the geopolitical tensions in North Africa.

Box 1. What Makes Malta an Attractive Financial Center?
Malta is an attractive location for financial services.
Economic and legal, regulatory and tax framework are
some of its key advantages.
As part of the euro area, Malta benefits from the EU
passport regime as well as the effective and
sophisticated legislation based on EU directives,
thus facilitating the financial flows across member
countries. Malta has been an EU member since 2004
and adopted the Euro in January 2008. The Euro
adoption eliminated the currency risk among euro area
members, while the adjustment process toward the
Maastricht criteria had contributed to economic
stability. Malta’s financial services legislation is also
business-friendly and industry-oriented. The Banking
Act is modeled on EU directives and complies with the
EU’s stringent quality standards.
Financial sector is regulated efficiently and
responsively. The Malta Financial Services Authority
(MFSA) is the single financial regulator. Its mandate
includes (i) supervising financial services, (ii) monitoring

business practices in the supply of financial products,
and (iii) promoting fair competition and consumer
choice in the sector. Its area of responsibility spans
from banking, insurances, investment services, and
financial markets.
Malta’s EU-approved tax regime is competitive and
efficient. Corporate income tax rate is 35 percent, but
to promote investment activities, Malta has a number
of tax incentives, including a reduced tax on approved
projects (a reduced rate of 15.75 percent), a reduced tax
rate in terms of double tax treaties with all major
economies (a reduced rate of 15 percent), and tax
credits allowing for further tax reduction. In particular,
income and capital gains from participating holdings
are tax exempted.
Other advantages include Malta’s strategic location
and time zone, modern infrastructure, skilled labor
supply, English language, and political stability.

Identifying Structural Bottlenecks
7.
Further improving Malta’s
productivity growth is key to sustaining
recent gains in competitiveness. Strong
growth in financial and business services will
demand more high-skilled labor force. In
particular, empirical evidence shows that
productivity growth within these sectors
significantly contribute to export growth (table
below and see also Monteagudo and
Montaruli (2011)3 ). Higher labor productivity

growth in the services sector could potentially
have a positive long-term effect on exports,
estimated at 0.6 percent in the case of financial
intermediation and 1.3 percent in the case of
business services for each percentage point
increase in the sector’s labor productivity.
Therefore, the efforts to improve the quality of
human capital would be crucial going forward.
These results need to be interpreted with
caution as the estimated based on limited data
may be subject to small sample bias.

Malta’s productivity growth has
lagged behind peers. Labor productivity
growth over the last decade7averaged only
0.2 percent, compared to 0.5 percent for the
euro area and 0.8 percent for the European
Union. Overtime, Malta’s productivity growth
has tended to be volatile, it averaged around
0.5 percent in 2001–08 and declined by
1 percent during the global financial crisis.

Nonetheless, the lack of sectoral productivity
data limits the scope for competitiveness
analysis. For Malta, where the economy is
increasingly diversified, it would be worthwhile
to develop labor productivity indicators across
economic sectors or industries to differentiate
developments. In turn, such analysis will be
necessary to determine wage settlement
policies by underlying wage adjustments
based on sectoral productivity developments.
This will also help cross-country comparisons,
where the country comparators across sectors
may be different.

MALTA 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

9.
Wage growth has exceeded
productivity growth over the last decade,
although recent wage moderation was
encouraging. For Malta, wage growth
(2.8 percent) was about 14 times productivity
growth (0.2 percent) over the past decade. The
wage indexation mechanism by which wages

are indexed to the country’s inflation could
contribute to persistently high wage growth,
despite productivity developments.
Nonetheless, Malta’s wage moderation in light
of the crisis helped narrow the gap between
wage and productivity.

10.
Structural changes in Malta’s
production may lead to a bottleneck in the
supply of highly skilled labor. Strong growth
of new high value-added exports was
fundamentally supported by Malta’s highlyskilled English-speaking workforce. However,
Malta has the highest rate of early schoolleavers among euro area peers, while the share
of college graduates hits the lowest. Malta has

also a long-standing issue of low female
participation in the labor force. The lack of
high-level education could create a shortage in
the highly skilled-labor segment in the labor
market, thus hindering the country’s potential
and competitiveness. In addition, its research
and development spending is the smallest
among the euro area peers.

Preserving Malta’s Competitiveness
11.
Malta, therefore, will need to
continue making progress on structural
reforms along with the EU’s Lisbon agenda
to address its structural weaknesses, boost
productivity growth, and sustain growth.
These include (i) improving the quality of
human capital through education targeted on
labor market needs, and encouraging female
labor participation; (ii) adopting productivityenhancing measures through training and
R&D; and (iii) improving business environment
and efficiency by removing rigidities and
reducing an oversized and inefficient public
sector as well as promoting energy efficiency.
Furthermore, strengthening the AML/CFT
preventive measures in the international
banking sector and in the online gaming
sector will contribute to preserve the
sustainability of Malta’s competitiveness in
these sectors.
12.
Finally, Malta should maintain the
reform momentum to reform the wage-

38

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

setting and indexation to better align wage
and productivity developments. The working
group represented by social partners, the
ministry of finance, and central bank of Malta
has been set up and made progress on
introducing some elements of productivity into
COLA formula. The revised formula, however,
still needs to be agreed among social partners.
Furthermore, the wage-productivity relation
could be enhanced by the more-refined
sectoral analysis. The Maltese authorities
should (i) continue to improve the national
accounts output measures following best
practices, particularly on data classification,
treatment of deflators, as well as services
output and price measures, in which these
changes would improve both the quality of the
national accounts and their international
comparability, (ii) speed up the timeliness of
labor productivity data, and (iii) in the longer
term, account for labor quality, including
educational level, age group and gender by
industry.

ANNEX II. A RULES-BASED FISCAL FRAMEWORK FOR MALTA1
Malta has committed to reform its budgetary framework in line with the recently agreed EU fiscal
compact treaty. Adhering to the new guidelines will strengthen fiscal policy making, by adding
credibility to the government consolidation strategy and enforcing greater discipline and transparency.
Malta-specific simulations suggest that a rules-based framework has the potential to improve fiscal
outcomes and promote debt sustainability.
1.
Malta’s current budgetary
framework needs strengthening.1 A key
weakness of Malta’s framework is the nonbinding nature of the multi-annual targets,
which implies a relatively short fiscal planning
horizon. The multi-annual projections
presented in the annual budget are not
underpinned by an articulated medium-term
strategy, nor by the detailed measures to
achieve them. Other weaknesses relate to the
lack of expenditure ceilings and corrective
measures in the event of deviations from the
target. Malta’s framework is also characterized
by the absence of an independent budgetary
institution to provide independent
macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts and to
assess fiscal sustainability and compliance
with the fiscal mandate. Improving the
monitoring of budget execution remains a key
challenge, as public expenditure is still subject
to discretionary decisions in the
implementation phase.
2.
The government’s commitment to
implementing the EC directives on
budgetary frameworks and the additional
requirements envisaged in the Fiscal
Compact agreed on January is a big step
towards fiscal discipline. Twenty five EU
members, including Malta, committed to
achieving and maintaining structural deficits

below ½ percent of GDP. Balanced-budget
rules will be embedded into national
constitutions or primary law. If the target is
missed, an automatic correction mechanism
will be triggered to bring the deficit back in
track. Governments also committed to
reducing their gross debt-to-GDP ratios at a
pace equal to 1/20th of the distance between
the current level and the 60 percent target. In
addition to numerical targets, the
implementation of the rule will also involve
the monitoring of compliance by independent
institutions.
3.
The establishment of a permanent
rules-based framework and strengthened
fiscal governance could yield a number of
benefits. The requirements outlined in the
new treaty would provide a durable constraint
on fiscal discretion ensuring sustainable debt
dynamics The rising use of some form of fiscal
rule over the last two decades reflects the
view that well-designed and properly
implemented fiscal rules could support
credibility and discipline and help limit
distorted incentives in policymaking (Box 1).
After an appropriate transition period, once
the public finances are closer to balance, the
EU-mandated structural balanced budget rule
could secure the gains of the consolidation
process, support fiscal discipline, and anchor
long-term expectations about fiscal
sustainability.

In order to illustrate how a rulesbased fiscal framework can improve
budgetary outcomes, this annex simulates
the hypothetical path of key fiscal
variables predicted by various fiscal rules
had they been in place in Malta since 2000.
The rules-based simulated outcomes are then
compared to the actual fiscal outturns over
the same period. For simulation purposes, the
deficit target is set to -3 percent of GDP, in
order to assess what the fiscal outcome would
be had Malta targeted the Stability and
Growth Pact threshold since 2000.Three fiscal
rules are analyzed. A formal representation of
these rules and the choice of parameter
values are discussed in Box 2.


40

Structural Balance Rule: This rule allows
for temporary deviations in the overall
fiscal balance from its medium-term
structural deficit target according to
cyclical developments. It allows for the full
operation of automatic stabilizers leading
to higher deficits when the output gap is
negative and lower deficits when the
output gap is positive. While this can be
considered as being very similar to the
structural deficit target in the EU treaty, it
does not explicitly take into account how
the deficit would adjust in case of a
deviation from the target.
Augmented growth based (AGB) rule
also allows for temporary deviation for the
medium term target when the current
period economic growth deviates from its
long term trend. Hence, it has the
countercyclical nature of the structural
balance rule but without requiring explicit
estimates of the output gap. In addition,
this rule also allows for a gradual
adjustment back to the medium term

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

target when past shocks cause the
balance to deviate from its target. Hence,
differently from the structural balance
rule, the AGB rule avoids unrealistically
high adjustments in a single year by
allowing more time for the balance to
converge back to the target. In this
respect, the AGB rule not only takes into
consideration cyclical concerns like the
structural balance rule does but also
incorporates an automatic correction
mechanism making it more likely to
encompass the proposed fiscal rule in the
EU treaty.


Expenditure Rule. This rule sets a ceiling
for the annual growth rate of real
expenditure. Revenues are not
constrained by the rule. Real government
expenditures can be set to equal the long
term growth of real GDP. Cross country
experience shows that this rule is usually
associated with additional requirements
such as debt brakes or deficit ceilings.

5.
The three fiscal rules under
consideration would have delivered better
fiscal outcomes than the actual policy
stance during the period 2000–07. In
particular, the rules would have been more
effective in:


Containing the fiscal deficit. The actual
deficit during this period was 5.2 percent
of GDP on average, while the deficit
predicted by the structural balance and
AGB rules would have been around
3 percent of GDP. Fiscal policy was quite
expansionary and procyclical during this
period, especially before Malta joined the
EU (2000-04). An expenditure rule would
have performed worse than the balance
rules, though still achieving a better

MALTA 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 1. Country Examples of Fiscal Rules
Multi-year Expenditure Rules in Finland,
Netherlands and Sweden (Ljungman 2008)
All three countries have had positive experiences
with expenditure ceilings, contributing to
maintaining robust public finances. They all include a
medium term framework, which in the case of
Finland and Netherlands is 4 years (the amount of
time that a government is in power), whereas for
Sweden it includes a 3 year rolling ceiling. Ceilings
are defined in real terms in the case of Netherlands
and Finland, which are then adjusted for inflation
and converted into nominal ceilings. In Sweden on
the other hand, the ceiling is directly defined in
nominal terms. The coverage of expenditure items
differs across countries. While in all cases countries
have opted to exclude interest payments on the
grounds that it is a very volatile and procyclical item,
their stance differs regarding the coverage of
cyclically sensitive items such as unemployment
benefits. Netherlands and Sweden expenditure
ceilings are comprehensive, by covering almost all of
central government spending. Finland, on the other
hand, excludes cyclically sensitive items from
expenditure ceilings in order to allow for the full
operation of automatic expenditure stabilizers.
During an economic downturn,, the cyclical
component of expenditures would be allowed to
increase without requiring a compensating cut in
other expenditure items. While in all three cases
expenditure rules are not regulated in legislation and
there are no predetermined sanctions in case of
deviations, political commitment and compliance
has been high. It is also important to note that in all
three cases such fiscal rule has been implemented in
the aftermath of a serious fiscal crisis. However such
rules were introduced after the consolidation had
been achieved.

Structural balance rule in Germany
In June 2009, the German parliament amended the
constitution to include a new rule for both federal
and state governments. The rule requires the federal
government’s structural deficit not to exceed
0.35 percent of GDP. The rule becomes binding
in 2016, with a transition period starting in 2011. The
states will be bound by a balanced structural budget
from 2020. Execution errors are cumulated in a
notional account that has to be corrected once
errors accumulate above 1 percent of GDP. However,
the adjustment only needs to start after an economic
recovery is in place to avoid a procyclical tightening.
The provisions allow for an escape clause that can be
invoked by parliamentary majority in the event of
natural catastrophes and other emergencies outside
government control.
Augmented growth-based balance rule in Turkey
Turkey has recently considered adopting a fiscal rule
that promotes countercyclical policy while
circumventing the need to estimate the output gap.
The draft law submitted to Parliament specifies a
general government deficit target of 1 percent of
GDP. In any given year, the actual deficit may deviate
from the target to account for cyclical developments.
In this case, the deficit may react to changes in the
growth rate (relative to the long-run trend of
5 percent), rather than changes in the output gap. In
addition, the rule allows gradual adjustment when
the deficit is away from its medium-term target. As a
result, the amount of required adjustment in any
given year would almost always be feasible, making
the rule more politically durable. For details see
Fletcher and Benelli (2010).

that actual real expenditure grew in line

revenues, which are unconstrained by an
expenditure rule, rather than spending
overruns. This result underscored the need
to place constraints in the overall fiscal
balance, and not solely on expenditures.

Reducing debt. Debt under the three rules
would have been lower. Actual debt
during 2000–07 stood at an average of
62 percent of GDP, whereas the fiscal rules
would have predicted a lower debt of
around 50 percent of GDP for the
structural and AGB rules and 58 percent
for the expenditure rule.

6.
As the economy was overheating in
the run-up to the crisis, the deterioration of
the fiscal balance would have been
contained under each of the fiscal rules.
In 2008 the overall balance deteriorated by
2 percentage points to 4.6 percent of GPD
from an average of 2.5 percent of GDP in the
two previous years. Fiscal policy at this time
was looser than warranted by cyclical
considerations, as the structural balance and
AGB rules would have both predicted a deficit
of around 1 percent of GDP. This year was also
associated with very high expenditure growth,
which surpassed GDP growth by a large
margin.

The increase in debt as a result of
the recession and public sector
restructuring as well as the expected
increase in ageing-related costs call more a
more stringent balance target in the period
ahead. In line with the new EU treaty, after an
appropriate transition period, Malta is
expected to implement a fiscal rule that would
target a structural deficit below 0.5 percent of
GDP. During the transition period, Malta
should move towards a multi-year budgetary
framework and deliver an annual structural
adjustment of at least ½ percentage points of
GDP. Under staff’s policy scenario, Malta’s
deficit would have narrowed to 0.7 percent of
GDP and its debt ratio to 65 percent of GDP
by 2016. Targeting a structural deficit of
-0.5 percent of GDP from then onwards would
be consistent with reaching the 60 percent of
GDP debt target after 2 years (by 2018).
Accordingly, debt would fall below 50 percent
of GDP after 10 years (assuming a long-run

growth rate of nominal GDP of 4 percent). This
suggests that meeting the debt requirement in
the fiscal compact would not impose an
excessive adjustment in Malta.

ANNEX III. MALTESE BANKS’ PROFITABILITY OUTLOOK1
A. Introduction
1.
Bank profitability analysis is
important for a proper assessment of
financial stability. 1The ongoing financial
crisis has reinforced the importance of
scenario analysis and stress testing of bank
balance sheets and income in order to assess
their resilience to shocks. In Europe, the
European Banking Authority (EBA) has
undertaken bank-level stress tests since 2009
for a sample of large EU banks, including one
domestic Maltese bank which passed the tests
successfully. However, EBA stress tests do not
project bank profitability in full, leaving certain
items unchanged from a base year (notably,
fee and commission income, trading income,
operating expenses). Separately, the Central
Bank of Malta undertakes univariate stress
tests in its Financial Stability Report, related to
asset quality deterioration, an economic
slowdown, house price correction and deposit
withdrawals.
2.
This annex presents two alternative
methods to gauge Maltese banks’
profitability. The first uses a dynamic panel
regression approach while the second is a
downside risk simulation based on
assumptions about loss rates and adverse
income shocks. These two approaches provide
complementary information on the
profitability outlook and risks facing Maltese
banks.

B. Panel Regression Approach
3.
The quantitative approach relies on
bank-panel regressions for major income

components. A general-to-specific panel
regression specification search was conducted
for the main income items, except trading
income. Data extend from 1997 (or earliest
available) until 2010 or 2011 and are taken
from Bankscope (bank level data) and IMF
(macroeconomic and financial data series). All
data are annual and expressed as a percentage
of banks’ total assets to address scaling issues
(heteroskedasticity). A panel approach was
adopted in order to exploit common trends
across banks and save on degrees of freedom
in the estimation. Extraordinary income was
omitted from the analysis because this is
difficult, if not impossible, to predict as it
reflects one-off events affecting individual
banks.
4.
Two slightly different versions are
presented. One version has separate
equations for net interest income, fees and
commissions and trading income, while the
second version combines the latter two as
non-interest income. In addition, there are
equations for loan loss provisions and
operating and administrative expenses. In the
first version, trading income was modeled in a
non-parametric way by aligning it with GDP
growth using historical data for the past 15
years. This reflects the fact that unfavorable
trading results coincide mostly with
macroeconomic shocks.2
5.

subcomponents are a function of a few
2

To reduce discontinuity of matched series, a highdimensional parametric fit function was used for each
bank to align real GDP growth with trading income.
This approach is described in IMF Country Report No.

macro-financial factors, and in line with
expectations. Besides a lagged dependent
variable, the specification search shows that
net interest income varies positively with GDP
growth and a steepening of the interest
margin, viz. the difference between lending
and deposit rates (see Table 1). Fee and
commission income tends to fall when shortterm rates increase and also correlates
inversely with the size of banks. In the second
version, fees and commission income and

trading income are combined as (net) noninterest income, which appears to be well
explained by the interest rate-growth
differential (relevant in growth accounting and
public debt sustainability) and marginally, also
stock prices have a positive impact. Loss
provisions decrease as GDP growth rises and
increases as stock market volatility and lending
rates are higher. Operating expenses are a
function of inflation and changes in the output
gap.

Maltese bank profitability appears
robust on average, although profitability
in 2011 was likely lower. Based on the above
panel regression results, individual bank profits
can be projected using an expected path for
the macro-financial factors. For the latter,
developments are assumed to be in line with
the Fund staff baseline macro forecast for
Malta, while some auxiliary regressions provide
the likely paths for series which are not part of
staff’s projections. In the absence of end-2011
profitability estimates, the regression results
suggest that average bank profitability likely
fell from 0.99 percent in 2010 to 0.85 percent

46

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

in 2011 in one model, or from 1.19 to 1.15 in
the other model (see left figure in panel
below). This decline is confirmed by anecdotal
evidence from one bank which reported fullyear figures for 2011 already.31In the next three
years, profitability is projected to improve
before reversing a bit in the long term. A
breakdown by major income categories shows

Note that these figures are different from the ones

that this is broadly attributable to roughly
stable net interest income, declining operating
costs and loss provisions, although the latter
rise again from 2015 onwards as lending rates
increase. Moreover, in the first model, fee
income exhibits a trend decline while trading
income rebounds from 2012 onward. However,
these very long-term projections reservations
as conjunctural developments may well
overtake these forecasts. Furthermore, large
banks appear to be more profitable than small
and medium-sized banks, since the median
bank profitability is smaller than the weighted
average. In terms of the level, profitability is
quite different under the various, although the

trend is in the same direction. Finally, looking
at the distribution across banks, there seem to
be quite large differences in profit levels, which
persist over time. Moreover, in the first model,
fee income exhibits a trend decline while
trading income rebounds from 2012 onward—
owing to the profile of interest rates and GDP
growth. In the second model, aggregate noninterest income is more stable, as the real
interest differential as projected to increase
from close to zero in 2011 to over 1 percent

easily be implemented at the individual bank
level too.

7.
An alternative accounting-based
simulation shows that bank profits and
capital buffers are very resilient to bank
revenue and asset impairment shocks. A
simple sensitivity analysis, reducing operating
income and increasing their loss impairments
to various degrees, illustrates the effect of
adverse shocks on domestic Maltese banks’
profits and capital buffers. Put another way, it
shows the amount of stress Maltese banks can
cope with before they start experiencing losses
or capital adequacy is adversely affected, given
a specific starting position. Such exercise
reflects a stressed environment in which
interest margins, trading and commission and
fee income come under pressure, coupled with
a further deterioration in the credit cycle as the
result of a potentially worsening growth
outlook. The simulation is performed at an
aggregate level for domestic banks using end2010 balance sheet and income data, but can

8.
The results suggest that domestic
banks can cope with quite a substantial
degree of stress, thanks to a robust starting
position end-2010 (see first text figure
below). Only in extreme scenarios—with
income falling by more than 40 percent and/or
impairment losses more than doubling—would
the banking sector experience substantial
losses. However, even in these extreme cases,
most of the adverse shocks would be buffered
by strong levels of capital: in the most extreme
simulation, the aggregate core capital ratio
would still be around 14 percent, down from
15.3 at end-2010 (not shown). Nevertheless, it
may be prudent for domestic banks to
maintain a conservative dividend policy. To
illustrate, if Maltese banks were to double their
profit retention rate from 35 to 70 percent,
core capital could be boosted by up to
70 basis points, and more strongly so as their
performance improves (see second text figure
below).

Maltese (domestic) bank profits are quite resilient to operating
income and asset impairment shocks.

The analysis indicated that the

sound in the short to medium term. The
analysis indicated that the Maltese banking
sector’s profitability is sound in the short to
medium term. However, there appear to be
some weaker spots, which underline the need
for adequate (intensified) supervision of the
weaker banks along various policy dimensions.
For the weakest, higher dividend retention
policies may be appropriate, as the Central
Bank of Malta already recommended. For

others, a targeted risk reduction may be
opportune to rebalance loan portfolios, so as
to reduce somewhat large and concentrated
exposures, in order to improve their asset
quality and enhance profitability. Also, while
the current analysis focused on Maltese banks
in isolation, the broader euro area debt crisis
context could impact Maltese banks in a short
time span, e.g., through rising funding costs,
increased uncertainty, higher chances of a
recession, among others.

ANNEX IV. MALTA: FINANCIAL STABILITY POLICY FRAMEWORK1
To date, the Maltese financial system has maintained financial stability, notwithstanding the stresses
and strains in the global financial system, lately stoked by the European sovereign debt and banking
crisis. Against this backdrop, as well as significant risks going forward, this note examines the key
elements of Malta’s financial stability policy framework, with the focus on the banking sector, given its
dominance of the financial system. The note concludes that the regulatory framework relating to
macro-prudential surveillance, micro-prudential supervision, bank resolution, and the deposit
compensation scheme should be strengthened, financial buffers be bolstered, and surveillance and
supervision tightened.

A. Context1
1.
Malta has a bank-dominated
financial sector, with the capital markets
playing a limited role. Accordingly, banks are
the key sources of finance for the real sector.
As at the end of 2010, banking sector assets
constituted 84 percent of the total assets of
the financial system, whereas insurance and
investment fund sector assets, respectively,
constituted 11 percent and 5 percent.
2.
The Maltese financial stability policy
framework was not subjected to materially
stressful conditions over the recent past.
During the period 2007 to date, Malta
managed to avoid and prevent any material
financial stability dislocations, notwithstanding
the turbulence globally and regionally. It is
important to realize from the outset that the
current arrangements have not been tested by
a systemic crisis or the failure of systemically
important financial institutions in recent years.
3.
As the financial sector is a common
good, it is incumbent upon the authorities
to ensure its effective functioning. A
financial sector is indispensible to an efficient
modern economy, and financial deepening
increases its potential to benefit an economy.

Prepared by Carel Oosthuizen (MCM).

50

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

However, the financial sector is fragile, in view
of its dependence on client confidence, and
exposure to systemic risk. Safeguarding its
stability is thus a major policy objective.
4.
Maintaining financial sector stability
requires a multi-faceted approach. One
facet encompasses the arrangements for
monitoring and managing systemic risk
through macro-prudential policies; a second is
the quality of micro-prudential regulation and
supervision; and a third is the safety net that
enables the authorities to manage crises when
they occur, including emergency liquidity
assistance, bank resolution, and deposit
insurance. The latter also includes contingency
planning for crises. This note addresses each of
these aspects of the financial stability
framework of Malta.

B. Systemic Risk Monitoring
Arrangements and Macro-Prudential
Policy
5.
The Ministry of Finance, the Central
Bank of Malta (CBM) and the Malta
Financial Services Authority (MFSA) jointly
set up structures to discuss issues of a
technical nature relating to financial
stability and crisis management. The main
structures in place are as follows: The
Domestic Standing Group (DSG), the Working
Group on Crisis Management (WGCM) and the

MALTA 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Joint Task Force on Bank Resolution (JTFBR) the latter two being substructures to the
former. The WGCM developed a policy
document titled “A Framework on the
Management of Domestic Financial Crises.”
The JTFBR developed a policy document titled
“A Report on the Review of the Domestic Bank
Resolution and Insolvency Regime.”
6.
The authorities are considering
vesting the DSG with decision-making
powers, to recommend and enforce macroprudential policies. It will be important to
determine the committee’s related mandate,
scope, power, instruments and governance.
This forum would also be responsible for the
overall contingency planning and crisis
management, including coordination of and
information exchange among the financial
sector safety net participants, as well as for
public communication.
7.
The central mandate for the overall
financial sector stability is vested in the
Central Bank of Malta (CBM). The CBM’s
highest internal forum dealing with financial
stability is the Financial Stability Committee.
The Financial Stability Committee (FSC) was
created as a co-ordination forum, with the task
of formulating the CBM’s assessment of the
stability of the financial system, and, as a
consultative forum, with the task of discussing
various issues related to the stability of the
financial system. The CBM’s Financial Stability
Department (FSD) provides secretarial support
to the FSC. The FSC convenes a minimum of
four times a year, and as circumstances may
necessitate. On a half yearly basis, the CBM
convenes a Forum for Financial Stability, for
local banks’ risk officers, wherein systemic risk
issues are discussed.

8.
The CBM has been proactive in
developing its capacities and capabilities in
the area of financial stability. The CBM
established a Financial Stability Department
(FSD), consisting of two legs, namely firstly a
division titled Financial Stability, Surveillance,
Assessment and Data, and secondly a division
titled Policy, Crisis Management and Stress
Testing. Since 2008, the Financial Stability
Department has produced three annual and
three interim Financial Stability Reports. A
summarized version of the Financial Stability
Report is published, whereas a detailed version
of the Financial Stability Report is shared with
the MFSA.
9.
The CBM relies on a structured
framework in order to detect potential
triggers of financial instability and early
signs of systemic distress, which consists,
inter alia, of the following components:
Analysis of various quantitative indicators such
as compliance with regulatory quantitative
requirements for capital and liquidity, financial
soundness indicators, balance sheet and profit
and loss developments, and credit risk
exposures; meetings with the MFSA and with
various banks and other stakeholders;
monitoring of news media; and financial
markets statistics.
10.
The FSD furthermore performs
various tasks in order to obtain relevant
information. The FSD identifies and obtains
information which will enable it to identify and
address systemic imbalances and systemic
risks, threats and vulnerabilities. FSD analysts
regularly carry out surveillance work, in order
to detect signs of stress. Also, the FSD
performs stress testing in order to test for
credit risk/asset quality, interest rate risk, a
bank run, a house price shock and an
economic downturn, whereupon the results

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

51

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

MALTA

are published in the Financial Stability Review.
In addition, the CBM performs ad hoc scenario
testing in response to current events, such as a
price shock to sovereign exposures. Recently,
the Maltese authorities extended the EU-wide
European Banking Authority’s stress testing
exercise of a limited number of banks, being
the systemically important banks, to all
domestic-oriented banks.
11.
The CBM takes the lead in
conducting crisis simulation exercises
designed to assess, evaluate and enhance
crisis management preparedness. Such
exercises are carried out every two to three
years. Typically, scenarios are identified and
then developed by the Working Group on
Crisis Management, which is comprised of
representative from the CBM, the MFSA and
the Ministry of Finance. These exercises have
focused on testing most of the arrangements
established in the Framework on the
Management of Domestic Financial Crises,
including the testing of (i) crisis management
practices, (ii) the use and exchange of
information, (iii) communication and decisionmaking, and (iv) the Systemic Impact
Assessment Framework (as proposed in
the 2008 MoU on cross-border financial
stability.) Following a simulation exercise, a
debriefing report is compiled, highlighting the
achievements and short-comings, and
containing recommendations for further
enhancement of crisis management
arrangements and practices. The CBM also
provides assistance to domestic banks in the
development of their own simulation exercises.
The CBM also participated in two crisis
communication simulation desktop exercises.
12.
Further strengthening the analysis
of risks posed by the financial sector,
including by the so-called international

52

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

banks and insurers, is key to identifying and
addressing systemic imbalances before they
materialize.

C. Micro-Prudential Regulation and
Supervision
13.
In pursuit of discharging its microprudential mandate, the MFSA applies a
multi-faceted approach. The MFSA performs
analyses of information submitted by the
banks and generates CAMEL ratings and a
“traffic light” classification of banks. Though
the MFSA itself does not explicitly undertake
stress testing, scenario analyses or crisis
simulation exercises, it has been involved, from
time-to-time, in a number of initiatives which
involve some of these techniques, inter alia, in
conjunction with the CBM.
14.
The MFSA holds the view that all
relevant information can and will be
exchanged with the CBM and any relevant
overseas supervisory authority should a
bank become a problem bank. The MFSA Act
contains extensive and comprehensive
prescriptions pertaining to information
exchange.2 Also, MoUs with local and
international counterparts enable information
exchange. The governor is a member of the
MFSA board.
15.
The authorities are responsive to
international developments. In response to
the EU’s Larosiere report, the MFSA
restructured itself by setting up separate
supervision units for banking, insurance and
financial markets; by also creating a cross2

MFSA Act: article 18; Banking Act: articles 4, 19, 25,
35B, 28, 29 and 34; and CBM Act: articles 36–39. See
also the framework of cooperation with other
domestic policy makers, as well as non-domestic
parties, set out in a preceding paragraph.

MALTA 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

sectoral authorization unit and regulatory
development unit. On a two to three year
cycle, the MFSA undertakes an assessment of
itself against international standards and
developments. Recently, the MFSA
commissioned an independent assessment by
the governance of its supervision.
16.
The asset classification, impairment
and provisioning framework needs to be
tightened. The framework for asset
classification and provisioning is not fully in
line with sound practice. In addition, to date,
the authorities have not undertaken backtesting on the asset classification and
provisioning framework. It is recommended to
update this framework and gather relevant
information to build the necessary time series,
which will enable back-testing.
17.
The MFSA is commended for its selfimposed quality controls of commissioning
regular independent assessments against
international standards. In 2010, the MFSA
commissioned an independent assessment of
regulation and supervision of banking,
insurance and securities markets against the
respective international standards. The
assessment concluded that progress had been
made since the 2003 IMF Financial Stability
Assessment Program (FSAP), but weaknesses
remained in supervisory capacity (notably
staffing), definition and monitoring of
connected party transactions, and internal
audit functions (Box 1).
18.
The MFSA has been quick to
respond to recommendations of the
abovementioned recent independent
assessment of the quality of supervision in
banking, insurance and securities. The
substantial increase in staff, the creation of an
enforcement unit, and work in the area of

concentration risk represent commendable
progress. Continuing efforts along the lines of
the report’s recommendations are needed
more fully to comply with international sound
practice.
19.
The MFSA exercises its powers of
enforcement and sanction, and monitors
corrective action plans. The MFSA’s
Supervisory Council takes formal decisions on
sanctions, which decisions are published on
the MFSA’s website. The enforcement unit is
responsible for giving effect to such sanctions.
For example, in the recent past, a bank’s
license was revoked and a substantial fine was
imposed on the largest domestic-oriented
bank. It might be advisable for the MFSA to
have a “catch all” power, enabling such MFSA
actions to prevent a bank from doing or
neglecting anything which may result in the
bank becoming or continuing to be unsafe or
unsound. The authorities are commended for
the decisive steps taken to develop a formal
and effective approach to enforcement, thus
counteracting the potential for regulatory
capture. Through sound judgment and
experience, it should be possible to build an
enviable track record.
20.
Contingency planning for crisis
preparedness should place particular focus
on systemically important banks and
develop plans to attend to the issue of toobig-to-fail/save banks. The adequacy of
financial buffers should be assessed through
regular stress testing. The development of
scenarios for material risks would enable the
undertaking of meaningful crisis simulation
exercises on a regular basis, involving relevant
stakeholders and covering systemically
relevant institutions, as well as cross-border
dimensions. Arrangements for coordination
and information exchange between the key

MALTA

Box 1. Independent Assessment of Financial Sector Standards (BCPs; IOSCO; IAIS)
Background
The Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA), a
single regulator for financial services, was
established in 2002. Soon thereafter, Malta
requested the IMF/World Bank to conduct a FSAP,
which was finalized early in 2003. Malta acceded to
the European Union in 2004.
Thereupon, the Board of Governors of the MFSA(the
Board), in pursuit of high standards in regulation and
supervision, requested that an internal audit of the
MFSA regulatory activities be carried out every two
to three years following a IMF/World Bank
assessment. Internal audits were carried out in 2005
and 2007. In the light of the global financial crisis,
the Board, noting that increased transparency was
being demanded by the markets, decided that
the 2010 internal audit should take the form of an
independent assessment and should be carried out
using the same format as the FSAP and this
assessment and future assessments should be made
public.
During 2010, a team of independent experts
performed the following updates of the 2003 FSAP
ROSC assessments: a BCP assessment, an IOSCO
assessment and an IAIS assessment, all based on
MFSA self-assessments. A report on the authorities’
progress in relation to the recommendations which
arose from the 2010 assessment was produced in
December 2011 (2011 IA PR).
BCP assessment
The 2010 independent assessment (2010 IA)
concluded that the MFSA was “Compliant” with
twenty BCPs and “Largely compliant” with 5 BCPs.
Accordingly, in no instances was the MFSA found to
be “Materially non-compliant” or “Non-compliant”
with any of the principles. (The 2003 FSAP had
concluded that the MFSA was “Compliant” with ten
BCPs, “Largely compliant” with thirteen BCPs and
“Materially non-compliant” with one BCP and one
BCP was considered to be not applicable.)
The 2010 IA noted that it had “found a significant
improvement in the overall compliance to the BCPs.
The main recommendations relate to addressing
staffing constraints, improving the regime relating to

54

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

fines, requiring that connected party prescriptions be
tightened, improving the nature and extent of
contact with bank boards and managements and
formalizing corrective and enforcement policy.
IOSCO assessment
The 2010 IA concluded that the MFSA had
“Implemented” twenty four principles, had “Broadly
implemented” four principles, that no principles
were “Partially implemented” and none “Nonimplemented”, and that two principles were “Not
applicable”. (The 2003 FSAP had concluded that the
MFSA had “Implemented” 22 principles, had
“Partially implemented” 6 principles, that no
principles were “Broadly implemented” or “Nonimplemented” and that two principles were “Not
applicable”.)
The main recommendations relate to addressing
staffing constraints, ensuring the effective on-going
review of capital adequacy and formalizing an early
warning system.
The key recommendations were that prescriptions
for the internal audit function needs to be
strengthened and that the planning, staff resources,
time set aside for and follow up regarding on-site
inspections should be strengthened.
IAIS assessment
The 2010 IA concluded that the MFSA had
“Observed” twenty two principles, had “Largely
observed” four principles, had “Partly observed”
2 principles and had “Non-observed” no principles,
nor was any principle found to be “Not applicable”.
The 2003 FSAP had concluded that MFSA had
“Observed” twelve principles, had “Broadly
observed” three principles, had “Materially nonobserved” two principles, and had “Non-observed”
no principles, nor was any principle found to be “Not
applicable”.
The key recommendations were that prescriptions
for the internal audit function needs to be
strengthened and that the planning, staff resources,
time set aside for and follow up regarding on-site

institutions, as well as public communication
should be tested and updated from time to
time. It would be advisable for the MFSA to
incorporate these techniques as standing
components of its supervisory approach, and
to create, develop and maintain the capacity
and capabilities to apply these techniques as
appropriate.
21.
Though the MFSA has the mandate
for consumer protection and business
conduct, it has not as yet developed or
implemented the relevant regulations.
Consumer protection and business conduct
needs to be integrated into the overall
financial sector regulatory and supervisory
framework, whilst ensuring achieving a careful
balance with safety and soundness concerns. A
review of the MFSA’s consumer protection and
business conduct functions could be
considered to secure consumer protection,
promote efficiency, and enhance the integrity
of the financial system. The mission
recommends prompt execution on the
relevant mandate.

interfering with the implementation of the
single EU monetary policy, the CBM is required
in advance to inform the ECB if the ELA will
exceed €500 million.
Resolution Regime for Banks
23.
Although the MFSA has most of the
necessary resolution powers there appears
to be gaps or grey areas in the resolution
regime. These include:


Ideally, a non-judicial special resolution
regime (SRR) should apply to banks. In
the light, of the unique and complex
nature of banking, the imperative to avoid
systemic risk, the indispensible role which
confidence plays in banking, and the
consequent need for prompt, speedy,
definitive and final resolution, it has
become generally accepted that a
jurisdiction is typically best served by a
non-judicial SRR for banks. However, it
should be recognized that the best SRR
remains merely a tool which requires a
positive enabling environment, sound
governance and well-versed and
experienced actors to optimize the
outcome. The courts should not have the
power to stay a decision of the authorities
to intervene a bank and no appeal should
be available to an aggrieved party where a
bank is intervened by the authorities, other
than in respect of the question whether
due process was followed or on points of
law—consequently, aggrieved parties
should not have the right to claim
restitution of rights violated or removed,
but only monetary compensation.



It may be necessary to consider
expanding the MFSA’s resolution
powers. It would be useful for the MFSA
also to have the power to apply prompt

D. Financial Sector Safety Net
Emergency Liquidity Arrangements (ELA)
22.
The provision of ELA is not a EuroSystem/ECB activity and, accordingly, is
subject to the prohibition against monetary
financing. The CBM stands ready to provide
modest (in relation to the requesting bank’s
balance sheet) amounts of short-term liquidity
to any illiquid, yet solvent, institution, against
adequate collateral discounted sufficiently for
the risk exposure undertaken by the CBM. If
considered necessary by the CBM, it may
require a state guarantee prior to engaging in
ELA, to avoid putting its capital at risk. Though
the CBM has the capacity to accommodate all
requests for ELA, subject to such ELA not

corrective action (PCA), facilitate purchaseand-assumption transactions and the
creation of bridge banks, which are
generally created for systemic banks in
order to buy time for a more effective
resolution. The legislative framework
should include explicit support for early
intervention by the supervisor, in the event
of prudential problems. The MFSA is in the
process of finalizing a policy document on
a PCA framework which explicitly
acknowledges that bank failure is a
possibility and incorporates an exit
strategy for an insolvent bank or a failing
bank which is not longer viable and cannot
be rehabilitated. These principles
constitute important elements for the
development of a decision-tree on how to
deal with a problem bank problem
situation.


Seemingly, deposits currently rank
equally with general creditors in the
event of liquidation. Consideration
should be given to providing insured
deposits with a preference over general
creditors’ interests. In addition to
improving the protection afforded insured
depositors’ interests, insured deposit
preference ensures that the “no creditor
worse off” principle does not undermine
insured depositors’ interests, as creditors
would not have grounds to object to
“good” assets becoming the subject of a
purchase and assumption transaction on
the basis that it would result in them being
worse off than in a liquidation.



Living wills and resolution and recovery
plans. The Maltese authorities should
engage with the systemically important
banks with a view to the banks developing
living wills along with resolution and

56

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

recovery plans, to ensure the maintenance
of financial stability irrespective of the
ultimate fate of a particular bank.
24.
The EC intends to publish
imminently a directive on establishing a
framework for the recovery and resolution
of credit institutions and investment firms.
Accordingly, it would be advisable for the
Maltese authorities to await this publication
prior to undertaking any of the suggested
amendments.
25.
The MFSA should ensure that its
personnel are properly prepared and ready
to deal with a problem situation. To this
end, training should be developed and
presented on applying the resolution
framework.
Deposit Protection Arrangements
26.
The target and actual size of the
Deposit Compensation Scheme (DCS) fund
is unsatisfactory. The target size of the DCS is
0.77 percent of eligible deposits, constituted of
an initial contribution of 0.1 percent, to be
paid over to the DCS, and a reserve of
0.67 percent, to be held and maintained by the
credit institution (and pledged to the DCS)
until called for by the DCS. Accordingly, the
DCS is a hybrid scheme, being composed
partly of ex ante elements and partly an ex
post elements. We strongly caution against a
scheme composed wholly or partly of ex post
elements, in view of the pro-cyclical
implications thereof—the remaining banks are
forced to contribute to pay depositors of a
failed bank during what is probably a time of
financial distress for them as well. In terms of
the official published policy, the primary
backstop for the DCS is the private sector. The
CBM noted in its latest Financial Stability
Report that the failure of a large financial

MALTA 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

institution or a few modest-sized institutions
would tax the DCS’s ability to meet its financial
obligations. Legislation should enable the DCS
funds to be used for the purpose of a purchase
and assumption transaction, but nor for open
bank assistance. It is recommended that the
authorities give due recognition to the small
economy with a large financial sector and

idiosyncratic features, and the consequent
potentially high risks to financial stability, and
err on the conservative side by imposing
buffers above the EU proposed minima. As a
precautionary measure for emergency
purposes, the authorities should put in place
backstopping financing arrangements and
facilities in relation to the DCS’ fund.

ANNEX II. MALTA—STATISTICAL INFORMATION
(As of February 1, 2012)
Data provision is adequate for surveillance
purposes. Significant progress in improving
macroeconomic statistics has been made in
close cooperation with the European Central
Bank (ECB) and Eurostat while upgrading
statistical systems to meet the euro area
standards1. Most macroeconomic statistics can
now be accessed through Eurostat. The
country has been a participant in the GDDS
since September 11, 2000, with the metadata
posted on the IMF’s Dissemination Standards
Bulletin Board.
Real sector statistics: Data on retail and
consumer prices, labor market indicators, and
tourism arrivals are released monthly, usually
with a short lag. These data are available
through Eurostat and via the Internet at the
Central Bank of Malta (CBM) and the National
Statistical Office (NSO) websites. Presently the
NSO releases national accounts data in euros
with one quarter lag. However, national
accounts data have remained subject to
substantial revisions, often affecting several
years. The reasons for revisions generally
include (i) large statistical discrepancies
(captured under stock building), particularly on
the first release, (ii) changes in data
classification for large shipments of oil exports
and imports, and (iii) revisions of deflators.
Furthermore, supply-side GDP estimates by
type of economic activity are only available at
1

The 2007/08 Eurostat peer review on the
implementation of the European Statistics Code of
Practice found that the NSO had reached a remarkable
compliance with large parts of the Code despite its
small size, but underscored the need to improve
adequacy of resources and data quality management.

current prices. The producer price index for
manufacturing has been published, but that
for services sector is still under discussion.
National accounts imports and exports data
are not disaggregated into goods and services.
The harmonized index of consumer prices was
first published in May 2004. It is recommended
that the Maltese authorities start to compile
the financial balance sheets and transactions
by sectors, household debt, and saving rate.
Government finance statistics: Fiscal
statistics meet basic requirements, with
quarterly accrual-based data on general
government operations compiled in
accordance with the ESA95 methodology and
disseminated with a one-quarter lag. The
general government comprises data from the
consolidated fund of government adjusted to
include other accounts of government, the
accruals elements, and the financial
performance of the Extra Budgetary Units and
of the Local Councils. The NSO also publishes
monthly statistics on the cash operations of
the central government, for which the
authorities plan to utilize the targeted
timeliness flexibility option in light of
additional time required for the final month of
the fiscal year.
Monetary and financial statistics: Monetary
statistics are timely and of good quality. Since
the entry into the euro area in January 2008,
monetary data for IMF statistical publications
are now obtained through a gateway
arrangement with the ECB, thus reducing the
reporting burden of the country. The country

ANNEX III. MALTA—PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT
SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
General government debt has been on an
increasing path, rising from 62 percent of GDP
in 2007 to 69 percent of GDP in 2010 as the
fiscal position has deteriorated. Under the
baseline scenario, the debt-to-GDP ratio is
expected to peak at 71.5 percent in 2012. In
the medium term, expected primary surpluses
are expected to put the debt ratio on a
downward path reaching 62 percent by 2017.
A significant amount of contingent liabilities
for the Maltese government, such a
government debt guarantees emanating from
the operation of public corporations,
constitute additional risks. Government
guaranteed debt amounted to 16.9 percent of
GDP in 2011 Q3, a 2 percentage point increase
from 2009, 60 percent of which relates to
Enemalta debt. 1
In order to assess the sustainability of debt a
number of adverse shocks are considered.


A permanent growth shock of ½ standard
deviation, which brings growth
permanently down for the whole forecast
period, is expected to put debt on an
increasing path reaching 72 percent
by 2017.



A primary balance shock of ½ standard
deviation would still set debt on a
sustainable path, reaching 67 percent of
GDP by 2017.

1

According to ESA95, as long as the guarantee is not
called (in the event of a default by a public
corporation), it is a contingent liability, recorded offbalance sheet.

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND



Given the magnitude of contingent
liabilities and their importance in debt
dynamics, a one-time shock of 10 percent
of GDP has been considered. This would
capture the case that some contingent
liabilities would be called and would be
recorded on-balance sheet. Given that this
is a large but temporary shock, the debt–
to-GDP ratio increases to 81 percent
in 2013 (when the shock takes place) and
then declines to 72 percent by 2017.

The structure of public debt (Figure 2) is
predominantly in the form of long-term
securities excluding financial derivatives and
held by resident credit institutions and
households.

ANNEX IV. MALTA—EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
ANALYSIS
Malta’s gross external debt is very large and rising. However, Malta’s ample external assets appear to
comfortably cover its external liabilities. The external asset accumulation is likely to continue over the
medium-term, resulting in further increases in net external assets. Overall, Malta’s external position is
likely to remain robust and resistant to various types of shocks.
Malta’s gross external debt is very large and
rising, while the accumulation of external
assets increased significantly. As of
September 2011, the gross external debt
position recorded €33.7 billion or
525.4 percent of GDP, up from €29.8 billion at
end-2009. The gross external debt is mostly
originated from other monetary and financial
institutions (OMFIs) 86.5 percent of total,
mostly short-term non-resident deposits, and
to lesser extent short-term and long-term
loans. On the other hand, the net asset
position doubled from €5 billion at end-2009
to about €10.5 billion or about 164 percent of
GDP at end-September 2011. The financial
transactions of OMFIs accounted for most of
the changes. The Maltese OMFIs held net
liabilities through short-term deposits and
loans; at the same time, possessed substantial
foreign assets through long-term loans and
securities. It is important to note that this
investment profile may, however, expose Malta
to the risk of maturity mismatch, especially in
the event of large short-term redemptions that
would require large-scale asset liquidation.

external financing needs1 and the balance of
payment developments, particularly the
underlying financial transactions—foreign
direct investment, portfolio and other
investment. The continued narrowing in
current account deficit is expected to
contribute to stabilizing Malta’s external debt,
while increasing the net asset position.
By 2017, net external assets reprojected to
reach 165.4 percent of GDP.

A baseline scenario projects that the net
external asset position would continue to
increase throughout the medium-term. The
external debt projections reflect planned

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

The Maltese external position remains robust
to various shocks. Alternative scenarios assume
a permanent ¼ standard deviation shock
applied to real interest rates, growth rate, and
current account balance, as well as a one-time
real depreciation of 30 percent in 2013.


Interest rate and growth shocks are likely
to have a positive impact on Malta’s
external position. Given the large net
external assets, the impact of a permanent
¼ standard deviation increase of about
150 basis points increase in real interest
rate would increase the net asset position

For public sector external financing, the amortization
schedule and interest payments are from the Article IV
2012 questionnaire response. For private sector
external financing, total amortization due assumes
20 percent of medium- and long-term external
obligations and interest payments are derived from
the projected net current income, of which net interest
income on debt and other investment.

MALTA

by about 13 percent of GDP from the
baseline. Likewise, a permanent
¼ standard deviation decline in growth
rate from 2.1 percent to 1 percent would
increase the net asset position by
approximately 11 percent of GDP.


An increase in the current account deficit
would deteriorate the Maltese net asset

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

position. An increase of non-interest
current account deficit to 11.8 percent of
GDP, from 9 percent of GDP in the baseline
scenario, would lower the net asset
position by 13 percent of GDP.


The real depreciation shock would
significantly increase the net asset position
by nearly 80 percent of GDP.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar
terms, g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with
an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and
non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels of the last projection year.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Malta
On March 21, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation 1 with Malta on a lapse-of-time basis 2.
Background
After a strong recovery in 2010, the economy has continued to perform well amidst
considerable turbulence in the euro area, supported by robust consumption and services
exports. Output has surpassed its pre-recession level and labor market indicators have
improved. The trade balance, which turned into surplus in 2010, improved further in 2011.
Recent gains in competitiveness have been underpinned by wage moderation, a narrowing
inflation differential vis-à-vis trading partners, and continued diversification into high-value
added activities.
Malta has taken effective action to correct its excessive fiscal deficit, shoring up confidence
in the country’s public finances. The structural fiscal adjustment was one of the largest
among advanced countries. The general government deficit is estimated to have narrowed
to 3 percent of GDP and the primary balance turned into surplus for the first time
since 2007. Following the announcement of the 2012 budget and additional expenditure
measures in January, the deficit is expected to fall further this year. Nonetheless, the
composition of adjustment remains suboptimal, relying excessively on one-off and revenue
measures.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board.

The Executive Board takes decisions under its lapse-of-time procedure when the Board
agrees that a proposal can be considered without convening formal discussions.

Despite the recent rating downgrades, sovereign bond spreads have remained contained
as government debt is predominantly held domestically. In turn, the sensitivity of the
Maltese banking sector to sovereign risk events in Europe is low given very low direct
exposures to vulnerable countries, as well as domestic banks’ reliance on a traditional retail
deposit-based banking model. Compared to euro area peers, Maltese banks continue to
outperform in terms of profits and capital adequacy.
While spillovers from the euro area crisis have remained contained to date, Malta’s large
financial sector (above eight times GDP) and highly open economy heighten contagion and
financial stability risks. The fragile macroeconomic environment and sustained market
volatility are expected to dampen export growth in 2012. Domestic sources of growth may
not be sufficient to offset the drop in external demand, given headwinds from a soft real
estate market, deteriorating confidence, and ongoing fiscal consolidation. At the same time,
uncertainty in economic policy could adversely affect growth if investment decisions and
structural reforms are put on hold. With the euro area expected to go into a mild recession
in 2012, Malta’s real GDP growth in 2012 will be relatively modest. Risks and uncertainty
around this scenario are significant, reflecting the potential from large spillovers from the
euro area crisis.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2012 Article IV consultation with Malta, Executive Directors endorsed the
staff’s appraisal, as follows:
The government’s commitment to prudent macroeconomic policies has helped Malta
weather the euro area crisis relatively well. But the fragile external environment has created
new risks to growth and financial stability. The main policy challenge now is to maintain
growth and employment, while building buffers against a highly uncertain international
environment. Malta’s resilience to date cannot be taken for granted. Contingency planning
needs to move to the forefront of the policy agenda for the event that growth is substantially
worse than expected or there is financial contagion from a potential intensification of the
euro area crisis. At the same time, the authorities need to balance concerns over a slowing
economy, which calls for accommodative policies, against increased risks that require more
prudent economic management.
The government’s commitment to return to fiscal balance over the medium-term remains
essential. Further fiscal consolidation is required to ensure sustainable debt dynamics, thus
reducing fiscal risks to manageable levels. The pace and composition of adjustment should
be attuned to the economic cycle. Following a significant fiscal effort in 2011, a gradual
deficit reduction path of structural annual adjustment of ½ percentage points of GDP, while
letting automatic stabilizers operate in full, would be appropriate. This will help offset the
headwinds facing the economy in the short-term, while achieving debt sustainability over
the medium-term. The measures underpinning the fiscal effort beyond 2012 need to be
specified for the consolidation to be credible.
Bold policy actions are necessary to reduce contingent liabilities and address Malta’s longrun fiscal challenges. Better governance and restructuring of public corporations will help

3
staunch losses and limit subsidies. With a large projected increase in ageing-related
expenditures, it is crucial to build broad public consensus for further pension and health
care reform aimed at increasing the adequacy and sustainability of the current schemes.
Given the large external risks, it is important to strengthen the financial sector’s resilience
further. The financial sector has continued to perform strongly, but its sheer size and large
foreign ownership represent a number of risks to financial stability and fiscal sustainability.
These include concerns about too-big-to-save and the adequacy of backstopping
resources in case of default or deposit run, the capacity to deal with the impact of a
banking shock on the economy, as well as supervisory challenges. Improving the
framework for financial crisis management and bank resolution and strengthening the
deposit compensation scheme could help limit the impact of contagion. Ongoing efforts to
strengthen financial buffers and tighten supervision relating to asset quality are welcome.
Commendable progress has also been made to better align the regulatory and supervisory
frameworks with international standards.
Financial stability will further benefit from establishing a formal framework for macroprudential policy. Such a framework should define the tasks, powers, and instruments of
the macro-prudential authority; establish clear lines of accountability; and ensure
operational independence from political bodies and from the financial industry. It is crucial
to improve systemic risk monitoring, particularly of spillover risks posed by international
banks, and design contingency plans accordingly.
Longer-term policy challenges remain pressing. Challenges related to population ageing,
labor force participation, education, and energy policy underscore the need to broaden the
reforms so far, raise productivity growth, and further improve competitiveness. Reforms to
secure these objectives include further diversifying the economy into high value-added
activities, reducing the economy’s dependence on energy imports, and strengthening
female labor force participation and education attainment. These steps should be
supported by a cautious settlement of wage negotiations to ensure better alignment of
wage and productivity developments.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
