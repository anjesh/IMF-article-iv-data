EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Economic Background
•

New Zealand’s economy has continued to perform well. Over the last 6 years, growth
has averaged 4 percent a year, compared to an annual average of 2½ percent across the
OECD. Job creation has been exceptional, reducing the unemployment rate to
3.6 percent, the lowest in the OECD. Government debt has been declining steadily, and
inflation has generally remained within the central bank’s target range.

•

Economic growth rose to almost 5 percent in 2004, bringing the economy to a high
level of resource utilization. Household consumption was buoyant reflecting strong
income growth partly due to improvements in New Zealand’s terms of trade. Fixed
investment accelerated as firms enjoyed strong profitability and robust sales, leading to
growing capacity constraints. Inflation picked up as tradable goods inflation rose, partly
due to higher oil prices, while the inflation rate in nontradable goods remained high. The
external current account deficit widened as imports jumped due to high domestic demand
and the strength of the New Zealand dollar.

Policy Discussions
•

The authorities and Fund staff broadly agree on the settings for macroeconomic
policies. Monetary policy faces a difficult balancing act: while the strong economic
momentum implies upward risks to inflation, further tightening risks aggravating a
slowing in activity that may already be underway. Nonetheless, the authorities’ recent
decision to tighten monetary policy and to retain a tightening bias was appropriate.

•

New Zealand’s fiscal position is very strong, but there are limits on the scope for an
expansionary fiscal policy. The government plans a phased rise in spending to meet
health and education priorities and to support low-income families, while meeting its
prudent medium-term target for reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio. A more expansionary
fiscal path could exacerbate existing strains on resources. Long-term fiscal pressures
from rising health care costs and population aging remain a significant challenge, and
reforms of the pension and health care systems will need to be considered.

•

Raising productivity growth, and, to a lesser extent, labor participation, are key to
reducing the gap between New Zealand and OECD average per capita incomes. The
priorities are to implement infrastructure improvements on schedule, to continue
upgrading education and training, and to use a range of measures to facilitate the ability
of individuals to move from welfare to work.

•

New Zealand’s banking system remains sound, and the authorities have taken this
opportunity to strengthen their crisis management framework. Discussions on the
potential integration of banking regulation with Australia are underway. At this stage it is
unclear how these discussions will progress, but adequate safeguards for financial
stability in New Zealand in the event of a crisis need to remain in place.

2.
During past Article IV consultations, there has been broad agreement on New
Zealand’s economic policies. In recent consultations, Directors have attributed the strong
performance of the New Zealand economy to the authorities’ astute management of
macroeconomic policies and the ongoing benefits from the extensive structural reforms since
the 1980s. Directors have also fully supported the sound medium-term frameworks guiding
fiscal and monetary policies, and have generally endorsed the authorities’ macroeconomic
policy initiatives. At the conclusion of the 2004 Article IV consultation on April 30, 2004
(IMF Country Report No. 04/128), Directors considered the decision to raise interest rates in
early 2004 to have been prudent in the context of the high level of resource utilization. To
support monetary policy in the near-term, Directors recommended that budgetary spending
not be increased relative to the latest projections, and that unanticipated revenues be saved.
Directors welcomed the partial prefunding of future pension liabilities through the New
Zealand Superannuation (NZS) Fund. To fully contend with the long-term fiscal challenge of
population aging, Directors emphasized that further reforms of the pension and health care
systems should be adopted.
B. Recent Developments
3.
Strong domestic demand was the main factor driving growth in 2004 (Table 1).
GDP rose by an estimated 5 percent during the year, led by a surge in domestic demand.
Private consumption was particularly strong, reflecting high employment growth, strong
commodity prices, and household borrowing against rising housing values. Following a fall
in net inward migration, house price increases eased to 13½ percent y/y in February 2005,
from 25 percent in 2004, and residential investment slowed from the blistering pace set

-5-

in 2002–03.1 Nonetheless, overall investment growth accelerated as business capital spending
rose rapidly, powered by robust sales, strong profitability, growing capacity constraints, and
declining domestic prices for imported equipment.

The current account deficit rose to 6.4 percent of GDP in 2004 (Table 2). Import
volumes jumped by 16 percent, mirroring the strength of domestic demand. Despite the
strong New Zealand dollar, export volumes grew by a relatively robust 5¼ percent.
Exporters’ incomes were also aided by widespread foreign exchange hedging, and rising
international prices for the country’s major commodity exports that pushed the terms of trade
to a 30-year high. Overall, the trade deficit rose by 1 percentage point of GDP, and with the
profits of foreign-owned companies rising sharply, the invisibles deficit increased by a
similar amount. Net foreign liabilities rose to 84½ percent of GDP at the end of 2004.

Fluctuations in net migration flows make population growth more volatile from year-toyear in New Zealand compared with other advanced economies. Chapter I of the forthcoming

Zealand dollar has risen by 7 percent on a

Inflation stayed within the target range of 1 to 3 percent, but signs of
inflationary pressure are emerging. Headline CPI inflation rose to 2¾ percent y/y by
end 2004, from 1½ percent a year earlier, led by a rise in the inflation rate for tradable goods
as the effects of the exchange rate appreciation diminished and oil prices rose. Nontradable
inflation remained high at 4¼ percent y/y, with the cost of constructing new dwellings
continuing to be a key contributor.

The New Zealand dollar exchange rate is relatively volatile, partly reflecting its sensitivity
to commodity prices. Chapter II of the forthcoming selected issues paper compares the
volatility of the New Zealand dollar with that of other currencies, and examines the impact of
exchange rate volatility on the foreign exchange hedging behavior of exporting firms.

-7-

8.
Monetary policy has been further tightened. The RBNZ raised the official cash
rate (OCR) six times between January and October 2004, bringing the OCR to 6.5 percent.
The resulting rise in effective mortgage interest rates has been somewhat smaller than in
previous tightening cycles—partly due to a mortgage lending “war” in late 2004—but a
slowing in household credit growth began in the second half of 2004. In its March 2005
Monetary Policy Statement (MPS), the RBNZ noted that the economy had not slowed in line
with earlier projections, and the near-term outlook for activity was also stronger, implying
higher underlying inflation pressures than earlier expected. As a result, the OCR was raised
by a further 25 basis points.

The fiscal position has strengthened, aided by stronger than expected growth.
The operating surplus before revaluations and accounting changes (OBERAC) rose to
4¾ percent of GDP in 2003/04 (fiscal year ending in June), and gross government debt
declined to 25¼ percent of GDP (Table 3). The December Economic and Fiscal Update
(DEFU) released at end-2004 projected the 2004/05 OBERAC surplus at 4.3 percent of GDP,
compared with a budgeted surplus of 3.9 percent, with higher projected tax revenues
in 2004/05 only partly offset by higher spending plans. In the eight months to February 2005,
the OBERAC was ¾ percent of GDP above the DEFU projections, owing to spending delays,
and higher surpluses of state owned enterprises.

-8-

C. Economic Outlook and Risks
10.
Real GDP growth is projected to slow in the near-term (Table 4). Growth is
expected to moderate to about 2¾ percent in 2005 and 2006.3 The housing market appears to
be cooling, so the fall in residential investment that began in the third quarter of 2004 is
likely to continue, and lead in turn to a

6.5 percent. Projections assume household debt remains at the 2004Q4 level of 137

11.
However, upside risks to domestic demand remain. Clear signs of the longawaited slowing in the economy have yet to emerge. Growth in real GDP slowed to
0.4 percent q/q, s.a., in the fourth quarter of 2004, partly reflecting one-off factors that may
be reversed in early 2005. Moreover,

3

The projected slowing in growth is more modest on a quarter-on-quarter basis, as the
average annualized quarter-on-quarter growth rate in 2004 was slightly below 4 percent.
4

The RBNZ projects house prices to be flat in 2005 and to decline modestly in 2006–07.
Downside risks to this outlook appear limited—some models of house prices indicate that
any potential overvaluation is perhaps on the order of 10 percent. Stress-tests conducted for
the FSSA (IMF Country Report No. 04/126) concluded that banks were robust to substantial
falls in house prices.

-9-

12.
The possibility of a further appreciation of the exchange rate, particularly if
pressure on the U.S. dollar intensifies, counterbalances some of the upside risks. The
impact of such an appreciation on export sector incomes could be felt more rapidly than has
recently been the case, as RBNZ surveys indicate that the extent of foreign exchange hedging
of exports has declined somewhat due to the already appreciated level of the exchange rate.
An associated rise in U.S. bond yields would affect long-term interest rates in New Zealand,
also tending to dampen demand.
13.
In the medium-term, real GDP growth is projected to average about 3¼ percent.
As New Zealand’s relative cyclical position unwinds in coming years, the external current
account deficit will tend to narrow, thus stabilizing net foreign liabilities as a share of GDP.5
The inflation rate is also expected to decline to about 2 percent. Given New Zealand’s
historically high level of labor force participation, at 67¾ percent of the population over
15 years old, employment growth is likely to moderate in the medium-term. Hence, a rise in
trend productivity growth will be needed to sustain strong growth (as discussed in section
II.C). The risks to these medium economic prospects are cushioned by past structural
reforms, macroeconomic policy flexibility, and generally healthy balance sheets, which have
proven to be resilient to large swings in exchange and interest rates in the past.6

5

The high current account deficit even as the economy returns to potential partly reflects the
assumption that the real exchange rate will remain at its current level. In contrast, the latest
RBNZ projections assume a 15 percent depreciation on a trade-weighted basis by end-2007.
In such a scenario the current account deficit would return toward historic average levels
(about 4½ percent of GDP) more quickly.

6

Annex I provides a fuller analysis of economic vulnerability based on an assessment of
private sector balance sheets. Stress tests using the standard external sustainability
framework template do not suggest major concerns (Table 5). A large exchange rate
depreciation produces (in a relatively static and mechanical fashion) a sizable jump in the
external debt to GDP ratio. However, the experience in the late 1990s underscores the
flexibility of the New Zealand economy in handling such shocks without significant
dislocation. Moreover, the mitigating influence of having foreign currency debt positions that
are predominantly hedged (either by natural hedges or by financial derivatives) is not
captured in the framework.

- 10 -

II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The authorities and staff were in general agreement on the settings for macroeconomic
policies in the period immediately ahead, and the discussions focused on the policy priorities
for sustaining strong growth in the medium term.
A. Monetary Policy and the Exchange Rate
14.
With the economy continuing to show considerable momentum, the RBNZ
recognized that current monetary settings might not be sufficient to contain
inflationary pressures. At the time of the December MPS, the RBNZ considered that a
further tightening might not be necessary given that the full effects of interest rates increases
in 2004 had yet to work their way through the economy. In particular, increased competition
between mortgage lenders in late 2004 had probably extended the usual lags with which
interest rates affected activity. An additional drag on the economy would also emerge
during 2005 as foreign exchange hedges rolled off and exporters became more exposed to the
appreciated exchange rate. Nonetheless, given that inflation was already at the top of the
band, the RBNZ considered there to be little headroom to absorb additional inflationary
pressures should the data continue to surprise on the upside.
15.
The staff agreed with the RBNZ’s diagnosis that further monetary tightening
would probably be required. Staff noted that the stage was set for the economy to slow,
with the high exchange rate already appearing to affect export industries like forestry and
seafood. Substantial interest effects were also in the pipeline. Nonetheless, the timing of the
slowdown was highly uncertain, particularly given the difficulty of predicting the behavior of
consumers who are experiencing strong income growth and record high job security. Indeed,
in the staff’s view, inflation might edge above the 3 percent band in 2005. This was not
inconsistent with the medium-term inflation objective providing that inflation fell back
within the band fairly quickly, thus underscoring the importance of monetary policy retaining
a tightening bias.
16.
Continued strong data led to another interest rate increase in March. Economic
activity has continued to be buoyant in 2005, further increasing inflation prospects, and in the
March MPS, the RBNZ pushed out the timing of the expected slowdown to late 2005. In
deciding to raise the OCR again, the authorities carefully weighed the risk of unduly
exacerbating the eventual slowing of activity against that of a rise in inflationary expectations
that would make the task of containing inflation more difficult in future. With inflation
expected to remain near the top of the target band in the medium-term, the authorities judged
there to be little scope for an easing of monetary policy in the foreseeable future, a view with
which staff concur.
17.
The authorities have not intervened in the foreign exchange market since the
recent review of intervention policy. Although the RBNZ remains committed to a freely
floating exchange rate, it announced in March 2004 that it would contemplate intervention if
the exchange rate was exceptionally and unjustifiably high or low, and if an opportunity
existed that would ensure such intervention would be effective. The RBNZ noted that the

- 11 -

exchange rate was high by historical standards—IMF staff estimates the New Zealand dollar
to be some 15 percent above medium-term equilibrium levels according to a macroeconomic
balance methodology. Nonetheless, the RBNZ considered that the strength of the currency
was largely attributable to the relatively high level of commodity prices and interest
differentials. It was also unclear that current foreign exchange market dynamics were such
that intervention would be effective. Staff viewed the criteria guiding foreign exchange
intervention to be well-considered, and likely to have the intended effect of making
intervention an effective, but rare, occurrence.
B. Fiscal Policy
18.
New Zealand’s strong fiscal position stems from its implementation of sound
policy in a transparent and predictable medium-term framework. In the May 2004
Fiscal Strategy Report (accompanying
Net Government Debt, 2004
the 2004/05 Budget) the government set out
(in percent of GDP)

its longer-term fiscal objectives, which are

- 12 -

its 2004/05 level—would help to address these priorities. Revenues were projected to remain
broadly stable relative to GDP, as earlier increases in the revenue ratio have proven to be
persistent suggesting they are largely structural, while downside revenue risks were more
limited than in the past, due in part to unutilized tax losses being at low levels. Consistent
with the medium-term objectives, the OBERAC surplus is projected to decline to 3 percent
of GDP by 2007/08, and gross debt is projected to fall below 20 percent of GDP in 2008/09,
with net debt including the NZS Fund becoming negative at that time.
20.
Staff agreed with the authorities that despite the current strength of the fiscal
position, there were limits on the scope for expansionary fiscal policy. Staff noted that the
latest DEFU projections involved a moderate stimulus in coming years, and that a more
expansionary path (whether through additional spending or tax cuts) could aggravate existing
short-term strains on resources.8 Moreover, spending growth in a number of categories,
including health and education, had been rapid in recent years, and if such growth was
sustained, the objective of keeping the ratio of debt-to-GDP on a gradually declining path
would not be achievable in the longer run. In the Budget Policy Statement 2005
(accompanying the DEFU), the Minister of Finance expressed the government’s intention to
avoid a fiscal expansion that would put undue pressure on interest and exchange rates, and
also noted that it was prudent not to spend an increase in revenues that resulted from cyclical
factors. Staff fully endorsed these policy intentions, and encouraged the authorities to
maintain the fiscal prudence that has served New Zealand well.

New Zealand faces significant long-term spending pressures owing to rising
health care costs and population aging. Per capita health spending has risen at an average
annual rate of 5 percent in real terms in the last five years. Recent estimates suggest that the
demographic changes in prospect, which are broadly typical of OECD countries, could push
government spending on pensions and health care from the current level of around 11 percent
of GDP to some 19 percent of GDP

on a sustainable path remained substantial. Among measures that would need to be
considered were parametric changes in the pension and health care systems. The authorities
have recently decided to start publishing long-run fiscal reports at least every four years to
help inform the public debate about these issues.
C. Growth and Structural Policy Issues
22.
New Zealand is aiming to sustain strong growth to raise living standards and
ensure the economy is better placed to manage population aging. 10 Despite the
economy’s dynamism in recent years, New Zealand’s per capita income remains some
20 percent below the OECD median level. In 2002, the government set the objective of
closing this gap, and has begun monitoring progress on factors that will contribute to this
goal.11 The key finding is that labor productivity is at the lower end of the OECD range, and
while labor productivity growth has increased from the second half of the 1990s, it remains
below the OECD median.

Resource Management Act, since reducing uncertainties in the resource consent process
would also be beneficial for investment.
24.
Maintaining New Zealand’s labor market flexibility is a critical element in
sustaining high medium-term growth. Amendments to the Employment Relations Act
come into effect in 2005, including requirements to bargain in good faith, to limit “freeriding” of individual agreements on collective negotiations, and to facilitate increased use of
multi-employer collective agreements. Significant minimum wage increases and the Holidays
Act, which includes an extension in annual paid leave from three to four weeks by 2007,
have also been adopted. While the authorities did not expect the functioning of the labor
market to be impeded by these changes, staff recommended that the effects be reviewed after
a suitable period. As the pool of available workers declines, the risk of making a poor
employment match may become a higher barrier to hiring, and staff encouraged the
authorities to review the adequacy of current arrangements for probationary periods.
25.
Current strong labor market pressures present an ideal opportunity for reforms
to further expand labor participation. The authorities explained that while New Zealand
has relatively high overall labor participation, there are still some groups for whom reducing
barriers to participation would help meet the pressing labor needs of employers. Hence staff
welcomed recent measures to increase the opportunity for women to participate by expanding
access to childcare. Staff noted that the WFF package had been carefully designed to avoid
significant adverse impacts on labor participation, and by making returning to work more
worthwhile for those on welfare benefits, it also provided a platform for other reforms to
boost labor participation.
26.
The authorities outlined how more active case management was being used to
help people make the shift from welfare to work. The government was seeking to help
people on benefits move back into work within their abilities by increasing resources for case
management, including by simplifying benefit administration. It had also introduced trial
employment periods for persons on the invalids benefit and pilot projects taking a case-bycase approach to addressing the health needs of those on sickness benefits. Staff welcomed
these steps, especially as the sharp fall in

27.
The authorities were developing a program to facilitate household savings. A
recent report proposed that employers should offer access to a savings plan, with voluntary
employee participation via an ‘opt-out’ system.12 The authorities were refining this proposal,
with the aim of reducing the costs associated with saving, especially for those on lower
incomes. Staff suggested that any budgetary incentives for saving should be time limited and
income targeted. The authorities recognized that large saving incentives were not affordable,
and indicated that the focus would likely be on offering “sweetners” to join and stay in the
scheme for a reasonable period. The staff noted that for many employees, such a program
would not increase their saving, and even if total household savings rose, this was unlikely to
much affect investment and growth, as the financial system has access to international
capital.
28.
The authorities have long recognized the importance of an open international
trade regime in promoting competition, innovation, and growth. As New Zealand faces
substantial foreign trade barriers in agricultural exports, it has a significant stake in the
success of the Doha round, and has been active in discussions across the full range of issues.
On the bilateral front, New Zealand concluded a closer economic partnership with Thailand
in November 2004, and recent studies of bilateral free trade agreements (FTAs) with China
and Malaysia reached positive conclusions. Current trade negotiations include those
concerning a four-way partnership with Brunei Darussalam, Chile, and Singapore.
Negotiations on an ASEAN-Australia and New Zealand Free Trade Area will commence
in 2005.
29.
New Zealand’s official development assistance is focused on the Pacific. Overall,
New Zealand provided 0.23 percent of Gross National Income for ODA in 2003, close to the
average for industrial countries, but well below the 0.7 percent United Nations target, which
New Zealand remains committed to achieve.
D. Financial Sector Issues
30.
The RBNZ has been working to strengthen the regulatory framework for the
banking system. The banking sector has remained sound in recent years, with strong capital,
low nonperforming assets, and well-managed risks. Policy initiatives in banking regulation
include: (i) strengthening the RBNZ’s ability to monitor banks’ risks by adopting a
framework for independent reviews of banks’ systems and controls, with the first use of this
tool already made; (ii) reviewing the disclosure regime, particularly in light of Basel II,
which includes a framework for strengthening market discipline that goes beyond the current
New Zealand disclosure requirements; and (iii) enhancing the capacity to manage financial
stresses, by operationalizing the RBNZ’s lender of last resort role and finalizing options for
responding to bank failures. Furthermore, to ensure banks can operate on a stand-alone basis
in a crisis, the RBNZ has developed a policy to limit the outsourcing of key functions. Staff
12

Working Group, August 2004.

- 16 -

welcomed these policy developments, which also represented substantial progress in
addressing the main recommendations of the FSSA (IMF Country Report No. 04/126).
31.
The potential for closer integration of banking regulation with Australia is being
discussed. The New Zealand banking system is dominated by four large Australian-owned
banks which account for some 85 percent of banking assets, and as a result, the RBNZ and
the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) have undertaken to build an
enhanced home-host supervisory relationship.13 In addition, the Australian and New Zealand
authorities have recently established a high-level council on banking supervision to
coordinate trans-Tasman regulatory issues and guide the development of policy advice to the
respective governments. While staff welcomed these efforts to strengthen supervisory
coordination, it nonetheless stressed that it would be crucial that the final regulatory scheme
adopted incorporate adequate safeguards for financial stability in New Zealand in the event
of a crisis.
32.
Staff welcomed the publication of the first Financial Stability Report. The
October 2004 report notes that a slowing in the housing market could pose some difficulties
for those nonbank financial institutions which have exposure to speculative developments,
and staff supported the planned review of the regulation and disclosure of this class of
institutions. Household debt has risen to 137 percent of disposable income, double its level
12 years ago, and household interest payments are projected to rise above previous highs
in 2005–06 (Box 2). The stress-tests conducted as part of the FSSA found that the banking
system was robust in the face of shocks to the household sector, including a substantial
decline in housing prices. Nonetheless, staff endorsed the RBNZ’s plans to use householdlevel data to further analyze the potential vulnerability of the household sector to higher
interest rates or other shocks.

13

In this context, in March 2005, the RBNZ and APRA agreed on terms of engagement that
establish high level principles for the cross border implementation of the Basel II capital
framework.

- 17 -

III. STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
New Zealand has maintained its recent record of outperforming other advanced
economies. Over the last 6 years, growth has averaged 4 percent a year, compared to an
annual average of 2½ percent across the OECD. Job creation has continued at a rapid pace,
reducing unemployment to the lowest in the OECD. These macroeconomic achievements are
underpinned by the sustained implementation of sound monetary and fiscal policies and the
wide-ranging structural reforms undertaken in the past.
34.
Growth has continued to surprise on the upside. Activity was expected to slow
in 2004 as a result of the appreciation of the New Zealand dollar, combined with a substantial
fall in net migration inflows that was expected to reduce pressures in the housing market and
slow durable consumption as residential investment declined. However, exporters’ incomes
have held up, aided by strong commodity prices and widespread foreign exchange hedging.
The strength of the labor market has also supported consumption, while promoting strong
business investment to help overcome capacity pressures and the difficulty of finding labor.
35.
Clear signs of the anticipated decline in inflationary pressures have yet to
emerge. Since the beginning of 2004, domestic demand has been consistently stronger than
envisaged, and with the potential pressure on prices not coming off as expected, the RBNZ
has appropriately raised rates seven times. Yet even though resource utilization has risen to
record high levels, inflation has remained inside the target range with strong upward
pressures on nontraded goods prices being offset by low inflation in non-oil traded goods
prices. However, labor markets are now exceptionally tight and inflation, already near the top
of the band, may rise above 3 percent in 2005.
36.
In this environment, monetary policy faces a difficult balancing act. While there
continue to be upside risks to the inflation outlook, a further tightening could exacerbate a
slowdown that may already be underway. It is expected that resource pressures will ease
once lower net migration translates into a decisive cooling of the housing market, and the
lagged effects on activity of higher interest rates and the more appreciated exchange rate
come into play. On the other hand, high consumer confidence, strong investment intentions,
and the highest terms of trade in 30 years, together pose a risk that domestic demand could
again exceed expectations, in which case, resource pressures would not abate. On balance,
given the underlying momentum in household consumption and business investment, staff
agree with the RBNZ that the risks to inflation are predominantly on the upside and that
monetary policy should retain a tightening bias.
37.
Fiscal performance has been very strong and prospects remain favorable, but
there is limited scope for expansionary fiscal policy. Policy objectives are to achieve
operating surpluses over the economic cycle sufficient to cover contributions to the NZS
Fund, and to meet capital spending requirements while bringing gross government debt down
below 20 percent of GDP by 2015. The Treasury’s December 2004 forecasts show operating
surpluses over the next few years that are larger than previously anticipated. The higher than
expected fiscal surpluses reflect buoyant revenues, and staff strongly endorse the authorities’

- 18 -

intention not to use the cyclical component of these revenues to raise spending. The new
projections already imply a small stimulus over the next few years, and a more expansionary
policy would risk adding to current resource pressures, while potentially complicating the
attainment of the government’s medium-term fiscal policy objectives. Moreover, the recent
rapid growth in a number of spending categories, including health and education, is unlikely
to be sustainable for much longer. In this light, the prudence and discipline that the
government has shown over many years in making its expenditure decisions should be
maintained.
38.
Rising health care costs and population aging will pose significant long-term
challenges for fiscal policy. Estimates made by the Treasury suggest that demographic
changes over the next half century are likely to double or triple government spending on
pensions and health care from the current level of 11 percent of GDP, depending on cost
assumptions. The creation of the NZS Fund to prefund part of the future pension liabilities
has been an important step to smooth out the effect on the budget of expected increases in
pension obligations. However, if public spending is to be kept on a sustainable path, the
challenges remain substantial, and parametric changes in the pension and health care systems
will need to be considered. In this context, staff welcome the decision to start publishing
long-run fiscal reports at least every four years since this will help inform public debate
about the need for reforms.
39.
New Zealand has the potential for continued strong economic growth in the
medium-term. Despite the strong performance of the economy in recent years, per capita
income remains some 20 percent below the OECD median. The challenge for New Zealand
is to sustain high growth that will narrow this gap, while positioning the economy to manage
the problems of population aging. In this endeavor, increasing labor productivity will be key,
since there is no longer scope for the substantial gains in labor utilization that have occurred
over the past decade. Indeed, the task for the next decade is to maintain high GDP growth in
a period when the labor input is set to grow more slowly.
40.
Higher productivity growth will be crucial to sustaining medium-term growth.
A rise in productivity growth appears to be feasible if business investment remains high,
thereby deepening the capital used by workers and bringing in new technology. The
government can facilitate continued high investment by upgrading transportation and energy
infrastructure, and ensuring that the education system equips the workforce with the requisite
skills. Improving the Resource Management Act to reduce investor uncertainties will also
assist in this regard.
41.
New Zealand’s labor market flexibility is a key advantage that should be
carefully preserved. A range of measures affecting the labor market have recently been
adopted, including the Holidays Act, amendments to the Employment Relations Act, and
increases in the minimum wage. These measures are generally not expected to impair labor
market flexibility, although the effects should be kept under close review. Given the tightness
of the labor market, the risk of making a poor employment match may be deterring some

- 19 -

firms from hiring new staff. The adequacy of existing arrangements for probationary periods
should therefore be reviewed.
42.
Using more active case management to help people transition from welfare to
work is a promising approach to expand labor participation. Although participation is
already relatively high, there appears to be scope for increasing participation among certain
groups, thus helping to meet the pressing labor needs of employers and cushion the impact of
slowing net immigration. Recent measures to increase the opportunity for women to
participate by expanding access to childcare are welcome, and the Working for Families
package provides a useful foundation for further reforms to raise participation rates. The
government has adopted significant new initiatives aimed at helping people on benefits back
into work within their abilities, including trial employment periods for recipients of invalids
benefit and taking a case-by-case approach to addressing the health problems of those
receiving sickness benefit. These efforts could be reinforced by strengthening requirements
for those on benefits to participate in training or work programs.
43.
The main benefits from schemes to promote savings probably lie in improving
the resilience and economic opportunities of households. Even if the proposals currently
being debated do lead to an increase in aggregate savings, the effects on investment and
growth are unlikely to be large as New Zealand already has easy access to international
capital. Nonetheless, workplace savings systems can help households build financial assets
that provide a buffer against shocks and expand their opportunities to invest in education,
housing, small business, and retirement. As the authorities well recognize, the design of such
schemes should take account of the administrative costs, while the incentives offered should
be carefully designed so as to limit the impact on the budget.
44.
Reforms to banking regulation are underway. The adage that roof mending is best
done while the sun shines has been taken to heart in the reforms being made to New Zealand
bank regulation. The financial sector is fundamentally sound, and the banking sector is
blessed with strong capital, low nonperforming assets, and well-managed risks. In these
favorable circumstances, the authorities’ efforts to strengthen their regulatory and crisis
management capacity are especially commendable. The planned review of the regulation and
disclosure of nonbank financial institutions is also an important step. At this stage, it is
unclear how discussions with Australia on the closer integration of banking regulation will
progress, but the priority should be to ensure that adequate safeguards for financial stability
in New Zealand remain.
45.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with New Zealand take place
on the standard 12-month cycle.

- 20 -

Box 1. Rapid Employment Expansion and Productivity Growth
New Zealand’s growth over the last decade has been primarily a labor utilization story, as the table
below summarizes. With the employment ratio already at a historical high, labor input growth is set to decline
in coming years, and New Zealand will need to increase productivity growth to sustain strong rates of GDP
growth. Since labor input can be expected to rise by only about 1¼ percent a year over the medium-term,
compared to 2½ percent over 1992-2004, productivity growth will need to increase to 2 percent a year (from
about 1¼ per during 1992-2004) for the economy to achieve annual growth in potential output of 3¼ percent.
To some extent these data overstate the required jump in productivity growth, since productivity growth has
been higher in recent years than in the first half of the 1990s, at some 1½ percent.

However, a significant increase in employment, as recently experienced in New Zealand, can itself lead
to lower measurements of average productivity. When the employment rate increases, the newly employed
workers tend to be less productive than existing workers, which mechanically reduces average productivity.
Bélorgey et al. (2004) estimate the impact of the employment rate on labor productivity for a panel of 25
industrial economies.1 They find that a 1 percent increase in the employment rate decreases average
productivity by ½ percent.
The increase in productivity growth required to maintain high GDP growth thus may be less daunting
than it appears. The employment rate in New Zealand rose from 57 percent in 1992 to 64 percent in 2004,
implying an average increase in the rate of about 1 percent a year. Extrapolating the results of Bélorgey et al.
(2004) to New Zealand suggests that this rapid growth in employment may have lowered measured average
labor productivity growth by as much as ½ percent a year. This would suggest that in the absence of further
growth in the employment ratio in the period ahead, measured productivity growth should be boosted by the
end of the dampening effect on average productivity noted above. Moreover, the productivity of newly-hired
workers can be expected to rise as they gain work experience, and it might do so more rapidly than the
average worker given their lower initial level of productivity on average.

Box 2. Rising Household Indebtedness and Monetary Policy1
As in other advanced economies, household
debt levels have risen strongly in the last two
decades in New Zealand. Following financial
deregulation in the mid-1980s, and aided by the
decline in nominal interest rates permitted by
disinflation, the ratio of household debt to
income in New Zealand doubled to 100 percent
by the end of the 1990s. Borrowing accelerated
in 2002-04, primarily due to the rise in housing
prices, lifting the debt ratio to an estimated
137 percent at the end of 2004, a level broadly
similar to the U.S., U.K., and Australia.

Higher indebtedness could increase the sensitivity of household spending to interest rates,
potentially allowing monetary policy to achieve its goals with smaller interest rate adjustments.
The negative impact of interest rates on the incomes of households that are debtors will be greater at
higher debt levels (see Debelle, 2004). New Zealand households are relatively exposed to interest rate
effects on their disposable income; at the end of 2004, some 85 percent of mortgage loans were at
interest rates fixed for less than two years, or were at floating rates.
An analysis of consumer spending in New
Zealand supports the hypothesis that interest
sensitivity has increased. Real interest rates on
housing mortgages are found to have a negative
impact on consumption, and a model allowing this
effect to depend on the level of household
indebtedness has greater explanatory power. With
household debt at 50 percent of disposable
income, a 1 percentage point rise in the interest
rate is estimated to reduce consumption by some
¾ percent after 2 years. With the household debt
ratio near 140 percent, as at the end of 2004, the
same interest rate increase is estimated to lower
consumption by 2¼ percent.

Nonetheless, the recent rise household’s equity in housing could moderate the interest rate
sensitivity of consumption looking forward. Recent U.S. research finds that households can better
hedge income shocks when collateral for borrowing is more abundant (Lustig et al, 2004). Housing
equity has risen by some 100 percentage points of income in recent years in New Zealand, so the scope
for households to smooth income shocks from interest rate changes may have risen significantly.

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
ε = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and α = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes, which is large in 2005 due to the exchange rate appreciation during 2004. The impact of price and exchange rate changes falls to negative 1 percent of GDP in later years.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.

ANNEX I

Economic Vulnerability Assessment
1.
New Zealand does not appear to face major economic vulnerabilities.14 Overall,
the economy remains well placed to manage adverse economic shocks. While net foreign
liabilities remain high, they have declined from their peak. Foreign debt has become more
concentrated in the banking sector and its maturity has shortened, reflecting increased
intermediation of capital flows by banks. About half of the debt remains denominated in
foreign currency, but exchange rate risk is mitigated through substantial hedging. Corporate
and banking sector balance sheets continue to look strong, and they have proven in the past
to be resilient to large swings in exchange rates and interest rates. Household balance sheets
and finances also look reasonably sound. Housing remains the main household asset, and
mortgage debt is the major household liability and a major asset of the banking system.
Higher leverage has recently increased debt servicing costs of households, and a substantial
increase in interest rates or unemployment or a correction in housing prices could potentially
strain the finances of some households.

Net external liabilities have remained broadly unchanged over the last four
years, as assets have kept pace with the rise in debt. Gross external debt increased from
85 percent of GDP at end-March 1998 to 111 percent at end-March 2001, and has since
declined to 104 percent at end-March 2004 (Table 1).15 Banks account for a growing
proportion of external debt, as their external debt more than doubled from 25 percent of GDP

This annex updates the vulnerability assessment provided in New Zealand: 2004 Article IV
Consultation, IMF Staff Country Report No. 04/116, 2004, which concluded that there were
no major vulnerability concerns.

at end-March 1997 to 59 percent at end-March 2004, and they now account for some
57 percent of total gross external debt. It is notable that this debt is generally owed to the
Australian banks that own the New Zealand banks, reducing the rollover and other risks
associated with external debt. At the same time, foreigners’ holdings of New Zealand
government debt have declined, representing only some 13 percent of total debt at endMarch 2004.
3.
The maturity profile of the external debt has been shortening, while there has
recently been a decline in the foreign currency component. As the financial sector raises
most of its funds at shorter maturities than the government and corporate sectors, the rise in
the share of banks’ external debt has caused a shortening of the maturity. The foreign
currency component of the external debt has declined to 51 percent of total debt at endMarch 2004, after rising to 63 percent at end-March 2001. The risks from foreign currency
exposure are mitigated by a substantial degree of hedging. Recent survey data indicate that
exchange rate risk for a large though declining share of the foreign currency debt is hedged
(Table 2).16 For the debt covered by the survey, some 88 percent has been hedged either
through natural hedges or using financial derivatives. Dependence on financial derivatives
for hedging has increased sharply since end-March 1998. The market for these instruments
appears to be reasonably deep and has proven to be rather resilient, given the large swings in
the value of the New Zealand dollar in recent years.

15

Data from 2001 are not fully comparable to earlier data due to methodological changes in
the New Zealand balance of payments accounts.

16

Hedging information is collected by Statistics New Zealand from a survey of corporations.
In 2003, the survey covered some 80 percent of foreign currency debt.

4.
New Zealand’s banking sector performance remains very strong. With a robust
domestic economy, New Zealand banks remained solidly profitable in 2004; their return on
assets was 1.3 percent.17 The banks are well capitalized, maintaining total capital of more
than 10 percent and tier-one capital of about 8 percent of risk-weighted assets.18 The overall
asset quality of the banking system remains high, with the ratio of impaired assets to total
assets at about ¼ percent, a historic low and well below levels in other developed countries.
The overall strength of the banks in New Zealand is reflected in their ratings by the
independent credit rating agencies.19 All of the major banks have strong ratings; the five
largest banks, which account for 90 percent of total assets and deposits, have credit ratings of
AA-.

17

Stress tests from the FSAP concluded in 2004 indicate that banks would be resilient to
significant market and credit risk shocks, including a major decline in demand for
agricultural exports, a large fall in housing prices coupled with a rise in unemployment, or a
substantial increase in the cost of foreign capital inflows.

18

Registered banks in New Zealand are required to maintain a minimum tier-one capital ratio
of 4 percent and a total capital ratio of 8 percent of risk-weighted assets.

19

All New Zealand banks are required to have credit ratings independent of their foreign
parents.

Overall financial indicators for the corporate sector in New Zealand remain
sound. Rates of return on assets and on equity rose in 2003, and they continue to be strong.
Leverage ratios remain in line with Australia’s and interest coverage remains healthy,
although it may decline as the effect of higher interest rates kick in.

6.
The strong real estate market contributed to a significant increase in household
net worth in 2002–04. Net housing wealth increased as housing prices rose substantially
faster than disposable income. Meanwhile, mortgage debt has gradually risen from
84 percent of disposable income in 1998 to 109 percent in 2003, supported by lower interest
rates, lower inflation, and financial deregulation. Net financial wealth rose slightly in 2003
relative to disposable income, as the equity market rebounded.

- 35 -

ANNEX I

7.
Higher interest rates and lower housing prices could result in financial strain for
some households. Increased leverage led to a rise in interest costs from 8 percent of
disposable income in 1999 to 10¼ percent in 2004. Sensitivity analysis conducted by the
Reserve Bank suggests that an increase by 1 percentage point in the residential mortgage rate
would increase these interest costs to 11.5 percent of disposable income. The number of
rental properties owned by households has risen from less than 20 percent of urban privatelyowned dwellings in 1991 to over 25 percent in 2004.20 If interest rates rise relative to rental
returns, some households who borrowed to invest in rental properties could find themselves
under some financial strain. The extent to which downside risks to housing prices and
consumption may have increased is unclear, as real estate investors are also more likely to
have other assets and income that can help absorb shocks.

ANNEX III

Statistical Issues
New Zealand publishes an array of high-quality statistics, which are fully adequate for
surveillance purposes. The frequency and timeliness of the availability of the common
indicators required for Fund surveillance are summarized in the attached table. Data are
readily available in electronic form from the websites of Statistics New Zealand, the Reserve
Bank of New Zealand, and the New Zealand Treasury.
The authorities are continuing to enhance data quality and expand the range of data
available. For example, Statistics New Zealand has been undertaking a range of projects to
improve balance of payments statistics in the areas of travel debits, trade in other services
(services excluding transport, travel, and insurance), debt securities transactions, and inward
foreign affiliate trade statistics. The New Zealand Treasury is leading a project to publish
fiscal data consistent with the Government Finance Statistics 2001 manual (GFSM 2001).
New Zealand has made further progress toward becoming a subscriber to the Special
Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). All SDDS requirements are being met for monetary
data, and timeliness requirements for central government fiscal data are expected to be met in
2005. Estimates of external debt by original maturity—as required by SDDS, rather than by
remaining maturity as measured by official data—are being prepared. The remaining issues
are the timeliness of local government data, where the authorities are exploring the feasibility
of earlier publication, and the requirement for publication of an industrial production index.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with New
Zealand
On May 2, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with New Zealand.1
Background
New Zealand’s economy has performed well, recording real GDP growth of 4 percent on
average since 1999, due to the extensive structural reforms undertaken in the 1980s and 1990s
and the sustained implementation of sound macroeconomic policies. High net migration inflows
in 2002–03 also contributed to strong growth in recent years. Unemployment has fallen to the
lowest rate in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Countries, public
debt has been declining, and inflation has remained within the central bank’s target range.
GDP growth was particularly strong in 2004, at 4.8 percent, led by a surge in domestic demand.
Private consumption grew by 6 percent, reflecting high employment growth, strong commodity
prices, and household borrowing against rising housing values. Business investment also
increased rapidly, powered by robust sales, strong profitability, growing capacity constraints,
and declining domestic prices for imported equipment.
The current account deficit rose to 6.4 percent of GDP in 2004, as import volumes jumped by
16 percent, mirroring the strength of domestic demand. At the end of March 2005, the New
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.
1

-2Zealand dollar had appreciated 7 percent on a trade-weighted basis since end-2003, to stand
about 16 percent above its twenty year average on a real effective basis. Export volumes
nonetheless grew by a robust 5¼ percent in 2004, aided by widespread foreign exchange
hedging that shielded exporters from the full effect of the stronger exchange rate. Meanwhile,
rising international prices for the country’s major commodity exports pushed the terms of trade
to a 30 year high. Net foreign liabilities rose to 84½ percent of GDP at the end of 2004.
Inflation rose to near the top of the 1 to 3 percent target range as the economy reached a very
high level of resource utilization. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) raised the official
cash rate (OCR) six times between January and October 2004, bringing the OCR to
6.5 percent. But the economy did not slow in line with earlier projections, and with the near-term
outlook for activity remaining strong, the OCR was raised by a further 25 basis points in March
2005.
The fiscal position is strong, with actual budget surpluses exceeding targets consistently in
recent years. The operating surplus before revaluations and accounting changes (OBERAC)
rose to 4¾ percent of GDP in 2003/04 (fiscal year ending in June), and gross government debt
declined to 25¼ percent of GDP. The OBERAC surplus for 2004/05 is expected to be larger
than budgeted, with higher projected tax revenues only partly offset by increases in spending
plans.
Growth is projected to slow in the near-term, to about 2¾ percent in 2005-06.
Consumer spending is expected to moderate due to a cooling of the housing market and the
effects of higher interest rates, while, with the hedges rolling-off, export growth is likely to be
dampened by the high exchange rate. Nonetheless, there are upside risks to domestic demand
due to high levels of job security; and, the RBNZ has indicated that there is little scope for an
easing of monetary policy in the foreseeable future. As the cyclical position of the economy
unwinds, the external current account deficit and inflation are expected to decline. Real
GDP growth is expected to average about 3¼ percent over the medium-term, requiring a rise in
productivity growth as recent gains in labor utilization will be difficult to replicate going forward.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed New Zealand’s strong economic growth in recent years,
which has reduced the unemployment rate to the lowest in the OECD. Directors considered
these commendable economic achievements to have been underpinned by the sustained and
skilful implementation of sound monetary and fiscal policies and the wide-ranging structural
reforms.
Directors noted that, since the beginning of 2004, domestic demand has been consistently
stronger than envisaged, partly due to continued strong export commodity prices. In
this environment, the potential pressure on prices has not come off as expected, and Directors
endorsed the authorities’ tightening of monetary policy. Directors observed that, even though
resource utilization has risen to record high levels, inflation has remained inside the target
range. Strong upward pressures on nontraded goods prices have been offset by low inflation in

-3non-oil traded goods prices, due in large part to the appreciation of the New Zealand dollar.
Looking forward, Directors considered that monetary policy faces a difficult balancing act of
responding to inflationary pressures while avoiding an unduly sharp slowing of activity.
On the one hand, growth is expected to moderate and resource pressures to ease, once the
effects of higher interest rates and the more appreciated exchange rate come into play, and a
decline in net migration inflows translates into a further cooling of the housing market. On the
other hand, high consumer confidence, strong investment intentions, and the most favorable
terms of trade in 30 years, together pose a risk that domestic demand again exceeds
expectations. On balance, Directors considered that the risks to inflation are predominantly on
the upside, and supported the authorities’ recent decision to maintain a tightening bias in
monetary policy. On the exchange rate, Directors supported the authorities’ approach of limiting
foreign exchange market intervention to exceptional cases that met clearly specified conditions.
Directors commended the authorities on their sound fiscal management, cast in a transparent
and predictable medium-term framework, which has led to a strong fiscal performance and a
substantial reduction in gross government debt. They welcomed the decision in the 2004/05
budget to lower the debt target from 30 to 20 percent of GDP, to be achieved before 2015.
Directors endorsed the government’s objectives of achieving operating surpluses over the
economic cycle, sufficient to cover contributions to the New Zealand Superannuation (NZS)
Fund, while meeting capital spending requirements and maintaining government debt at prudent
levels.
Directors stressed that current fiscal projections imply a small macroeconomic stimulus over the
next few years, and that a more expansionary policy would risk adding to current resource
pressures. Against that background, they supported the intention not to spend the cyclical
component of higher-than-expected operating surpluses. Moreover, Directors noted that the
recent rapid growth in a number of spending categories, including health and education,
is unlikely to be sustainable. Directors therefore encouraged the government to maintain the
prudence and discipline that it has shown in the past several years in making its expenditure
decisions.
Directors reaffirmed that the creation of the NZS Fund to prefund part of the future pension
liabilities has been an important step toward meeting the significant long-run demands on the
budget posed by population aging. While noting that health care also represents an important
source of long-run pressure on fiscal resources, they emphasized the need for further
parametric changes in the pension and health care systems. Directors urged that such
measures be adopted sufficiently early to help smooth fiscal costs over time and allow
individuals time to adapt. In this context, Directors welcomed the planned publication of long-run
fiscal reports at least every four years to help inform public debate about the policy options.
Directors agreed that New Zealand has the potential for continued strong economic growth in
the medium-term. They observed that New Zealand’s per capita income remains about fourfifths of OECD median levels, and that narrowing this gap would leave the New Zealand
economy better positioned to manage the problems of population aging. With limited scope for

-4further increases in labor utilization, Directors agreed with the authorities that increasing labor
productivity is the key policy challenge.
Directors noted that higher labor productivity growth appears feasible if business investment
remains high, thereby deepening the capital used by workers, and promoting the adoption of
new technologies, and research and development. To enhance the investment environment,
Directors supported plans to upgrade the transportation and energy infrastructure,
and endorsed recent steps to enhance the skills of the workforce by raising the quality and
relevance of tertiary education. Directors were of the view that improving the Resource
Management Act would also help facilitate investment.
Directors judged New Zealand’s flexible labor market to have contributed to strong employment
growth and low unemployment, and recommended that this flexibility be carefully preserved.
In this context, Directors advocated that close review be kept of the effects of the range of labor
market measures that have been adopted in recent years, including the Holidays Act and
minimum wage increases. Directors agreed that the adequacy of existing arrangements for
probationary periods of employment should be reviewed.
While overall labor participation is already relatively high, Directors saw scope for increasing
participation among certain groups. Directors welcomed the intention to promote participation of
women by expanding access to child care, and the government’s plans to use more active case
management to help people make the transition from welfare to work, and recommended that
these efforts be reinforced by strengthening requirements for those on benefits to participate in
appropriate training or work programs.
Directors endorsed the authorities’ emphasis on minimizing the administrative costs of the
schemes being developed to facilitate household savings that would be operated at the
workplace level. Directors recommended that any savings incentives that are offered be
designed so as to contain the budgetary impact. Directors considered that such schemes can
help to improve the financial resilience of households.
Directors strongly welcomed the authorities’ recent efforts to strengthen the banking regulation
and crisis management framework at a time when the financial sector is fundamentally sound.
They considered the planned review of the regulation and disclosure of nonbank financial
institutions to be an important step. Directors observed that substantial progress in addressing
the recommendations of the 2004 Financial System Stability Assessment is being made,
including by enhancing cooperation and coordination between the financial supervisors in
Australia and New Zealand. In the discussions currently under way between the two countries
on the closer integration of banking regulation, Directors urged that priority be given to ensuring
that adequate safeguards for financial stability in New Zealand remain in place.
Directors recognized that New Zealand continues to face substantial trade barriers in key areas,
including agricultural products, and welcomed the authorities’ commitment and efforts to
promote an open international trading system, not only at the bilateral and regional levels,
but also at the multilateral level under the Doha round. Directors commended the authorities'

-5generous response to the recent tsunami and encouraged the authorities to continue to make
progress towards their goal of raising overseas development assistance.
Public Information Notices (PINs) are issued, (i) at the request of a member country, following the
conclusion of the Article IV consultation for countries seeking to make known the views of the IMF to the
public. This action is intended to strengthen IMF surveillance over the economic policies of member countries
by increasing the transparency of the IMF's assessment of these policies; and (ii) following policy discussions
in the Executive Board at the decision of the Board.
