STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Growth prospects: Switzerland is experiencing a strong expansion. The recovery has been
broad based, with output and employment now above pre-crisis levels. While domestic
demand should remain resilient, currency strength and an expected weaker external
environment should induce a slowdown, from 2.6 percent in 2010 to 2.4 percent in 2011
and 1.8 percent in 2012. Inflation should remain muted. Main risks relate to international
developments, through their possible impact on external demand, supply conditions, or the
currency. Longer-run risks to growth are linked to a slowdown in construction and structural
changes in the financial sector.
Policy stance: With the output gap closing and a below neutral policy interest rate,
monetary accommodation should be withdrawn in the near-term under the baseline
scenario. Foreign exchange intervention should be limited to offsetting excessive volatility.
Monetary policy tightening will ensure that demand pressures remain moderate and will be
consistent with a neutral fiscal stance, as envisaged under the fiscal rule. With government
debt at 53 percent of GDP and the budget close to balance, a sound fiscal position should
be preserved, including through long term sustainability reforms.
Financial stability: The performance of the financial sector is improving, but areas of
vulnerability remain. Gradual interest rate normalization may not be sufficient to address
growing interest rate and credit risks associated with mortgage lending, where lending
standards are deteriorating. Preventive action, through targeted policy measures, such as
system-wide affordability limits or maximum loan-to-value ratios, would be prudent. The
legal mandates and powers of FINMA and the SNB in addressing macro-prudential risks
should be clarified.
Regulatory and Supervisory Reforms: Priorities include: (i) the approval of the
systemically important financial institution (SIFI) legislation; (ii) preserving the additional
capital buffers that are at the center of the “too big to fail” proposal; and (iii) continued
efforts to strengthen prudential supervision.

Impact of the Appreciation of the Swiss franc on Exports and Prices

In spite of the recent appreciation of the Swiss
franc, performance of the export sector
remains satisfactory. The real effective exchange
rate is back at its 1995 peak, but indicators of
export performance suggest that exporters remain
competitive. Export market shares in goods remain
strong, particularly in advanced economies.1 The
trade surplus in goods has risen gradually, driven by
trade with non-euro area countries and emerging
markets (Switzerland, however, has a structural
deficit vis-à-vis the euro area).

performance going forward, with effects
differing across export markets. Estimates of
aggregate export exchange rate elasticity indicate
that long-run elasticities are significant; with an
elasticity of goods exports to the nominal effective
exchange rate of about 0.8 (see Selected Issues
Paper). This aggregate elasticity may reflect not only
the direct dampening effect on foreign demand,
but also the indirect competitive pressures from
trading partners in common export markets.
However, estimates based on the analysis of
bilateral exports suggest little price elasticity of
exports to the euro area, which account for
50 percent of exports, and are mostly driven by
demand factors. In contrast, exports to fast
growing emerging economies appear more elastic
to the NEER, with estimates varying between
0.7 and 1.
The appreciation of the Swiss franc could also
affect monetary policy decisions to the extent
that it feeds into domestic prices. A high passthrough might contribute to downward dynamics
of core inflation if inflation expectations are
negatively affected. However, the existing literature
has generally found a low pass-through to
consumer prices in developed countries, even if the
pass-through to import prices is usually significant,
thus allowing expenditure switching effects of
exchange rate movements.

Estimates for Switzerland confirm that the
pass-through to consumer prices is low,
implying that the appreciation of the SFr is
unlikely to weigh down on consumer prices
significantly. Estimates based on an errorcorrection model suggest that while the impact of
the appreciation is high on import prices, the
“long-run” exchange rate pass-through for core
CPI is very low, between 2 and 4.7 percent.

Are Risks in Residential Construction and Mortgage Markets Rising??

Net immigration flows, low interest rates, and
supportive real incomes continue to underpin the
Swiss real estate market.

While the growth in residential real estate prices
appears relatively subdued in international
comparison, prices have accelerated of late.
Analysts have also noted the presence of “hot
spots” with larger price increases in specific areas
(notably Geneva, Zug, and Zurich).
Affordability indicators do not yet show overall
significant signs of misalignment. Separately, the
ratio of owner occupied apartment prices relative to
rental apartment prices has risen sharply from the
early 1990s to 2000, reflecting the impact of rent
regulation, but it has flattened since then.

Part of the expansion may be fueled by a relaxation
of lending practices. SNB survey data indicates
there are substantial “exceptions to lending
standards”. In 2009, banks with a total market
share of about 25 percent reported exceptions to
lending policy for more than 20 percent of new
mortgage loans (see Figure 3, final panel). In
addition, a sizable portion of the banks failed to
respond to the survey—exacerbating uncertainty.

In their internal lending standards, banks assume
certain interest rates and maintenance costs for
prospective borrowers in order to determine
affordability of a mortgage. The long-term average
rate on mortgage loans is close to 5 percent, with
rates in the 1990’s persistently above 5.5 percent.
However, survey data indicates that in 2009, banks
with 27 percent market share assume an interest
rate of less than 5 percent and maintenance costs
of less than 1 percent, suggesting insufficiently
conservative affordability criteria.

Switzerland’s Net Foreign Asset Position and External Balance Assessment

Switzerland’s net foreign asset position (NFA)
has risen steadily for several decades, reaching
130 percent of GDP at the end of 2009. The
upward trend has been a consequence of savinginvestment surpluses. While net investment in fixed
income securities remains predominant, Swiss
multinationals have increasingly invested abroad
resulting in a net FDI position of 63 percent of GDP
at the end of 2009. In contrast, as a result of the
large mutual fund industry, and because a large
share of these multinationals’ stocks is owned by
non-residents, Switzerland has large net portfolio
equity liabilities estimated at 46 percent of GDP at
the end of 2009.

However, the accounting treatment of
reinvested earnings and capital gains tends to
inflate the current account (CA). Most of the
earnings of the multinationals are not paid out as
dividends, but are reinvested abroad. These are
recorded as direct investment income in the current
account, with an offsetting FDI outflow in the
financial account. At the same time, capital gains of
non-resident investors of Swiss stocks are not
recorded as portfolio income outflows. These two
factors are subtracted to get a better assessment of
the residents’ saving-investment balance. Assuming
a 3 percent return on multinationals’ earnings
resulting in capital gains, and subtracting an
estimated 3 percent net direct investment income
from the current account (estimated from historical
data), the required overall downward adjustment in
the CA reaches about 4 percent of GDP.

Taking into account these corrections, estimates
drawing on the CGER methodology suggest the
SFr is still broadly in equilibrium, in spite of its
appreciation.1 According to the latest estimate of
the External Sustainability approach, the mediumterm corrected CA is about in line with what is
required to stabilize the net foreign asset position,
while it was estimated to be above in 2009.
According to the Macro Balance approach, the
medium-term corrected CA is also broadly in line
with its medium-term fundamentals (the fiscal
balance, demographic factors, the oil balance, the
income level and output growth). The Equilibrium
Real Exchange Rate approach implies an
overvaluation driven by the recent nominal effective
appreciation above its historical average and given
stable terms of trade.

According to the Spring 2011 CGER assessment, the Swiss

Confederation budget has been regularly overachieved over the last six years mainly on the back of

to ageing pressures were not fully successful.
Ageing-related expenditures are expected to rise by
5 percent of GDP by 2050.4 Parametric reforms of
old age insurance, aimed at increasing the female
retirement age (from 64 to 65 years), was defeated

measures focus on ensuring sufficient liquidity and
capital buffers for TBTF banks partly in the form of

evidence of increased resolvability.

Profitability Analysis

Profitability has improved steadily

since 2009. Despite mixed results, the sector has
started to recover from the global financial crisis.
Faced with falling life insurance premiums and only
slightly increasing non-life insurance premiums,
insurers have continued to take cost-cutting
measures. Recovering capital markets have led to
investment gains and significantly fewer write
downs on investments. Major insurers’ ROE has
improved from the trough in 2008 to over

insurers is on par with U.S. competitors—and

insurance sector generates about 80 percent of the
net income of the Swiss insurance industry. Despite
the continued growth in the non-life insurance
industry, insurers’ operating profitability is eroding.
The main insurers’ average combined ratio (sum of

the non-life and life industry, investment results
could improve, but will not reach the pre-crisis
levels. The moderate investment income could only

investment analysis shows that despite the
recovery of the Swiss insurance sector,
challenges and risks remain. Profitability is likely
to be subdued because of weak underwriting
results and moderate investment results. The full
implementation of the SST is an important step
forward to enhance the sector’s resilience while
some companies may find it challenging to boost
their capital because of the subdued profitability
prospects and the need to strengthen reserves. The
impact of the interest rate depends not only on the
direction, but also on the speed. A sustained low
rate or an abrupt increase of interest rates would
negatively affect the insurance sector while the
benefit of a progressive increase of interest rates
would outweigh the cost. Risks associated with the
real estate market warrant continued close
monitoring and effective management.

of the SNB” in the balance of payments.
Switzerland has continued to provide data on
Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) and
participated in the 2009 Coordinated Direct
Investment Survey. The data and metadata
for both these initiatives have been posted on
the IMF website.
With regard to AML/CFT, the FATF Plenary
decided in October 2009 that Switzerland had
made significant progress in addressing the
deficiencies which were identified in its 2005
mutual evaluation report, and on that basis,
decided to remove Switzerland from the
“regular follow-up” process. Switzerland will
report further improvements to its AML System
in October 2011 within the context of its
biennial update.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
Switzerland
On May 18, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Switzerland.1
Background
The economy has experienced a strong, broad-based recovery. After falling by 1.9 percent
in 2009, output grew by 2.6 percent in 2010. Domestic demand was underpinned by sound
balance sheets, low interest rates, and a rebound in employment and immigration. Exports
increased more strongly than expected, on the back of robust external demand and in spite
of a 10-percent appreciation in the real effective exchange rate. Trade and current account
surpluses have continued to expand. Capacity utilization, particularly in construction, is now
above its long-term average while the unemployment rate has gradually declined. Despite
the surge in oil prices and declining slack in the economy, inflationary pressures, so far,
remain muted. House prices have accelerated but there is so far no evidence of a
widespread misalignment.
Monetary policy has supported a swift exit from the recession. The Swiss National Bank
(SNB) continues to implement an expansionary monetary policy, with the 3-month Libor
target range at zero to 0.75 percent since March 2009. From that date until mid-2010, the
SNB pursued foreign exchange interventions to limit upward pressure on the Swiss franc.
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summing up can be found here:

2
Fiscal policy provided limited stimulus during the crisis given small automatic stabilizers, a
moderate package of policy measures, and conservative application of the debt brake fiscal
rule. Thus, overall fiscal balances were little affected by the downturn.
The global market recovery, and favorable financing conditions, together with financial
sector measures have contributed to improving banks’ profitability, and capital and liquidity
positions in 2010. However, there is evidence of increased risk taking in mortgage lending,
in the context of persistently low interest rates and high competition among banks.
Recommendations from the “too big to fail” commission, now under discussion in
Parliament, include supplementing minimum Basel common equity requirements with
loss-absorbing buffers in the form of contingent convertible capital, which may be lowered
depending on measures to reduce inter-connectedness and complexity. Regarding
supervision, the Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) has developed a new
risk-based approach, increased on-site inspections, hired more personnel, and taken steps
to improve the effectiveness of external auditors. Inter-agency cooperation has been
strengthened with a new tripartite Memorandum of Understanding on collaboration,
information exchange, and crisis management.
With the recovery firmly established, the authorities are contemplating an exit from their
expansionary monetary policy. Fiscal policy is projected to be broadly neutral. The recovery
is expected to gradually moderate in the near-term. Growth is projected to slow to 2.4
percent in 2011 and to 1.8 percent in 2012. While domestic demand should remain resilient,
the delayed effects of currency appreciation and a weaker external environment will slow
exports and reduce the trade surplus. Headline and core inflation should remain muted at
around 1 percent in 2011–12. However, there are large uncertainties related mainly to
global developments.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their pro-active policy response, which
contributed to a swift and broad-based economic recovery. Directors noted that
uncertainties relating to external developments are likely to persist, weighing on the
near-term growth outlook. In the medium term, continued financial sector reforms will be key
to reducing vulnerabilities.
Most Directors supported a prompt withdrawal of the monetary stimulus, absent new
shocks, and concurred that interventions on the foreign exchange market should be limited
to reducing excessive exchange rate volatility. Directors took note of the differences
between staff and authorities on the assessment of the exchange rate misalignment, with
many stressing the uncertainties surrounding the assessment. Directors noted that, while
the normalization of the monetary policy stance will contribute to reducing macro-financial
concerns, it may not suffice to address loosening lending standards in the mortgage market.
They recommended, therefore, that macro-prudential measures also be considered, unless
system-wide self-regulation is sufficiently stepped up.

3

Directors welcomed Switzerland’s comparatively strong fiscal position. In view of the
prospective tightening of monetary policy, they agreed that a neutral fiscal stance is
appropriate. Directors supported continued adherence to the “debt brake” rule and, in light
of the large financial sector and ageing pressures, encouraged further efforts to buttress
fiscal sustainability, including a parametric reform of the old age insurance system.
Directors noted that banks’ performance has improved, but vulnerabilities remain. They
commended the authorities for their efforts to promote “too big to fail” legislation aimed at
reducing the risks posed by the two largest banks, and looked forward to a swift adoption of
the law. Directors encouraged further progress in micro-prudential supervision, including on
a cross-border basis, by increasing on-site inspections and strengthening the independence
of external auditors from banks. Directors stressed the importance of continuing to monitor
risks in the insurance sector, where reduced profitability prospects and the need to
strengthen reserves could hinder recapitalization efforts.
Directors encouraged a strengthening of the macro-prudential framework, clarifying roles
and responsibilities of the SNB and FINMA, where necessary by revising relevant
legislation, and establishing the legal basis for system-wide policies to address macro
financial stability issues.

Statement by Rene Weber, Executive Director for Switzerland
and Peter Marcel, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
May 18, 2011
1.
On behalf of our Swiss authorities, we would like to thank staff for once again
presenting a useful staff report, which includes a thorough and insightful analysis of the
macro-economic situation with a particular and appropriate focus on financial sector
issues. We share staff’s opinion regarding the policy challenges going forward on most
aspects. The candid policy recommendations are welcome and add considerable value to
the topical domestic policy discussions in Switzerland.
Outlook
2.
The growth outlook for the Swiss economy is positive overall. Available data for
end-2010 and the beginning of 2011 continue to paint a solid picture of the Swiss
economy, although this outlook is tempered by the strong appreciation of the Swiss franc.
External and domestic demand will likely have contributed positively to growth during
the first months of 2011. Unemployment is falling and the output gap is practically
closed. The government projects only slightly lower GDP growth in 2012 than this year
(2.1 percent in 2011 and 1.9 percent in 2012).
3.
However, the net trade contribution to Swiss GDP will be low on average in 2011.
Besides the dampening effects of the currency appreciation in real terms, a weaker
international environment is likely to contribute to a slowdown. Business sentiment as
measured by surveys had reached relatively high levels during the first semester 2010,
but has not improved further since. During the last months, new orders in the chemical
industry, an important segment of the Swiss industry, have declined considerably. On the
positive side, corporate balance sheets are healthy and liquid, and international
competitive pressures should continue to elicit productivity gains.
Monetary Policy
4.
Our authorities share the staff’s appraisal that there is a need to normalize the
monetary policy stance in the near term. Absent significant shocks or risks to the outlook,
the current expansionary policy cannot be maintained without compromising price
stability in the longer term. Conditional on an unchanged policy rate, CPI inflation is
forecast to stay below 1 percent during 2011, but it is expected to exceed this mark in
2012 and surpass 2 percent by the end-2013. Normalization is also needed to reduce
macro-financial concerns, even though monetary tightening alone may not suffice. It may
have to be complemented by the use of macroprudential instruments.
5.
Since the beginning of the international financial crisis, the Swiss franc has come
under significant appreciation pressure. This pressure increased further in spring 2010
with the escalation of the debt crisis in the euro area. Given the zero bound on interest
rates, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) intervened to prevent an unwanted tightening of
monetary conditions via an excessive appreciation of the Swiss franc. In mid-2010, as

2
uncertainties abated and the economic outlook improved, the SNB stopped its
interventions and started to mop up liquidity.
6.
The strong appreciation of the Swiss franc over the second half of 2010—which
even accelerated at year-end—resulted in a substantial valuation loss on foreign exchange
reserves. Profits were nonetheless distributed because of past accumulated surpluses and
the Confederation’s and the cantons’ need for budget planning dependability. To mitigate
the exchange rate risks inherent in holding foreign exchange reserves, the SNB continues
to build up its capital and diversify its foreign exchange reserves.
7.
Our authorities do not share the staff’s assessment that the exchange rate is broadly
in line with fundamentals. Rather, the SNB considers the Swiss franc to be overvalued, as
clearly shown by the results from the IMF’s equilibrium real effective exchange rate
approach. The SNB does not consider the other two approaches that are used in the
CGER methodology—the macro-balance and the external sustainability approach—to be
very relevant for Switzerland. Both of these approaches rely on estimates of an
equilibrium current account, something that is very difficult to estimate in the Swiss case
because Swiss current account figures are essentially influenced by structural factors
(such as large investment income from multinationals, trade in services, and the
mandatory pension system) and not by the exchange rate. Even the adjusted numbers in
Box 3 do not do full justice to the inadequacy of these approaches in the Swiss case.
Financial stability
8.
Our authorities share the staff’s assessment of Switzerland’s main challenges for
financial stability, namely the need to strengthen the large banks’ capital base and to
prevent an overheating in the real estate market. On the former, the large banks’ leverage
remains high relative to peers, despite recent improvements and notwithstanding aboveaverage Tier 1 ratios, and the quality of their capital will need to be improved. It is
envisaged that systemically important banks build up their capital well above
international standards in the next few years (see ¶ 9). On overheating, the authorities are
closely monitoring risks to financial stability stemming from the real estate market and
they share the staff’s view that corrective measures to address these risks need to be
considered. Specific measures already taken comprise: (i) data collection to further
improve monitoring quality, (ii) an initiative to revise the Swiss Bankers Association’s
self-regulation for mortgage lending, and (iii) an intensification of microprudential
supervision. The Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) could, in addition,
require capital add-ons.
Too-big-to-fail (TBTF) legislation
9.
The Swiss authorities welcome the staff’s assessment that the proposed legislation
on strengthening financial sector stability (TBTF) is instrumental in reducing systemic
risk in the economy. The combined impact of the strong measures relating to capital,
liquidity, and organization will be key for the effectiveness of this legislation. The
proposal currently being debated in parliament does not only aim at increasing the
resilience of systemically important banks, but would also establish strong incentives for

3
these institutions to reduce their systemic impact and to improve their international
resolvability.
Macroprudential framework
10. Our authorities appreciate the in-depth analysis of the framework for
macroprudential oversight. They consider the staff’s concrete proposals as a helpful
contribution to the discussion. They note, however, that international experience and
guidance on best practices remains limited at present and that there is no broadly
accepted framework, let alone a “one-size-fits-all” concept. Further analysis, taking
account of the specific structure of the Swiss financial system, will thus be needed to
formulate a macroprudential framework for Switzerland. This framework will have to be
based on, and combine, the expertise of both the SNB and FINMA and to account for the
experience gained during the crisis.
11. The Federal Department of Finance has set up a high-level working group to (i)
assess the organization of macroprudential surveillance in Switzerland and the need for
additional macroprudential instruments and (ii) evaluate the need to adapt the legal
framework, inter alia to ensure that the SNB can fulfill its financial stability tasks,
including with regard to crisis prevention. This further work should help clarify the
division of responsibilities between the various authorities and assign the instruments
accordingly. The working group will submit its report in the fall 2011.
Fiscal Policy
12. The fiscal outcome for 2010 benefited from a much stronger than expected
performance of the Swiss economy, resulting in a general government surplus of 0.2
percent of GDP rather than a budgeted deficit of 1.5 percent. This swing from deficit to
surplus was most notable at the federal level. The 2010 federal budget as well as those of
sub-national entities were based on economic forecasts that pointed to a severe recession
in 2009 followed by a tentative recovery in 2010. Although in retrospect the recession
was the worst since the 1970s, it was not as severe as predicted at the time of budgeting,
and the strength of the recovery exceeded all expectations.
13. As noted by staff, the requirements of the Swiss debt brake rule have been regularly
surpassed over the last six years. This has helped to move federal debt onto a more
sustainable path and has led to a significant reduction in interest payments. However,
budgetary overperformance has focused the authorities’ attention on the estimation
methods for receipts, in particular from the withholding tax. In light of the latest outturns,
this tax estimate will be revised upward to better take account of its more recent trend.
14. The medium-term budgets of the Confederation are expected to deteriorate
somewhat due to various structural tax reforms. At the sub-national level, however,
balances are improving further. The figures of the social-security accounts—which
recorded an increase in the deficit of roughly 1 percent of GDP between 2008 and
2010—will improve as well and reach balance by 2012, partly due to the reform of
unemployment insurance.

4

15. As a further sign of fiscal prudence, debt levels are expected to continue their
decline, notwithstanding their small uptick in 2010. Since many cantons and
municipalities have adopted and implemented their own debt brake or other fiscal rules,
our authorities believe that the basis for the debt consolidation called for by staff is
solidly in place.
