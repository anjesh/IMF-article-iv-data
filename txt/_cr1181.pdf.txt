Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2010 Consultation with Belgium
Approved by Ajai Chopra and Jan Kees Martijn
March 8, 2011
Executive Summary
The political impasse hampers economic policy making and compounds post-crisis
vulnerabilities. Political uncertainty and high public debt have triggered market concerns
about Belgium’s public finances, and the Belgian sovereign and banks are vulnerable to
contagion from possible renewed market turmoil in the euro area. Economic activity expanded
more than foreseen in 2010 and progress was made in bank restructuring but real GDP growth
is projected to moderate in 2011, in view of the expected slowdown in the euro area.
There was agreement on the need for a comprehensive strategy to address
macroeconomic policy priorities but the authorities considered that this would require a new
federal government. In the meantime, the caretaker government is preparing a draft 2011
budget while the financial authorities have intensified banking supervision.
There was consensus that significant efforts are needed to bring down the public debt
while dealing with rising aging costs. The draft 2011 budget will build on the encouraging
2010 fiscal outcomes but would mostly rely on ad hoc measures. Achieving the appropriate
objective of a balanced budget by 2015 will require significant efforts, including a reform of
fiscal federalism arrangements, spending constraint at all levels of government and social
security, as well as revenue measures. Adopting a rule-based multiyear fiscal framework based
on inter-governmental burden-sharing would be important to ensure the credibility of the
envisaged consolidation.
In light of the significant risks remaining in the financial sector, continued vigilance is
needed. The authorities agreed that banks must ensure sufficient capital and liquidity buffers as
the Basel III regulatory framework is implemented. They should also remain flexible to provide
liquidity support in the event of renewed stress. The authorities viewed continued strengthening
of financial supervision as an important policy priority. More efforts are needed to monitor
cross-border exposures, identify risks in the financial sector as a whole, and facilitate the timely
resolution of cross-border financial institutions.
Growth-enhancing structural reforms should be pursued vigorously. The focus should be
on improving the functioning of the labor market in order to increase employment, and on
promoting competition in product and services markets. The limited real wage increase
envisaged for 2011–12 would help strengthen competitiveness, and the automatic wage
indexation should be reconsidered.

I. POLITICAL GRIDLOCK AMID FINANCIAL TURBULENCE
1.
Belgium is going through a prolonged political impasse resulting from persistent
regional tensions. The federal government of Prime Minister Leterme fell in April 2010 over
long-standing disagreements on how to reform the bilingual electoral district of BrusselsHalle-Vilvoorde. Following early elections in June 2010, negotiations to form a new federal
government led by the two largest parties (the New-Flemish Alliance and the francophone
Socialist Party) faltered, reflecting inter alia divergent views on further fiscal devolution to
be imbedded in another reform of the state (Box 1). Subsequent efforts by the mediator
appointed by the King in October to work out a framework for negotiations on a new
government program fell through in January 2011. Since then, a new round of talks aims at
lifting the political deadlock. While these efforts signal continued willingness to form a
federal government, new federal elections cannot be excluded.
Box 1. Complex Political Fault Lines
Divergences between the Flemish northern part of Belgium and the francophone south
have built up over decades. They range from linguistic and cultural issues; economic policy
making, including industrial and labor market policies; to different preferences concerning
regional fiscal autonomy and national social safety nets. Five state reforms since 1970 have
transformed Belgium from a centralized state to a country made up of federal entities (the
federal state and the social security administration, as well as the Flemish, Walloon and
Brussels Capital Regions and the Flemish, French, and German linguistic communities).
The current political controversies center in particular on:


The extent and modalities of further fiscal devolution through a revision of the
Special Financing Act, which regulates the financial relations between the various
federal entities, and the transfer to the regions of part of personal income taxation as
well as part of the responsibility for labor market policies, health care, child
allowances, and the judiciary.



The financing of Brussels through higher compensation for public services provided
to commuters and international civil servants in conjunction with streamlining its
governing structures and improving the efficiency of its administration.



The reform of the bilingual electoral district of Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde that lies
partly in Flanders.

2.
The political stalemate hampers economic policy making and compounds postcrisis vulnerabilities. The Belgian economy is gradually recovering from the downturn but
the protracted political negotiations have detracted from addressing important challenges:


The public debt-to-GDP ratio, which had declined steadily during pre-crisis years, is
on the rise again on the heels of the crisis, albeit less than in neighboring countries.
Rising aging costs will put pressure on the public finances in the coming years.

4


The banking sector is in the midst of a restructuring but remains vulnerable to
spillovers from its sizable foreign exposures; asset quality deterioration; and funding
shocks.



The low employment rate and limited competition in product and services markets
hold back economic growth, which is also crucial for fiscal consolidation.

3.
Belgium has been affected by the turbulence on European sovereign debt
markets and the political impasse has weakened market confidence in the country’s
resolve to bring its public debt under control. Despite high household savings and a strong
external position, the 10-year sovereign bond spread (vis-à-vis the German Bund) has
increased from some 40 bps early in 2010 to around 100 bps in the latter part of the year and
early 2011, the highest level among core euro area countries. Preserving market confidence
in Belgian sovereign debt is important to avoid adverse debt dynamics as well as to maintain
sound bank balance sheets and funding conditions. In view of the large financing needs of
Belgium’s government and banks in 2011, it is urgent to address the above-mentioned
economic policy challenges.1
4.
The consultation discussions focused on the need to develop and communicate a
clear and comprehensive strategy to address macroeconomic policy priorities without
delay. The mission discussed various options with the authorities to (i) reduce the fiscal
deficit in 2011–12 as per Belgium’s Stability Program, including through initiating reforms
in fiscal federalism arrangements and entitlement programs; (ii) address contagion risks and
legacy problems in the financial sector while strengthening banking supervision and
preparing for Basel III implementation; and (iii) push ahead with structural reforms in labor
and product/services markets. The authorities agreed on the need for such a strategy but
considered that this would first require reaching agreement on a new government and a fiscal
federalism reform. At the same time, the caretaker government is preparing a draft 2011
budget law to ensure that the 2011 fiscal targets under Belgium’s Stability Program will be
reached while the financial authorities have intensified banking supervision.
II. GRADUAL RECOVERY WITH CHALLENGING OUTLOOK
A. The Recovery Continued in 2010
5.
After being hit by a severe recession in 2008–09, the Belgian economy is
gradually recovering.


1

Supported by the rebound in world trade and by monetary and fiscal easing, real GDP
growth in 2010 was stronger than foreseen and is estimated at 2 percent, above the

The Belgian state faces on average euro 3.5 billion monthly T-bill rollover needs in 2011, and large T-bond
redemption needs of about euro 28 billion with peaks in March and September. As of late October 2010, the
total wholesale funding of banks with maturity less than six months amounted to euro 209 billion (almost
60 percent of GDP).

5
euro area average (1.7 percent). As in other European countries, the expansion has
been driven by strong exports, notably to Germany and Asian emerging economies.
Industrial production in November had increased by about 7 percent from the trough
a year ago. Both consumer and business confidence indicators have improved.


With employment expanding again, the unemployment rate increased somewhat
further to almost 8½ percent in 2010, but remained below the euro area average of
10 percent. Labor hoarding and use of reduced working time arrangements have
mitigated the rise in unemployment.

6.
While core inflation remained subdued in 2010, headline inflation jumped up
due to the energy price hike. Core inflation was weighted down by the sizable output gap
and remained low at 1¼ percent in 2010. Headline inflation, however, picked up briskly to
2.3 percent in 2010, well above the euro area average (1.6 percent). The inflation gap with
the euro area was largely driven by rising oil prices and amplified by the sensitivity of the
Belgian economy to energy price shocks (Box 2). As a result, the automatic wage indexation
was triggered in August 2010.
Box 2. Why is Belgian Inflation Sensitive to Energy Prices?
Inflation in Belgium is more sensitive to changes in energy prices than inflation in other
euro area countries. National Bank of Belgium studies find that a 10 percent increase in oil
prices would lead to a 0.71 percentage point rise in the HICP in Belgium after three years,
compared to 0.45 percentage point in the euro area as a whole. Staff analysis has found that the
pass-through within one year from oil price increases to domestic fuel prices in Belgium is
0.42, the highest coefficient among advanced countries (average: 0.24).
The sensitivity of Belgian inflation to energy prices reflects not only the relatively high
energy dependency of the economy, but also structural rigidities in both energy and labor
markets. Belgium’s industrial structure and the higher consumption of energy products by
Belgian households lead to higher energy dependency than for other euro area countries. The
volatility of crude oil prices affects Belgian consumers more because of the relatively low level
of excise duties and related taxes, and limited competition in the energy sector. In addition, the
pass-through to headline inflation is amplified by second-round effects induced by Belgium’s
automatic wage indexation mechanism.

B. Outlook and Risks
7.
The Belgian economy is expected to continue its gradual recovery. Staff project
real GDP growth to moderate somewhat to about 1.7 percent in 2011, and to pick up
gradually to some 2 percent over the medium term. The authorities project growth to remain
at 2 percent in 2011. Export growth would weaken in the near term with the expected
softening of growth dynamics in Belgium’s main trading partners while relatively high labor
costs and supply rigidities continue to impede the penetration into fast-growing export
markets. Domestic demand would be restrained as the government largely unwinds the

synchronized slowdown, possibly related to
spillovers from simultaneous fiscal retrenchment in Europe.
9.
The growth of potential output is expected to revert to its declining trend over
the medium term. Before the crisis, the potential growth rate of the Belgian economy was
already falling owing to demographic factors, particularly population aging. The crisis
pushed down potential growth in 2008–09 below its trend rate because of the adverse impact
on sectors relying on foreign demand and external finance. From 2010, potential growth is
projected to revert to its trend rate of about 1½ percent over the medium term. With
significant under-utilization of production capacity and slack in the labor market, the output
gap would be gradually closed.
C. External Developments and Competitiveness
10.
The current account balance is expected to continue to be in moderate surplus
over the medium term. Despite the significant widening of the overall fiscal deficit in 2009,
the national saving-investment balance returned to a modest surplus, reflecting the surge in
private savings as well as the drop in private investment. In view of households’ Ricardian
behavior, net savings of the private sector would remain large and continue to offset the
fiscal deficits.2 The external current account surpluses projected over the medium term would
be smaller than before the crisis.
2

During 1993–2008, public savings and household savings in Belgium were negatively correlated (correlation
coefficient: -0.8), supporting the hypothesis that Belgian households display Ricardian behavior.

Competitiveness issues relative to key trading partners persist. Estimates based
on the CGER methodologies do not indicate that the real exchange rate is in disequilibrium,
but developments in the real effective exchange rates based on unit labor costs (ULC) show a
competitiveness gap with respect to some key trading partners, especially Germany. With the

III. POLICY CHALLENGES
12.
In view of lingering concerns about sovereign risks in the euro area and
uncertainty about the pace of the global recovery, the discussions centered on the need

10
to build a consensus on macroeconomic policy priorities. The authorities were fully aware
of the importance of assuaging sovereign market concerns before policy interest rates are
raised from current lows, and underlined the broad support for adhering to the fiscal
consolidation objectives set out in Belgium’s Stability Program.3 Staff indicated that
significant efforts are needed to deal with rising aging costs while lowering public debt to the
SGP limit of 60 percent of GDP over the longer term. The authorities agreed that legacy
problems in the financial sector should be resolved while addressing contagion risks,
strengthening banking supervision, and preparing for Basel III implementation. Sustained
growth and job creation will also be key for fiscal consolidation and staff considered it
essential to push ahead with growth-enhancing structural reforms.
A. Fiscal Policy: Achieving Successful Fiscal Consolidation
13.
Fiscal consolidation started in 2010. The overall fiscal deficit was reduced from
6 percent of GDP in 2009 to 4.6 percent in 2010, below the Stability Program target
(4.8 percent of GDP). This outcome reflected the stronger-than-foreseen economic growth,
strict budgetary monitoring and spending discipline by the caretaker federal government, and
a slowdown in healthcare spending growth. At the same time, the regions and communities
underperformed as compared to their efforts foreseen in the Stability Program despite higherthan-expected revenues. Belgium’s fiscal consolidation strategy appropriately aims to reduce
the overall fiscal deficit to 3 percent of GDP in 2012 before achieving a balanced budget by
2015, in order to start reducing the public debt after 2012.
14.
Building upon the encouraging 2010 fiscal outcome, the caretaker government is
preparing a draft federal budget for 2011. Staff welcomed that the draft budget will aim at
reducing the overall deficit to less than 4 percent of GDP in 2011, below the target under
Belgium’s Stability Program (4.1 percent of GDP). With the sub-national budgets already
adopted, the adjustment burden in 2011 will fall on the federal government and social
security. In the absence of a new government, however, the draft federal budget would rely
mostly on ad hoc measures, including a new tax on nuclear power plants and an increase in
the tax on banking activities. Spending will be contained by continuing some of the 2010
savings, including on healthcare.
15.
In order to reduce the overall deficit to 3 percent of GDP by 2012, significant
additional tightening measures will be needed. Under current policies, the overall deficit is
projected to remain at about 4 percent of GDP in 2012 and beyond while the public debt is
bound to drift up further over the medium term. This reflects in particular the pressure of
rising aging costs on the budget which could increase by almost 2 percent of GDP by 2015
and further mount by 3 percent of GDP during 2015–30.

Successful fiscal consolidation will need to be based on a joint effort at all levels
of government. The experience from the past large fiscal adjustment in Belgium shows the
importance of reaching agreement on a multiyear budget framework based on
intergovernmental burden-sharing with specific deficit targets (Selected Issues Paper,
Chapter 1). In order to achieve Belgium’s fiscal objectives, a new government will have to
undertake a structural fiscal effort of almost 1 percent of GDP in 2012 and about 0.75 percent
of GDP thereafter to achieve the balanced budget target by 2015, as illustrated in the
Consolidation Scenario in the figure below.

17.
The debt sustainability analysis shows that public debt reduction calls for strong
and persistent fiscal consolidation efforts (see Selected Issues Paper, Chapter 2). Belgium
has the third largest debt-to-GDP ratio in the euro area and its public debt is very sensitive to
an economic slowdown, an interest rate hike, or fiscal slippage. Under staff’s baseline
scenario, public debt would remain close to 100 percent of GDP through 2015. Under the
fiscal consolidation scenario envisaged in Belgium’s Stability Program, however, the debt-toGDP ratio would start to decline in 2013 to about 89 percent of GDP by 2015, which would
be an important down-payment on reducing the debt to 60 percent of GDP by 2030.

To stabilize and start bringing down the public debt, reforming the existing
fiscal federalism arrangement is a priority (Box 3). Key issues to be addressed are the lack
of adequate incentives to contain real spending growth in line with trend economic growth
and the off-loading on the federal government of revenue shortfalls, higher-than-foreseen
social security outlays, and some spending decided by regional and local governments. While
the assignment of public services to different levels of government can be based on various
considerations (such as economies of scale and voter preferences, including on sub-national
fiscal autonomy and national solidarity), it should ultimately be governed by the need to
preserve the financial viability of the general government as a whole. With regard to the
ongoing political negotiations to revise the fiscal federalism arrangement, the authorities
broadly agreed on the importance of the following considerations:


Adopting a rule-based framework to ensure the credibility of the envisaged
consolidation efforts, in line with the ongoing strengthening of fiscal governance
in the euro area. This should comprise a multi-year budgetary framework based
on realistic macroeconomic assumptions; caps on spending growth for each level
of government; and possibly a revenue rule that assigns unforeseen additional
revenue to public debt reduction.



Determining the share in tax revenues of each level of government in a consistent
manner, in order to safeguard sufficient revenues for the federal government to
honor its debt service and social security obligations;



Avoiding moral hazard and promoting transparency and accountability at all
levels of government, in order to preclude decisions by sub-national governments
that create unplanned fiscal liabilities for the federal government and establish a
clear link between costs and benefits of public services; and



Limiting tax competition between sub-national jurisdictions to avoid distortions in
the efficient working of the internal common market.

19.
Restoring a credible path towards fiscal sustainability will require a new
government to implement a comprehensive strategy, notably including growth-friendly
entitlement reforms. The focus should be on limiting expenditure growth at all levels of
government and social security, while also preparing additional revenue measures:


4

Both the federal and the sub-national levels of government should take advantage
of the projected retirement of about a third of public servants by 2020 by not
replacing a sizable number of them. Also at sub-national levels of government the
efficiency of public services in Belgium can be significantly improved.4

Box 3. Fiscal Federalism in Belgium
Federalization in Belgium derived from historical, linguistic, and cultural divides. The Belgian
federation is composed of the federal state, three regions, and three linguistic communities.
There is no hierarchy between federal laws and regional and community laws.
Almost three quarters of the regional and community financing come in the form of transfers
from the federal government. The main financial transfer to the regions is the federal personal
income tax transfer. It is a grant rather than a shared tax as it is not a fixed proportion of the
total revenue from the personal income tax. Since 1990 the federal personal income tax transfer
is horizontally attributed to the regions according to each region’s contribution to federal
personal income tax revenues. In parallel, under the National Solidarity Intervention program
(Intervention de solidarité nationale, ISN), regions receive an equalization grant. Finally, each
region obtains a lump-sum grant from the federal budget. Due to their lesser fiscal capacity, the
Brussels and Walloon regions are net recipients of ISN transfers.



Curbing the rise in pension costs by eliminating fiscal incentives for early
retirement and introducing actuarial neutral discounts on early pension benefits to
compensate for the longer benefit period and the shorter contribution period.5 It is
urgent to organize a national dialogue to prepare a comprehensive pension reform
as in other European countries. An increase in the effective retirement age by one
year is estimated to yield structural savings of about ½ percent of GDP.



Reducing federal transfers to the healthcare system (estimated at 1 percent of
GDP in 2011) by tightening the excessively loose real healthcare spending growth
norm (4.5 percent) and by strengthening cost-saving incentives for healthcare
providers and customers. Transferring part of the healthcare responsibilities, e.g.,

At present, the effective retirement age at less than 60 years is much below the statutory retirement age of
65 years.

15
long-term care, to the regional and local levels would provide better aligned
incentives and help trim costs.


Strengthening fiscal discipline at the local government level by setting up a forum
for regional-local fiscal coordination at all stages of the budget cycle and by
applying transparent norms on the size and composition of local investment and
borrowing to prevent municipalities from accumulating excessive or overly risky
liabilities.



Broadening the tax base and improving revenue collection. There is also
considerable scope to reduce the large federal and regional tax expenditures while
using part of the gains to lower statutory tax rates and the labor tax wedge.

The authorities agreed that achieving Belgium’s fiscal objectives will necessitate
implementing significant adjustment measures, including in the pension and healthcare
systems, but indicated that these will have to be decided by a new government.
B. The Financial System: Continued Restructuring to Improve Resiliency
20.
Conditions in Belgium’s financial system have improved, but the banking sector
is still in the midst of significant restructuring with considerable risks remaining.
Deleveraging in the banking sector continued, with total assets falling from some 430 percent
of Belgian GDP in mid-2009 to around 360 percent by mid-2010. Share prices and credit
default swap (CDS) premiums of Belgium’s four main bank-assurance groups (Dexia, KBC,
BNP Paribas Fortis, and ING Belgium) have stabilized in 2010, but CDS premiums remain
elevated. The banking sector saw a return to net profitability in the second half of 2009 and
2010. Growing net interest income has been an important driver of the increase in banks
operating income, reflecting re-pricing of commercial loans and deposits as well as
steepening of the euro yield curve.

While asset quality has deteriorated somewhat, the banking system remains by
and large well capitalized. The deterioration of the economic situation was mirrored by
higher nonperforming loans (NPLs), in particular in Ireland and Central and Eastern
European (CEE) countries, but the overall share of NPLs in gross loans remains low. At the
same time, the banks have reduced their risk-weighted assets through divestment of non-core
business activities. Overall, the capital adequacy of Belgian banks compares favorably to
other major European banks, owing in part to the state capital support. The aggregate capital
adequacy ratio reached 18 percent by mid-2010 while the Tier 1 capital ratio improved from
13.2 percent at the end of 2009 to 14.1 percent in mid-2010.

22.
Staff and the authorities agreed on the importance of ensuring that banks
continue to have sufficient capital buffers as the Basel III regulatory framework is
implemented. Although the forthcoming changes in the definition of regulatory capital
implied by Basel III will impact the largest banks, the authorities’ simulations showed that
the large Belgian banking groups would be able to comply with the new regulations without
raising additional equity. This finding assumed the envisaged grandfathering and transitional
arrangements for phasing-in the new regulations, as well as continued progress in bank
restructuring. As market pressures may require early compliance with Basel III requirements,
the authorities need to ensure that banks maintain sufficient capital buffers. This will enhance
the banks’ ability to raise longer-term funds at reasonable costs and supply adequate credit to
the private sector.
23.
Banks’ lending criteria have eased relative to the depth of the crisis and demand
for credit and credit to the private sector have picked up. Loan demand for mortgages has
shown a strong increase in 2010, as has demand for loans by companies. At the same time,
the criteria for granting credit in Belgium have moved sideways since the end of 2009, amid
a tighter lending environment elsewhere in the euro area. Overall credit to the private sector
recovered in 2010 at a rate that is in line with nominal GDP.

24.
Bank restructuring is progressing but execution risks are considerable. The
authorities are closely monitoring the significant restructuring of three of the four major
banks that is aimed at deleveraging and refocusing on core markets and activities (Annex I).
Wholesale funding has fallen but about 60 percent of bank assets continue to be funded by
wholesale sources. Banks’ funding costs have increased because of more reliance on
liabilities with longer maturities and the stiff competition for retail deposits. This—coupled
with lower fees and commissions as well as the refocusing on retail banking—implies that
the profitability of Belgian banks is unlikely to return to its pre-crisis level over the medium
term. The sizable deleveraging in many parts of the European banking system could hamper
envisaged asset disposals. Renewed turbulence in European financial markets could further
increase funding costs and involve losses on foreign exposures.
25.
Liquidity conditions have improved, but the authorities should remain flexible to
provide liquidity support in the event of renewed stress. The funding structure of the
Belgian banking system has been rebalanced with a major retreat from more volatile
interbank deposits and an increased focus on deposits by retail customers. ECB financing of
Belgian banks has come down to pre-crisis levels by end-2010. However, the still high
degree of dependency on wholesale funding of some Belgian banks implies that crisis-related
public support to the banking system must be managed flexibly and contingency plans should
be prepared to address a possibility of renewed market tensions (including through swap
lines with other central banks). The authorities need to keep up the pressure on banks to
develop new funding models based upon a sound mix of simpler and more transparent
instruments, and a larger deposit base. Quantitative impact analyses undertaken by the
authorities imply that Belgian banks—similarly to other large European banks—will have to
take substantial measures to comply with the new Basel III liquidity framework. Staff
welcomes the introduction of the stress test liquidity ratio developed by the Banking, Finance

Belgian banks remain vulnerable to potential spillovers from both mature and
CEE markets. Exposures to CEE countries (mainly the Czech Republic, Poland, and
Hungary) and to Ireland (in particular to the real estate sector) reflect the activities of
subsidiaries of Belgian banks in these countries that are to be scaled down with the
implementation of the restructuring plans. The legacy structured products portfolios—
protected by government guarantees—remain sensitive to developments in the U.S. financial
sector. The combined exposures to Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and Spain amounted to
almost 10 percent of bank liabilities (30 percent of GDP) in 2010:Q3, with about a third of
this exposure to sovereign debt (mainly Italy and Spain) and some 40 percent to the non-bank
private sector (mostly Ireland and Spain). With sizable holdings of Belgian sovereign debt
(about 17 percent of GDP), the banks are also exposed to valuation losses on Belgian public
debt instruments.

Continued emphasis on proactive supervision against the backdrop of
institutional change is an important policy priority. The integration of prudential
supervision of licensed financial institutions into the National Bank of Belgium (NBB), now
foreseen to become effective as of April 1, 2011, should facilitate a better understanding of
macro-financial linkages in the Belgian economy, in order to prevent banks from undertaking
excessively risky activities with large externalities. During the transition period, the new

Similarly to the Basel Liquidity Coverage ratio (LCR), the CBFA stress ratio targets 30-day liquidity under a
stressed scenario of liquidity outflows, but with a wider definition of liquid assets and more severe stress
scenarios. See Gestion du risque de liquidité, CBFA Circulaire 2010/21 from September 30, 2010 at
www.cbfa.be/fr/ki/circ/pdf/cbfa_2010_21.pdf . The implementation of the new Basel III liquidity framework
envisaged in 2015 for the LCR will require changes in the calibration of the CBFA stress ratio.

22
Systemic Risks and Systemic Institutions Committee—a joint CBFA and NBB body—has
been responsible for supervision of systemic financial institutions. The remaining challenges
of better integration of micro- and macro-prudential supervision should be addressed while
putting emphasis on intensive and intrusive supervision, close monitoring of cross-border
exposures, and keeping up the pressure on banks to develop transparent organizational
structures. The authorities should also closely coordinate their regular stress testing efforts
with the next round of EU-wide stress tests, based on credible and stringent scenarios, subject
to intensive supervisory scrutiny, and benchmarked against sufficiently high capital levels.
28.
The tightening of banking sector regulation might cause risks to migrate into
other parts of the financial system and the supervisory framework must gear itself to be
able to identify these developments. The new Financial Services and Markets Authority,
separate from the NBB, will remain in charge of the supervision of financial markets (and
related conduct of business rules) and will be given additional functions in consumer
protection of financial products and supervision of certain financial intermediaries (e.g.,
insurance brokers). It is important to set up an effective cooperation and information
exchange between the two new supervisory authorities, including through formalized
cooperation agreements.
29.
Staff welcomes the enactment of a new law that extends the authorities’
intervention powers in the event of a systemic crisis, but more needs to be done to
strengthen resolution mechanisms. The Financial Crisis Law passed in June 2010 gives the
authorities strong powers to act decisively in times of crisis and provides supervisors with
strong political backing for resolving systemic institutions (Annex II). Additional work,
including at the international level, is required to facilitate the timely resolution of complex,
cross-border financial institutions, if needed. In view of the high interconnectedness of the
Belgian financial sector with those in neighboring countries (see Selected Issues Paper,
Chapter 3), continued close cooperation with foreign regulators and central banks, notably
within the EU, is critical to develop a shared understanding of the risk profile and activities
of Belgian financial institutions as well as robust contingency plans.
C. Structural Reforms: Promoting Growth
30.
Increasing Belgium’s potential growth requires steadfast reforms in the labor
market. There is considerable scope to improve labor market outcomes in Belgium in
comparison with some of its euro area peers (Box 4). By increasing the Belgian employment
rate to the euro area average, trend output growth could be increased by about ½ percent per
year over the medium term. In order to expand employment, and thereby lift trend growth
and improve fiscal soundness, the authorities agreed that it is important to step up labor
market reform. To this end, staff encouraged the authorities to:

23
Box 4. Why is Labor Market Performance Better in the Netherlands?
Belgium and the Netherlands are
neighboring small open economies, but labor
market outcomes are strikingly different.
Specifically, Belgium has a higher
unemployment rate, lower labor participation
rate, and longer unemployment duration—
although there is a high degree of regional
disparity, reflecting differences in economic
structures, linguistic skills, and activation
policies.
The gap in labor market performance
between the two countries likely reflects a
confluence of factors:

children with average earnings.



Intensity of activation policies—In the Netherlands, as in Germany, unemployment
compensation is more closely linked to job search activities. In Belgium, activation
policies vary across regions and are typically more proactive in Flanders than elsewhere,
which might partly explain the better labor market outcomes in the region. Overall,
however, the incentives for an unemployed person to search for a job are weaker in
Belgium.



Strictness employment protection legislation. Belgium has stricter employment protection
legislation than the Netherlands, thereby making it more difficult to fire a worker. This, in
turn, increases the risks of hiring in Belgium and makes employers less willing to do so.



Tax wedge—Belgium has a much higher tax burden on wage incomes than the
Netherlands. This effectively lowers the differential between earnings and unemployment
benefits (unemployment trap), thereby reducing incentives to stay on a job for the
employed and to look for a job for the unemployed.

24


Phase out temporary unemployment programs to improve job search incentives
and labor re-allocation during the recovery;



Enhance incentives for individuals to find a job by stepping up the monitoring of
search activities and increasing sanctions on inadequate efforts, including in case
of refusal of suitable employment; expanding job counseling and training
opportunities; gradually limiting the duration of unemployment benefits; and
increasing performance incentives for employment agencies;



Reduce the tax wedge on labor income, in order to increase the differential
between wages and unemployment benefits with a view to enhancing job search
incentives;



Put in place mechanisms that discourage workers to leave the labor force
temporarily or permanently before having reached the legal retirement age; and



Increase labor market participation for younger workers and immigrants by
stepping up targeted language and other training, and reconsidering the
employment protection legislation.

31.
Moderating wage increases and reconsidering automatic wage indexation are
important to strengthen competitiveness. Belgium’s labor costs are high compared to its
peers (Box 5). Staff agrees with the authorities that labor costs need to be kept in line with
those of Belgium’s main euro area trading partners. In this connection it is welcome that
negotiations between unions and employer associations envisage limiting real wage increases
in 2011–12. Staff encourages the authorities to reform the automatic wage indexation
mechanism, including in the public sector, in order to increase the flexibility in wage
negotiations to take account of varying circumstances in different sectors and avoid secondround effects of energy price volatility.
32.
Continued progress in product market reform is necessary for enhancing
competition. Staff welcomes the new law on market practices, which has eased regulation in
the retail sector, and the transposition of the EU Services Directive into Belgian legislation.
Further steps should ensure that the liberalization in the services sector is effectively
implemented. In light of the sensitivity of the Belgian economy to energy price shocks, it is
important to enhance transparency, regulation, and competition in energy markets. The
Competition Council should be provided with sufficient resources and its independence
should be strengthened further. It should be able to conduct independent sectoral analyses,
issue specific competition policy recommendations, and cooperate effectively with sectoral
regulators.

25

Box 5. Why are Labor Costs High in Belgium?
The relatively high labor costs in Belgium have weakened the country’s competitiveness.
Compared to its European peers, notably Germany, Belgium’s unit labor cost has grown faster
in both the private and the public sectors. This partly reflects the inflexible wage negotiation
process, which has resulted in real wage increases that exceeded labor productivity growth.
Belgium’s wage negotiation system is based on two pillars:


Wage norm—This puts an (indicative) upper bound on wage increases, in order to
keep them in line with those in France, Germany, and the Netherlands. The norm is set
by the social partners (or by the government in case of non-agreement) on the basis of
biannual calculations by the Conseil Central de l’Économie (CCE) based on labor cost
developments in the three neighboring countries.



Automatic wage indexation—This effectively puts a lower bound on wage increases
and Belgium is one of the last OECD countries that still use such automatic wage
indexation. The wage indexation is anchored on an adjusted inflation measure known
as the health index, which excludes the prices of tobacco, alcohol, and fuel energy (but
not heating energy).

The inflexibilities inherent to the wage bargaining process have led to several unintended
consequences. The combination of wage indexation and the wage norm fixes a substantial part
of the annual wage growth at the national level, leaving little room for wage negotiations to
take account of varying circumstances in different sectors. Furthermore, the automatic wage
indexation results in considerable second-round effects of energy price hikes. In fact, the exante expected increases of its neighbors have usually been over-estimated and the ex-post
Belgian wage increases have usually been higher than those in its neighbors This has raised
Belgium’s unit labor costs and weakened external competitiveness.

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
The Belgian economy is recovering from the financial crisis and global recession
but the protracted political impasse hampers policy making and compounds post-crisis
vulnerabilities. Economic activity expanded more than foreseen in 2010, the unemployment
rate is stabilizing, and progress was made in bank restructuring. At the same time, the
absence of a new federal government is tying the hands of the authorities in addressing the
important challenges facing the country. With high and rising public debt, the political
stalemate has triggered market concerns. Preserving market confidence in Belgian sovereign
debt is important to avoid adverse debt dynamics and to bolster the banking system.
34.
The near-term outlook is challenging. The Belgian economy is expected to
continue its gradual recovery but real GDP growth is projected to moderate somewhat in
2011, in view of the expected slowdown in the euro area. While the still sizable output gap is
keeping core inflation subdued, headline inflation would remain above target in 2011,
reflecting strong pass-through of rising world prices. Risks, however, are tilted to the
downside. In particular, the Belgian sovereign and banks are vulnerable to contagion from
possible renewed market turmoil in the euro area, which could shake confidence, increase
financing costs, and depress demand. Risks in the banking sector are linked to possible
spillovers from its sizable foreign exposures, asset quality deterioration, and funding shocks.
Possible strains would be amplified by negative feedback loops between sovereign and
banking sector risks.
35.
There is a strong need to adopt a clear and comprehensive strategy to address
macroeconomic policy priorities without delay. It is important to assuage financial market
concerns before policy interest rates are raised from current lows. To this end, early action
should be taken to restore fiscal sustainability, including by initiating reforms in fiscal
federalism arrangements and entitlement programs; strengthen financial sector stability; and
push ahead with structural reforms to create jobs, improve competitiveness, and promote
growth.
36.
Significant efforts are needed to bring down the public debt while dealing with
rising aging costs. Staff supports the authorities’ objective to achieve a balanced budget by
2015. Building on the encouraging 2010 fiscal outcome, the draft 2011 federal budget under
preparation by the caretaker government will appropriately aim at reducing the deficit below
the target under Belgium’s Stability Program. Without a new government, however, the draft
budget would mostly rely on ad hoc measures. Given rising aging-related government
spending, achieving the fiscal objectives for 2012 and beyond will require a structural fiscal
effort of 1 percent of GDP in 2012 and about 0.75 percent of GDP over the medium term at
all levels of government.
37.
Bringing down the public debt requires reforming the fiscal federalism
arrangement and implementing a comprehensive consolidation strategy. It is important

28
that a new state reform strengthens incentives to keep spending in line with trend growth and
ensures the financial viability of the government as a whole. The experience of Belgium’s
past successful fiscal consolidation shows the importance of agreeing on a multiyear budget
framework based on inter-governmental burden-sharing. Adopting a rule-based fiscal
framework would help ensure the credibility of the envisaged consolidation efforts. A new
government should focus on limiting expenditure growth at all levels of government; curbing
the rise in pension costs by increasing the low effective retirement age; and tightening the
healthcare spending norm while strengthening cost-saving incentives. There is also room to
broaden the tax base, improve revenue collection, and reduce tax expenditures.
38.
Bank restructuring is progressing but considerable risks remain. Renewed
financial market turmoil could hamper the envisaged assets disposals, increase funding costs,
and involve losses on foreign exposures. While at present the banking system is wellcapitalized, the authorities need to ensure that banks maintain sufficient capital buffers as the
Basel III regulatory framework is implemented, in order to safeguard adequate credit supply
to the economy. Liquidity conditions in the banks have improved but the authorities should
remain flexible to provide liquidity support in the event of renewed stress. At the same time,
they should encourage banks to develop robust new funding models and take the measures
needed to comply with the new Basel III liquidity framework.
39.
Continued strengthening of financial supervision is an important policy priority.
The integration of micro-and macro-prudential supervision at the central bank is welcome.
This should be accompanied by intensifying supervision, closely monitoring cross-border
exposures, and inducing the banks to develop transparent organizational structures. The
authorities should also coordinate their regular stress testing efforts with the next EU-wide
round. Formalized cooperation agreements between the central bank and the new Financial
Services and Markets Authority should help to identify risks in the financial system as a
whole. The new Financial Crisis Law is an important tool to deal with a systemic crisis but
more needs to be done, including at the international level, to facilitate the timely resolution
of cross-border financial institutions.
40.
Growth-enhancing structural reforms are crucial. In order to expand employment,
and thereby boost growth and improve the public finances, labor market reforms need to be
stepped up. The priorities are to strengthen job search incentives, reduce the tax wedge on
wages, and raise labor market participation. In view of subdued productivity growth, the real
wage moderation envisaged for 2011–12 would help to strengthen competitiveness. To
increase flexibility in wage negotiations and avoid second-round effects of energy price
hikes, the automatic wage indexation should be reconsidered. Further measures are also
needed to strengthen competition in product and services markets. In the energy sector, there
is a need to enhance transparency, regulation, and competition.
41.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Belgium be held on the
regular 12-month cycle.

Annex I. Recent Developments on the Restructuring of Main Belgian Banks
In the aftermath of the financial crisis, the Belgian banking system has initiated a
restructuring process, which has led to a shift in the business model for the three main
banks. The Belgian public authorities acquired ordinary shares of Dexia and Fortis bank
Belgium and subscribed to KBC perpetual Core-Tier 1 securities. The Belgian authorities
have guaranteed illiquid and risky assets of KBC, and illiquid and risky assets of FSA (a
monoline subsidiary of Dexia) were severally guaranteed by France and Belgium. The
authorities financed a defeasance structure that acquired some assets of Fortis before its
takeover. The restructuring at these banks aims at deleveraging, refocusing on core banking
operations, de-risking, and strengthening domestic retail franchises. As beneficiaries of state
aid, the restructuring plans of KBC and Dexia were approved by the European Commission
which imposed a number of restructuring requirements. Specifically,


Dexia accelerated its deleveraging program in 2010. A total of euro 26 billion of
bonds and loans has already been sold in the first 10 months of 2010, after a total sale
of euro 18 billion in 2009 (with only a small discount to nominal value). The
divestment program is also under way, with the sale of the U.S. subsidiary FSA
insurance closed in July 2009—benefitting from the guarantee by the Belgian and
French states on commitments by Dexia under the put option for the buyer—and
stakes in Dexia Crediop and Dexia Sabadell to be disposed by end-2012 and end2013, respectively. Its reliance on short term wholesale funding and central bank
borrowing fell to about 1⁄5 of its balance sheet total. The group only collects retail
deposits in Belgium and Luxembourg. Against this background, Dexia has fully
exited state guarantees on funding (provided severally by Belgium, France, and
Luxembourg) as of end-June 2010 with some euro 45 billion of guaranteed bonds
outstanding as of 2010:Q3. The bank returned to profitability in 2009 and 2010. Its
Tier 1 capital ratio stood at 13.1 percent and its core Tier 1 ratio at 12.1 percent at
end-2010.



KBC has an option to buy back the securities subscribed by the federal government
and the Flemish region (euro 7 billion) at 150 percent of issue price by 2013, which is
to be financed through asset disposals/IPOs (including, among others, a disposal of its
private banking subsidiary KBL, divestments of its banking and insurance
subsidiaries in Belgium (Centea and Fidea), and its consumer finance bank Zagiel in
Poland, and a partial IPO of the bank’s Czech subsidiary CSOB). A total of euro 39
billion of risk-weighted assets (25 percent of the balance sheet total) have been
earmarked for sale in 2009–13 with more than half of this amount achieved by mid2010 (euro 21 billion), taking into account the 2010 sale of KBL, which has not yet
been finalized, however. In addition, the restructuring plan also included putting
KBC’s financial structured products in run-off status. After exceptional losses in 2009
related to its derivative positions—that are covered by an asset insurance scheme

38
from the Belgian state—losses on financial instruments booked at fair value
decreased substantially in 2010 and the bank has shown net profits starting from mid2009. At end-2010, KBC’s Tier 1 capital ratio stood at 12.6 percent and the core Tier
1 ratio at 10.9 percent.


Fortis bank has been acquired by BNP Paribas in May 2009. The restructuring
entailed the transfer of toxic assets to a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and
reorganization of trading activities within the BNP Paribas structure. Restructuring is
concentrated on deleveraging of the loan book; runoff and divestment of the
investment, private equity and hedge fund portfolios; and re-focusing on the core
banking business in Belgium. By 2010:Q3 BNPP-Fortis’ loan book exposure had
fallen by 38 percent, and its capital markets bond portfolio by 65 percent. The
corporate loan book has been transferred to BNP Paribas with Fortis refocusing on
SME and retail business. The bank has more than doubled its operating income in the
first nine months of 2010 compared to 2009, and its Tier 1 capital ratio reached
14.8 percent by mid-2010.

39
Annex II. Belgium Bank Resolution Framework and Changes Introduced by the
Financial Crisis Law of June 2, 2010
The CBFA has a broad range of remedial powers enshrined in the Banking Act. A
special inspector can be appointed by the CBFA and a purchase and assumption transaction
(P&A) is enabled by the Credit Institutions Law. The Credit Institutions Law also offers
powers to split banks, while it ensures that institutions whose license has been revoked
remain subject to the Credit Institutions Law and supervision until all funds collected from
the public have been reimbursed.
The Financial Crisis Law of June 2, 2010, introduced a special resolution regime for
banks, insurance companies, and settlement institutions designed for systemic crises.7 A
systemic crisis is defined as a situation where failure of a financial institution could affect the
stability of the Belgian or international financial system because of (i) the volume of deposits
of a credit institution, its importance for the functioning of the credit market or its role in the
financial system; (ii) the volume of the liabilities of an insurance company or its role in the
financial system; or (iii) when a settlement institution is concerned. When these conditions
are fulfilled, the King may by decree (discussed in the Council of Ministers) either at the
CBFA’s request or on His own initiative, and having received an opinion from the
supervisor, adopt any act of disposal, in favour of the State or any other person or entity,
whether Belgian or foreign, public or private, and in particular any act of transfer, sale or
contribution relating to the following:


Assets, liabilities or one or more areas of activity and, more generally, all or part of
the rights and obligations of the institution concerned; and



Securities or shares issued by the financial institution.

Upon notification of the Royal decree, the financial institution looses the power to dispose
freely of the assets covered by the acts of disposal laid down in the Royal decree.
In line with the strong shareholder and creditor preference inherent in the EU
Convention of Human Rights, the Royal decree has to define the compensation to be
paid to the owners of the assets or the holders of the rights covered by the act of
disposal. The application of this procedure is subject to a judicial review guided by a second
law passed on June 2, 2010. The court rules on the lawfulness of the act and the adequacy of
7

Loi visant à compléter les mesures de redressement applicables aux entreprises relevant du secteur bancaire
et financier and Loi complétant, en ce qui concerne les voies de recours, la loi du 2 juin 2010 visant à
compléter les mesures de redressement applicables aux entreprises relevant du secteur bancaire et financier,
both published in Belgisch Staatsblad/Moniteur Belge of June 14, 2010.

40
the compensation. This Law obliges the court to take into account the situation of the
financial institution at the moment of the act of disposition and in particular considers what
its financial situation would have been if it had not, directly or indirectly, received public aid,
emergency liquidity assistance or public guarantees. The Law excludes any appeal against
this judgment.
The potential delays (up to 27 days) for obtaining the Court judgment, publication of
which perfects the resolution transaction vis-à-vis third parties, can adversely affect
financial stability. Prompt action is paramount when dealing with a systemic situation. Staff
advised the authorities to analyze why such long delays were deemed necessary and
investigate ways to shorten the process while striking a balance between speed and legal
certainty.

Exchange Rate Arrangements



Belgium’s currency is the euro, which floats freely and independently against other
currencies.



Belgium has accepted the obligations under Article VIII and maintains an exchange
system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international
transactions, except for restrictions maintained solely for security reasons. These
measures are established by European Union regulations and have been notified to the
Fund pursuant to Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51).

FSAP Participation:

FSAP Assessment

IMF Country Report No. 06/75

Summary: The report concluded that Belgium’s financial system is resilient and benefits from a
number of Belgium-specific features that help stability. These include a traditionally cautious
attitude toward risk by banks, large holdings of government securities, extremely low holdings of
equity by banks, a stable source of funding benefiting from generous tax incentives, a high
standard of banking supervision, and a stable macroeconomic policy framework. Overall,
supervision showed a high degree of compliance with international standards. Near-term
vulnerability appears low, reflecting the soundness of the dominant banking system, the
generally benign financial environment, the strong financial condition of the corporate sector,
and the relatively healthy financial position of the household sector. Financial institutions were
found to withstand an adverse macroeconomic stress well, helped in part by the beneficial
diversification in the bancassurance model.

4
The 2005 Mutual Evaluation Report on the Assessment of Anti-Money Laundering and
Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) measures prepared by the Financial Action
Task Force (FATF) indicates that Belgium’s AML/CFT framework applicable to financial
institutions is comprehensive and broadly compliant with FATF standards in this area.
Notwithstanding the strengths of the Belgian financial sector, a number of issues emerged from
the FSAP. The heavy exposure abroad, the open nature of the economy, and the importance of
the Euroclear Group globally, made the domestic financial system potentially vulnerable to
global economic developments and financial contagion. Risks remained and may increase with a
downturn in the business cycle, increased cross-border operations, and deeper links with the
global money centers. In line with the 2005 FSAP recommendations, the supervisory framework
has been strengthened. The Banking, Finance, and Insurance Commission’s (CBFA)
management committee has been streamlined and synergies between the CBFA and the National
Bank of Belgium (NBB) have been further developed. Regular stress tests have helped promote a
systematic dialogue between supervisory authorities and market participants, while detailed
procedures for financial crisis management have been tested. Prudential supervision of the
insurance sector has been upgraded and regulation of the pension funds sector reinforced.

ANNEX II. BELGIUM: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Belgium’s economic and financial statistics are adequate for surveillance purposes. The
National Bank of Belgium (NBB) regularly publishes a full range of economic and financial
data and provides calendar dates of main statistical releases. On-line access to these
comprehensive databases is facilitated by the NBB’s data search engine, Belgostat. Belgium
is a SDDS subscriber. Statistics for International Financial Statistics on banking institutions
and monetary aggregates are prepared on a monthly basis and are timely.
Belgium adopted the European System of Integrated Economic Accounts 1995 (ESA95)
in 1999. Revisions of national accounts started in November 2005 to comply with
EUROSTAT requirements and prepare for the adoption of chain-linked national accounts
statistics. Unlike in other countries, the NBB is responsible for compiling national accounts
statistics. Quarterly accounts are published within a lag of three months. Both annual and
quarterly accounts data are of good quality, with shortcomings mainly related to export and
import deflators, which are based on unit values, rather than prices collected directly from
exporters and importers.
General government revenue, expenditure, and balance on an accrual basis (ESA95) are
published annually. The NBB publishes monthly data on central government operations and
quarterly data on general government operations since April 2007.
The overall quality and availability of financial indicators are good. The authorities are
providing quarterly updates of financial sector indicators (FSIs) in a timely manner.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
BELGIUM
Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2010 Consultation with Belgium
Approved by Ajai Chopra and Jan Kees Martijn
March 22, 2011
1.
This supplement provides an update of economic and policy developments since
the release of the staff report (SM/11/48, March 9, 2011). The thrust of the staff appraisal
remains unchanged.
2.
Recent data confirm a continuing gradual recovery. Industrial production in
December 2010 had increased by about 8 percent from the trough a year ago and the
unemployment rate in the fourth quarter fell to 8.2 percent. The National Bank’s
February 2011 business barometer for the manufacturing sector, construction industry, and
trade-related services marked its eighth consecutive monthly increase. While business
confidence further improved in early 2011, consumer confidence deteriorated in March
probably due to the persistent rise in oil prices. Annual headline inflation remained elevated
at above 3 percent in January–February, reflecting higher energy prices.
3.
The caretaker government has prepared a draft federal budget for 2011 that
aims to reduce the overall fiscal deficit to 3.6 percent of GDP. The draft budget is based
on projected real GDP growth of 2 percent in 2011, and would bring the deficit considerably
below the target under Belgium’s Stability Program (4.1 percent of GDP). The additional
effort undertaken by the federal government and social security consists of spending
restraint, including in healthcare, and a variety of revenue measures, including an increase of
excise taxes on tobacco products. Based on preliminary information, staff estimates the
structural adjustment effort at all levels of government in 2011 at about 0.5 percent of GDP.
4.
The caretaker government has also adopted a package of labor market measures
for 2011–12 that is based on the inter-professional negotiations between unions and
employer organizations. The key measures consist of a real wage freeze in 2011 and a
moderate wage increase of 0.3 percent in 2012, as well as measures to mitigate the
unemployment trap for low-wage workers and lower firing costs for white-collar workers.
The real wage moderation decided for 2011–12 will help to strengthen competitiveness of the
Belgian economy.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Belgium
On March 23, 2011 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Belgium. 1
Background
The Belgian economy is recovering from the financial crisis and global recession. Economic
activity expanded more than foreseen in 2010, the unemployment rate is stabilizing, and
progress was made in bank restructuring. But the absence of a new federal government delays
addressing important long-term challenges facing the country.
The Belgian economy is expected to continue its gradual recovery but real GDP growth is
projected to moderate somewhat in 2011, in view of the expected slowdown in the euro area.
While the still sizable output gap is keeping core inflation subdued, headline inflation would
remain above target in 2011, reflecting strong pass-through of rising world oil prices.
Fiscal consolidation started in 2010, and the overall fiscal deficit was reduced from 6 percent of
GDP in 2009 to 4.6 percent in 2010. Building on this encouraging outcome, the caretaker
government has prepared a draft federal budget for 2011 that aims at reducing the overall
deficit to 3.6 percent of GDP in 2011, below the target under Belgium’s Stability Program
(4.1 percent of GDP). With the sub-national budgets already adopted, the adjustment burden in

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summing ups can be found here:

2011 will fall on the federal government and social security. The additional effort undertaken
consists of spending restraint, including in healthcare, and a variety of revenue measures,
including an increase of excise taxes on tobacco products. In order to restore fiscal
sustainability, the authorities appropriately aim to reduce the overall deficit to 3 percent of GDP
by 2012 and achieve a balanced budget by 2015. Given rising aging-related government
spending, realizing their fiscal objectives will require a structural fiscal effort of about ¾ percent
of GDP over the medium term at all levels of government.
Conditions in Belgium’s financial system have improved. The banking sector is still in the midst
of significant restructuring. Deleveraging in the banking sector continued, and the banks saw a
return to net profitability in the second half of 2009 and 2010. The integration of prudential
supervision of licensed financial institutions into the National Bank of Belgium (NBB) is now
foreseen to become effective as of April 1, 2011. The Financial Crisis Law passed in June 2010
gives the authorities strong powers to act decisively in times of crisis and provides supervisors
with strong political backing for resolving systemic institutions.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for advancing fiscal consolidation and restoring
confidence in the financial sector. To build on this progress, Directors underscored the need for
a better articulated strategy to address macroeconomic policy priorities. Further efforts are
necessary to bring down public debt relative to GDP, safeguard financial sector stability, and
intensify structural reforms to boost potential growth, create jobs, and enhance competitiveness.
Directors welcomed the 2011 draft budget, which targets a more ambitious reduction of the
overall deficit than that envisaged under the Stability Program, and supported the authorities’
objective of a balanced budget by 2015. Achieving these objectives will require, however, a
strong fiscal adjustment, including limits on spending growth at all government levels, further
reform of the pension system, and a slower expansion of health care expenditure. There is
also some room to broaden the tax base, improve revenue collection, and reduce tax
expenditures. Directors also recommended a review of the current arrangement for fiscal
devolution so that spending is kept in line with trend growth, as well as the adoption of a multiyear fiscal framework based on clear rules and inter-governmental burden-sharing.
Directors noted that bank restructuring is progressing well, the banking system is well
capitalized, and liquidity conditions are improving. Nevertheless, considerable risks remain,
calling for continued vigilance and contingency planning. In particular, measures to ensure that
banks are in compliance with the new regulatory framework should remain on top of the policy
agenda, while maintaining flexibility in providing liquidity support in the event of renewed stress.
Directors welcomed the integration of micro- and macro-prudential supervision at the central
bank and the enactment of the new Financial Crisis Law. Further efforts should focus on

3
identifying risks in the financial sector as a whole, strengthening coordination with supervisory
agencies within the European Union, and facilitating the timely resolution of cross-border
financial institutions.
Directors saw a need to reinvigorate labor market reforms, in particular strengthening job search
incentives, reducing the tax wedge on wages, and raising labor market participation. They
regarded the recent adoption of a labor market package as a welcome step toward wage
moderation. Further flexibility in wage-setting would help enhance competitiveness, as would a
review of the wage indexation mechanism to take account of productivity developments.
Directors recommended enhancing the independence of the Competition Authority and
improving transparency and regulation in energy markets.
