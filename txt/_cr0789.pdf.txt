Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Sound policies have underpinned Belgium’s recent favorable economic performance, but
their further strengthening is necessary to meet the challenges posed by globalization,
aging, fiscal federalism, and the increasing complexity of the financial sector. There is
general recognition that fiscal consolidation and further labor market reforms are key
ingredients of the solution, but the authorities anticipate a lengthy process of consensusbuilding and gradual action. In the staff’s view, speed, depth, and coordination of policy
implementation across all levels of government need to be stepped up.
Barring major shocks to the international environment, economic growth is projected to slow
from nearly 3 percent in 2006 to a robust 2.2 percent in 2007. Labor unions, employers, and the
authorities agreed that the trend erosion in competitiveness had to be halted and that the
stubbornly high unemployment rate called for wage moderation and strict execution of the
Generation Pact.
The financial system has gained further resilience, and supervisors have made major strides in
improving the already high quality of supervision in line with the recommendations of the
2005 FSAP. The trend toward internationalization of financial institutions and their expansion
in nontraditional areas is modifying the systemic risk profile of the financial system.
Supervisors acknowledged that they will have to sharpen the focus of their resources on these
developments and underscored the need for international cooperation.
Consistent with the strategy to deal with aging, the 2007 budget sets in motion the muchneeded buildup of fiscal surpluses, though some additional measures are likely to be required
to achieve the target. Moreover, medium-term consolidation objectives will have to be more
ambitious than envisaged and backed by a specific strategy of expenditure restraint. There
was agreement that revising fiscal federalism arrangements had become a priority and that
fiscal institutions had to be strengthened. Following the Generation Pact, there is no appetite
for the more comprehensive package of labor market reforms recommended by the staff.

I. INTRODUCTION1
1.
Fiscal consolidation, job creation, and further strengthening of financial
supervision are policy priorities for Belgium. They correspond to the challenges of dealing
with rising aging costs and fiscal federalism, taking full advantage of the global expansion,
and adapting supervision to an increasingly complex and internationally-oriented financial
sector. Overall, the economy has performed well, and policy objectives have been in line
with Fund recommendations, but implementation has lacked determination in some key areas
(Box 1). Hence, following the mid-2007 elections, a decisive strengthening of policies will
be crucial to preserve high living standards and an adequate social security system.
Box 1. Effectiveness of the Policy Dialogue
The authorities agree that policies should focus on raising employment rates and achieving fiscal
consolidation. Implementation of Fund recommendations has been slow and remains incomplete, partly
because the scope and speed of reform are constrained by the long-standing tradition of consensusbuilding and the complex federal structure of government. The authorities see continuous and
comprehensive engagement of the Fund as key to its effectiveness.
Fiscal policy
Fund recommendations: reduce primary spending growth durably to achieve the authorities’ twin
objectives of fiscal consolidation and tax reduction; adopt a multi-year expenditure-based framework to
lock in fiscal adjustment; revise the fiscal federalism arrangements and reinforce fiscal institutions,
including the internal stability pact and the High Council of Finance (HCF).
Policy developments: the budget has been balanced or in surplus since 20001 with public debt steadily
falling as a share of GDP. However, interest savings have been used for tax cuts and spending hikes,
leading to an erosion of the primary surplus. Primary spending growth remains too high for
consolidation. The authorities continue to focus on achieving nominal balance targets. The HCF has
resumed its work.
Labor and product market reforms
Fund recommendations: phase out early retirement arrangements, modify the wage-bargaining
framework, shorten the duration of unemployment benefits, and enforce job search requirements; in
product markets, continue deregulation and liberalization.
Policy developments: reforms have relied mostly on active labor market programs, but recently,
employment services have been strengthened. The Generation Pact set out measures to raise employment
of the young and old. Social partners prefer maintaining the central wage-bargaining framework, but
some flexibility has become acceptable. Product market reforms are proceeding along EU timelines, and
the administrative burden was reduced appreciably.
Financial sector
Fund recommendations: the 2005 FSAP recommended adapting supervisory arrangements to changing
market developments, enhancing macro-prudential supervision and cooperation between the central bank
and supervisors, upgrading insurance supervision, and strengthening pension supervision earnestly.
Policy developments: most of the recommendations have been implemented.

II. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
2.
The economic upturn that started in mid-2005 has
remained on track. On the heels of a catch-up in private
investment, the revival of private consumption and the
cyclical expansion in neighboring countries have broadened
the recovery to all sectors of the economy and allowed
growth to become more balanced in 2006 (Table 1).2 Owing
to more robust private and public consumption, growth has
been exceeding that of key trading partners (Figure 1), and
the economy is now operating near capacity.

with the euro area, after faster growth.

3.
Underlying inflation has been stable and broadly
in line with the euro area average. Deviations have been
due to administrative price changes and recently to
a methodological revision (Figure 2).3 Headline inflation has
been more volatile, reflecting the higher weight of energy
prices, with the decline in the latter pushing it toward
2 percent at end-2006. Inflationary pressures from
widespread wage indexation have been muted: the relevant
index rose by only 1.7 percent in 2006, as it largely excludes
energy prices and benefited from the correction of a previous
upward bias.
4.
Monetary conditions have been supportive, while
fiscal policy turned procyclical in 2006 (Figure 3). Despite
some real appreciation and interest rate hikes, monetary
conditions have remained accommodating, only recently
reaching their long-run average. With the cycle typically well
attuned to the euro area average, interest rates set by the ECB
have been suitable from Belgium’s perspective. Guided by
nominal targets, fiscal policy imparted an impulse of almost
1 percentage point of GDP in 2006, as growth surprised on
the upside. While acknowledging the small fiscal multiplier,
owing to the highly open nature of the economy, and the
confidence-enhancing effect of sustained achievement of
fiscal targets, the staff saw this as a key factor underpinning

the strength of activity. The authorities, though, felt that their
policy of tax cuts in a balanced budget environment had been
more important.
5.
Buoyant house prices have bolstered residential
investment and supported household spending (Figure 4).
Residential real estate prices registered double-digit growth
in 2005, for the second consecutive year, but the market has
cooled since then, with realtor associations expecting the
pace of increases to be halved in 2006.4 While a strong
housing market is a feature common to many euro area
countries, domestic factors have been adding exuberance:
the 2004 fiscal amnesty led to a repatriation of assets that
were invested in secondary residences, and reduced
transaction costs and strengthened fiscal incentives for firsthome purchases boosted family house prices from 2005
onward. Some indicators (e.g., the ratio of disposable income
over monthly mortgage payments) suggest a slight
overvaluation of the market since end-2005, but the price
level remains below that of neighboring countries. The
impact on activity has been felt through residential
construction and mortgage refinancing, as the household
savings rate has remained stable for the past three years.
6.
At odds with developments elsewhere in the euro
area, the unemployment rate has not declined
significantly (Figures 5 and 6). Comparatively faster labor
force growth, high relative labor costs, and less wage
moderation seem to be the underlying culprits, though labor
unions saw a lack of training and a less dynamic structure of
production as equally important factors. All job creation
since mid-2005, which has not lagged much compared to
previous cycles, has been in the nontradable sectors, with
losses in industry not quite matched by gains in construction.
More labor hoarding and the fitful start to the current
recovery appear to have dampened the cyclicality of
unemployment. Finally, a recent tightening of job search
requirements—

which has reduced the administrative unemployment
rate slightly—seems to have spurred more people into
active job search, but the authorities agreed that it was
too early to declare success.
7.
While judging its current level to be
appropriate, all agreed that competitiveness should
not be allowed to erode further (Figure 7). As the
authorities underscored, developments in relative unit
labor costs and market share volumes were similar to
elsewhere, except in Germany. Current account and
trade surpluses had been sustained, with their recent
decline mainly the result of adverse terms of trade
effects. The economy has remained attractive to foreign
investors because of progress in reducing business
regulation and corporate income taxation. In addition,
model-based estimates suggest that the current exchange
rate is not overvalued. Nonetheless, with labor costs
(and productivity) among the highest in the world, and
several manufacturing sectors wilting under competitive
pressure, the authorities and social partners agreed that
wage moderation would be essential going forward.
8.
Export volume shares have fallen
appreciably, but value shares have held up well
(Figure 8). Even though exporters do not seem to have
comparatively greater pricing power, given the
preponderance of standardized products, price deflators
for exports (and to a lesser extent, imports) appear to be
consistently outpacing those of trading partners
(Figure 9). There is also no evidence that the product
structure has been shifting toward higher value-added
products. This raises suspicions of a statistical bias in
the price-volume breakdown of trade, whose correction
would, however, not materially alter the assessment of
overall performance.
9.
Against this background, economic growth is
expected to slow but maintain a robust pace. The
authorities and the staff project GDP growth to decline
from nearly 3 percent in 2006 to 2.2 percent in 2007,
as rising interest rates dampen demand, residential
construction eases from its recent sustained vigorous pace,

the fiscal stance turns restrictive, and the global environment softens. With good profitability
and high capacity utilization rates, private investment should remain strong, but—after its
substantial catch-up during 2004–05—will register slower growth. There was agreement that
abrupt euro appreciation associated with a disorderly resolution of global imbalances and a
sharper-than-expected U.S. slowdown constitute key downside risks, and that the German
economy could go either way from the baseline projecting a slowing associated with an
increase in the VAT rate.5 On the domestic front, residential construction could surprise on
the upside. Inflation is projected to reach nearly 2 percent in 2007, in part due to mid-year
indirect tax increases.
III. FINANCIAL SYSTEM
10.
Households are benefiting from the ongoing
financial deepening. They are adding about 2 percent of
GDP per year to their large stock of net financial assets,
which are generally viewed as retirement savings since
specific third pillar pension savings vehicles are only
beginning to emerge. In search of return, households have
been increasing their claims on institutional investors.
This shift has been accompanied by a rise in the risks
borne by households and fostered by a larger supply of
more flexible mutual fund and insurance products, and
a rise in the taxation of income from securities. On the
liability side, mortgage credit, the largest household
source of credit, has been steadily growing since the
late 1980s, recently boosted by low interest rates and the
booming house market (Figure 10). Banks have allowed
households to swiftly take advantage of changes in the
level and term structure of interest rates (Figure 11).
They have introduced new instruments with different risk
and price profiles, but there is no evidence of any
loosening of lending standards.

11.
Corporate deleveraging is continuing, with the
financial sector intermediating the shift toward equity
finance (Figure 12). As elsewhere, profit margins of
nonfinancial corporations have risen, generating the internal
funds needed to finance the upswing in investment.
Concurrently, recourse to external financing has increasingly
taken the form of equity issues, slightly more than in other
countries, as a duty on new equity issues was eliminated and
an allowance for corporate equity (ACE) instituted.
Consequently, debt financing turned negative in 2005 for the
first time in several years, and equity issuance skyrocketed
in 2006. Venture capital seems to be in sufficient supply but
remains undersized as the economy is insufficiently geared
toward innovation and small entrepreneurship.
12.
The trend toward internationalization of financial
institutions has been accelerating, while banks are
expanding in nontraditional areas. No doubt, the fact that
two of the four largest banks are cross-border institutions is
a driving factor, but other banks are also raising their
exposures abroad, especially to Central and Eastern Europe.
The share of domestic customers has fallen to about one third
of bank assets, and lending to non-euro area residents has
been one of the fastest growing activities (Figure 13). At
present, half of the corporate loans are to residents outside of
the euro area. In addition, banks have branched out into
energy trading and have been engaging increasingly with
hedge funds, mostly on behalf of clients and with transfer of
collateral so that their capital at risk in these operations has
remained limited.
13.
The financial system has remained stable and
highly profitable, liquid, and solvent (Figure 14,
Tables 2–4). Benefiting from a benign risk environment, low
interest rates and effervescent equity markets, bank-insurance
groups are experiencing high returns on assets and equity, in
part due to historically low levels of provisioning and
nonperforming loans. Banks remain well capitalized with risk
asset ratios reaching close to 12 percent in mid-2006.
Solvency and coverage ratios of insurance companies and
pension funds have been increasing due to exceptional

Stress tests conducted by the Financial Stability Committee show the system to be resilient to
plausible shocks, confirming the findings of the 2005 financial stability assessment by the
IMF (FSAP).6
14.
In line with the FSAP recommendations, the unified supervisor (CBFA) and the
central bank (NBB) have been substantially improving the quality of supervision, from
an already high level. In particular, regulations and supervision in banking, insurance,
securities, payments, and settlement have been fully aligned with international standards,
pension fund and insurance supervision upgraded, and internal controls and operation of the
CBFA and cooperation between the CBFA and the NBB improved. The staff urged the
authorities to accelerate the envisaged on-site exams of pension funds and conduct more
outreach on the new pension law. The authorities acknowledged these points as well as the
need to further exploit the synergies between the CBFA and the NBB.
15.
Looking ahead, it was agreed that supervisors need to adapt to the changing
systemic risk profile of the bank-insurance groups. Given resource constraints, the staff
called for a risk-based approach to the allocation of management and staff resources at the
CBFA. The authorities saw merit in this suggestion but felt that reputational and legal
considerations required a continuous and comprehensive engagement with firms of lesser
systemic importance. Beyond improving international cooperation through memoranda of
understanding with foreign supervisors, the authorities argued for the establishment of an
international tier to supervision for regionally and globally systemic institutions. In this
context, they remain committed to addressing the international dimension of crisis
management, including solvency issues, and to proactively securing a high level of
engagement with international partners on the Euroclear payments and settlement system.
IV. DEALING WITH AGING AND GLOBALIZATION7
16.
The authorities and the public generally recognize that meeting the challenge of
aging in the context of globalization requires a comprehensive strategy, but in the
staff’s view, speed, depth, and specificity of policy implementation are lagging. The key
components of the authorities’ strategy consist of fiscal consolidation to benefit from interest
savings associated with a declining public debt burden, and a sharp increase in employment
rates. On both counts, the authorities have made good progress, but success is still distant,
and key opportunities have not been exploited (Box 2). Achieving balanced budgets or small

surpluses for seven years in a row has established fiscal credibility, but interest savings have
been used for spending and tax reductions (Table 5). The authorities felt that this strategy had
been necessary to secure the recent good performance of the economy. Similarly, while the
labor market reforms of the Generation Pact represent a breakthrough in awareness, they will
not significantly lift employment rates above demographic trends. All agree with the need for
further reforms, but the authorities anticipate a lengthy process of consensus-building and
gradual action.
17.
Addressing the projected rise in aging-related costs requires a mix of fiscal
adjustment, growth-enhancing policies, and entitlement reforms (Box 3). Without these
reforms or with only the fiscal adjustment as envisaged in the 2006 Stability Program
Update, public debt dynamics are unsustainable. Indeed, aging-related expenditure is
projected to increase by 5.8 percent of GDP by 2050, even with the employment rate rising
by 7.5 percentage points.
A. Fiscal Policy and Institutions
18.
After being strongly procyclical in 2006, fiscal policy will tighten in 2007,
arresting the trend decline in the primary surplus. With higher-than-expected growth and
substantial one-off measures, balancing the budget in 2006 represents a structural weakening
by about 1 percent of GDP. Conversely, the 2007 budget aims for a structural improvement
of 0.6 percent of GDP, and recourse to one-off measures is being reduced. However, with
revenue projections somewhat optimistic, the staff sees a remaining gap of about 0.3 percent
of GDP (Text Table), which it urged the authorities to close with durable measures. The

Box 3. Aging and Fiscal Sustainability
Between 2005 and 2050, total net aging costs are expected to rise by 5.8 percent of GDP. To
deal with this issue, the authorities plan to build up fiscal surpluses and implement growth and

the medium term, allowing a reduction
of the public debt-to-GDP ratio to 65 percent, but rising costs of aging are not offset in the long
run. Under this scenario, the public debt-to-GDP ratio would increase without bound.

14

Box 3. Aging and Fiscal Sustainability (concluded)
Adjustment without reform. In addition to the baseline, upfront fiscal adjustment is
implemented to reach the staff-recommended surplus of 1.8 percent of GDP by 2012 and
then sustain it through 2018. This would significantly reduce the debt ratio initially to
a low of 30 percent of GDP by 2028, but thereafter, rising costs of aging begin to
dominate. Indeed, the interest savings obtained in this strategy are insufficient to cover
the costs of aging, and indebtedness would again rise without bound, though later and at
a slower pace than in the baseline.
SCA scenario. Annual labor productivity growth is assumed to be 1.7 percent, consistent
with TFP growth of 1.1 percent (which corresponds to the estimate of the EU15’s TFP
growth during 1970–2004). Further, capital deepening of 0.6 percent of GDP is
assumed, and structural reforms are expected to boost the employment rate by
2.5 percentage points above the baseline, which allows employment to grow by
0.1 percent per year during the projection period. Fiscal adjustment follows the path
outlined in the 2006 Stability Program Update to reach a surplus of 1.5 percent by 2013.
This scenario comes close to achieving fiscal sustainability and brings the public debt-toGDP ratio down to about 20 percent of GDP by 2030. However, aging costs continue to
rise appreciably until 2050, by which time the public debt ratio will have resumed an
upward trend.
Constant steady-state debt. This purist scenario derives the reforms needed to ensure that
the public debt ratio becomes constant when the dependency ratio stabilizes in 2050.
This would require additional structural reforms to yield an extra ¼ percent of labor
productivity growth per year.
In sum, while the parameters of these scenarios are subject to considerable uncertainty,
the values retained by the SCA for some of them (notably labor productivity growth and
the timing and impact of structural reforms) seem to be on the sanguine side. In addition,
given the already high capital-labor ratio, assuming further capital deepening may not be
justified. However, small entitlement reforms to reduce the projected increase in the cost
of aging would insure against the risk of other structural reforms yielding insufficient
benefits.

authorities disputed this assessment while emphasizing their intention to take any necessary
additional measures in the context of the quarterly reviews of budget implementation.
General government spending is set to grow marginally slower than GDP, while federal
government expenditure is much tighter. Conversely, regional authorities, which have little
or no debt and an increasing share of revenue, are set to ramp up spending.
19.
The authorities remain committed to prefunding a significant share of agingrelated costs. The budget surplus is expected to rise gradually to 1.1 percent of GDP

15
in 2011. However, the HCF is preparing new long-term projections that suggest that more
effort is needed to ensure sustainability and that complete prefinancing is not realistic. The
staff therefore argued for building up the surplus to 1.5 percent of GDP by 2011 and further
beyond this date, in evenly-paced annual adjustments; implementing some additional pension
reforms; and more vigorously pursuing productivity-enhancing reforms (Table 6). This
approach takes into account the Belgian society’s strong preference for intergenerational
fairness in the face of an onset of aging earlier than in many other countries and a realistic
estimate of the contribution of other structural reforms to the resolution of the aging problem.
The authorities accepted that medium-term fiscal consolidation would have to be more
ambitious than envisaged in the 2005 stability program update but felt that they could spread
the adjustment further in time.
20.
Without a specific medium-term strategy to reduce expenditure, backed by
a solid consensus, the planned fiscal adjustment may fail to materialize. Year-to-year
achievement of nominal targets has been relying on one-off operations to balance the books,
diverting attention from reforms that would yield durable and increasing savings (e.g., the
streamlining of operations of different levels of government, an increase in efficiency of the
civil service utilizing natural attrition, a reduction in subsidies, elimination of early
retirement schemes, and instauration of a time limit on unemployment benefits). The
authorities noted that the complete spending autonomy of the regions constituted an obstacle.
They were receptive to a more universal move to performance-based budgeting to improve
the overall efficiency of the public sector.
21.
Faster progress in curbing spending and reforming labor markets would render
recent tax reforms more effective in promoting employment and investment. Cuts in
social security contributions have only recently begun to lower labor costs, mainly in sectors
under strong competitive pressure. Shifts from income taxes to indirect taxes have been
increasing incentives to work and will benefit the environment, but—through the universal
practice of wage indexation—have been pushing up wage demands and the public wage bill,
thus slowing job creation. The introduction of an allowance for corporate equity (ACE) will
diminish distortions8 but had to be accompanied by revenue-increasing measures to offset its
budgetary impact and will promote investment more in capital- than in labor-intensive
sectors. The authorities emphasized that the ACE would positively impact employment as
well, though it might lead to short-term revenue loss. Noting that effective corporate taxes
were already among the lowest in the world and that production was already very capital
intensive, the staff saw merit in a more determined reduction of the tax wedge on labor—one
of the highest by international standards.
22.
The revision of fiscal federalism arrangements has become a priority. Imbalances
embedded in these arrangements are widening rapidly. Specifically, regional entities are
8

The ACE is estimated to lower the effective corporate tax rate by 4 percentage points.

16
experiencing rapid revenue growth due to increased transfers stemming from the parameters
built into these arrangements, but they have no real incentive to save these increases. In this
context, the authorities welcomed the staff’s call for an urgent revision of the arrangements
and for increased accountability and better coordination of fiscal and other economic policies
among all levels of government. Choices on this sensitive issue are ultimately political. To
inform the debate, the staff saw a need for improving the availability of budget information
at the regional level.
23.
Against this background, a further strengthening of the fiscal framework and
fiscal institutions will be essential. While recognizing the merits of an expenditure-based
framework, the authorities felt confident that setting medium-term tax policy and nominal
budget objectives would suffice to control spending, while an expenditure framework would
be cumbersome to coordinate. They agreed that a stronger internal stability pact among
levels of government was necessary and that the HCF, which had resumed its activities after
an inopportune lapse, would need to step up its role. In particular, the staff emphasized the
HCF’s mandate to assess compliance with stability programs and intergovernmental
agreements on budget targets, which could usefully be complemented by an ex ante
evaluation of the budgets of the various layers of government.
B. Employment Creation and Productivity Growth
24.
Low participation and high structural
unemployment signal labor market rigidities. While
the upward trend in employment rates is set to continue,
it will contribute only two thirds of the increase needed
to validate the authorities’ fiscal sustainability scenario.
The measures of the Generation Pact are likely to raise
the employment rate by a further 1 percentage point out
of the required 2½ percentage points. Unemployment
continues to be structurally very high for the low skilled
and the young, with very sharp regional differences
(Figure 15).

25.
With recently agreed-upon labor market
reforms still being implemented, the authorities judged it premature to consider new
measures. Emphasis is being placed on activation and training policies, while the recent cut
in marginal taxes on the high skilled and efforts to promote research and development are
expected to have positive spillovers. The authorities agreed that the tax wedge on labor
should be further reduced and education and training improved, but saw no consensus for
curbing the level and duration of out-of-work benefits and fully phasing out early retirement
schemes.
26.
The authorities doubted that an overhaul of the central wage-bargaining
framework would have appreciable benefits. Indeed, there was no support from labor

17
unions and employers for a fundamental change in the framework. They argued that it had
contained wage pressures well over the medium term and that opening it up would likely lead
to wage drift, especially as profitability was high and the labor market relatively tight.
Accordingly, social partners had agreed to correct the recent slight overrun of the wage
norm, but labor unions called for the correction to be spread over four rather than two years.
The staff observed that the central bargaining framework, based on the so-called
“competitiveness law,” did not take into account productivity developments and had not
prevented loss of competitiveness, especially in the manufacturing sector (Box 4). Indexation
remained an anachronistic feature of the framework, though several sectors had put
mechanisms in place to mitigate its effects. Pointing to significant differences in the level of
wages across sectors, enterprises, and regions, the authorities disputed the staff’s claim—
based on the observation that wage differentials had hardly budged over the past decade—
that the framework hampered wage differentiation.
27.
Social partners nonetheless recognized that the bargaining framework had to be
made more conducive to job creation. The staff suggested to keep wage increases below
the projected increase for trading partners as long as employment rates had not caught up.
The Central Economic Council, in its regular report on establishing the margin for wage
negotiation, had begun to report a broader battery of economic performance indicators to
help influence the debate.
28.
Disparities in regional labor market performance point to the need to
differentiate but also to coordinate federal and regional labor market policies (Table 7).
Regions faced with low employment rates of older workers and a more rapidly aging
population should focus on keeping older workers in the labor force, but are unlikely to be
successful if early retirement schemes are not phased out. Coexistence of job shortages in
some regions with high rates of vacancies in others calls for strengthening mobility and
cross-regional training programs. Resolving high youth and female unemployment rates in
some regions will require adjusting the level and the tax treatment of benefits, set at the
federal level, in order to lower reservation wages.
29.
Ongoing product market reforms and deregulation are raising economic
efficiency. The administrative burden on businesses and households has been reduced,
improving an area that scored poorly according to the OECD. Liberalization of the energy
sector has led to lower gas and electricity prices for wholesale customers, but competition in
the retail market needs to be unleashed. Complete privatization of telecommunications and
deeper reforms of railway and postal services would increase efficiency but are not on the
near-term agenda. While the opening-up of the services sector to international competition is
set to take place in line with the EU directive, agreement has been reached to selectively
allow entry of 113 professions that are in short supply on the domestic labor market.
Following consultation with stakeholders, retail shop opening hours are set to be liberalized.

18

Box 4. Wage Formation and External Competitiveness1
Belgium’s centralized wage-bargaining framework is based on a so-called “competitiveness
law.” It was introduced in 1996 to promote employment and preserve external competitiveness
vis-à-vis France, Germany, and the Netherlands. The law requires that the growth of nominal
hourly labor costs for Belgian enterprises in a period of two years does not exceed a “wage
norm”: the weighted average of the estimated increases in labor costs in these three countries. In
addition, wages are to be indexed.
Although the norm has been largely adhered to, competitiveness has eroded, especially in
the manufacturing sector (Table and Figure). This is mainly because real wage growth has not
been linked to relative productivity developments between Belgium and the three neighboring
countries. Indeed, while labor cost has not been out of line, productivity growth in the
manufacturing sector has been lagging behind. Moreover, competitiveness should be considered
against a broader set of trading partners. Overall, eroding competitiveness has not yet become
a serious problem, as demonstrated by the stable export market shares in nominal terms both
globally and in key trading partner countries (although export shares in volume term have
declined), but it will be if current trends continue.
While decentralization of the wage-bargaining framework may not be politically feasible in
the short term, some changes to the framework are necessary to prevent further losses in
competitiveness. For the 2007–08 wage round, “all-in” agreements should be encouraged to
minimize high wage increases due to inflation surprises, and tax cuts should not be used to allow
higher take-home pay, but should lead unambiguously to lower labor costs. The law that past
overruns of the wage norm should be corrected in the subsequent wage agreements needs to be
enforced. In the longer run, the framework needs to be changed to take into account productivity
developments in Belgium and neighboring countries as well as productivity differentials at the
sectoral and enterprise levels.

V. STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
Supported by sound economic policies, the economy has been performing well,
and the financial sector has gained further resilience, but policies will need to be
strengthened to meet the long-run challenges posed by population aging and
globalization. Achieving nominal budget targets for seven years running has firmly
established the credibility of fiscal policy, though it has been associated with a trend decline
in the primary budget surplus. Addressing aging and globalization now requires building up
budget surpluses, broadening labor market reforms, and further improving education and the
functioning of product markets. Policy actions need to be taken early on to preserve adequate
pensions and high quality health care in the long run. Hence, a decisive strengthening and
improved coordination of policies across all levels of government should be a priority of the
next government.
31.
Economic activity is expected to ease to a robust pace. GDP growth is projected to
slow to 2.2 percent in 2007, as rising interest rates dampen demand, the external environment
softens, and the fiscal policy stance turns from strongly procyclical to slightly restrictive.
Uncertainties surrounding this outlook are associated with house prices, external demand,
and the euro. While the real effective exchange rate is not overvalued on fundamentals, the
recent erosion of competitiveness has to be halted, through both wage moderation and
productivity-enhancing structural reforms. Cuts in social security contributions to help lower
labor costs should be used sparingly and not to obtain agreements that include higher takehome pay.
32.
The financial system is strong and resilient, and there are no stability concerns,
but supervisors will have to adapt to its changing systemic risk profile. Major strides
have been made in improving the already high quality of supervision, in line with the
2005 FSAP recommendations. Ongoing stress tests could be usefully refined, and the
recently conducted liquidity stress tests should be turned into a recurrent exercise in view of
likely changes in global liquidity conditions. Fuller advantage now should be taken of the
synergy between the NBB and the CBFA. With bank-insurance groups rapidly expanding in
nontraditional areas and abroad, supervisors will need to focus more on these issues.
Concurrently, the increasing international dimension of Belgium’s financial system
underscores the importance of strengthening the information exchange and international
cooperation among supervisors.
33.
Dealing with aging and globalization requires a multi-pronged approach, which
is partly under way and broadly recognized in principle but needs to be fully
implemented in practice:
•

Intergenerational fairness demands significant prefunding of the rise in aging costs,
for which fiscal consolidation will have to become more ambitious than envisaged.
Fiscal surpluses should be raised to about 1.8 percent of GDP by 2012, in evenly

21
paced annual adjustments, based on a strategy of primary expenditure restraint across
all levels of government.
•

Further reforms of the pension system are important: early retirement schemes should
be fully phased out and pension discounts made actuarially fair. Building on recent
progress, the growth of health care spending should be durably reduced.

•

Employment rates are expected to rise significantly due to demographics and the
implementation of the Generation Pact, but additional reforms of labor market
institutions will be key.

•

Finally, welcome reforms in product markets, reductions in the administrative burden,
and policies to promote innovation are creating growth opportunities. To benefit
fully, obstacles to competition in the services sector need to be removed.

34.
The structural adjustment targeted in the 2007 budget is consistent with the
strategy to deal with aging, but additional measures are likely to be required to reach
budget objectives. On the positive side, one-off measures are being reduced, a trend that
should be locked in. However, revenue projections seem optimistic, and primary spending is
set to grow only marginally slower than GDP, thus delaying progress in consolidation.
Additional measures taken to close the gap should be of a durable nature to support the
requisite rise in surpluses.
35.
Successful consolidation calls for a revision of fiscal federalism arrangements
and a further strengthening of fiscal institutions. Imbalances between regional and federal
entities are set to widen, with regions facing little incentive to save the increase in revenues
they are experiencing. In revising the arrangements, any further devolution should be
accompanied by strengthened accountability and stronger coordination among federal and
sub-federal entities of both budgetary and other economic policies. In this context, the
resumption of the activities of the HCF is timely and welcome, and a further strengthening of
the internal stability pact is warranted.
36.
Building on the initial steps taken with the Generation Pact, additional labor
market reforms will be essential to lift employment rates to levels prevailing in
neighboring countries and to achieve Lisbon objectives. The sharpened focus on
activation policies is highly appropriate, but to be effective, labor market policies will need
to be streamlined and coordinated across regions. In a balanced package and mindful of the
implications for the budget, the tax wedge on labor should be further reduced and the
generosity of out-of-work benefits lowered. The duration of unemployment benefits will
have to be effectively limited and training efforts bolstered. Over the medium term, the
wage-bargaining framework needs to be made more conducive to job creation. In particular,
it will be crucial to forego the practice of indexation and to take better account of
productivity differentials between regions, sectors, and enterprises in setting wages.
37.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

Until December 31, 1998, Belgium formed a monetary union with Luxembourg
in which the Belgian and Luxembourg francs were at par, while also participating in the
exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. Belgium entered the final
stage of European Economic and Monetary Union on January 1, 1999 at a rate of
40.3399 Belgian francs to the euro.

FSAP Assessment

IMF Country Report
No. 06/75

Summary: The report concluded that Belgium’s financial system is resilient and benefits
from a number of Belgium-specific features that help stability. These include a traditionally
cautious attitude toward risk by banks, large holdings of government securities, extremely
low holdings of equity by banks, a stable source of funding benefiting from generous tax
incentives, a high standard of banking supervision, and a stable macroeconomic policy
framework. Overall, supervision showed a high degree of compliance with international
standards. Near-term vulnerability appears low, reflecting the soundness of the dominant
banking system, the generally benign financial environment, the strong financial condition of
the corporate sector, and the relatively healthy financial position of the household sector.
Financial institutions were found to withstand an adverse macroeconomic stress well, helped
in part by the beneficial diversification in the bancassurance model.
Notwithstanding the strengths of the Belgian financial sector, a number of issues emerged
from the FSAP. The heavy exposure abroad, the open nature of the economy, and the
importance of the Euroclear Group globally, make the domestic financial system potentially
vulnerable to global economic developments and financial contagion. Risks remain and may
increase with a downturn in the business cycle, increased cross-border operations, and deeper
links with the global money centers. While the financial position of the insurance industry
has improved, serious challenges exist, and the supervisions of the insurance and pension
funds need to be strengthened. Looking ahead, the Banking, Finance, and Insurance
Commission (CBFA) needs to take fuller advantage of the synergies with the National Bank
of Belgium (NBB) and further enhance its effectiveness. Maintaining the soundness of the
financial system and safeguarding financial stability would call for, in the short term, actions
aimed at (1) addressing identified weaknesses in the supervision of the insurance sector;
(2) establishing an effective mechanism for consolidated supervision of the bancassurance
groups; (3) devoting adequate resources and capacity to the oversight and supervision of the
Euroclear Group/Euroclear Bank; (4) continuing to place emphasis on liquidity management;
and (5) further enhancing the existing crisis management arrangements.

34
APPENDIX II. BELGIUM: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Belgium’s economic and financial statistics are adequate for surveillance purposes. The
National Bank of Belgium (NBB) regularly publishes a full range of economic and financial
data and provides calendar dates of main statistical releases. On-line access to these
comprehensive databases is facilitated by the NBB’s data search engine. Belgium is an
SDDS subscriber. Statistics for International Financial Statistics on banking institutions and
monetary aggregates are prepared on a monthly basis and are timely.
In compliance with EUROSTAT requirements, Belgium adopted chain-linked national
accounts statistics in October 2006 and introduced new data sources.9 So far, revisions of
national accounts for the period 1995–2005, both annually and quarterly, have been
completed, while revisions for the earlier years are still under way. GDP growth based on the
chain-linked national accounts data is more or less in line with that based on the old series,
although the composition of growth has changed somewhat, especially for 2004 and 2005
(Figure below). Specifically, in 2004, the external sector’s negative contribution to growth
was revised to a small positive contribution, while the growth contribution from private
consumption and investment was stronger than suggested by the old national accounts data.
In 2005, however, the growth contribution of private consumption and investment was
revised down, while the building up of inventories contributed more to the growth.
Both annual and quarterly national accounts data—published within a lag of three months—
are of good quality, with shortcomings mainly related to export and import deflators, which
are based on unit values rather than prices collected directly from exporters and importers.
Consequently, Belgian export market shares in values have developed rather differently from
their shares in volumes. With the chained-link national accounts data, these discrepancies
were reduced somewhat.
General government revenue, expenditure, and balance on an accrual basis (ESA95) are
published annually. The NBB publishes monthly data on central government operations. It
would be helpful to present these data quarterly on a national accounts basis to facilitate
monitoring of public finances.
The overall quality and availability of financial indicators are good, while additional
indicators for the insurance sector should be developed. The authorities are providing
quarterly updates of financial soundness indicators in a timely manner.

Unlike in most other countries, the NBB is responsible for compiling national accounts statistics.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with
Belgium
On February 16, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Belgium.1
Background
The economic upturn that started in mid-2005 has remained on track. On the heels of a catchup in private investment, the revival of private consumption and the cyclical expansion in
neighboring countries have broadened the recovery to all sectors of the economy. Underlying
inflation has been stable and broadly in line with the euro area average. At odds with
developments elsewhere in the euro area, the unemployment rate has not declined significantly.
Comparatively faster labor force growth, high relative labor costs, and less wage moderation
seem to be contributing factors. The real exchange rate has been appreciating, eroding
competitiveness, and while exports shares have kept up well in value, they have declined in
volume terms. Nonetheless, the current account has remained in surplus.
Despite some real exchange rate appreciation and interest rate hikes, monetary conditions have
remained accommodating, only recently reaching their long-run average. Fiscal policy turned
procyclical in 2006, imparting an impulse of almost 1 percentage point of GDP, as growth
surprised on the upside. The 2007 budget aims for a surplus of 0.3 percent of GDP and
a structural improvement of 0.6 percent of GDP. Recourse to one-off measures to reach budget
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
objectives is set to diminish, and primary spending growth will be slightly below GDP growth.
Federal government spending is more restrictive, but regional authorities, which have little or no
debt and an increasing share of revenue, are set to ramp up spending.
Against this background, economic growth is expected to slow but maintain a robust pace. The
staff projects GDP growth to decline from nearly 3 percent in 2006 to 2.2 percent in 2007, as
rising interest rates dampen demand, residential construction eases from its recent sustained
vigorous pace, the fiscal stance turns restrictive, and the global environment softens. Over the
long run, demographics are likely to lessen growth, and aging-related costs will add several
percentage points of GDP to fiscal spending.
Benefiting from a benign risk environment, low interest rates and effervescent equity markets,
financial enterprises are experiencing high returns. Banks remain well capitalized, and solvency
and coverage ratios of insurance companies and pension funds have been rising. The
internationalization of financial institutions has been accelerating, while banks are expanding in
nontraditional areas and emerging markets. Households have been increasing their claims on
institutional investors, and mortgage financing has been their largest source of credit. Corporate
deleveraging is continuing.
In line with the 2005 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) recommendations,
regulations and supervision in banking, insurance, securities, payments, and settlement have
been fully aligned with international standards, pension fund and insurance supervision
upgraded, and internal controls and operation of the supervisory agency improved.
On other structural issues, the upward trend in employment rates is set to continue, though it
will contribute only two thirds of the long-term increase targeted by the authorities. The
measures of the recently implemented Generation Pact will help to cover part of the remaining
gap. Emphasis is being placed on activation and training policies. Marginal taxes on the high
skilled have been cut, efforts to promote research and development bolstered, and the
administrative burden on businesses and households reduced. The services sector is set to be
subject to international competition in line with the EU directive.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities on their sound fiscal and financial policies, and
in particular, the significant fiscal consolidation which has allowed the economy to perform well
and the financial sector to gain further resilience. They identified population aging and
globalization as the key long-run challenges and expressed some concern about the recent
erosion of competitiveness. Addressing these issues requires building up budget surpluses,
moderating wage growth, and further improving education and the functioning of labor and
product markets. To achieve these objectives in a timely manner, Directors called for a
coordinated early and decisive policy response across all levels of government.
Directors noted that the pace of economic growth was expected to ease, but remain robust
in 2007. They saw uncertainties surrounding this outlook associated with house price

3
developments, external demand, and a possible euro appreciation. Directors agreed that the
real effective exchange rate was broadly in line with fundamentals, but emphasized that
competitiveness should not be allowed to erode further, which would require wage moderation
and productivity-enhancing structural reforms.
Directors welcomed the strength and resilience of the financial sector. They commended the
authorities on the major strides made in improving the already high quality of supervision, in line
with the 2005 FSAP recommendations. Directors emphasized that there is a need to further
improve cooperation between the supervisory agency (CBFA) and the central bank. They
encouraged supervisors to focus on the rapid expansion of bank-insurance groups in
nontraditional areas and other countries, which is changing the systemic risk profile of the
financial system.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intentions to fully implement their multi-pronged approach to
dealing with aging, consisting of fiscal adjustment and growth-enhancing reforms. In this
context, Directors recommended a more ambitious path for fiscal consolidation, and considered
that the authorities should lock in the structural adjustment and nominal surplus targeted in the
2007 budget, and the reduced recourse to one-off fiscal measures. Directors noted that further
pension reforms would be essential, especially the phasing out of early retirement systems and
the establishment of full actuarial fairness of the pension system. The growth of health care
spending should be contained, building on recent progress in this area.
Directors observed that successful fiscal consolidation would require a revision to fiscal
federalism arrangements and a strengthening of fiscal institutions. Though essentially a political
matter, they underscored that in revising the revenue-sharing and allocation of spending
responsibilities across levels of governments, accountability and coordination of fiscal and
economic policies among federal and sub-federal entities would need to be strengthened,
particularly as the fiscal objective shifts from balancing the budget to building up surpluses.
Directors welcomed the resumption of the activities of the High Council of Finance and
supported the authorities’ intention to enhance the internal stability pact.
Directors felt that further labor market reforms, building on the steps taken in the Generation
Pact, would be essential to lift employment rates and lower the costs of aging and encouraged
the authorities to work on building the necessary consensus. They welcomed the sharpened
focus on job search incentives and assistance, while recommending further streamlining and
coordination of labor market policies across regions. They saw a need to lower the tax burden
on labor, improve training, and reduce the generosity of out-of-work benefits. In particular, the
duration of unemployment benefits would need to be limited in time. Over the medium term,
Directors felt that the wage bargaining framework ought to be made more conducive to job
creation, by taking better into account developments in productivity and employment rates in
setting wages. They welcomed reforms in product markets, the reduction in the administrative
burden, and the policies under way to promote innovation. Directors encouraged the authorities
to accelerate the removal of obstacles to competition in the services sector.
