STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
November 5, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context. High oil prices and production have contributed to sizable fiscal and external
surpluses. Non-oil growth has picked up, mainly driven by consumption and investment.
Political developments in the last few years have had an adverse impact on the
implementation of public investment program. A new five-year Development Plan for
2015–19 has been proposed to the Parliament. The authorities are initiating subsidy and
public wage reforms, as well as fiscal and financial institutional and regulatory reforms.
Kuwait is at an inflection point as economic diversification, a key policy priority, has to start
now to generate a higher and sustainable growth path.
Recent oil price developments. The recent decline in oil prices further highlights current
challenges. While the consultation with the authorities took place when oil prices were
projected to decline from $105 per barrel in 2014 to $96 per barrel in 2019, since then they
have fallen by about 20–25 percent. Staff’s policy recommendations on the pace of fiscal and
structural reforms remain valid if the current drop in oil prices is temporary. Staff also
developed with the authorities a downside scenario, with oil prices lower by $20 over the five
year period. Under this scenario, with substantial buffers that have been built-up, a decline in
oil prices should not trigger immediate spending cuts, especially in capital expenditure, but it
places more urgency on implementing the government’s medium-term consolidation plans to
contain current spending consistent with intergenerational equity.
Political setting. Since the formation of the last Parliament after elections in July 2013, some
tensions resurfaced in early 2014 (six parliamentary elections were held during 2006–13). It is
vital for the government and the parliament to agree on an agenda to place the public
investment program on track and continue structural reforms.
Outlook and risks. Kuwait’s near- and medium-term economic outlook is favorable. Non-oil
GDP growth in Kuwait is expected to pick up to 4.0–5.0 percent in the medium term,
supported by government investment in infrastructure and the oil sector, and by
consumption. The main downside risk to the outlook arises from lower global oil
demand and prices.
Macroeconomic policies. The current strong fiscal position notwithstanding, spending
rigidities and reliance on oil revenues have highlighted fiscal risks. Containing current
spending growth by restraining the wage bill and reforming subsidies (combined with
targeted mitigating measures and a well-designed communication strategy) is important

KUWAIT

for ensuring fiscal sustainability. Developing a supportive fiscal policy framework
underpinned by medium-term macroeconomic and expenditure frameworks, while preparing
for an adoption of fiscal rules, would strengthen the reform process. In the context of the
exchange rate basket peg, the central bank should continue to be proactive in liquidity
management.
Enhancing financial stability. Prudent regulation and supervision by the central bank
has ensured banking system stability. Risks to the financial system from investment
companies are contained, although a few companies continue to make losses and
deleverage and restructure their balance sheets and operations. Enhancing the
macroprudential policy framework would further strengthen systemic stability.
Economic Diversification. Reforms are needed for improving the business environment,
public investment efficiency, and education and skills. In addition, measures to realign
incentives for firms and national workers to promote entrepreneurship and private
sector employment are required. These would include increasing private sector
competition, reducing wage gaps between the public and private sector, and containing
public employment.

KUWAIT

CONTEXT
1.
Kuwait’s economic activity has picked up, supported by high oil prices and production,
but challenges remain. Non-oil sector growth has been driven mainly by consumption growth,
reflecting an increase in public wages and subsidies. The execution of the government’s Five Year
Development Plan (DP) (2010–14) has been below target and public investment has stalled. Public
investment remains lower than in other emerging market economies.1 Frequent changes in
governments since 2006 partly delayed the implementation of some mega projects. Spending
rigidities and increased reliance on oil revenues have highlighted fiscal risks. The authorities are
preparing a new Development Plan (2015–19) that focuses on economic reform and the
implementation of some long-stalled strategic mega projects.
2.
The government has taken measures to address some of the challenges, broadly in line
with staff advice (Annex I). The cabinet has decided to eliminate diesel subsidies, reduced
allowances for Kuwaitis travelling abroad for medical aid, and passed a law to cap end-of-service
compensation. A departmental group in the Ministry of Finance is studying the rationalization of
kerosene and electricity subsidies. The government has initiated public finance management
reform with the help of the World Bank, and is working on an ambitious time schedule for its
implementation. Parliament has recently passed a number of important laws, including on
anti-corruption, promoting foreign investment, public-private partnerships, and privatization. The
central bank is proactively maintaining banking system stability.
3.
Economic diversification is a policy priority. The growth model has so far relied on oil
revenues to invest in public employment, health, education and infrastructure, and achieved rapid
economic development. Transitioning to a more balanced private sector driven model that
encourages firms to export requires significant progress in implementing structural reforms to
improve the business environment, governance, and institutional and policy making frameworks;
enhancing the skills of workers; encouraging entrepreneurship by developing the small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) sector; and changing the incentive structure of firms to focus on
the tradable sector by reviewing the competition policy law, government procurement procedures,
reviewing barriers for entry of firms, fostering forward and backward linkages of private sector firms
with state-owned enterprises. In addition, strengthening the incentives for employment of nationals
in the private non-oil sectors would entail containing growth in public sector wages and jobs.
4.
Positive external spillovers from Kuwait are expected to continue. Kuwait has played an
important role in maintaining stability of the global oil market and is embarking on an investment
program to increase its capacity in crude oil. Kuwait is an important source of outward remittances,

The objective of the Plan was to increase private sectors’ contribution to the economy, creating jobs and providing
long-term investment opportunities. About $130 billion was to be implemented with private sector participation,
including a variety of public-private partnerships in projects in oil, utilities, infrastructure and healthcare and
education services sectors.

about $15 billion in 2013, and has provided important financial and humanitarian assistance to the

A fiscal surplus of 26 percent of GDP is projected in 2014 supported by high oil prices,
but with increases in salaries and subsidies it will be down from about 35 percent in 2013. Wages
and salaries constitute 50 percent of total expenditure in the FY 2014/15 budget. Total spending is
projected to rise by 25 percent in the budget, reflecting both increased current (22 percent) and
capital expenditures (45 percent) (Figures 1 and 6).

Monetary conditions have been accommodative.2 The Central Bank of Kuwait
(CBK) benchmark discount rate remained unchanged since October 2012 at 2 percent. The
weighted-average deposit and lending rates fell to 1.49 percent and 4.35 percent, respectively, at

end-June 2014 (from 1.60 percent and 4.86 percent, respectively at end-October 2012). As total
deposits increased by 6.5 percent y-o-y in June 2014, excess liquidity of the banking system—bank
reserves at the central bank—has been rising as well. Bank credit to private sector grew y-o-y by
7 percent in June 2014, driven mainly by personal loans (Figure 7). Bank lending to non-bank
financial institutions further contracted to 5 percent of banks’ total credit portfolio in June 2014,
compared to 6.3 percent a year ago and the pre-crisis boom of 12.7 percent in mid-2008.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
8.
Kuwait’s current near-term economic outlook is positive, but there are downside risks,
from slow implementation of public investment priority projects. Non-oil GDP growth in
Kuwait is expected to accelerate to 4.0 percent in 2015, and is projected to further increase gradually
to 4.5–5.0 percent in the medium term in the baseline scenario, on the strength of public spending
in infrastructure and the oil sector, private investment, and consumption. Inflation is projected to
increase to 3.5 percent in 2015. A moderate increase in oil production is expected to further support
overall growth. The external current account and fiscal surpluses are projected to remain high over
the medium term, but on a declining trajectory, amid rising government spending and a gradual
decline in projected oil prices.
9.
The authorities acknowledged that an enduring political agreement on the reform
agenda is required to implement the DP and improve investment climate to achieve the
projected baseline non-oil growth rates. They, however, noted that the relationship between
government and parliament had improved, and legislations passed by the current parliament so far
have exceeded any previous parliament’s performance over a full term. The government is moving
forward in implementing major projects in the oil sector such as refineries and clean fuel, roads,
port, and airport. However, there is continuing pressure from members of parliament to increase
subsidies and wages and other benefits to Kuwaitis. Staff have lowered non-oil growth projections
compared to last year, mainly reflecting the underexecution of projects under the DP, and any
further shortfall in implementation of major projects would result in non-oil growth lower than
currently forecast.
10.
A sustained decline in oil prices presents a major downside risk to the medium-term
outlook (Risk Assessment Matrix below). Given the recent trends in current spending as well as
the projected decline in oil prices in the baseline, government expenditure would exceed revenues,
excluding investment income, by 2020, although the overall fiscal position will remain in surplus. The
breakeven oil price—the price needed to balance the budget at current expenditure levels—has
risen over the past few years and is estimated at $75 in 2014/15 (excluding investment income).3
Staff’s analysis, however, shows that a $20 decline in oil prices relative to the baseline would result
in bringing the fiscal position (excluding investment income) to a sizable deficit in the medium term
3

The production level is assumed at 2.925 million barrels a day in 2014. Transfers to the Futures Generations Fund
are not considered in the calculations as they are treated as below-the-line transactions in fiscal accounts.

KUWAIT

(Figure 2). While large fiscal buffers would allow the government to smooth public spending in the
medium term in the event of a sustained oil price drop, this would come at the cost of lower savings
for future generations. All these factors would adversely affect long-term fiscal sustainability. Capital
spending plans in the near term should continue as envisaged, but it would require further
consolidation in the medium-term, which would lead to slower growth. On the other hand,
geopolitical risks and unrest in key oil exporting countries pose upside risks to Kuwait’s hydrocarbon
production and prices. The government has recognized the importance of using the period of high
surpluses to save more by containing current spending growth and increasing non-oil revenues.
11.
The authorities have embarked on a large investment program in the oil sector to
increase production capacity for crude oil from 3 mbd to 4 mbd by 2020. They are also
expanding the capacity of their refineries and the petrochemicals complex. Staff noted potential
risks to this strategy in view of global developments regarding shale oil supply. The authorities did
not anticipate any reduction in their market share arising from global shale supplies in the near-term
because of supply outages in Iraq, Libya and Nigeria. In the medium- to long-term, according to the
authorities, environmental concerns, the quality of crude, uncertainty regarding changes in US policy
to permit crude shale oil exports, high depletion rate of shale, cost differential between new
production and that in Kuwait, and improved global demand outlook, could constrain shale supplies
and create space for Kuwait to increase its market share.

Surges in global financial market volatility would likely have limited effects on the
banking system. Banks fund their assets mainly from domestic deposits. Banks have direct
exposures to the cyclical real estate sector and equity (24 percent of total assets) in addition to
collaterals, thus exposing them to a downturn in real estate and equity prices. The feedback effects
among banks, nonbank financial institutions, the real estate sector, and the stock market may
exacerbate the impact. The high capitalization and provisioning levels, however, provide substantial
loss absorption capacity that has been validated by the central bank’s and credit rating agencies’
stress test results.4 The central bank is also proactively monitoring and mitigating concentration and
other risks through the use of macroprudential tools, including limits on loan-to-value ratios, and
mandating less well capitalized banks to raise capital. An abrupt change in global financial market
conditions could however increase market and funding risks for investment companies (ICs), forcing
further deleveraging of proprietary positions for some of them, as well as adversely affecting
fiduciary assets.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to
materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding
the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and
“high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as
of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The main policy issues include restraining current spending growth, developing medium-term
macroeconomic and fiscal frameworks, sustaining long-term growth through diversification, and
maintaining financial stability.

A. Macroeconomic Policy Mix
13.
The accommodative monetary policy stance remains conducive to credit growth. Bank
credit continues to grow, supported by deposit growth. The central bank is ensuring that current
liquidity conditions are supportive of credit demand, and monetary operations continue to focus
primarily on absorption of surplus liquidity through conventional and Islamic instruments. With low
inflation and gradually increasing non-oil growth, the policy mix is growth-supportive and remains
appropriate. Monetary policy in coming years is expected to tighten under the basket peg.
Macroprudential policy tools are available to the central bank to mitigate potential financial stability
risks, and they are currently on a neutral setting.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

KUWAIT

14.
The peg to a basket provides a credible monetary anchor, while the overall external
sector assessment points to stability. Staff share the authorities’ view that the peg to the basket is
appropriate given the current structure of the Kuwaiti economy. Estimates from the macrobalance
and equilibrium real exchange rate assessment methodologies show that the real exchange rate is
broadly in line with fundamentals, while estimates from the external sustainability approach give
inconclusive results (Appendix II). On balance, staff believe there is no compelling evidence that the
exchange rate is misaligned. Various external indicators reinforce the stability of the external sector.
Central bank reserves have remained stable in the range of about 6.5–8 months of imports over the
past few years while the sovereign wealth fund (Kuwait Investment Authority) has an estimated
$550 billion at end-2013. The availability of cheap migrant labor keeps labor costs down and
inflation moderate. The real effective exchange rate has been stable.
15.
The overall fiscal stance is expansionary until FY 2015/16 as some expenditures (e.g.
foreign aid and subsidies) were shifted from the last year to the current year.5 However, some
consolidation is envisaged thereafter, and this is appropriate in the context of fiscal sustainability.

This is based on the non-oil balance as percent of non-oil GDP, excluding pension recapitalization.

6

The estimates are based on a finite-horizon precautionary saving-investment model, in which oil income
uncertainty is taken into account and investment affects the growth path. If the Development Plan is implemented
fully, public capital spending would probably be close to the model estimate. However, according to the model,
investment should contribute to export growth, requiring initiatives to support the tradable sector development.

more urgent in a scenario of lower oil prices.
17.
Staff and the authorities agreed that reduction in the non-oil fiscal deficit over the
medium term can be obtained with a number of options:


A gradual phasing-out of subsidies (9 percent of GDP), with a social safety net in place and other
mitigating measures (e.g. cash transfers) and a well-designed communication strategy to get the
buy-in of the middle class, would generate substantial savings. This would have to be
implemented in a manner that would not increase inflationary pressures.



Curtailing the increase in government jobs and keeping the growth in compensation constant in
real terms would result in saving of 0.8 percent of GDP in 2015 and an average of about
1.5 percent of GDP per year in the medium term.



A review of various transfers to enterprises and households, goods and services spending, and
other current expenditures, about 15 percent of GDP, is warranted to rationalize spending and
explore potential savings. Pension reform is a potential candidate for spending rationalization.



Subjecting Kuwaiti companies to corporate tax and lowering the rate to 10 percent from
15 percent, abolishing the National Labor Support Tax and the tax for the Kuwait Foundation
for the Advancement of Sciences, and making Zakat creditable against the corporate tax,
has the potential to increase revenues by 1.8 percent of GDP. Implementation of the value
added tax (VAT) could yield an additional 2.3 percent of non-oil GDP. Thus, the combined
revenue-increasing potential of these taxes is 2.9 percent of GDP. Revising fees for public
services would constitute an additional source of non-oil revenues.

18.
The government has started implementing reforms to contain current spending. The
cabinet has decided to increase diesel and kerosene prices from 55 fils per liter to 170 fils per liter
(with potential saving of 0.5 percent of GDP). Some allowances for Kuwaitis travelling for healthcare

abroad have been rationalized. The government is in advanced stages of sending a proposal to the
cabinet for reducing subsidies for electricity. The government’s proposal on a tariff structure for
electricity based on a sliding scale of usage would generate revenues of about 1 percent of GDP
each year and a reduction in usage by 20 percent. Staff suggested that over the medium term,
policies need to be implemented to eliminate the gap between the reference price (domestic
production cost with some remuneration for capital in the sector) and the current tariffs.
19.
Staff and the authorities were of the view that to generate broad public support, a
successful subsidy reform entailed (i) a comprehensive reform plan with impact assessment
studies, (ii) appropriate phasing of price increases, (iii) a far-reaching communication strategy
raising awareness about the cost of subsidies and the benefits of reform, and (iv) targeted
mitigating measures, especially to protect the vulnerable segment of the population. The
government is actively engaged on these fronts.
20.
The government is also considering a public sector wage reform, on which staff made
suggestions. The objectives of the reform include revamping the current payroll system, linking
performance management with promotions, standardizing salaries across public sector jobs, and
moving to a system of salary indexation with periodic rebasing. Staff welcomed this development as
it would simplify the wage structure, but suggested design changes since the proposal left room for
arbitrary increases in salaries during the rebasing year and did not address the issue of containing
employment growth. Staff suggested the Ministry of Finance be given powers to set wage bill
ceilings or overall expenditure limits as part of the medium-term fiscal framework to contain
arbitrary wage increases during the rebasing. Moreover, staff also emphasized that reducing the
wage gap between public and private sector jobs to create incentives for nationals to take up private
sector jobs, and restraining the increase in public sector employment should be part of the reform.
Introducing skills testing for new and existing staff is a possibility. Wage subsidies need to be
reviewed to retain the original intention of it being temporary. The authorities agreed that the
development of the private sector and focusing on diversification should reduce the need to absorb
new entrants into the public sector.

with the broader diversification goals, and integrated with the budget formulation process.
Although Kuwait compares better than oil exporters in the MENA region in terms of public
investment management, it falls behind when compared to other emerging market economies. In
the near term, staff and the authorities identified actions needed to improve efficiency that would
include adopting a general strategy to modernize the procurement system, raising the oversight of
public investment projects by increasing the transparency on decisions related to such projects,
preparing an infrastructure needs assessment and effectively implementing the anti-corruption
framework, and assessing the state of the public investment management system. Over the medium
term, the framework for managing public investment should be revamped, particularly by
developing the medium-term expenditure framework, the appraisal of investment projects, and by
introducing a systematic ex-post evaluation of projects (Selected Issues Paper II).
22.
The government recognizes the importance of making more rapid progress in
establishing a fiscal policy framework to lessen fiscal policy uncertainty. It would entail
developing a medium-term macroeconomic framework to provide multiyear projections of key
economic variables, a medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF) to provide multiyear targets or ceilings
on aggregate fiscal variables; and a medium-term expenditure framework to translate the overall
budget envelope into a set of multiyear expenditure ceilings and policies for the main spending
ministries (Selected Issues Paper I). These elements will lay a strong foundation for the public
finance management reform underway with the help of the World Bank. The macro-fiscal unit can
play an important role in this process.

B. Fostering Sustainable Growth
23.
The main challenge facing the country is to strengthen growth potential. Action would
be needed, including boosting on infrastructure investment, improving the business environment
and the functioning of product markets, and labor market reforms. The government’s new five-year
Development Plan (DP, 2015–19) is scheduled to be placed before parliament shortly. Given
underexecution of spending and delays in initiating and completing priority projects in the previous
plan, the new plan attempts to set realistic targets that are consistent with the overall economic
objectives and improve execution of the projects. Staff underscored the importance of monitoring
and ensuring implementation of the DP to sustain investment and support non-oil growth over the
medium term. The authorities explained that the new plan has indentified impediments to execution
and is focusing on reforms to support governance in the private sector, long-term investment
reform strategy, improve efficiency of public investment by eliminating procedural obstacles and
improving public procedures services, improve business environment by fighting corruption and
improving transparency and accountability in the public sector.

24.
Efforts by the government to diversify the economy are paramount to reduce Kuwait’s
dependence on oil and to generate private sector jobs for nationals. Although removing
impediments in physical, legal, and business infrastructure is important, aligning incentives of firms
and workers is the missing link in the diversification strategy (Figures 8–10). Improvements in the
quality of education, and skill development; reducing distortions that lead to reliance on foreign
labor, thereby increasing private sector employment opportunities for nationals (Figure 3); and
implementing reforms that encourage tradable goods and services production are essential (Box 1).
Developing SMEs, with the support of the KD 2 billion National Fund for SME Development, is
important as a source of job creation for nationals, economic diversification, including promoting
non-oil exports, and sustainable growth (Selected Issues Paper III).

As Kuwait advances its diversification agenda, banks will need to reorient business
strategies towards maintaining a more diversified asset portfolio. They will also need to
improve their capacity to assess credit risk. The lack of diversification contributes to sectoral
concentrations in loan portfolios of both conventional and Islamic banks, particularly in real estate.
Greater focus on improving the risk management of the growing Islamic banks’ segment becomes
especially important as their business model is based on risk-sharing with clients.
Developing domestic debt markets would bring important benefits, such as raising funding for the
large infrastructure investment programs. Expediting the legal framework for the issuance of sukuk
would help deepen this market. The Capital Markets Authority (CMA) is currently reviewing the draft
law for sukuk issuance.

Box 1. Kuwait–Diversification Efforts Have to Start Now
Achieving a diversified export base and high export sophistication, which are major ingredients of
sustainable growth, takes decades, and Kuwait with more than 95 percent of goods exports in oil,
has to start this process now. The government should play a key role in skill development of nationals
1
and actively increase incentives of firms to move into tradable production.
Skill development should start at an early stage. The quality of early childhood education determines
long-lasting outcomes and mainly works through positive effects on non-cognitive skills. More positive
social behavior and improved academic motivation rather than higher IQs helped children obtain higher
test scores later in life. Kuwait has a high gross pre-school enrollment rate, but lags behind in quality.
Improving teacher quality, which is highly correlated with young students’ achievements, is paramount.
Fostering a spirit of self-reliance and creativity is another element in the development strategy.
Korea’s “Saemaul Undong” provides an example of a social program that succeeded in changing
attitudes of citizens to support development. The main elements were first, to encourage communities
to undertake small-scale projects to improve their surrounding environment, followed by the investment
in income-generating projects and infrastructure. The government helped with funding and provided
support in type of projects, leadership, accountability, regional/national coordination, and technical
assistance. For Kuwait this means that they need to have a dialogue with the population on moving to a
less distributive model of sharing the oil wealth, and which encourages private initiative.
Successful diversification strategies in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Mexico have relied on policies to
create linkages in the existing industries and foster new industries with an emphasis on
competing in international markets and technological upgrade to climb the “quality ladder.” As
was done in Korea, the key element in providing state support is a strong governance and accountability
framework in which the top management is responsible for the funds they receive. Cross-country
experience shows that subsidies to support exporters and taxes on firms in the non-tradables, access to
financing and business support services through development banks and export promotion agencies,
and the creation of special economic zones, industry clusters, research and development centers, and
start-up incubators have been used to promote one goal to develop tradable sectors and encourage
firms to export. “System integrators” in the form of large firms have been created or encouraged to
spearhead the development of large tradable sectors such as automotive or shipbuilding.
Taiwanese and Norwegian experiences provide interesting case studies in developing local firms
and clusters. In 1980, a Taiwanese Venture Capital (VC) initiative provided financial incentives and tax
credits to encourage firms to set up business in the newly created Science Park after failing to attract
multinationals. Two funds were established and run by U.S.-educated Chinese, who were invited to
relocate there. The venture proved successful and large banks, corporates, and even conservative family
conglomerates started creating their own VC funds in information technology businesses. In Norway, in
the 1970s, the government intervened directly in the procurements of oil operators to develop oil
suppliers’ cluster and required foreign operators to develop the competencies of local suppliers. The
government also imposed a minimum of 50 percent of research and development spending to develop
an oil field to take place in Norwegian entities. The government continued to support the suppliers over
the years to encourage firms to internationalize their activity. Eventually, the suppliers’ cluster became
successful, spanning a large array of high value added industries.

C. Strengthening Financial Stability and Intermediation
26.
Banks are amply capitalized and liquid with stable profits, reflecting prudent
regulations by the Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK). Banks have a combined capital adequacy ratio
of 18.3 percent, falling gross non-performing loans (NPLs) of 3.5 percent (driven by a combination of
lower NPLS in real estate and equity, a pick-up in loan growth and continued write-offs of loans),
and a growing provisioning ratio (general plus specific provisions) of 139 percent at end-June 2014
(Figure 11). The CBK has introduced Basel III capital regulations for conventional and the growing
Islamic bank segments, including a framework for domestic systemically important banks, which will
increase the regulatory capital of banks significantly, as well as regulations on leverage ratio.
Regulations on short-term liquidity are in advanced stages of preparation. Banks are highly liquid
with 30 percent of total assets in the form of liquid assets at end-June 2014, and the central bank
does not envisage any problems with banks being able to comply with liquidity and leverage ratios
when the regulation comes into effect. The Islamic banking sector has grown rapidly and now
constitutes a major component of Kuwait’s national banking and the overall financial system.8 CBK
regulations are designed to ensure a level playing field between conventional and Islamic banks,
while taking into account the unique features of Islamic banking (Selected Issues Paper IV).

The CBK has been proactive in introducing macroprudential regulations in line with
international practices to mitigate potential financial stability risks.9 The main source of
vulnerability to the banking system comes from credit concentration to the corporate sector and real
estate, given the structure of Kuwait’s domestic market, which the central bank regulates through
concentration limits. The main sectoral

welcomes. Staff has also observed that activity has been recently increasing in investment properties
and commercial real estate segments of the real estate market, which the central bank is closely
watching and ready to use macroprudential tools to limit potential stability risks to the banking
system arising from this sector.

The market share of the local Islamic banks has increased from 23 percent of banking system assets at end-2005
to 39 percent by end-June 2014.

new draft corporate bankruptcy law could help expedite the restructuring of some loss-making ICs,
and implementation of the corporate governance code would help strengthen the sector, on which
the CMA is planning a communication campaign to ensure that companies adopt it by the extended
deadline of June 2016. The CMA expalined that it conducts onsite and offsite supervision of ICs and
funds under its supervision, and imposes minimum capital requirements, and regulations on liquidity
and leverage, which are constantly under review. The CMA is also conducting a major review of its
by-laws, and working toward harmonizing listing and disclosure requirements for funds.
29.
Measures of shadow banking vary widely for Kuwait depending on the definition used
(Selected Issues Paper V).10 Staff and the authorities shared the view that shadow banking provides
important complementarities to the banking system, and regulation and supervision should focus on
strengthening the monitoring of shadow banking institutions and activities with an emphasis on
those that pose systemic risks to financial stability (Figure 4). Increased monitoring of shadow
banking (activities and entities), including expanding data coverage for Other Financial Corporations
operating in Kuwait as well as data sharing among regulators, together with a formal
macroprudential policy framework, would allow for an early, reliable and comprehensive
identification, assessment and containment of systemic risks.

10

Staff’s assessment shows that measures of shadow banking for Kuwait vary between 2 percent of GDP (activitybased) and 60 percent of GDP (institution-based) depending on the definition used, and are subject to important
data limitations. The ICs, which account for a major share of the institution-based measure of shadow banking is
regulated by the CMA.

Continued coordination between the regulatory and supervisory bodies and enhanced
surveillance tools will facilitate effective monitoring and management of potential systemic
risks. Such a framework should include (i) strengthening the macroprudential arrangements for
policymaking and coordination through a formal mandate (ii) further strengthening the Early
Warning System (EWS) for identifying and monitoring systemic risks, including expanding early
warning indicators for the corporate and real estate sectors, and making macro stress testing an
integral part of systemic surveillance; (iii) enhancing the existing macroprudential toolkit; and
(iv) implementing structural measures over the medium term, including further developing domestic
interbank money and debt markets to support liquidity management, modernizing the insolvency
regimes and supporting judiciary framework, and strengthening crisis management and resolution
systems. The CBK should be provided with enhanced powers in this regard (Selected Issues
Paper VI).
31.
The authorities continue to strengthen the Anti Money Laundering/Combating of
Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework, and looks forward to their continuing work
with the Financial Action Task Force. A Fund technical assistance project supported the authorities
in developing and adopting an AML/CFT law and regulations in line with international standards,
establishing a high level AML/CFT National Strategic Committee, setting up the Financial Intelligence
Unit (FIU) under the oversight of the Minister of Finance that became recently operational, and
establishing comprehensive mechanisms to freeze terrorist assets. Going forward, Kuwait is
expected to continue improving the effectiveness of the AML/CFT regime, and strengthening the
role of the FIU.

D. Other Issues
32.
Staff acknowledges the progress made in improving Kuwait’s statistical system,
particularly in the area of national income, trade and labor data, and encourages the
authorities to further their efforts in improving all areas of economic data, including through
cooperation with GCCStat.

STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
The economic outlook for Kuwait remains favorable. Non-oil GDP growth in Kuwait is
expected to further accelerate to 4.0 percent in 2015, and is projected to increase to 4.5–5.0 percent
in the medium term in the baseline scenario. It is vital for the government and the parliament to
agree on an agenda to place the public investment program on track, and continue with economic
reforms to achieve this growth.
34.
The fiscal position is currently strong but restraint in current spending is needed to
preserve buffers and increase saving for future generations. A medium-term fiscal strategy is
required to drive reforms, the elements of which would include containing current expenditure growth,
particularly subsidies and wages, prioritizing capital expenditure, and increasing non-oil revenue. Subsidy
reform needs to be supported by an effective communication strategy raising awareness about the cost
of subsidies and the benefits of reform, and accompanied by targeted mitigating measures,
especially to protect the vulnerable segment of the population. The proposed wage reform would be
more effective if it operates within overall expenditure limits, aligns incentives for reducing the wage
gap between public and private sector jobs and contains public employment.
35.
Prioritizing capital expenditure towards social and physical infrastructure projects
would help strengthen growth. Higher capital spending should be accompanied by improved
efficiency of public investment, and integrated with the budget formulation process. Drawing lessons
from experience with the current DP (2010–14), which fell short of targets, the new plan (2015–19)
should set realistic targets that are consistent with the overall economic objectives and increase
safeguards to ensure better implementation. A cost-benefit analysis of mega projects is warranted.
36.
A key challenge will be to strengthen the fiscal policy framework to support fiscal
reforms. Medium-term fiscal framework would support implementation of the desirable fiscal
measures. Strengthening the macro-fiscal unit would facilitate preparation of macroeconomic
forecasts and improve revenue and expenditure projections. Other elements would include the
combining medium-term frameworks with the annual budget process, while preparing for an
adoption of fiscal rules. The implementation of a public investment management system would help
increase the efficiency of public investment.
37.
While the current regulatory framework has effectively contained financial risks,
enhancing the macroprudential policy framework would further strengthen systemic stability.
Effective and prudent regulation by the central bank has ensured high capitalization and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KUWAIT

provisioning and maintained banking system stability. Developing a formal macroprudential
framework that gives the CBK a formal mandate for ensuring financial stability and enhanced
coordination across regulators would further contribute to financial stability. The macroprudential
policy framework should consider further strengthening the central bank’s early warning system for
identifying and monitoring systemic risks, with macro stress testing being an integral part of
systemic surveillance, and the use of macroprudential policies in a countercyclical manner.
38.
The systemic risk from ICs is contained, but strengthened oversight and governance,
and some consolidation is required to prevent potential financial stability risks. The completion
of the new draft of corporate bankruptcy law, with support from an effective oversight and
communication campaign by the Capital Markets Authority, could help expedite the restructuring of
some loss-making ICs, engender consolidation, and ensure implementation of the corporate
governance code by June 2016.
39.
Economic diversification into areas with potential for national employment should
constitute a key policy priority. Improving the business environment, infusing stronger
governance in public administration, and providing a greater role for small and medium-sized
enterprises, are needed to take this agenda forward. In addition a number of policy measures such
as strengthening private sector competition, implementing labor market reforms, and limiting
government employment could help realign incentives for firms and national workers to promote
entrepreneurship and pursue private sector jobs. For instance, a review of competition policy law
and its implementation and of policies related to procurement procedures and barriers to entry of
new firms could help increase competition. Diversification could benefit from integrating the private
sector through backward and forward linkages in upstream and downstream input industries.
40.
Further developing domestic financial markets will help the diversification process and
reduce concentration risks. Developing domestic debt markets would bring important benefits,
such as providing alternatives to funding large infrastructure investment projects. Expediting the
legal framework for the issuance of sukuk would help deepen this market.
41.
Considerable progress has been made in improving the quality and availability of key
economic data. Staff encourages the authorities to further their efforts in improving all areas of
economic data, particularly in the areas of government finance, national accounts and real estate
market statistics, including through cooperation with GCCStat.
42.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Appendix II. Kuwait: External Sector Assessment
Staff believes that the peg to the basket is appropriate given the current structure of the Kuwaiti economy, and that
the overall assessment points to external stability. Estimates from the macrobalance and equilibrium real exchange
rate assessment methodologies show that the real exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals; estimates from
the external sustainability approach give inconclusive results. On balance staff believes there is no compelling
evidence that the exchange rate is misaligned.
The equilibrium real effective exchange rate (EREER) approach suggests that the real exchange rate is
broadly in line with its estimated long-run equilibrium. Computations of the equilibrium real effective
exchange rate are based on the estimation of a long-term

close to the equilibrium value if using an estimate based on
the vector-error correction model. Thus it is assessed as broadly in line with fundamentals.
The macroeconomic balance (MB) approach suggests that the current account is within the range of the
medium-term norms from several specifications, but the external sustainability approach shows mixed
results. The macroeconomic balance approach indicates that the medium-term current account norm, based on

approach shows a wide range of current account
benchmarks, at about 14 percent of GDP and 49 percent of GDP, implying both overvaluation and undervaluation,
making it difficult to draw any definitive conclusions. The benchmark based on real per capita annuity implies an
overvaluation of about 31 percent, while that based on real annuity indicates that REER is undervalued by about
23 percent. The more stringent rule (real per capita) would suggest less spending in the medium term (in line with
the PIH fiscal sustainability benchmark), and staff’s medium term framework points to a tightening fiscal stance
over the medium-term.
Various external indicators reinforce the stability of the external sector. Central bank reserves have remained
stable in the range of about 6.5–8 months of imports over the past few years while the international investment
position has decreased to about 51 percent of GDP in 2012, below its 2005–11 average of about 70 percent, which
in part reflects the deleveraging of external assets of financial and nonfinancial corporates after the global crisis.
The sovereign wealth fund (Kuwait Investment Authority) has an estimated $550 billion at end-2013. The
availability of cheap migrant labor keeps labor costs down and inflation moderate.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of October 15, 2014)
The World Bank and the Government of Kuwait developed a rolling four-year Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS), which leverages the setup of a World Bank Country Office in Kuwait (inaugurated in
January 2009).
The Kuwait CPS and program emphasize implementation of reforms. Hence all programs are
grounded in the Government five-year plan, and are developed closely with the line ministry/agency
as well as with the Ministry of Finance, which plays the coordinator role and the Bank’s central
counterpart.
The CPS focuses on Fee-Based Services laying the ground for Bank provision of advisory and
analytical support to Kuwait. Program priorities are driven and guided by CPS and revolve around
the following three pillars:


Improving public sector performance – By making the State a more efficient one, so that
public services are delivered transparently and effectively, with activities in the areas of
reforming public finance and governance including: setting up an anti-corruption agency; tax
modernization, strengthening state property institutions and management, streamlining
outdated procurement and project cycle regulations and practices, capacity building efforts in
the area of public finance management and financial accountability, and support for several
environmental initiatives.



Economic diversification – Aiming to support reform efforts geared towards transforming
Kuwait into a commercial and financial sector with diversified economic activities and the
creation of a more conducive business environment for private sector development and foreign
direct investment. Bank activities under this theme include supporting the implementation of
Kuwait’s privatization law, support Kuwait Direct Investment Promotion Authority (KDIPA) with
feasibility for establishing three economic zones to attract FDI; help set up the newly established
Competition Protection Authority, support the design and implementation of an Insolvency and
Creditors Rights framework and support the establishment of the National SME Fund.



Human development - with a major program to support the quality of education, including
having an international expert based in Kuwait. Bank support in this area also includes social
protection, labor and youth issues.’

Activities for the FY 2014–15
I – Improving public sector performance


Medium Term Policy Directions. At the request of the Minister of Finance the Bank is
exploring ways to support the Government of Kuwait in analyzing the fiscal and economic risks
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KUWAIT

facing Kuwait in the medium term and provide advice on policies to mitigate such risks. The
Bank team is reviewing a wealth of studies and reports undertook over the last several years
analyzing Kuwait’s development objectives and recommending reform priorities. The team is to
distill from such a review lessons on obstacles for reform implementation and engage key
stakeholders with the aim of building a consensus around a suggested reform path.


Environmental Compliance Fund (ECF). This activity responds to a request from the Kuwait
Supreme Council for the Environment, and subsequently from the Ministry of Finance, for World
Bank support in promoting improved environmental performance from point-source/industrial
polluters in Kuwait through the establishment of an ECF. Bank support is consisting of helping
the EPA design an environment compliance system to assist the polluting enterprises reduce
pollution to the level required by the national standards and guidelines. Such system would
consist of the design of the following activities: (i) A Compliance Action Plan (CAP) to be
prepared by each of the polluting enterprises to reduce pollution; and (ii) A Financing Window
to be established in selected commercial banks to provide a combination of loans and grants to
the polluting enterprises in order to implement part or all the activities in the compliance action
plans (CAPs).



Project Cycle. At the request of the Ministry of Finance, the World Bank has conducted a review
of the government project cycle. Bank work helped explore ways to shorten the project cycle
and improve project management practices in Kuwait. As part of this activity, the Bank team has
reviewed and analyzed a selection of projects in government entities at three stages: concept,
implementation and evaluation. This review is helping identify bottlenecks and areas that need
amendments in procedures or regulation/legislation. The Bank is also making recommendations
to strengthen the capacity of the Government agencies to implement projects through adequate
training.



Tax Modernization Support. The World Bank is supporting efforts by the Kuwaiti Government
to modernize tax administration. The project evolved from a technical assistance activity
originally designed to help implement a Value Added Tax system in Kuwait as part of its GCC
trade union obligations. The activity aims to build capacity, which is where the involvement of
the World Bank is critical. This is being achieved through intensive training in tax operations and
modern techniques of tax administration, as well as through on-the-job training by the experts
hired by the project. This focus on strengthening a critical public sector function – tax
administration –in the context of fiscal reform makes the Bank a natural partner for the
government. A team of international resident advisor has been placed in Kuwait to work on this
activity under the supervision of the World Bank.



Solid Waste Management II. This activity is a follow-up to a first phase solid Waste
Management program, which aimed at improving Kuwaiti authorities understanding of the
current challenges of the solid waste sector and incited them to promote reforms to enhance
cost effectiveness of private sector participation, particularly in collection, sorting and recycling
of waste. At the request of the Municipality of Kuwait City, the Bank is engaged through this
second phase of the program to help implement the main recommendations of the first phase,
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KUWAIT

namely: (i) preparation & implementation of a national priority project for the closure and
rehabilitation of existing dumpsites, (ii) elaboration and adoption of a solid waste master plan
consistent with Kuwait Land-Use Master plan, to identify national policy & investment priorities
for the solid waste sector, (iii) completion & harmonization of existing legal instruments, starting
with a Solid Waste Law, and (iv) establishment of a municipal solid waste agency under the
municipality’s authority.


Reorganization of State Property. The objective of the activity is to assist the State of Kuwait
in the strategic understanding of the institutional and regulatory issues related to state land
policy management in Kuwait. Bank work helped develop a clear understanding of the roles
and responsibilities of various entities involved in state land management and identifying the
barriers and constraints to effective land management. Bank work is gaining prominence
among key decision makers and a presentation for the Ministerial Cabinet is planned for
November 2013.



Assessment of 'Digital Oasis' project idea and support to the preparation of ICT-SME and
Outsourcing Framework. The Bank is supporting Kuwait’s Central Agency for Information
Technology (CAIT) with: (i) the assessment of the feasibility of a 'Digital Oasis' project; and,
(ii) the preparation of a framework for IT Outsourcing; and (iii) the promotion of SME's in ICT.



Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA – Phase II) – In follow up to the PEFA
exercise conducted in FY11, MoF requested Bank support to help build capacity and improve
Ministry teams understanding of the PEFA framework and help them play a more active role in
the preparation of future PEFA assessments. The Project also aims at improving the
comprehension of the PEFA framework at the senior leadership level to help them better utilize
the framework and make informed and strategic PFM reform policies that will serve the interest
of the State of Kuwait.



Support to Kuwait Anti-Corruption Agency (KAA). Bank support to the recently established
KAA includes support for the drafting of executive regulation and bylaws for the high anticorruption commission as well as the sharing of best practice examples of administrative and
financial functions. The Bank team is advising the KAA on organizational structure and providing
ToRs and job profiles for KAA administrative and financial functions.



Subsidies Incidence Analysis. At the request of the Ministry of Finance the Bank is analyzing
the impact of the potential removal of certain subsidies (fuel, electricity and water). The Bank is
providing MoF with a note simulating the incidence of removal of these subsidies on
Households, the national establishments and the budget.
II – Economic diversification through increased private sector development



Kuwait Foreign Investment Bureau (KFIB) Support. The World Bank is supporting KFIB in
developing feasibility studies and master plan(s) for three new economic zones for foreign
investors (Wafra, Abdali, and Shegaya). KFIB has contracted a private consulting firm to conduct

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KUWAIT

the feasibility study and a World Bank team is supporting KFIB during the implementation of the
study, through review of the consultant’s outputs and providing comments to ensure quality
output:


Privatization Support. At the request of the Minster of Finance the World Bank has been
supporting the implementation of a recently passed Privatization Law. Bank support included
helping draft By-Laws for the law and a policy (vision) statement to provide additional rationale
and explanation for the draft By-Laws. Bank support also included Portfolio development
through sector assessments. Further Bank assistance may include transaction support, public
education, and support to enhance corporate governance and post-privatization reforms.



ROSC Insolvency & Creditor Rights. Ministry for Commerce and Industry (MoCI) requested
Bank’s support in moving forward with a number of reforms to help improve Kuwait’s
investment climate starting with a review of Insolvency and Creditors Rights in Kuwait (ICR).
Bank work led to a recommendation for the need for new laws regulating Enterprise
Rehabilitation and Liquidation in Kuwait. Subsequently, a World Bank TA program has been
agreed with MoCI for the Bank to support: (i) the development of a functional workout
framework to stabilize and help recovery of Investment Companies and the enterprise sector;
(ii) reforms to improve liquidation and rehabilitation procedures, including the promotion of
more reliable access to credit information for credit providers, wider access to credit based on
security interests in movable assets, and a registry governing security interests in movable
assets; and (iii) enhancing professional development of commercial judicial specialization.



Kuwait Competition Protection Agency Support. The World Bank is supporting the successful
implementation of the competition law and policy in Kuwait. The Bank is effectively providing a
comprehensive technical assistance program for setting up the Competition Protection
Authority and tackling key challenges at the beginning of CPA’s operation. Bank support will be
delivered in three consecutive phases: Phase I - Institutional development; Phase II - Capacity
building/training; Phase III - Advocacy and Cooperation.



Support to the National Fund for Small and Medium Enterprise Development. At the
request of the government the World Bank is providing support to the SME Fund in: (i) helping
develop the Executive Regulations of the SME Fund – as a Phase I of the activity, and; (ii) support
in the development of Fund’s strategy and business plan; and organizational governance and
service lines. This activity aligns with the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), and the World
Bank's Finance and Private Sector regional strategy (2012) to: (i) Support private sector
development and economic diversification; (ii) Unleash innovation and competitive industries;
and (iii) Enhance access to finance.
III – Human development



KUWAIT

Bank is partnering with MoE in expanding the cooperation program to improve the output of
the education process, including through work on curriculum, and developing a school
leadership framework. The World Bank work in the education sector has further expanded to
include support the work of the National Center for Assessment and Evaluation (NCAE) as well
as support for the development of a strong higher education sector strategy, which will include
a sector review and benchmarking to regional and more global standards.


Development of Social Safety Net Strategic Framework. Kuwait’s Ministry of Social Affairs
and Labor (MOSAL) requested World Bank support to develop a more coherent Social Safety
Net Strategic Framework. Under this activity the Bank is supporting the Government of Kuwait in
undertaking an assessment of existing social policies and programs in Kuwait, and developing a
Social Safety Net Strategic Framework that is consistent with international practices, and
grounded within the socio-economic context of Kuwait.



STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of October 14, 2014)
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Despite further
improvements in the current year, there is scope for improved compilation of the national accounts and
balance of payments statistics through better coordination among statistical agencies. Timeliness, particularly
for the national and fiscal accounts, is an area of concern.
National Accounts and Production: Past improvements of national accounts include: change of the base year
for the constant price data to 2010 and the estimates of value added for subsidized goods and services of the
public utilities sector through the use of input costs (the household expenditure survey was used previously).
Continued progress, especially in the estimation of value added for the oil sector, requires the dedication of
adequate resources and improved coordination between the Ministries of Planning, Oil, and Finance. The IMF’s
statistics department (STA) has provided technical assistance to the Ministry of Planning to improve national
accounts and price data. It would be useful if the Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK) would publish oil sector
information in the Quarterly Statistical Bulletin pertaining to output, refining, domestic consumption, export
price for crude and refined products and the domestic price of petroleum products. These data are available
from the Ministry of Oil. Timeliness of the data needs to be improved. In the last few years, delays in the
production of price indexes caused long lags in the production of real GDP data. Recent improvements in the
compilation of statistics are expected to reduce publication lags and produce quarterly data.
Price statistics
CPI weights are based on the 2007 household expenditure survey and were introduced into the index for a
reference year of 2007. An improved monthly CPI based on a revised basket has been published in monthly CPI
bulletins with about a one-month lag. The wholesale price index (WPI) needs to be developed into a producer
price index (PPI) which is consistent with the national accounts and includes all domestically produced goods,
ex-factory, for the export and the domestic market. The PPI development has been ongoing, and the PPI is
expected to be published by end-2014.
Government finance statistics: Annual GFS data are reported for publication in the Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook (GFSY). The major components of extrabudgetary revenues (investment income and
transfers of profits of public institutions), extrabudgetary expenditures (interest on foreign debt and treasury
paper), and financing operations conducted by two reserve funds are not reported. Data on interest on foreign
debt and treasury paper are usually provided to Article IV consultation missions, but the regular provision of
data on investment income is lacking.
The authorities have made some progress in fiscal data presentation, but the lack of a suitable classification of
data on the execution of the budget remains a constraint on monitoring effectively fiscal developments during
the year. The authorities’ presentation is not yet fully compliant with the GFSM 2001 guidance, but progress is

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

KUWAIT

being made in terms of creating a new chart of accounts and moving reporting to an accrual basis.
Data on the operations of the Public Institute for Social Security are not made available. Sharing of information
between various government agencies could be improved. STA has indicated to the authorities that operations
of the two reserve funds should be classified as part of government, as they perform activities for public policy
purposes (management of debt and assets, and financing of the budget). An additional extension of coverage
would be to report GFS in the form of the Statement of Sources and Uses of Cash for the consolidated central
government. The authorities have also been briefed on the IMF’s ongoing work to enhance the transparency of
fiscal accounts and presentations detailed in the “Code of Good Practices on Fiscal Transparency” and were
encouraged to adopt some of the practices recommended in the Code.
Monetary and financial statistics
The CBK reports monetary data to STA on a regular and timely basis based on the Standardized Report Forms
(SRFs). CBK needs to work further to distinguish a number of investment companies that accept deposits from
other investment companies that do not accept deposits. Investment companies that accept deposits should
appropriately be classified as part of the depository corporations sector. In the current SRFs, all investment
companies (including those that accept deposits) are classified as other financial corporations. However, the
amount of deposits accepted by investment companies is considered as not significant. The Capital Markets
Authority needs to collate and disseminate information related to investment companies.
Balance of Payments Statistics: The CBK compiles and disseminates detailed annual data in accordance with
the methodology of the BPM6, while trade data estimates are disseminated monthly. However, data on capital
flows of the nonfinancial private sector are limited. To improve coverage for inward foreign direct investment,
the CBK is making efforts to obtain more data by surveying direct investment enterprises. The Central
Statistical Office (CSO), working with the CBK, implemented the IMF’s Coordinated Direct Investment Survey in
2010-12. This initiative should improve foreign direct investment statistics. Enhancements have been made in
the estimation of travel services and communication services, but further improvements are needed in
compilation practices and in the estimation of data on several service items and private transfers.
A major step forward in 2007 was the dissemination of IIP data for 2001 onwards in STA publications. However,
the information on IIP data made available to staff is incomplete as it excludes the external assets held by the
general government due to domestic legal constraints on dissemination (however, loans granted by the
Kuwaiti Fund for Arab Economic Development and general government trade credits are included).
The CBK also participates in the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) with data reported for 2003
onwards, and in the recently introduced Coordinated Direct Investment Survey. These data are for the financial
sector acting as end-investors or as intermediaries on behalf of residents and do not include holdings of
foreign securities held by government agencies, which comprise the bulk of Kuwait’s cross-border holdings.
In 2009, STA provided TA on improving external accounts data. The CBK has made good progress since then,
particularly in the substantial revisions to report forms, including the separate reporting of financial
transactions in the BOP and other changes in volume in the international investment position. It has also made
progress in the estimation of remittances data. Yet, delays and data gaps remain. In particular, coordination
among major government entities is needed to provide quarterly data to the CBK in time to compile timely
quarterly statistics. Trade data are compiled by the CSO annually and from 2013, on a quarterly basis.

Data Standards and Quality

Kuwait is one of the first GDDS participants.

No data ROSC is available.

However, most of its metadata, with the exception
of the real sector and socio-demographic
metadata, have not been updated since
October 2002. The CBK maintains its own
webpage where it provides the following data to
the public: money and banking statistics; balance
of payments statistics; trade balance statistics;
exchange rate; GDP by sector and expenditure at
current and constant prices; public finance
statistics; CPI and WPI; and security market
indicators. Similarly, the Ministry of Planning has a
webpage where the CSO publishes data on
national accounts, prices, and other related
statistics. The Ministry of Finance webpage
includes detailed data for actual and estimated
budget operations. In addition, the Kuwait Stock
Exchange webpage provides data on stock market
indices, volume and value of securities traded, as
well as privatization schedules and other related
information.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 9, 2014

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Kuwait
On December 5, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Kuwait and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal without
a meeting.2
Economic activity picked up in 2014. Non-oil growth is projected at 3.5 percent driven by a
combination of continued increase in domestic consumption and some pick-up in government
capital spending and private investment. Flat oil production would keep the overall real GDP
growth positive at 1.3 percent. The average inflation rate is forecast to remain at about 3 percent.
The current account and fiscal surpluses are expected to remain high.
Banks are amply capitalized and liquid with stable profits. Banks have a combined capital
adequacy ratio of 18.3 percent, falling gross non-performing loans (NPLs) of 3.5 percent (driven
by a combination of lower NPLs in real estate and equity, a pick-up in loan growth and
continued write-offs of loans), and a growing provisioning ratio (general plus specific
provisions) of 139 percent. Risks to the financial system from investment companies are
contained, although a few companies continue to make losses and deleverage and restructure
their balance sheets and operations.
The medium-term economic outlook is favorable. Non-oil GDP growth is expected to pick up to
4.0–5.0 percent in the medium term, supported by government investment in infrastructure and
the oil sector, and by consumption. The fiscal and current account surpluses are projected to be
significantly lower in the baseline scenario. The main downside risk to the outlook arises from a
sustained decrease in oil prices as well as slow implementation of the Development Plan (public
investment program).

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.
2

The Executive Board takes decisions under its lapse-of-time procedure when the Board agrees that a proposal can
be considered without convening formal discussions.

2

Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2014 Article IV Consultation with Kuwait, Executive Directors endorsed
staff’s appraisal, as follows:
The economic outlook for Kuwait remains favorable. Non-oil GDP growth in Kuwait is expected
to further accelerate to 4.0 percent in 2015, and is projected to increase to 4.5–5.0 percent in the
medium term in the baseline scenario. It is vital for the government and the parliament to agree
on an agenda to place the public investment program on track, and continue with economic
reforms to achieve this growth.
The fiscal position is currently strong but restraint in current spending is needed to preserve
buffers and increase saving for future generations. A medium-term fiscal strategy is required to
drive reforms, the elements of which would include containing current expenditure growth,
particularly subsidies and wages, prioritizing capital expenditure, and increasing non-oil revenue.
Subsidy reform needs to be supported by an effective communication strategy raising awareness
about the cost of subsidies and the benefits of reform, and accompanied by targeted mitigating
measures, especially to protect the vulnerable segment of the population. The proposed wage
reform would be more effective if it operates within overall expenditure limits, aligns incentives
for reducing the wage gap between public and private sector jobs and contains public
employment.
Prioritizing capital expenditure towards social and physical infrastructure projects would help
strengthen growth. Higher capital spending should be accompanied by improved efficiency of
public investment, and integrated with the budget formulation process. Drawing lessons from
experience with the current Development Plan (2010–14), which fell short of targets, the new
plan (2015–19) should set realistic targets that are consistent with the overall economic
objectives and increase safeguards to ensure better implementation. A cost-benefit analysis of
mega projects is warranted.
A key challenge will be to strengthen the fiscal policy framework to support fiscal reforms.
Medium-term fiscal framework would support implementation of the desirable fiscal measures.
Strengthening the macro-fiscal unit would facilitate preparation of macroeconomic forecasts and
improve revenue and expenditure projections. Other elements would include combining the
medium-term frameworks with the annual budget process, while preparing for an adoption of
fiscal rules. The implementation of a public investment management system would help increase
the efficiency of public investment.
While the current regulatory framework has effectively contained financial risks, enhancing the
macroprudential policy framework would further strengthen systemic stability. Effective and

3
prudent regulation by the central bank has ensured high capitalization and provisioning and
maintained banking system stability. Developing a formal macroprudential framework that gives
the CBK a formal mandate for ensuring financial stability and enhanced coordination across
regulators would further contribute to financial stability. The macroprudential policy framework
should consider further strengthening the central bank’s early warning system for identifying and
monitoring systemic risks, with macro stress testing being an integral part of systemic
surveillance, and the use of macroprudential policies in a countercyclical manner.
The systemic risk from investment companies (ICs) is contained, but strengthened oversight and
governance, and some consolidation is required to prevent potential financial stability risks. The
completion of the new draft of corporate bankruptcy law, with support from an effective
oversight and communication campaign by the Capital Markets Authority, could help expedite
the restructuring of some loss-making ICs, engender consolidation, and ensure implementation
of the corporate governance code by June 2016.
Economic diversification into areas with potential for national employment should constitute a
key policy priority. Improving the business environment, infusing stronger governance in public
administration, and providing a greater role for small and medium-sized enterprises, are needed
to take this agenda forward. In addition a number of policy measures such as strengthening
private sector competition, implementing labor market reforms, and limiting government
employment could help realign incentives for firms and national workers to promote
entrepreneurship and pursue private sector jobs. For instance, a review of competition policy law
and its implementation and of policies related to procurement procedures and barriers to entry of
new firms could help increase competition. Diversification could benefit from integrating the
private sector through backward and forward linkages in upstream and downstream input
industries.
Further developing domestic financial markets will help the diversification process and reduce
concentration risks. Developing domestic debt markets would bring important benefits, such as
providing alternatives to funding large infrastructure investment projects. Expediting the legal
framework for the issuance of sukuk would help deepen this market.
Considerable progress has been made in improving the quality and availability of key economic
data. Staff encourages the authorities to further their efforts in improving all areas of economic
data, particularly in the areas of government finance, national accounts and real estate market
statistics, including through cooperation with GCCStat.
