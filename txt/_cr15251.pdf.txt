IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Saudi Arabia
On July 29, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV Consultation1 with Saudi Arabia.
Saudi Arabia has been one of the strongest growing economies in the G-20. Rising oil prices and
production resulted in large external and fiscal surpluses and strong government spending led to
robust private sector activity. Over the past year, however, the global oil market environment has
changed substantially with oil prices dropping by close to 50 percent.
Real GDP growth is projected to slow to 2.8 percent this year, and then further to 2.4 percent in
2016 as government spending begins to adjust to the lower oil price environment. Over the
medium-term, growth is expected to be around 3 percent. Inflation is likely to remain subdued.
The decline in oil prices is resulting in substantially lower export and fiscal revenues. A central
government fiscal deficit of 19.5 percent of GDP is projected in 2015, and while the deficit will
decline in 2016 and beyond as one-off spending ends and large investment projects are
completed, it will remain high over the medium-term. Nevertheless, government debt is very low
and was 1.6 percent of GDP at end-2014. The current account surplus declined to 10.9 percent of
GDP in 2014. It is expected to move into a small deficit in 2015 but return to surplus during
2016-20. Deposit inflows to banks and private credit growth have slowed in recent months.
Nonetheless, the banking system is well positioned to weather lower oil prices and the growth
slowdown.
The decline in oil prices has increased the importance of structural reforms to switch the focus of
growth away from the public sector and toward the private sector. With unemployment of
nationals still high and the working-age population growing strongly, the government is
continuing to focus on reforms that aim to increase the employment of nationals in the private
sector and diversify the economy away from its reliance on oil.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed Saudi Arabia’s strong economic performance while noting that
the large decline in oil prices is likely to dampen growth in the period ahead. Directors
considered that uncertainties about future oil prices and possible escalations of regional tensions
are the main risks to the outlook. They commended Saudi Arabia’s commitment to promoting
stability in the global oil market and to providing financial support for developing countries in
the region.
Directors noted that the sharp drop in oil revenues and continued expenditure growth would
result in a very large fiscal deficit this year and over the medium term, eroding the fiscal buffers
built up over the past decade. Against this background, they underscored the need for a gradual,
but sizable multi-year fiscal adjustment based on a mix of expenditure and revenue measures.
These measures should include comprehensive energy price reforms, firm control of the public
sector wage bill, greater efficiency in public sector investment, and an expansion of non-oil
revenues, including by introducing a VAT and a land tax. Directors agreed that issuing debt to
finance part of the deficit is appropriate and would help promote the development of private
capital markets.
Directors concurred that a stronger fiscal framework would support fiscal consolidation. The
annual budget should be set within a medium-term fiscal framework that clearly establishes the
authorities’ policy intentions, fully integrates the expenditure priorities from the national
development plan, and delinks expenditures from short-term volatility in oil revenues while
ensuring that spending adjusts to longer-term price trends. Directors welcomed the authorities’
plan to establish a macro fiscal unit and publish fiscal data in GFSM2001 format.
Directors agreed that the banking system is in a strong position to weather lower oil prices and
weaker growth and supported continuing efforts to strengthen financial sector regulation and
supervision. They saw merit in formalizing the macroprudential policy framework to ensure
coordination among key agencies and to build on the existing use of macroprudential tools in a
countercyclical manner.
Directors agreed that the exchange rate peg to the U.S. dollar remains appropriate. They
emphasized the need for fiscal consolidation to support the peg over the long term and saw merit
in periodically reviewing the peg in coordination with other GCC countries to assess the impact
of labor market and other structural reforms.
Directors supported ongoing policies to increase the employment of nationals in the private
sector and diversify the economy. They welcomed efforts to strengthen the business
environment, develop infrastructure, invest in education and training, and increase employment
opportunities for women. Directors emphasized, however, that achieving the authorities’ goals
will require realigning the incentives facing firms and workers to encourage tradable rather than
nontradable production and employment in the private rather than public sector.
Directors noted the continued progress that Saudi Arabia is making in improving the quality and
availability of key economic statistics and welcomed the authorities’ plan to subscribe to SDDS
in 2016.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 13, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Context. The global oil market environment has changed substantially over the past
year with oil prices dropping by close to 50 percent. Based on historical experience, the
large oil price decline is expected to affect the macroeconomy and the financial sector.
Meanwhile, demographic pressures to provide jobs and housing for a rapidly growing
and young population continue.
Outlook and risks. Real GDP growth is projected to slow in 2015 and 2016. Downside
risks to the growth outlook stem mainly from lower oil prices, any slowing of the
domestic reform agenda, and an escalation of regional tensions.
Macroeconomic policies. The fiscal deficit is expected to reach 19½ percent of GDP in
2015, and while it will decline in 2016 as one-off spending ends, it will remain high over
the medium-term. A gradual but sizeable and sustained fiscal consolidation needs to
begin, underpinned by a stronger fiscal framework. Monetary policy settings and the
peg to the U.S. dollar remain appropriate for the Saudi economy.
Financial Sector. The banking system is in a strong position to weather lower oil prices
and weaker growth. SAMA’s regulation and supervision is being strengthened further
through a number of reforms. Formalizing the macroprudential framework to clearly
establish responsibilities and the way countercyclical policy tools will be used would
further enhance policy implementation.
Managing demographic pressures. The decline in oil prices has increased the
importance of structural reforms to switch the locus of growth away from the public
sector and toward the private sector. The government is making considerable efforts to
diversify the economy and raise the private sector employment of nationals. More needs
to be done to realign incentives for firms to export and workers to seek private sector
jobs. Measures to provide affordable housing need to be implemented cost effectively.

CONTEXT
1.
While activity has slowed in recent years, Saudi Arabia has been one of the strongest
growing economies in the G-20 (Figure 1). Over the past decade, rising oil prices and production
resulted in large external and fiscal surpluses. The economy benefited from strong government
spending, boosting private sector activity, while government deposits in the banking system
increased to nearly 56 percent of GDP and government debt declined to about 1½ percent of GDP
by end-2014 (Table 1). Inflation has been moderate and human and social development indicators
have improved considerably.
2.
Power transferred to King Salman following the death of King Abdullah in January.
A reorganization of government has occurred under the new administration with numerous
committees being abolished and two ministries being merged. Two new high-level councils have
been created to streamline policymaking—the Council of Economic and Development Affairs and
Historical Oil Price Declines and Changes in Production
the Council for Political and Security

Oil prices have fallen by close to
50 percent since mid-2014. The price
decline appears to have been driven partly
by demand weakness, but more
importantly by supply factors (particularly
rising oil production in the U.S., and
continued high levels of OPEC output). In
contrast to earlier periods of sharp oil
price declines (1981-86, 1998–99 and
2008–09), Saudi Arabia has not cut its
production. Indeed, production increased
to 10.4 mb/d in June.

Note: For the first three episodes, peak production is the highest level of production achieved prior
to the identified episode of declining oil prices, while the trough represents the lowest level of

change in production. For the 2014-15 episode, July 2014 is set as the start of the episode and
changes in production are calculated relative to July 2014 using latest available IEA monthly
production data.

4.
Managing demographic pressures from a rapidly growing and young population is a
key challenge for policymakers. The Saudi labor force has been growing by over 5 percent a year.
Within the labor market, Saudi nationals are employed primarily in the public sector, while the
private sector relies on low-wage, low-skilled expatriate labor. Going forward, providing attractive
private sector jobs to Saudi youth will require diversification of the economy into high-productivity
activities and ensuring that Saudi youth have the requisite skills for these positions. Labor market
reforms together with investments in affordable housing to help younger people and the less welloff population enter the housing market are key elements of the government’s policy agenda.
Progress has been made in implementing many of the recommendations made in the 2014 Article
IV consultation, except in the fiscal area.

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SAUDI ARABIA

Status of Staff Recommendations Made During the 2014 Article IV Consultation
Recommendation

Current Status

Fiscal adjustment is needed to preserve buffers and
increase saving for intergenerational equity.

Fiscal consolidation did not happen in 2014. The non-oil
primary fiscal deficit (in percent of non-oil GDP) increased
as expenditure on goods and services and capital projects
grew strongly.

Strengthen the fiscal policy framework.

Progress has been limited. A macro-fiscal unit has been
budgeted for, but not yet established. Expenditures in the
2015 budget are likely to again be well below actual
outcomes.

An upward adjustment in energy prices is needed to
contain the growth in domestic energy demand.

Consideration is being given to energy price reforms for
commercial and industrial users. The government is also
focusing on improving efficiency standards. The
development of public transportation networks is
underway.

Introduce a tax on high-end property and/or vacant land.

The Council of Ministers has approved a tax on vacant land
and is determining the modalities.

Introduce a formal, clear, and transparent macroprudential framework.

A high-level Financial Stability Committee has been
established within SAMA. Early Warning Systems (EWS)
have been strengthened. A Financial Stability Report has
been published.

Introduce reforms to strengthen financial regulation and
supervision.

The D-SIB framework has been published and identified
banks have until January 2016 to comply with the higher
capital charges. A LTV ratio for mortgage lending has been
introduced, and all finance companies now need to be
licensed by SAMA.

Policies are needed to increase the employment of Saudis
in the private sector and spur diversification.

The authorities are continuing to develop their labor
market strategy and private sector hiring of Saudi nationals
has increased. Some increase in mobility for expatriate
workers has been introduced. Investments in infrastructure
and education are continuing.

Further improve economic statistics.

Progress is continuing. Rebased (to 2010) national
accounts data has been published, while quarterly IIP data
is submitted to the Fund. However, there is no official real
estate price index, wage data is sparse and inconsistent,
and fiscal data in GFSM2001 format has not been
published.

MACRO-FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK,
RISKS, AND SPILLOVERS
A. Recent Macro-Financial Developments and Outlook
5.
Economic and financial developments are interwoven with the oil cycle in Saudi
Arabia. Past episodes of large oil price declines have been associated with a strong impact on
macroeconomic and financial sector outcomes (Figure 2). Lower oil revenues have led to weaker
fiscal and external positions, a drop in equity prices as markets anticipate the impact of lower oil
prices on the corporate sector, and generally slower government spending growth. In turn, slower
government spending has led to weaker non-oil activity, tighter banking sector liquidity, lower credit
growth, and weaker bank balance

2008–09, the government was able
to maintain spending given the strong fiscal position, in 1998–99 it was not. And as the 1980s
showed, even large buffers can be eroded if the price drop is sustained. The dependence of the
economy on oil has remained high despite efforts at diversification —although there has been some
progress in recent years in developing non-oil exports, these are concentrated in petrochemicals
and are also exposed to oil price movements.

affected by the oil price (and petrochemical price) fall, and the current account surplus declined
from 18.2 percent of GDP in 2013 to 10.9 percent of GDP in 2014 (Table 4, Figure 4).
7.
Deposit inflows to banks and private sector credit growth have slowed. Bank deposit
growth slowed to 10 percent (y-o-y) in May, down from an average of 13½ percent in 2014,
while private sector credit growth was about 9½ percent, down from an average of 12½ percent.
Corporate balance sheets are generally in good shape (Box 1), but corporate profits have fallen, led
by the petrochemicals sector. The exchange rate initially came under modest downward pressure,
but this has abated. Equity markets declined in 2014H2, but have partially recovered since the
beginning of the year as oil prices have stabilized and in anticipation of the opening of the market
to qualified foreign investors (which took place on June 15). No data is available to assess the
position of household balance sheets.
8.
Real GDP growth has slowed since 2014 and inflation has eased. Following a strong
start, real GDP growth slowed during the course of 2014, reflecting a decline in oil production and
weakening non-oil output growth. For the

largely due to global food price trends and
the effective appreciation of the exchange rate (Figure 6).
9.
Employment growth was strong in 2014, but the unemployment rate for nationals
remained high. Employment grew by 3.2 percent in 2014, with Saudi employment growing by
4.4 percent and non-Saudi by 2.2 percent. Nevertheless, the unemployment rate for nationals stood
at 11.7 percent at end-2014, unchanged from a year earlier. The Gini coefficient which was published
by CDSI with the 2013 Household Income and Expenditure Survey stood at 45.9 in 2013, down from
51.3 in 2007.1
10.
Looking forward, the decline in oil prices is expected to have a continuing impact on
economic and financial developments. In particular:



Growth is expected to slow to 2.8 percent this year, and then further to 2.4 percent in
2016. The recent increase in oil production is expected to boost oil GDP growth to 2.4 percent
this year, before it slows in 2016. Non-oil private sector growth is projected at 3.4 percent in
2015 and 3.8 percent in 2016. Over the medium-term, growth is expected to settle around
3 percent. Oil GDP is projected to grow by around 1.5 percent a year from 2017–20, driven by
domestic consumption, while non-oil growth is expected to be around 4¼–4½ percent, lower
than the average non-oil growth of close to 7 percent during 2009-13. However, given the likely
slowing of government spending, this outcome will depend on private sector growth becoming
more self-sustaining as a result of the ongoing reforms. Without a reform dividend, non-oil
private sector growth could be about 1 percentage point a year lower because of weaker
government spending, translating into lower overall growth of about 0.4 percentage points a
year.



A large fiscal deficit is projected in 2015, and only a partial narrowing is expected over the
medium-term. Government spending is projected by staff to increase by about 5 percent this
year as some slowdown in capital spending offsets increased current expenditures, although the

With the partial recovery of oil prices, this expenditure path will result in the fiscal deficit
narrowing to 9½ percent of GDP by 2020. Government deposits with the banking system would
be run-down to about 12 percent of GDP, and debt would increase to 33½ percent of GDP by
2020 (the assumption is that the government uses a combination of debt and deposits to
finance the fiscal deficits).

Note: Total private sector credit is computed as the sum of loans by the Specialized Credit Institutions, private sector credit by domestic
banks, and the outstanding stock of foreign currency debt securities and local currency securities held outside banks.



Inflation should remain subdued. Inflation is expected to pick up modestly as food prices start
rising, but rent pressures may ease as housing supply increases, and inflation is projected at just
below 3 percent in the medium-term.



The current account is projected to move into a deficit of about 1 percent of GDP in 2015
as export receipts fall, but should return to surplus during 2016–20. Portfolio outflows are
expected to decline as domestic liquidity tightens, while portfolio inflows will likely increase with
the opening of the equity market to foreign investors. SAMA’s NFA have fallen by $52 billion
since the beginning of 2015, and are expected to continue to decline over the medium-term.

11.
Higher U.S. interest rates and the appreciation of the U.S. dollar are likely to play
secondary roles to oil prices and fiscal policy in determining the outlook. While the expected
gradual normalization in U.S. monetary policy will lead to higher interest rates in Saudi Arabia given
the peg, it is difficult empirically to uncover a significant impact of interest rates on the non-oil
economy. The appreciation of the U.S. dollar will impact the real effective exchange rate, making
imported goods cheaper and increasing their consumption, but only a modest effect on non-oil
exports is expected.

B. Risks and Spillovers
12.
Risks to the growth outlook are tilted to the downside. The main downside risks are
the possibility of lower oil prices due either to weaker global demand or increased supply, the
possibility that domestic reforms do not generate a growth dividend and create a more diversified
and self-sustaining private sector that creates jobs and reduces inequality, and an escalation of
regional tensions that undermines confidence and investment. On the upside, a stronger than
expected rebound in oil prices would boost growth. In the absence of fiscal adjustment, growth
could also be stronger in the near-term, but fiscal risks would rise over the medium-term with
negative implications for longer-term growth and macroeconomic stability. Increased volatility in
global oil markets would also present challenges for macroeconomic management. Global financial
risks, unless they manifest themselves in lower oil prices, are less important given the limited
financial linkages with the global economy. These risks are discussed in the risk assessment matrix.
13.
The oil market is the most important channel for inward and outward global spillovers
from Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia plays a key role in the global oil market and in determining OPEC
policy. Its spare production capacity provides important insurance against negative supply shocks as
demonstrated during 2011 and 2013 when Libyan production declined sharply. At the current
juncture, the authorities believe there is considerable uncertainty about the oil market outlook—
while demand should pick up with a stronger global economy, it is not clear when and by how much
supply in non-OPEC countries will adjust nor whether supply from other OPEC members will
increase. The authorities noted that they have increased production and exports in recent months to
maintain market share in the face of still growing demand for Saudi Arabia’s oil. Given Saudi Arabia’s
low production costs, the authorities believe that other producers will have to reduce supply and
adjust to the new market environment.
14.
Saudi Arabia has other important outward regional spillovers. Saudi Arabia has
important effects on the Middle East and south Asian countries through remittances, financial
assistance, and imports. Given the slowdown in government capital spending, remittances are
projected to fall this year and recover only slowly thereafter. Financial assistance is continuing, with
additional aid recently committed to Egypt.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The decline in oil revenues has underscored the need for gradual but sizable fiscal adjustment and
a more ambitious reform agenda to shift the economic growth model away from the government
and toward the private sector. Against this background, discussions focused on two main themes
(i) maintaining macroeconomic stability in an environment of low oil prices, and (ii) further reforms
to manage demographic pressures and enable sustained and inclusive private-sector led growth.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SAUDI ARABIA

A. Maintaining Macroeconomic Stability
Fiscal policy—consolidation needed, supported by a stronger fiscal framework
15.
Government spending has increased substantially in recent years. Consequently, the
breakeven oil price rose to $106 a barrel in 2014 from $69 a barrel in 2010. As a result, with the large
decline in oil prices, the fiscal deficit has increased sharply and is likely to remain high over the
medium-term. These deficits will rapidly erode the fiscal buffers (in the form of government deposits
and low public debt) that have been built over the past decade (Appendix I, Figure 8). If the
underlying (i.e. excluding one-off spending) non-oil fiscal deficit remains at its estimated 2015 level
over the medium-term (scenario i, Figure 8), net financial wealth (defined as government deposits in
the banking system less gross public debt) would turn negative in 2017 (and in 2016/2019 in a
lower/higher oil price environment). In the baseline scenario, net financial wealth turns negative in
2018 (scenario ii, Figure 8).
16.
Staff emphasized the need for gradual but sizable fiscal consolidation to begin.
Fiscal buffers allow policymakers to smooth this adjustment and avoid sharp cuts in spending.
Nonetheless, a large adjustment is needed and should begin to help stabilize the net financial asset
position of the government over the medium-term. Building political support will be necessary to
implement the fiscal consolidation.
17.
Reforms to strengthen the fiscal framework would support the process of fiscal
consolidation. At present, expenditure routinely exceeds that set out in the annual budget, which
creates uncertainty about the government’s fiscal policy intentions and risks leading to inefficient
spending decisions (Table 7). Therefore, an important starting point for reforms is for the annual
budget to provide a full account of planned expenditures during the year, including from the
budget surplus fund. Moreover, the annual budget should be set within a medium-term framework
that clearly establishes the authorities’ fiscal goals and delinks expenditures from short-term
volatility in oil revenues while ensuring spending adjusts over time to longer-term price trends. The
medium-term framework should incorporate the spending priorities from the 5-year national
development plan, which should be regularly updated and linked to the annual budgets on a rolling
basis. The framework would also need to assess budget risks, including from future pension
commitments of the Public Pension Agency (PPA) and the General Organization for Social Insurance
(GOSI), and how they could be mitigated. Fiscal policy analysis and implementation would be
supported by a macro-fiscal unit, the introduction of the Government Financial Management
Information System (GFMIS) and the publication of fiscal data in GFSM2001 format.
18.
The authorities outlined their progress in strengthening the fiscal framework. The
authorities noted that positions for the new macro-fiscal unit had been included in the 2015 budget
and they would start filling these soon. In addition, progress was being made toward the publication
of fiscal data in the GFSM2001 format and they expected this to happen with the 2016 budget. They
also said they were producing but not publishing multi-year macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts.

20.
Staff recommended that fiscal adjustment could be achieved through a mix of
expenditure and revenue measures. Key measures that were discussed included:


Energy price reforms to raise revenues and reduce energy consumption growth. Gasoline
prices in Saudi Arabia are the lowest in the GCC. The implicit cost of low energy prices is
significant (8 percent of GDP this year using a price gap method between prices in Saudi Arabia
and pre-tax prices in the U.S.), and benefits accrue disproportionately to the wealthy and
encourage over-consumption. Raising domestic prices of gasoline and diesel products to the
average level in the GCC would yield an estimated 2.6 percent of GDP in revenues (compared to
6 percent of GDP if raised to the U.S. pre tax price levels). Raising energy prices gradually and
eventually introducing a price adjustment mechanism would help slow energy consumption,

as the sum of a long-term moving average of oil revenues and projected non-oil revenues.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

raise revenues to protect priority spending, allow improved targeting of benefits to lower and
middle income households, and help ensure automatic adjustment to future price changes. A
comprehensive energy price reform program would need to be accompanied by measures to
compensate low- and middle-income households and help energy-intensive firms (including the
electricity and water desalination companies) to adjust. It would also need to be communicated
clearly to build political support.


Reducing the government wage bill which is high compared to other oil exporting
countries. A civil service review could help identify non-essential positions, and a strategy put in
place to reduce government employment through attrition over time, while limiting wage
growth. An announcement that the government is no longer the employer of first resort would
set expectations and support efforts to increase the private sector employment of nationals.
Firm control of public sector wage increases would support this policy.



Increasing non-oil revenues to finance government services over the longer-term. The
non-oil tax regime is comparatively light with non-oil revenues (excluding investment income)
only about 7 percent of non-oil GDP in 2014. There is no personal income tax on wages,
although corporate profits, and business and professional incomes of individual Saudi citizens
are subject to zakat at 2.5 percent. The introduction of a VAT, as agreed at the GCC level, the
planned tax on vacant land, and a tax on high-end properties would strengthen the non-oil
revenue base.



Reviewing capital spending projects. At 16¾ percent of GDP in 2014, the government’s public
investment outlays (in transportation, health, and education sectors) have increased sharply over
the past decade (from about 7½ percent of GDP in 2007). Investment in these areas is
appropriate to support development goals and economic diversification efforts. However, while
the efficiency of public investment in Saudi Arabia is estimated to be close to the global average,
it is below that in advanced commodity exporters such as Australia, Canada, Chile, and Norway.
Given the size of the public investment program, improving its efficiency could yield substantial
savings. Project selection, monitoring, and appraisal processes should be reviewed to ensure
they are sufficiently robust, and a review of existing projects conducted to check they are closely
linked to, and efficiently meeting, developments goals with a view to making additional savings
in the capital spending budget.

21.
The authorities agreed on the need for gradual fiscal consolidation and emphasized
that measures on both the revenue and expenditure sides were already underway. The Council
for Economic and Development Affairs has asked ministries to submit proposals for expenditure
reduction, including through a reprioritization of capital expenditures, and has lowered the cost
threshold for its approval of new projects from SR 300 million to SR 100 million. Plans to build new
sports stadiums have been scaled back. On the revenue side, consideration is being given to energy
price reforms for commercial and industrial users. Additionally, with the GCC having recently
approved a VAT framework (and an excise tax on tobacco), Saudi Arabia can now move ahead with
its own VAT law. A tax on vacant land is planned, and could be used to finance expenditures on lowINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

SAUDI ARABIA

income housing. Overall, the authorities believed that they would be able to hold the 2015 fiscal
deficit at a lower level than projected by staff.
22.
The authorities explained that they plan to start issuing debt to finance the deficit.
Having financed the deficit so far from the deposits held with SAMA, debt issuance is likely to start
in the second half of the year. With large fiscal deficits looming, staff agreed there were benefits of
debt financing to help slow the erosion of government deposits in the banking system, take
advantage of the favorable financing environment, and build a yield curve to support the
development of domestic debt capital markets.
Maintaining financial stability if growth slows
23.
Banks are likely to face a more challenging environment in the period ahead. With the
economy heavily reliant on oil— either directly or indirectly through government spending—it is
difficult for Saudi banks which make up the largest part of the financial system (Appendix II) to
diversify their credit portfolios. Activity in the construction, commerce, and manufacturing sectors,
which account for 40 percent of total bank lending, is closely linked to the oil cycle, and balance
sheets in the construction sector are weaker than in other sectors.
24.
Nevertheless, there was agreement between the authorities and staff that banks are
well positioned to weather the growth slowdown. Profits in the banking sector and capital
buffers are strong (average pre-tax return on assets was 2.5 percent, and the capital adequacy ratio
was 17.9 percent at end-2014) and NPLs are low (1.1 percent of total loans). Staff estimates, based
on publicly available bank-by-bank data for 12 banks, suggest that while NPLs will likely rise
modestly over the medium-term (to around 2.8 percent) given lower oil prices and the expectation
of slower private sector growth, banks have more than enough provisions set aside to cover these
loan losses and capital ratios would remain stable. Bank balance sheets also appear able to absorb a
more significant worsening of the economic situation than is envisaged in the staff’s baseline
scenario. Given their strong liquidity positions, banks would come under significant liquidity
pressure only in the event of substantial deposit withdrawals which has not happened in previous
periods of oil price declines.
25.
SAMA explained that a number of key reforms were being introduced to strengthen
the banking sector. Progress has continued on the implementation of the 2011 FSAP Update
Recommendations (Appendix III) and the Basel III capital requirements. A Domestic-Systemically
Important Bank (D-SIB) methodology has been published, and identified D-SIBs will be required to
comply from January 2016. The framework for countercyclical capital buffers (CCB) is also being
developed in line with Basel guidelines. Draft legislation has been prepared to strengthen the
resolution and recovery regime for banks. In terms of concentration risk, an aggregate large
exposure limit of 400 percent of capital has been imposed, and single borrower exposure limits will
be reduced from 25 percent of capital at present to 15 percent by 2019. A loan-to-value (LTV) ratio

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SAUDI ARABIA

of 70 percent was introduced for mortgages in November 2014 (previously mortgages were often
given for 100 percent of the property value) and its impact on real estate activity and mortgage
lending is being monitored. Lastly, a deposit insurance fund will be introduced in January 2016
and built-up gradually. This will protect deposits in participating banks up to a maximum of
SR 200,000. SAMA also noted that while the impact of de-risking by several global banks in
response to enhanced implementation of global regulatory standards and economic and trade
sanctions has not had a significant impact on Saudi banks, they believed a dialogue was needed
between banks and regulators to ensure this did not become a problem for local and regional
banks.
26.
SAMA outlined the steps that are being taken to strengthen the macroprudential
framework. An early warning indicators dashboard has been established. Work is ongoing to
formalize the minimum microprudential requirements on capital (currently implemented through
the bank supervisory process at higher than minimum Basel requirements) and identify triggers that
could guide the use of countercyclical capital buffers in an oil-driven economy such as Saudi Arabia.
A high-level Financial Stability Committee has been established within SAMA to monitor financial
sector risks. The recent publication of the first Financial Stability Report will support this framework
and increase the transparency of policy operations to the public and financial markets.
27.
Staff suggested that a formal macroprudential policy framework could help guide the
countercyclical use of policies. In addition to steps already underway, a formal framework should
ensure coordination and assign responsibilities among SAMA, the Capital Markets Authority (CMA),
and the Ministry of Finance, to help strengthen macroprudential policy formulation and
implementation within and across institutions. The reliability of early warning indicators in signaling
potential systemic stress should be assessed to identify triggers that would activate the
countercyclical use of a broad set of macroprudential policies. The framework should provide
guidance on when and how macroprudential policies can be tightened or eased, while respecting
microprudential norms to maintain confidence and an appropriate degree of resilience against
future shocks. Microprudential norms should be set taking into consideration the lack of economic
diversification and concentration risks. Additionally, addressing data gaps would help SAMA better
monitor risks—developing a real estate price index and market activity indicators would be
especially useful to monitor emerging risks from mortgage lending.
28.
Staff recommended enhancing SAMA’s use of countercyclical macroprudential
policies. SAMA emphasized that it has used capital ratios, provisioning, and reserve requirements
countercyclically through past financial cycles, but outside of a formal framework. Bank dividend
payments also require prior approval from SAMA and this has helped maintain strong capital
buffers. Other macroprudential tools have also contributed to financial stability, albeit these have
not been adjusted over time. Staff suggested that, based on international experience, enhancing the
countercyclical use of macroprudential tools could help reduce the buildup of systemic risks in the
financial sector during oil price upswings, and cushion against disruption to financial services during

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

SAUDI ARABIA

oil price downswings. In addition to SAMA’s existing macroprudential tools, countercyclical caps on
sectoral exposures could also be used to reduce the financial sector’s vulnerability to specific sectors
that are exposed to government spending or asset price movements.
29.
There was agreement that a relaxation of macroprudential policies could be
considered if downside risks to the outlook materialize and systemic stress emerges. Staff
suggested that monitoring a number of high-frequency indicators closely can help assess risks to
financial stability. The decision to relax macroprudential policies will need to be based to a
considerable extent on judgment drawing on market intelligence, supervisory assessments, and
stress tests. Within a macroprudential framework, the relaxation of macroprudential instruments will
have to consider the available policy space and source of systemic stress—if policy space is assessed
to be available and liquidity pressures are the source of banking sector stress, easing reserve
requirements first would be appropriate. If this proves insufficient, the loan-to-deposit ratio could
also be relaxed. Strengthening its forecasting framework would help SAMA manage banking system
liquidity. If the stress is on asset quality, dynamic provisions may be allowed to decline first to
absorb losses. Putting a CCB framework in place would allow the relaxation of the CCB, should it be
needed after dynamic provisions have been reduced. At the same time, strong financial supervision
will remain essential to ensure the adequacy of the remaining capital and liquidity buffers. SAMA
agreed and considered that, with high existing levels of capital and liquidity buffers, some policy
space for the relaxation of macroprudential policies is available if it were to become needed.
30.
The coverage of macroprudential policies needs to be broadened to contain potential
leakages. Staff suggested that macroprudential instruments that are presently applicable only to
local banks should be extended to nonbanks and foreign branches. For CCBs, reciprocity
requirements (under the Basel III framework) could help ensure home-host cooperation in
minimizing leakages towards foreign branches. In addition, DTI (debt-service-to-income) limits
could be extended beyond personal and consumer loans to include all debt service paid by an
individual borrower, and LTV limits could be extended to commercial real estate loans (currently
applied on residential mortgages) or other corporate loans and investments secured by real estate
as collateral. SAMA indicated that an expansion in the scope of the DTI limits is under consideration.
31.
Staff welcomed efforts to strengthen the regulation of the nonbank financial sector,
develop capital markets, boost consumer protection and financial inclusion, and improve the
effectiveness of the AML/CFT regime. The measures that are planned or underway include:
Mortgage lending and regulation of nonbank financial institutions. Fourteen banks and five finance
companies have received real estate finance licenses, and a further 16 finance companies have been
licensed for other financing activities. With lending for real estate having risen by nearly 70 percent
(and now accounting for 12 percent of bank lending) over the past two years, the recently
implemented LTV ratio (which applies to banks and nonbanks) could help mitigate emerging risks,

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SAUDI ARABIA

but its impact will need to be periodically assessed. Regarding insurance, SAMA has been working
on improving the financial health of the sector to protect consumers and ensure companies are
well-positioned to support future demand for insurance products.
Capital market development. Debt capital markets in Saudi Arabia are currently under-developed,
hindered by the lack of a benchmark sovereign yield curve. The sovereign debt issuance now
planned can help build a yield curve to support their development. Creating a deep and liquid bond
market would increase financing options for companies, increase investment options for savers, and
support growth. At the same time, equity markets have been opened to qualified foreign investors,
who are now allowed to invest directly up to certain limits (implemented from June 15, 2015). This is
expected to expand the investor base and bring more stability to the market, which is currently
dominated by retail investors and public sector investment institutions (the Public Investment Fund
(PIF), GOSI, and the PPA—Figure 9).
Consumer protection and financial inclusion. The authorities are taking steps to increase the
transparency of bank fees and charges. On most measures, financial access in Saudi Arabia is
lower than in G-20 peers (Figure 10) and is being broadened, including through improving financial
access for SMEs from less developed regions of the country. In addition, the wage protection system
that is being introduced requires nationals and expatriates working in the private sector to have
bank accounts.
The AML/CFT regime. Saudi Arabia was recently admitted as an observer of the Financial Action Task
Force (FATF). Following the passage of the CFT law in 2013, SAMA has been working with banks to
identify weaknesses in their frameworks through thematic reviews and audits. Staffing levels to
monitor compliance, both within banks and at SAMA, have increased significantly.
External stability and the exchange rate
32.
Staff’s assessment suggests that the current account was broadly consistent with
fundamentals in 2014 (Appendix IV). Nevertheless, it is projected to be weaker than estimated
norms in 2015, mainly reflecting the large fiscal deficit, and therefore, a sizable fiscal adjustment will
be needed over time to bring the current account in line with fundamentals. The authorities argued
that caution was needed in interpreting the model-based assessments of the external position given
the uncertainties with such models, particularly in the case of a large oil exporter such as Saudi
Arabia. They also noted that the fiscal deficit was driven by large investments in infrastructure,
health, and education that would yield significant growth dividends, and considered the strong
external balance sheet and limited exposure to capital flows to be mitigating factors.
33.
Supported by the flexibility of the labor market, the exchange rate peg has provided
monetary policy credibility and has helped deliver low inflation and inflation volatility.
Nevertheless, with the U.S. dollar appreciation, the REER has appreciated by nearly 14 percent over
the past year while the terms of trade has fallen by over 30 percent in 2014–15. A more flexible
exchange rate would have benefits for the stability of fiscal revenues in nominal riyal terms and
enable a more independent interest rate policy, but given the structure of the economy (heavy
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

SAUDI ARABIA

reliance on oil exports and limited import competing industries which are anyway reliant on
imported inputs, including labor) would have very limited benefits for competitiveness and could
increase the volatility of inflation. Moving away from the peg would also remove a credible
monetary anchor, and reduce certainty for trade and investment.
34.
The authorities and staff agreed that the exchange rate peg remains appropriate
for the Saudi economy. Nevertheless, staff suggested that the peg be reviewed periodically
(in coordination with other GCC economies) to ensure it remains appropriate given the evolving
structure of the Saudi economy due to ongoing labor market reforms and efforts to increase
diversification. Meanwhile, reforms that would support a move to a more flexible regime, if this
became appropriate in the future, would be desirable in their own right and could proceed
(including strengthening liquidity management, improving monetary transmission by developing
money and debt markets, and improving data on foreign currency exposures of corporates).

B. Further Reforms to Manage Demographic Pressures and Ensure
Sustainable and Inclusive Growth
Job Creation for Nationals
35.
With a young population that is entering the labor force in large numbers each year,
creating sufficient well-paying and productive private-sector jobs for nationals is a pressing
challenge. It is not that job creation in the private sector has been a problem—employment growth
has been strong—but rather the majority of these jobs have been filled by expatriates. The overall
unemployment rate for nationals of 11.7 percent is high and masks considerable gender and age
variations (Box 3). Despite low labor force participation among women, female unemployment was
about 33 percent at end-2014. Youth unemployment was over 40 percent, and has been increasing.
With rising labor force participation for women, and over 35 percent of the population still under
the age of 19, these segments of the labor force will increase rapidly, underscoring the urgency of
creating private sector jobs for nationals.
36.
The authorities noted that they were continuing to implement their labor market
reform strategy to increase private sector employment of nationals. The reforms are designed
to make Saudi nationals more competitive in the private sector labor market, make private sector
jobs more attractive to nationals, and require or encourage private firms to hire nationals. These
initiatives can be grouped into five areas:


18

Requiring private sector companies to meet minimum rates of Saudi employment in their
workforce. The Nitaqat program requires companies to meet certain Saudization quotas that
vary by sector and size of company. The program has also been used to introduce a de facto
minimum wage for nationals of SR 3,000 a month.

Helping nationals develop the skills needed by the private sector. Spending on education
and training has been increased substantially and the number of university graduates is
increasing. Colleges of excellence, focusing on particular professions, have also been opened to
provide sector-specific skills.



Addressing the wage gap between Saudis and expatriate workers. A number of measures
are being taken to bridge the gap between expatriate wages and the reservation wage of Saudis.
Wage subsidies and payroll tax rebates for Saudi employees are available, and monthly fees
have been imposed on expatriate workers. The increased mobility of expatriate workers under
the Nitaqat scheme will likely increase their wages over time.



Supporting nationals in their job search. The Hafiz program provides financial support for
people searching for a job. Job placement services and an unemployment insurance program
have been introduced.



Reducing regulations and improving working conditions. Regulations on female employment
have been eased, with more sectors being opened for their employment. Proposals to reduce
the private sector work week from 45 to 40 hours and to limit late night opening in retail stores,
which will facilitate hiring of female workers, are being discussed.

37.
Staff noted that while the number of Saudis working in the private sector has
increased in recent years, more could be done to improve the incentives for private sector
employment. Public sector employment has also grown strongly and the unemployment rate has
remained high. The lack of data makes a full comparison of public and private sector wage rates
difficult, but revealed preference indicates that many Saudis, particularly the low-skilled, see the
public sector compensation package and work hours as more attractive than the private sector.
These workers then lack the incentives to invest in skills needed by the private sector. If the
availability of public sector jobs remains high, the labor market programs could prove less effective
and the fiscal position could be undermined. A clearly stated policy from the government that future
public sector employment opportunities will be very limited would help set expectations and
incentivize greater private sector job search and the acquisition of skills in relevant areas. The
authorities believed that with a large number of youth entering the labor market each year, strong
private sector job creation would be key to rationalizing public sector hiring.
38.
Increased private sector employment of nationals will have macroeconomic
implications over time. The availability of low-wage expatriate labor in the private sector has
underpinned the rapid economic development over the past four decades. It has helped contain
cost pressures during periods of strong growth, thereby helping deliver relatively low inflation,
limited real exchange rate appreciation, and flexibility to an economy with a pegged exchange rate.
As the structure of the private sector labor market evolves to one that is more reliant on nationals,
costs may rise and inflation may become more sensitive to the domestic non-oil output gap. On the
other hand, if the reduced availability of expatriate workers encourages increased investment and
productivity rises as higher skilled nationals enter the private sector, this may help offset higher
wage costs.

Economic Diversification
39.
The authorities are continuing reforms to boost economic diversification. A large
number of structural reforms have been implemented, including significant investments in human
capital and physical infrastructure and improvements to the business environment (Figure 11).
Financial policies are also supporting SME development through increased SME access to finance,
including through the establishment of dedicated SME units in banks, the Kafalah loan-guarantee
program, and better access to credit information through SIMAH, the national credit bureau. More
generally, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry is working to better coordinate and strengthen
the support to the SME sector. Elsewhere, work has started on a new insolvency law and contract
enforcement is being strengthened. Privatization of state-owned enterprises has restarted with the
sale of part of the government’s stake in National Commercial Bank (NCB). The government is
focusing on developing industrial clusters around oil and mining, and joint ventures in refining,
mining, petrochemicals, automobiles, pharmaceuticals, and banking.
40.
The incentives for diversification, however, are not fully developed. The rapid growth in
fiscal spending over the past decade has meant that most firms in Saudi Arabia can profitably
operate in the nontradable goods and services sectors, relying on demand from the government
and public sector workers rather than competing in the relatively risky tradables sector that can lead
to rising investment and productivity. This also has implications for the labor market as firms rely
mostly on low-wage low-skilled foreign workers, and generate few high-paying high-productivity
jobs. Moving toward a more diversified economy, a key goal of the 10th National Development Plan,
will require a change in the incentive structures. Measures could include reorienting public spending
and strengthening the role of private sector competition to incentivize firms to focus on tradable
rather than nontradable production. At the same time, improving the availability of finance and
insurance for export-oriented firms could enable them to produce in the riskier tradables sector.
Housing
41.
The government is continuing to implement its program to provide affordable
housing. In light of the growing population and reported high house prices in the major cities, this
is a considerable challenge. Estimates suggest that 160-180,000 new homes will need to be built
each year over the next few years to meet growing demand. The government has allocated
SR 250 billion from the budget surplus fund for the program, and the Ministry of Housing is
continuing to develop options to support buyers which include the provision of interest-free loans
(up to SR 500,000), and the payment of interest on behalf of the borrower for mortgage loans taken
out from banks. The provision of support to buyers is being allocated according to a points system
that favors those with greater need. On the supply side, options being developed include the
provision of free public sector land and the proposed “white lands tax” which would increase the
land available for housing.
42.
Staff emphasized the need for ensuring that the housing needs of the population
are met in a cost-effective way while minimizing the disruption to private real estate and
mortgage markets. Housing is appropriately an important policy priority, but the program cost is

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SAUDI ARABIA

high and to date it has moved slowly. Measures to expand supply should include a strengthened
role for the government acting as a facilitator and regulator rather than a developer to help expand
housing supply in a cost effective way. In this context, streamlining regulatory and approval
processes to achieve efficiency gains could improve the functioning of private real estate markets.
With respect to the support for buyers, financing should be targeted to those who are unable to
obtain financing from banks or finance companies, and focus on purchases of new dwellings to
avoid bidding real estate prices up further.
Statistical issues
43.
Efforts are continuing to strengthen economic statistics. Rebased (to 2010) national
accounts data has been published and quarterly IIP data is being submitted to the Fund. However,
there is no official real estate price index, FDI data is unavailable for recent years and data on
trade credit is of uncertain quality, wage data is sparse and inconsistent, an economically useful
breakdown of commercial bank credit by sector is hampered by a large unallocated component,
data on bank lending rates is not collected, and fiscal data in GFSM2001 format has still not been
published. The authorities’ said they are aiming to subscribe to the SDDS in 2016.

STAFF APPRAISAL
44.
Oil prices have fallen by close to 50 percent over the past year, and although Saudi
Arabia has increased its oil production in recent months in contrast to earlier periods of oil
price drops, oil revenues have still fallen substantially. Given the economy’s reliance on oil, this
decline in oil revenues will affect the real and financial sectors. Credit and deposit growth have
slowed in recent months, the equity market and corporate profits have fallen, and real GDP growth
has slowed. Staff expects real GDP to grow by 2.8 percent this year and 2.4 percent in 2016, down
from 3.5 percent in 2014. Risks to the growth outlook stem mainly from uncertainty about the future
oil market outlook, uncertainties about the growth pay-off from recent reforms, and an escalation of
regional tensions that could undermine confidence.
45.
A gradual but sizable fiscal adjustment is needed to put the fiscal deficit on a firm
downward path. The fiscal deficit is projected to reach 19½ percent of GDP this year, and while it
will decline as one-off spending ends and several large capital projects are completed, on current
policies it will remain high over the medium-term. A large multi-year fiscal adjustment, anchored on
a structural budget balance, is necessary to stabilize fiscal buffers and bring the budget position
closer to that needed for intergenerational equity. If this adjustment does not take place, fiscal
buffers will be quickly eroded, and fiscal risks would rise. Comprehensive energy efficiency and price
reforms, expanding non-oil revenues, reviewing capital and current expenditures to better align
spending with policy priorities, and reducing the government wage bill should form central
elements of the fiscal consolidation strategy. Issuing debt to finance part of the deficit as fiscal
policy adjusts is appropriate.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

SAUDI ARABIA

46.
Reforms to the fiscal framework are needed to support the process of fiscal
consolidation. The annual budget should provide a complete and realistic representation of the
planned expenditures during the year, including from the budget surplus fund. This will improve the
budget as a signaling device of the government’s fiscal policy intentions, as well as help improve the
efficiency of spending. The annual budget should be set within a medium-term framework that
clearly establishes the authorities’ fiscal goals, delinking expenditures from short-term volatility in oil
revenues while ensuring that spending adjusts over time to longer-term price trends. Expenditure
priorities from the 5-year national development plan should be fully integrated in the medium-term
budget framework and linked to the annual budgets and regularly updated. Establishing a macrofiscal unit and publishing fiscal data in GFSM2001 format will support these changes.
47.
The banking sector is in a strong position to weather lower oil prices and weaker
growth. Profits, liquidity, and capital buffers are strong and NPLs are low. While fiscal adjustment
and slower private sector growth are likely to result in modestly higher NPLs over the medium-term,
bank provisions are more than adequate to cover loan losses and capital ratios would remain stable.
Bank balance sheets also appear able to absorb a more significant worsening of the economic
situation. SAMA’s continued reforms to strengthen the regulation and supervision of the financial
sector are welcome.
48.
The macroprudential policy framework could be strengthened to mitigate financial
sector risks in a countercyclical way. SAMA was a developer and early user of macroprudential
policy tools. Some tools have been used in a countercyclical way, while others have not changed
over time. Enhancing the countercyclical use of macroprudential tools and linking to systemic risks
in the financial sector would help SAMA mitigate the potential effects of oil price and asset price
cycles on financial stability. The establishment of a formal macroprudential policy board with
SAMA, the CMA, and the Ministry of Finance as members would help ensure policy coordination
and could guide decisions on when to tighten or relax policies. Decisions will need to be based to
a considerable extent on judgment drawing on early warning indicators, market intelligence,
supervisory assessments, and stress tests. Macroprudential policies may be relaxed if financial sector
stress emerges and policy space is assessed to be available.
49.
The exchange rate peg remains appropriate given the structure of the Saudi economy.
Supported by a flexible labor market, the peg has delivered monetary policy credibility and low
inflation, while a more flexible exchange rate would have few benefits given the structure of the
economy. Nevertheless, fiscal consolidation will be needed to support the peg over the long-term.
Given ongoing structural changes in the labor market and efforts to increase diversification, the peg
should be periodically reviewed in coordination with other GCC countries to ensure it remains
appropriate.
50.
The decline in oil prices will put greater emphasis on labor market and other structural
reforms to switch the locus of growth away from the public sector and toward the private
sector. Policies are continuing to strengthen the business environment, but the incentives facing
firms will need to change to focus more on tradable rather than nontradable production in the nonoil sector. In addition, limiting the availability of public sector jobs will be critical to create incentives
22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SAUDI ARABIA

for workers to acquire the skills needed for high-productivity jobs in the private sector. Continued
efforts will be needed to strengthen education and training.
51.
Considerable progress has been made in improving the quality and availability of key
economic statistics. Further progress is needed, however, especially in the areas of government
finance, monetary, real estate, and labor market statistics. The authorities’ target of subscribing to
SDDS in 2016 is welcome, but progress in other statistical areas is also important and would
enhance the availability of information to inform policymaking. Continued close collaboration with
GCCStat will support a further strengthening of domestic economic statistics.

52.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

A 10 percent permanent decline in oil prices would reduce fiscal and external balances by

growth would drop by 0.5 percentage points a year assuming the government fully offsets
the revenue losses with expenditure cuts. The actual impact would be less in the nearterm if fiscal buffers are used to delay the expenditure reductions, although at the cost of

in the private sector and drying up of liquidity in the banking system could reduce credit

realities of lower oil prices. Policymakers should intensify diversification efforts to partially
offset potential negative spillovers from lower oil prices. The authorities should ensure
adequate banking system liquidity and carefully monitor banks for signs of stress.
Medium
Heightened tensions and conflict in the Middle East could result in higher oil prices if oil
supply is threatened (oil prices could also rise unexpectedly if, in response to the recent
fall in prices, unconventional and other high cost producers sharply reduce supply
growth). The positive impact on the economy from higher oil prices could, however, be
Medium offset if confidence and investment falls and financial market volatility increases in
response to heightened regional tensions. Higher oil prices would ease pressure on the
fiscal position, but fiscal adjustment would still be needed over the medium-term. Increased
efforts at diversification would remain important. If growth was significantly affected by a
loss of confidence, there could be a case for temporarily slowing the pace of fiscal
adjustment.
Medium
High oil price volatility could also lead to increased macroeconomic volatility if not
carefully managed. Strong fiscal and macroprudential policy frameworks are needed to

mitigate the risks that increased oil price volatility could translate into higher
macroeconomic volatility.
Medium
Despite growing employment of Saudi nationals in the private sector, the public sector
remains the key employer. Absorbing new labor market entrants into government jobs will

not, however, be an option going forward given the need for fiscal consolidation. Unless,
private sector hiring increases, unemployment will rise. Further labor market reforms are
needed to increase the employment of Saudi nationals in the private sector.
Low
The normalization of U.S. monetary policy would tighten financial conditions in Saudi
Arabia. Nevertheless, it is difficult to find empirical evidence of an interest rate channel in
Saudi Arabia. Increased financial market volatility, unless accompanied by volatility in oil
prices, would have a limited impact given the structure of the Saudi economy. Given the
peg, dollar strength would appreciate the riyal. This, however, would have a minimal
High
impact on growth or the current account given small non-hydrocarbon exports and
limited substitutability between domestic production and imports. Banks should prove
resilient as any open foreign exchange positions (subject to prudential limits) are largely in

U.S. dollars. Continued strong fundamentals would likely prevent excessive volatility in Saudi
Arabian financial markets. Large financial cushions are in place to mitigate the impact.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of
IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a
probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM
reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks
may interact and materialize jointly.

Box 1. Saudi Arabia’s Corporate Sector
Listed Saudi companies have low levels of debt and
generally healthy debt service coverage ratios. While the
debt of listed companies increased by around 10 percent in
2014, driven mainly by increased issuance among utilities,
telecoms and industrial groups, it remains relatively low at
17 percent of GDP. No information is available on non-listed
companies which are an important part of the corporate sector
in Saudi Arabia. Much of the debt is concentrated in
petrochemical and utility companies. Short term debt
outstanding, which accounts for around 15 percent of total debt,
increased slightly in 2014. Aside from three sectors with debt
service coverage ratios below 1, most sectors currently operate
with comfortable debt service coverage level. The construction
sector, which experienced declining profitability in 2014, was the
only major sector with a debt service coverage ratio below 1.

Box 2. Empirical Evidence on Oil-Macro-Financial Linkages in Saudi Arabia
Two complementary VAR models are estimated to uncover oil-macro-financial linkages.1 The first model
uses quarterly aggregate data to uncover the transmission channels between macroeconomic and financial
variables (1997Q1-2014Q4): oil prices, equity prices, domestic credit, government spending, and non-oil GDP (the
quarterly series for the latter two variables are interpolated from annual data). The second model assess linkages
between macroeconomic and bank-level balance sheet variables using an annual panel VAR (1999–2014): oil
prices, non-oil private sector output, bank credit, nonperforming loan (NPL) ratios, and bank deposits. The use of
these two different VAR models allows for a deeper analysis of the macro-financial transmission channels despite
some limitations with data availability.
The models find significant evidence of oil-macro-financial linkages and feedback loops. Impulse responses
from the first model suggest that equity prices and government spending are the main channels through which an
oil price shock affects aggregate domestic credit and non-oil output in Saudi Arabia. In terms of first-round
effects, a decrease in oil prices results in an immediate decline in equity prices and in government spending after 6
quarters. The decline in equity prices and government spending then affects non-oil GDP. There is also a feedback
loop between credit, equity prices, and non-oil GDP.
The second model allows for a more detailed assessment of the impact of oil prices on the banking sector.

Box 3. Youth, Female, and Regional Differences in Labor Market Outcomes
The overall unemployment rate for nationals, which stands at 11.7 percent, masks considerable gender,
age, and regional variations.



Among Saudi females, the unemployment rate stood at 33 percent in 2014, compared to less than 6 percent
for males. Participation of females in the labor force is also low.



Among youth, unemployment is very high and rising. With over 35 percent of the population still under the
age of 19, this working age segment will increase rapidly, underscoring the urgency of tackling youth
unemployment.



Across regions, unemployment rates vary considerably being as high as 20 percent in some regions. Gender
gaps are much wider than at the national level in some regions.

Recent labor reforms and development projects have aimed at addressing these inequalities. The
government has introduced a number of initiatives targeting mainly youth and female workers including in the
Nitaqat and Hafiz programs, and a number of sectors have been opened to female employment.1 Female
participation has increased from around 14 percent in 2011 to 18 percent in 2014 and the unemployment rate has
declined. A number of development projects have been targeted to high unemployment regions.

sustainable level of fiscal spending from the oil wealth is defined as an annuity constant in real per capita
terms. The shaded area represents the sustainable level of fiscal spending conditional on oil prices remaining within
$25 per barrel of the baseline.
3Structural revenues are estimated by assuming that the long-term oil price is the average oil price from past five
years. Long-term oil output is computed as a three year moving average including the current year. The structural
balance is then computed as structural revenues less total expenditures.

1/ Public sector is defined as central government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over U.S. bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Appendix II. A Snapshot of the Financial Sector in Saudi Arabia
The financial sector in Saudi Arabia is dominated by commercial banks. Government-owned
specialized credit institutions, public pension funds, non-bank finance companies, money market funds,
securities firms, and insurance companies constitute the remainder of the formal financial sector.


There are 24 commercial banks operating in Saudi Arabia (of which 12 are foreign-owned). Bank
assets amount to 76 percent of GDP. The top 6 banks account for over 75 percent of total commercial
bank assets. The business model of the commercial banks is focused on the domestic market.



Five public specialized credit institutions (SCIs) still play a significant role.1 The SCIs are owned
by government ministries and are not supervised by SAMA or the CMA. They are not deposit-taking
institutions. The SCIs were designed to complement bank lending, and they provide medium- to
long-term subsidized loans to industry, SMEs, housing, and agriculture. One SCI also has substantive
equity participations in many state and private companies. Assets (at book value) of the five SCIs
account amount to 22 percent of GDP.



Non-bank financial institutions are growing in number since the passage of the Finance Law in
2012. From November 2014, all banks and finance companies providing real estate or other financing
services have needed to be licensed by SAMA (37 such licenses have been granted). No data is
available on the size of the finance companies. There are also 88 securities firms.



The insurance sector is growing rapidly, but is still small. There are 35 insurance companies, but
assets are only 3 percent of GDP. All insurance companies are now regulated and supervised by
SAMA.



The two public pension funds are sizable institutional investors, with combined assets of 34
percent of GDP. PPA, the larger of the two, manages the scheme for public workers, while GOSI
manages the scheme for private workers. The schemes operate defined-benefit plans financed
primarily on a pay-as-you-go basis.



There are 169 listed companies with a market capitalization of 65 percent of GDP as of end2014. The investor base consists primarily of retail and large state investors. The presence of foreign
investors has been very limited as they were previously allowed to invest only through equity swap
arrangements and participations in mutual funds or exchange traded funds (ETFs). Direct foreign
investor participation in the equity market has been allowed since June 15, 2015.



Fixed income markets remain undeveloped. The government debt market did not develop during
the past decade, in part reflecting the decline in the stock of debt outstanding to a very low level.
There have been some large but sporadic issues of corporate bonds and sukuks by a few large
companies.

Appendix IV. External Sustainability Assessment
for Saudi Arabia
Staff believes the peg to the U.S. dollar serves Saudi Arabia well. Staff’s assessment is that the
external position in 2014 was broadly consistent with fundamentals, but that for 2015 the current
account will be weaker than estimated norms. Fiscal, rather than exchange rate, adjustment will be
needed to bring the current account back in line with fundamentals.
1.
The current account surplus in 2014 narrowed further due to falling oil prices. The
surplus declined to 10.9 percent of GDP, from 18.2 percent in 2013, as oil prices declined by over
50 percent between June and December and oil export volumes for the year decreased slightly.
Given oil prices, the current account is projected to move into a small deficit this year, before
returning to surplus during 2016–20 as oil prices rise and oil export volumes increase.
Nevertheless, this implies a significantly reduced current account surplus going forward
(4.7 percent of GDP in 2020). Over the long term, the current account will be determined by the
nature of the development strategy chosen—in particular the balance between saving oil
revenues overseas to create an income stream for future generations versus domestic investment
(public and private)—and the pace of oil extraction and future oil prices.
2.
In recent years, the share of Saudi non-oil exports in global non-oil exports has
increased as the authorities have pursued economic diversification, particularly in
petrochemicals. Despite the increase, Saudi non-oil exports in 2014 were around 1/3 of
1 percent of global non-oil exports (compared to Saudi Arabia’s share in world GDP of about
1 percent). In terms of metrics of external vulnerability, the Saudi external situation is very
comfortable. Foreign exchange reserves covered over 36 months of imports and 157 percent of
broad money in 2014, while external assets stood at an estimated 140 percent of GDP in mid2014 and external liabilities at 36 percent of GDP (of which portfolio and other investments
amounted to 8.3 percent of GDP). The financial account, excluding official reserves, is dominated
by direct investment inflows and trade credits and portfolio outflows. Errors and omissions, which
were large and consistently negative in the past, were about -2 percent of GDP in 2014.

54

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SAUDI ARABIA

3.
Given the peg to the strengthening
U.S. dollar, the REER has appreciated, thus
moving counter to what would have been
desirable in the face of the oil price shock.

1

The REER has appreciated by 14 percent over
the past year while the terms of trade fell by
4 percent in 2014 and is projected to decline
by another 30 percent this year.
4.
The external sustainability approach
suggests the current account surplus may be
too low, although the result is sensitive to
the assumptions made and the choice of
annuity. The underpinning of this approach is
that the sustainability of the current account
trajectory requires that the net present value
(NPV) of all future oil and financial/investment
income (wealth) be equal to the NPV of imports
of goods and services net of non-oil exports.2
Subject to this constraint, the government
would choose a path for imports, and hence a
current account norm, that would support
intergenerational equity—and some
precautionary savings in view of volatile oil
prices—through an appropriate pace of
accumulation of net foreign assets. Import
trajectories (“annuities or allocation rules)” are
calculated under two different policy scenarios:
(i) constant real per capita annuity; and
(ii) constant real annuity. Both types of annuities
are used in the literature, and can be derived

Inflation measures, and therefore the estimated real exchange rate, are affected by the presence of a range of
subsidies—fuel, electricity, water, and certain food items.

1

Proven oil reserves at end of 2014 were 262.1 billion barrels. However, estimates of proven reserves have changed
little since 1988 despite aggregate oil production over this period of close to 90 billion barrels. Staff projections assume
that the oil production grows at a constant rate (2 percent) due to domestic consumption and, peaks at 12.9 million
barrels in 2029 and then remains constant at that level till 2115 when oil production stops. Oil exports remain
unchanged. Oil prices increase by 2 percent and the GDP deflator increase by 2.5 percent after 2020, and real non-oil
GDP grows by 5 percent while total real output growth is assumed to be 2.8 percent. Future oil revenues are nominally
discounted at 6 percent, the assumed rate of return on externally held financial wealth/NFA, while population growth is
1 percent.

from the optimization of plausible government utility functions.3 The estimates suggest that the
current account surplus is below what would be expected under the constant real per capita
annuity rule, but above the constant real annuity rule. These estimates are subject to
considerable uncertainty and are sensitive to the parameters assumed. The figures show the
effects of (i) 25 percent higher/lower oil prices; and (ii) 25 percent higher/lower oil prices and
changes in the discount rate (to 5 and 7 percent, compared to 6 percent in the baseline).
5.
A macroeconomic balance approach that is focused on oil exporting countries
suggests that the current account was within the range of norms estimated from
several different specifications in 2014, but will be outside this range in 2015. The
macroeconomic balance approach estimates four main specifications of the equilibrium current
account (norm) from a set of fundamentals (non-oil and gas fiscal balance, oil and gas reserves,
old-age dependency ratio, population growth rate, initial net foreign assets (NFA) net of external
debt, oil trade balance, growth rate of real per capita GDP, relative income, and lagged
dependent current account) employing a generalized method of moments (GMM) technique (see
Beidas-Strom and Cashin, 2011). As shown (in the table below), the estimation yields a range of
current account norms for Saudi Arabia from a surplus of about 12 to 19 percent of GDP in 2014,
and 0.5 to about 17 percent of GDP in 2015. Specification II, yielding a norm of 11.6 percent in
2014 and 10.3 percent in 2015, is the preferred one given the absence of a lagged dependent
variable and the inclusion of NFA data.
6.
Estimates based on the EBA-lite methodology suggest the current account balance
was below the norm for 2014. The current account norm was 11.4 percent of GDP compared
with an actual level of 10.9 percent, producing a gap of -0.5 percent of GDP. The EBA-lite
methodology builds on the EBA approach and is applied to a wider group of countries. The EBA
and EBA-lite approaches provide regression-based estimates of current account and real
effective exchange norms and gaps for countries. Norms are the estimated levels of the current
account based on underlying fundamentals, while gaps are the deviations of observed values
from the norms. The EBA-lite methodology is estimated on a wide group of countries with very
different characteristics and therefore does not adequately account for the specifics of oil
exporting countries (such as the need for intergenerational savings because oil resources are
non-renewable).

Countries,” IMF Working Paper 09/281.

Overall Assessment

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Background. External assets are substantial at an estimated 140 percent of GDP in mid-2014, while total
external liabilities were 36 percent of GDP (portfolio and other investments were 8.3 percent of GDP). All
external debt is private. The net international investment position (NIIP) stood between 85 and 105 percent of
GDP during 2007-mid-2014. The average return on assets was relatively low at about 2½ percent compared
to 5 percent on liabilities during the period. External assets are dominated by international reserves, but
details on the composition of external assets are not available. Projections suggest that the NIIP/GDP ratio will
remain broadly stable over the medium term.
Assessment. The external balance sheet is very strong. Substantial accumulated assets represent both savings
of the exhaustible resource revenues for future generations and protection against vulnerabilities from oil
price volatility.

Overall Assessment:

Current account

Background. The current account (CA) surplus in 2014 narrowed to 10.9 percent of GDP from 18.2 percent in
2013. This reflected lower oil revenues and weaker petrochemical prices.1 The oil price decline is projected to
result in a small current account deficit in 2015 as oil export revenues decline by 14 percent of GDP. As oil
prices are anticipated to partially recover over the medium term, CA surpluses are also expected to recover (to
about 5 percent of GDP in 2020). Over the long term, the CA will be determined by: (i) the fiscal strategy
chosen—the balance between saving to create an income stream for future generations versus spending on
consumption and investment, the latter of which will boost future growth if carried out efficiently; and (ii) the
pace of oil extraction and future oil prices.
Assessment. Saudi Arabia is one of the world’s largest oil exporters, with oil exports over 65 percent of nonoil GDP and 80 percent of exports of goods and services. As with other large exporters of nonrenewable
resources, it is faced with concerns of intergenerational equity and is affected by oil market volatility. These
factors subject its CA to wide swings and the assessment of its external position to considerable uncertainty.
Staff’s assessment is that there was a negative current account gap in 2014, although the estimated size of
this gap varies with the methodology used (from -8.5 to -0.5 percent of GDP, with an average gap of -3
percent of GDP). 2/ However, this gap is driven by current fiscal policy settings. Projections suggest the current
account gap may widen in 2015.

The decline in the oil price reduced the
current account surplus in 2014 and is
expected to result in a small deficit in 2015.
With the forecast trend improvement in oil
prices, the current account is projected to
improve over the medium term.

Real exchange
rate

Capital and
financial
accounts:
flows and policy
measures

Background. The Riyal has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at a rate of 3.75 since 1986. The real effective
exchange rate (REER) has appreciated by nearly 14 percent over the past year and is currently about 19
percent above its average over the past decade. The REER is mainly influenced by the U.S. nominal exchange
rate vis-à-vis trade partners and oil price dynamics (which affect domestic prices through government (and
therefore consumer) spending).
Assessment. Most exports are oil or oil-related products, and exchange rate movements have a limited
impact on competitiveness. Rather, external adjustment will come via the impact of fiscal policy on domestic
demand and imported goods and services.
Background. Inflows are dominated by FDI, while outflows are largely trade credits and portfolio investment.
Capital account restrictions and underdeveloped domestic capital markets continue to limit portfolio and
investment inflows, Steps to allow increased foreign investment in the equity market are ongoing.
Assessment. There are no immediate risks or vulnerabilities associated with capital flows.

The external position in 2014 was broadly
consistent with fundamentals. This
assessment takes account of the dominant
role of fiscal policy in determining the
external position. Projections for 2015
suggest the current account may be weaker
than estimated norms. Fiscal policy
adjustment will be needed to close the
current account gap.

While a current account gap is projected in
2015, the very strong external balance sheet
including high foreign exchange reserves
and no significant concerns about capital
flows are strong mitigating factors. The
current account deficit projected for this
year is very small in relation to available
buffers.
Given the structure of the Saudi economy,
with exports dominated by oil and oilrelated products, external adjustment will
need to be driven by fiscal adjustment
rather than exchange rate adjustment.
Potential policy responses:
While sizeable fiscal buffers mean there is
no need for a sharp cut in government
spending in the face of lower, but uncertain,
oil prices, fiscal consolidation is needed.
The non-oil fiscal deficit remains
significantly above the level implied by
intergenerational equity models and at
current spending levels fiscal buffers will be
significantly depleted. Fiscal adjustment is
the key to increasing the current account
over the medium-term in line with

and liability
position and

Saudi Arabia (concluded)
FX intervention
and reserves
level

Background. Saudi Arabia does not have a Sovereign Wealth Fund. The government’s foreign assets are held
at the central bank within international reserves. International reserves were about 97 percent of GDP (36
months of imports) at end-2014, although they did decline modestly in the final months of 2014. Reserves
play a dual role—for both precautionary motives and as savings for future generations.
Assessment. Reserve assets are more than adequate for precautionary purposes (measured by the Fund’s
metrics). Nevetheless, a larger current account surplus and resulting NIIP accumulation would be needed to
ensure an equitable intergenerational transfer of oil revenues in real per capita terms.

Technical

1/ Errors and omissions are estimated at -2 percent of GDP in 2014.

Background

2/ EBA methodology assessments are not available for Saudi Arabia. Staff considered a number of
methodologies, including those that incorporate the special intertemporal considerations that are dominant in
economies in which exports of non-renewable resources are a very high share of output and exports.
Estimates suggest current account norms for 2014 range from 19.4 percent of GDP (external sustainability or
ES approach) to 11.6 percent of GDP (MB approach from IMF Country Report No. 13/229) to 11.4 percent of
GDP (EBA-lite approach). The corresponding current account gaps are estimated at, respectively, -8.5 percent,
-0.7 percent, and -0.5 percent. The estimated fiscal gap in 2014 is 17.7 percent of GDP (derived as the
difference between the actual fiscal balance and that consistent with intergenerational equity). If this fiscal gap
is closed, the current account gap is eliminated under the ES approach. Consequently, the estimated current
account gap under the ES methodology is entirely driven by current fiscal policy settings. The estimated CA
gap under EBA-lite reflects a fiscal policy gap (of about -7.5 percent) and a large unexplained residual (of
about +7 percent) owing to the fact that Saudi Arabia is a significant outlier in the EBA-lite sample (e.g. due to
historically very large and volatile external surpluses).

Notes

intergenerational equity needs.
Government investment on infrastructure
and education is appropriate, but it is
important to ensure that this spending is
efficiently meeting development needs.
Efforts are needed to reduce current
spending and increase non-tax revenues.

Lending to the Fund and Grants:
Saudi Arabia is a participant of the New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB), whose credit arrangement
under the NBA amounts SDR 11.126 billion. The current outstanding amount under the credit
arrangement as of July 10, 2015 is SDR 1,122.2 million. The Fund also has a borrowing agreement
with Saudi Arabia in association with the General Arrangements to Borrow (GAB), for an
amount equivalent to SDR 1.5 billion, which was renewed for another five-year period from
December 26, 2013. In October 2012, Saudi Arabia entered into a note purchase agreement with the
Fund under the 2012 Borrowing Agreements, with the amount of SDR 9.71 billion, to provide a
second line of defense after quota and NAB resources. In March 2001, Saudi Arabia agreed to
support the PRG-HIPC Trust with investments totaling SDR 94.4 million. In April 2006, these
investments were extended with an additional investment of SDR 38.2 million, to provide SDR
40 million (end-2005 NPV terms) in subsidy resources to support the Exogenous Shocks Facility.
Additionally, in April 2005, Saudi Arabia agreed to provide a grant contribution of US$4 million
(equivalent to SDR 2.6 million) to subsidize Emergency Natural Disaster Assistance to low-income
countries. In May 2012, Saudi Arabia pledged a new grant contribution of SDR 16.7 million in
subsidy resources to the PRGT, which will be disbursed at end-December 2021. In October 2012 and
October 2013, Saudi Arabia provided subsidy resources to the PRGT through the transfer of its full

share in the distributions of the general reserve attributed to windfall gold sale profits, totaling SDR
71.88 million. As regards loan resources, the Fund as Trustee of the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Trust (PRGT) entered into a borrowing agreement with the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency in May
2011, by which Saudi Arabia would provide new loan resources of up to SDR 500 million.
Exchange Rate Arrangement
Saudi Arabia maintains an exchange rate system free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions. The Saudi Arabian riyal was formally pegged to the
U.S. dollar, effective January 2003 and the exchange arrangement is classified as a conventional peg.
Prior to that, it was officially pegged to the SDR at the rate of SAR 4.28255=SDR 1, with margins of
7.25 percent even though in practice it has been pegged to the U.S. dollar since 1986, with a middle
rate of SAR 3.7450=$1. Saudi Arabia maintains security-related exchange restrictions pursuant to UN
Security Council resolutions 1267 and 1373.
Last Article IV Consultation
Saudi Arabia is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation was
held during May 4–15, 2014 in Riyadh. The staff report was considered by the Executive Board on
July 11, 2014 and published on September 23, 2014

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of June 10, 2015)
World Bank
The World Bank’s Technical Cooperation Program (TCP) has been providing policy advice, capacity
development, and implementation support to development efforts in Saudi Arabia on a
reimbursable basis since 1975.
The TCP aims to assist Saudi Arabia in addressing its development challenges of generating
productive jobs for a fast growing population; improving the performance of its education and
health system to meet evolving needs; enhancing the provision of public services including water,
electricity, and transport; and strengthening capacity in national, municipal institutions, and tourism.
In recent months, advisory work was completed in the areas of: public financial management,
foreign direct investment, small and medium enterprise strategy, economic diversification strategy,
special economic zones, and housing finance regulations. Priority activities in the ongoing program
include: work on employment policy including a focus on unemployment assistance; workshops on
education quality, assessment, and decentralization issues; developing funding options to promote
energy efficient investments; updating the water sector strategy and building a consensus around it;
developing an implementation plan for the national ports strategy; advising on the creation of a
Public Transport Authority as a new regulatory body; and food security.
International Finance Corporation
IFC activities in the country, as well as with Saudi investors outside the country, have increased
significantly in recent years. They are in line with the following three objectives:
Promoting Selective Business in Saudi Arabia
IFC’s strategy for investments in Saudi Arabia is to invest in selective transactions that can add value
in terms of institution building, development of new financial instruments, and SME development.
Specific investments in the financial sector include housing finance, insurance, leasing and
microfinance (with total commitments of around $200 million). IFC also provides Advisory Services in
mortgage finance, SME finance, corporate governance, risk management and PPP transactions. IFC
PPP is actively engaged in the Kingdom with two new PPP mandates signed in FY14 (Taif Airport and
King Abdul Aziz International (Jeddah) Airport). These engagements build upon IFC’s earlier success
of Medina Airport PPP where IFC helped mobilize over $1 billion, as well as the successes on the Hajj
Terminal and a captive desalination project at Jeddah Airport.
Promoting South-South Investments from Saudi Arabia
Saudi Arabian investors have been a key part of IFC’s South-South program to promote greater
regional integration. Since 2007, IFC has been able to mobilize around $2 billion from Saudi

4

sponsors for investments in the rest of MENA as well as in emerging markets including in Africa and
East Asia. IFC continues to work closely with Saudi sponsors to further facilitate cross border
investment in the region.
Mobilizing Funds
IFC is working closely with Saudi public institutions and IFIs to undertake global initiatives that
benefit private sector activities in developing countries. So far, these efforts have resulted in
obtaining commitments of over $1 billion.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of July 10, 2015)
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Most
affected areas are: labor markets, government finance statistics, and external sector statistics.
National accounts and Labor Markets: The estimates of annual GDP were rebased to 2010
from the previous base year of 1999. The revised GDP data are more comprehensive in terms of
coverage of services, specifically distribution and financial services. The revision has resulted in
upward revisions to the level of GDP as well as the relative contributions by economic activity to
GDP. This rebasing has increased the share of the oil GDP in 2013 to 43 percent from 21 percent
previously. Data on wage rates of public and private sector workers is not published, nor is
official data on the number of public sector employees.
Price statistics: The weight reference period for the wholesale price index appears outdated
(1988 according to the publicly available information) and would need to be updated, ideally at
least every five years. No official real estate price index is provided.
Government finance statistics: The authorities are in the process of reclassifying the budget in
line with GFSM 2001. Most chapters have been completed and the Ministry of Finance is planning
on using the GFSM 2001 framework to report fiscal data and publish it by early 2016.
Monetary and financial statistics: The quality of monetary data has improved and additional
information is made available in the SAMA Monthly Statistical Bulletin. However, the authorities
have not yet adopted the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs) as recommended in the Monetary
and Financial Statistics (MFS) Compilation Guide. An MFS technical assistance mission is
scheduled in FY2016 to assist the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authorities (SAMA) to migrate to SRFs.
The breakdown of bank credit to the private sector in the quarterly bulletin can be improved,
which currently includes a large “Miscellaneous” category. Data on lending and deposits rates is
currently not published.
Financial sector surveillance: SAMA reports all 12 core financial soundness indicators (FSIs) to
the IMF.
External sector statistics: Quarterly IIP data are published although IIP statistics are highly
aggregated and the coverage in the capital and financial accounts, particularly for the private
sector, needs to be improved. Errors and omissions in balance of payments data have been
reduced substantially due to an improved coverage of trade credit although there is scope for
further improvements. The authorities are working on strengthening financial account data,
where data on FDI flows and other investment flows are weak. There are inconsistencies between
the BOP and IIP data.
