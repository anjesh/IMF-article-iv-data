STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 5, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Fiji’s economy expanded by about 2 percent in 2011 after several years of very low
growth. Political uncertainty and slow structural reforms have suppressed potential
growth, and this, coupled with fiscal stimulus during the global financial crisis, has
pushed Fiji’s public debt ratio to one of the highest levels in the region, leaving limited
room to respond to future shocks. The economic outlook appears stable, but there are
downside risks related to the political situation, structural weaknesses, and the global
environment.
Macroeconomic policies are broadly appropriate. The 2012 budget has proposed much
needed fiscal consolidation, though marginal income tax rate reductions will make it
difficult to achieve deficit targets. Monetary policy is accommodative, given the currently
benign inflation outlook, but continued vigilance against future inflationary pressure is
critical, and credit growth targets should be avoided. The Fijian dollar is broadly in line
with fundamentals, and the financial sector is well regulated and supervised, although the
Fiji National Provident Fund requires reform.
Structural reforms are key to boosting growth and sustainability. Policy changes
regarding the land system, public enterprises, the sugar sector, exchange controls,
pensions, and the civil service are in the right direction, and recent political developments
should boost investor confidence, but rigorous implementation is essential for success. A
significant reduction in price controls, more consultation in the policymaking process,
including in handling labor relations, and continued resolution of political uncertainties,
including establishment of a concrete plan leading up to the 2014 election, will also be
critical.

Fijian tourism, exports, remittances, and FDI—
there would be scope for some fiscal stimulus.
Depending on the shock, exchange rate
adjustment could also be warranted.

B. Structural Policies
20.

Removing structural impediments to

growth is critically important. Many of the
mission’s interlocutors suggested that relaxing
the emergency regulation and establishing a
clear path toward a 2014 election would be the
key measures to boost investor confidence. In
this context, the recent announcement that the
emergency regulation would be lifted on
January 7 so as to facilitate national
consultations on a new constitution is most
welcome. Interlocutors also expressed

however, could be offered for those already in,
or near, retirement. The authorities’ earlier plan
to cut the rate from as high as 25 percent to
9 percent is on hold, and the 2012 budget
announced that an actuarially sound pension
rate, along with transitional arrangements,
would be introduced on March 1, 2012; no
details, however, are available at this point.

sometimes inconsistent policymaking—making
decisions too frequently, without adequately
consulting civil society, and without any lead
time for implementation; changing these
practices would also improve the business
climate. Staff also noted the importance of
several sector-specific reforms to unlock the
economy’s potential, welcomed the
authorities’ efforts in these areas, and urged
that further reforms be expedited.2 A strict

provides a general sense.

Maximum prices are tailored to each retailer’s

21.

Land reform is widely perceived to

be among the most important structural
measures to boost the economy. Making
more productive use of the nation’s lands has
been a major, and appropriate, focus of the
authorities’ reform efforts (Box 4). Maximum
allowable lease tenures have been extended,
and a Land Bank has recently been set up to
better deploy the nation’s assets. There is a
complex bureaucracy responsible for different
parts of land policy, and rationalizing its
functions over time would be desirable. There
have also been some complaints about
inadequate consultation with native
landowners, and addressing this could make
the reforms more sustainable.
22.

Price decontrol could also provide a

fillip to investment and growth. Staff see the
current system of price controls as overly
extensive and as a deterrent to investment.
Anticompetitive practices are not uncommon
in a small economy, and given the difficulties
in prosecuting such behavior, there may be a
case for regulating prices of a few basic
commodities, for the benefit of the poor. In
Fiji, however, the Commerce Commission

costs and updated as often as weekly. The
criteria for entering and leaving the controlled
list are unclear. The authorities noted that
controls were a temporary solution and were
being reduced. The mission felt that the
authorities needed to tackle anticompetitive
practices directly and scale back price controls
faster, as such micromanagement distorts
price signals, creates uncertainty, absorbs staff
resources, gives vendors incentives to reduce
product quality or not supply at all, and
reduces incentives for investment. The pace of
price decontrol would, however, need to be
moderated somewhat to smooth the inflation
path.
23.

Sugar-sector reform, which is

already underway, is another critical step. In
2010, the government committed to reforming
the industry and returning FSC to profitability.
This included assuming FSC debt and taking
full ownership and control of the company.
The Task Force has now laid out a
comprehensive strategy (addressing farm
productivity, mill efficiency, and pricing
strategy) to turn around the sugar sector

Box 1. Poverty in Fiji and Policy Responses
Expenditure-based poverty estimates suggest
that 35 percent of the Fijian population—with
substantial variation across the different divisions
and provinces—lived in poverty in 2008/09, down
from 40 percent in 2002/03. While there has been
considerable improvement in urban areas, rural
areas have shown none.
These observed trends are consistent with known
patterns of economic growth, including, in
particular, the decline in agriculture output over
the last few years. Most of the decline in poverty
came from the growth of non-agricultural sectors
in urban areas. It also appears that rural-urban
migration contributed.

heads. Government spending on social assistance
is quite small, at around ½ percent of GDP, and
its impact on poverty at the national level is thus limited. Eligibility criteria for targeted social
assistance need to be more clearly defined, and access to the Family Assistance Program should be
widened while targeting the extremely poor. An increase in the social assistance budget would be
desirable, but transfer programs are just one instrument in a multipronged approach to reducing
poverty.

Box 2. Exchange Rate Assessment
Staff estimates suggest that the Fiji dollar is broadly in line with fundamentals. The three standard
methods show overvaluation ranging from 1 to 6 percent. Qualitatively, these results are consistent
with staff’s baseline projection of stable reserves coverage over the medium term.
Under the MB approach, the current account
deficit norm is estimated at 6¾ percent of
GDP, based on demographic factors, relative
income growth, and the oil trade balance.
The projected current account deficit lies
slightly above this norm, and assuming a
semi-elasticity of -0.3, it is estimated that a
4½ percent real depreciation would be
sufficient to bring the projection in line with
the norm.

5/ Current account deficit that stabilizes net foreign liabilities, estimated
at 120 percent of GDP in 2016.

The ERER estimates are broadly in line with
the MB approach. The model explains the
REER largely on the basis of the tourism-based terms of trade (i.e., using average expenditure per
tourist as a price proxy for this key export). Assuming a slight improvement in the terms of trade
over the medium term (with tourist spending flat, and import prices declining as per the WEO), the
exchange rate is estimated to be 6 percent overvalued.
The ES approach implies that the exchange rate is roughly in equilibrium, assuming nominal GDP
growth of just over 7 percent on average over the medium term and stabilization of net foreign
liabilities (NFL) at 120 percent of GDP.

FNPF is a public pension fund in which formal-sector employees are required to participate. Member
contributions are retained in individual accounts and pooled for investment purposes. Members can make
pre-retirement withdrawals for specified purposes, and upon retirement at 55, they have the choice between
a lump-sum and a lifetime annuity.
FNPF suffers from a substantial actuarial imbalance on account of high annuitization rates (from 15 to 25
percent). These large

Box 4. Land Reform
Eighty-eight percent of land in Fiji is “native land,” owned by tribal groups; another eight percent is
individually owned; and the remaining four percent is state land.
Native land cannot be sold but can be leased with the landowners’ consent. The iTaukei Land Trust
Board (TLTB) handles such transactions and sets rents—typically 2½ to 3 percent of the land’s
unimproved capital value (UCV), and no more than 6 percent by law. Obtaining a TLTB lease is fairly
cumbersome, and much native land has sat idle.
Seeking to deploy land more effectively, the government in 2010 established a Land Use Unit which
essentially competes with TLTB. The Unit operates a Land Bank in which native landowners (as well
as the Government for state land) can voluntarily register land for the Unit to administer. Once the
land has been transferred from TLTB to the Land Bank, the Unit must survey and value the land and
advertise its availability.
The Land Bank offers native landowners more beneficial terms than TLTB, including a higher rental
rate (up to 10 percent of UCV, and no diversion of 15 percent of the rent to the tribal chief, as is the
case with TLTB) and longer lease periods (up to 99 years for any type of land, versus a maximum of
30 years for TLTB’s agricultural land).
So far, seven tracts of land have been registered with the Unit, exceeding the 2011 target of 2,000
hectares, a further 11,000 hectares have been volunteered for registration, and one lease has been
issued, to a Chinese company pursuing bauxite mining. Although this is still a very small portion of
total native land, it represents a positive start and appears also to have pushed TLTB to improve its
competitiveness.
Going forward, institutional capacity at the Unit must be strengthened, and more consultation with
native landowners will be necessary to ensure their buy-in and thus the reform’s sustainability. In
due course, some rationalization of the multiple bureaucracies handling land issues would also be
desirable.

1/ Derived as [r - g - (1+g) + (1+r)]/(1+g++g) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
 = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and  = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-(1+g(1+r1+g++g) times previous period debt stock. increases with an appreciating domestic currency (> 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels of the last projection year.

the boxes represent average projections for the respective variables in the baseline and scenario being presented.
Ten-year historical average for the variable is also shown.
2/ For historical scenarios, the historical averages are calculated over the 10-year period, and the information is used
to project debt dynamics five years ahead.
3/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and current account balance.
4/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent occurs in 2010. The middle line corresponds to a 30% real depreciation
with an associated improvement in the current account, assuming a semi-elasticity of 0.3.

Composition of the iTaukei Native
Land Trust Board was changed
through the introduction of the
Native Land Trust (Amendment)
Decree 2010). The Decree shifts
power from Great Council of Chiefs
(GCC) to the Government through
the Minister for iTaukei Affairs
(currently the Prime Minister)
enabling Government to push
through reforms to the
administration of native lands (which
account for 88 percent of Fiji’s total
land allocation.
A competitive mechanism for leasing
native land through the Land Use
Decree was introduced in 2010. The
Decree establishes a new Land Use
Unit within the Ministry of Lands. The
Unit is responsible for operating a
Land Bank in which native
landowners (as well as the
government with respect to state
land) can voluntarily register land for
the government to administer.
The Commerce Commission Decree
2010 consolidated the Commerce
Commission’s role as the key
government institution responsible
for encouraging competition within
Fiji’s marketplace and regulating
prices when necessary.
The list of controlled items has
shrunk over the decades, but price
controls were extended to basic
hardware items such as bagged and
bulk cement, concrete blocks, roofing
products and electrical products.

Future Plans


Building institutional capacity
within the Land Use Unit of the
Ministry of Lands to effectively
manage the Land Bank.



Bringing land under the
Agricultural Landlord and
Tenant Act (around
35,000 leases) into the Land
Bank (still needs to be clarified).



Budget support to FSC provided in
2011 (FJ$110 million) and 2012
(FJ$40.9 million) to pay for FSC’s
maturing debt whilst the remainder
utilized as working capital.



FSC now operates as a Commercial
Statutory Authority (controlled by
Government within the provisions of
a Corporate Governance Framework).



Industrial Relations Framework
revised to establish a new legal
framework that governs FSC’s
industrial relations with its workforce
e.g., Essential Industries Decree.



New Ministry for Sugar created in
June 2011 to be solely dedicated to
spearheading reforms.



Measures to improve production and
production management including
fast tracking of cane replanting
programme, compulsory planting of
3 cane varieties and utilization of
fertilizer, and moratorium on all
development on cane lands
implemented.
A reform plan was adopted in April
2010 to put the Fiji National
Provident Fund (FNPF) on a sound
financial and actuarial footing. It
included implementing steps to
reduce the pension conversion rate
from 15 percent per annum to a

In 2011, FNPF received approval from
the Reserve Bank to invest up to
$150 million (or around 4 percent) of
its $3.7 billion assets in overseas
markets. FNPF has responded by
securing the services of an Australian
fund manager and has commenced
making overseas investments. It is
pushing to see the overseas limit
increased to up to 20 percent of its
total assets on a long term basis.
The authorities implemented a wage
freeze and a hiring freeze (with
exceptions for essential technical and
professional positions) for several
years.

The authorities need to embed the
measures taken to date in a more
comprehensive civil service reform
program including:
 realignment of personnel with
priorities and the consolidation
of functions where duplication
exists or fragmentation is
currently impeding efficiency
and effectiveness;


realignment of public sector
salaries with private sector
comparators;



ensuring strict adherence to
merit-based appointments and
promotions and due process for

VII.
Exchange Rate Arrangements: Fiji’s
de facto exchange rate arrangement is a
conventional peg.
Since April 1975, the exchange rate of the Fiji
dollar has been linked to a basket of currencies
of Fiji’s five major trading partners: the U.S.,
Australian, and New Zealand dollars; the pound
2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

sterling (replaced by the Euro at the beginning
of 1999); and the Japanese yen. The weights used
in the basket, based mainly on the value of trade
and tourist transactions are reviewed annually.
The exchange rate of the Fiji dollar against
U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, is
determined daily by the Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF)
in relation to the currency basket. The RBF’s
buying and selling rates for transactions in
U.S. dollars are communicated to commercial
banks. On April 15, 2009, the Fiji dollar was
devalued by 20 percent against the basket. The
exchange rate was F$1.8205 per U.S. dollar as of
December 30, 2011.
Exchange and capital controls were tightened
significantly in early 2009 following the
devaluation of the currency. Some of the
exchange restrictions have been eliminated and
amended since then. Remaining restrictions
subject to Article VIII arise from the Fiji Revenue
and Customs Authority tax certification
requirements before foreign companies can
remit profits abroad and from limits on large
payments (e.g., oil imports and dividends
repatriation of foreign banks).
Approval of most current payments was
delegated to commercial banks and foreign
exchange dealers in the late 1990s. However, the
extent of delegation was tightened during
periods of stress on foreign exchange reserves,
most recently in April 2009. In December 2009,
the RBF announced an increase in the delegated
ceilings for commercial banks and foreign
exchange dealers for most current payments,
effective January 1, 2010, and further increases in
delegated limits were announced in November
2011. Banks have also been allowed to have net
forward contracts of up to F$20 million, and
individuals are allowed to take out up to

REPUBLIC OF FIJI 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

F$10,000 for overseas investment. There are also
restrictions in Fiji dollars on offshore portfolio
and direct investments by the Fiji National
Provident Fund and other nonbank financial
institutions, companies, and individuals.
VIII.
Last Article IV Consultation: The 2010
Article IV consultation discussions were held in
Suva during October 28–November 12, 2010.
The consultation (Country Report No. 11/85)
was completed by the Executive Board on
February 2, 2011. Fiji is on a 12-month cycle
with the concurrence of the authorities.
IX.
Safeguards Assessment: The firsttime safeguards assessment of the Reserve
Bank of Fiji (RBF) was finalized in January 2011
and found key safeguards elements in place.
The RBF publishes annual financial statements
that are both prepared and audited in
accordance with internationally recognized
standards. The assessment confirmed,

however, that the level of autonomy of the RBF
is very low with the legislation supporting a
wide scope of political interference. Proposed
amendments would address some but not all
of these weaknesses; alternative measures
were recommended by the staff for others. An
action plan has been put in place where there
is capacity to prepare IFRS financial statements
and commenced with the financial statements
for the year ended 2010 during 2011.
X.
Resident Representative: The
Regional Resident Representative Office for
Pacific Islands based in Suva, Fiji was opened
on September 13, 2010 and the office covers
Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Palau,
Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands,
Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. Mr. Yongzheng
Yang is the resident representative.

(As of December 30, 2011)
The Bank and Fund country teams led by
Mr. Vivek Suri (World Bank Lead Economist,
East Asia and the Pacific) and Mr. Koshy
Mathai (IMF Mission Chief for Fiji) maintain a
close working relationship and have an
ongoing dialogue on a range of

Cooperation over the past year has included
World Bank participation in the November
2011 Article IV mission to Fiji. The Bank’s
participation facilitated discussions with the
authorities in areas of mutual interest such as
structural reforms.

implemented to make the sugar
industry viable. To date, the poor
performance of FSC has created a large
burden on the budget and significantly
reduced Fiji’s growth.


FNPF reform, which is key to financial
sector stability. FNPF should be made
actuarially sound, including through
reducing the conversion rates of
benefits to annuities. FNPF’s
investment portfolio would also
benefit from greater diversification and
more profitable investments.



Civil service reform. The authorities
have made some progress with civil
service reform, but further work is
required to ensure that the wage bill is
fiscally sustainable and the civil service
is efficient and effective. Wage
restraint will be necessary to increase
the fiscal space for essential non-wage
public expenditure and realign public
sector salaries with private sector
comparators. Maintaining the partial
hiring freeze––with exceptions for
essential positions––is necessary to
facilitate employment reductions
through attrition and to rebalance the
civil service toward higher-skilled
personnel. Over the medium term,
functional reviews are required to
identify core service areas and help
rationalize the overall size and
structure of the public sector.



Public enterprise reform. The pace of
implementation of reforms of other
public enterprises aimed at improving
services and reducing fiscal costs
needs to be accelerated. These reforms

Based on the above cooperation, the Bank and
Fund teams agree that Fiji's main
macroeconomic challenges are to safeguard
fiscal and external stability, as well as address
structural obstacles that are impeding growth.
These obstacles are detailed in the main text of
the report, but some of the structural reforms
seen by the Bank and the Fund as macrocritical include:


Land reform, which is critical for Fiji’s
growth prospects and economic
diversification. In addition to making
further progress with land reform,
there is a need to streamline the
administration of land policy.



Price decontrol, to re-establish price
signals and encourage investment.



Sugar reform, to revitalize a key
sector. The Fiji Sugar Corporation
needs to be restructured and returned
to profitability, and wide ranging sugar
sector reforms need to be

will help reduce the government’s
direct and contingent liabilities, help
ensure fiscal sustainability, and
promote growth.


Exchange decontrol, to enhance the
attractiveness of the business climate
and encourage more foreign
investment.



Review of the social safety net. Fiji’s
social safety net needs to be reviewed
to enhance the definition of eligibility
criteria and the protection of the most
vulnerable segments of the population.
A stronger safety net will help to
ensure the success of Fiji’s reform
agenda.





Tax policy and administration
reform. VAT and income tax legislation
should be strengthened and simplified
to increase efficiency, transparency and
broaden the tax base. This should
include tightening the scope for
discretionary concessions, which would
make the system more transparent
while also creating fiscal space. Fiji
continues to benefit greatly from TA in
this area provided by the Pacific
Financial Technical Assistance Center
(PFTAC) located in Suva.
Debt management. Debt
management procedures should be
followed strictly and Fiji should
develop a debt-management strategy
to prevent a rapid build-up of public
debt.

Strengthening statistical capacity
and statistics. Fiji should ensure that it
continues to develop personnel with
the capacity to produce accurate and
timely economic statistics. Good
statistics are important both for macro
policy formulation and good public
financial management (e.g.,
establishment payroll and wage bill
control). Fiji continues to benefit from
a broad range of statistical advice from
PFTAC.

ANNEX III. FIJI: RELATIONS WITH THE PACIFIC
FINANCIAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTRE
(As of December 30, 2011)
Background
Fiji has faced a difficult macroeconomic
environment in recent times. Growth has
been anemic for a number of years and the
external position is vulnerable. Reserves have
recovered since the 2009 devaluation but high
public debt and contingent liabilities arising
from state-owned enterprises constrain the
space for fiscal stimulus. The financial sector is
sound but monetary policy transmission has
been weak—credit growth is slow despite
reductions in policy rates and high liquidity in
the banking sector. Political developments
have meant that few development partners are
active in PFTAC’s focus areas.
Fiji has been PFTAC’s largest user of TA in
recent years. The revenue sector has been the
main area of focus. PFTAC has supported
FIRCA in a comprehensive modernization
process including the development of
enhanced corporate planning, simplified
income tax legislation and streamlined
personal income taxation policies and
procedures. There has also been significant
progress made in the Statistics area with
improved national accounts balance of
payments and price statistics. In the PFM area,
support has been focused on building internal
audit and accounting capacity while in
macroeconomics the focus has been on
building modeling skills, including for potential
natural resource revenues.

results framework for the current PFTAC
funding cycle (Annex).1
PFTAC TA aims to support the authorities
sustain progress on fiscal consolidation and
enhance the framework for macroeconomic
policy making. In the fiscal area the majority
of inputs will continue to be in the revenue
area with support on PFM systems and fiscal
forecasting. Enhanced statistics will support
strengthened modeling capacity in RBF and
Ministry of Finance which should ensure policy
makers are better informed.
In the Public Financial Management area,
PFTAC will discuss with the authorities assisting
in taking stock of systems and the institutional
environment through a PEFA assessment in
mid-2012 (1.1). This process may also include
assistance in looking at the roles,
responsibilities and structure of the Ministry of
Finance, perhaps drawing on IMF HQ expertise.
Areas or specific follow-up assistance will be
influenced by the action plan drawn up
following the PEFA (1.2) but are likely to be
focused on accounting and budget execution
(1.4). Assistance in cash and debt management
may also be a focus (1.6), if resources are
available. PFTAC will coordinate closely with
the AsDB’s PEM TA project.
In the revenue area, Fiji is one of the regional
leaders in terms of administrative processes
but is keen to improve revenue performance.
PFTAC assistance in the near-term will focus on

bringing to fruition a number of initiatives: a
thorough modernization and simplification of
the income tax law that will pave the way for
effective self-assessment; and the
implementation of PAYE as a final tax (2.1, 2.4).
Some further support to the implementation of
the new corporate plan may also be required
(2.2, 2.5) PFTAC will also contribute to the
development of a fiscal regime for the mining
sector (2.1), although HQ-financed resources
will also be needed on the policy and drafting
side. Following the completion of these
projects, potential areas for assistance include
building capacity in dealing with transfer
pricing (2.6) and implementing the 2009 FAD
recommendations on streamlining tax
incentives (2.1). The authorities have also
expressed interest in support in the customs
area, which is unlikely to be possible given
resource constraints.
In statistics, the focus of support will be
further development of the national accounts.
The ultimate aim is to have quarterly national
accounts being produced by 2013 (4.4), but in
advance of that PFTAC will support the
implementation of recommendations from the
recent review of national accounts
methodology, including the rebase planned in
2012 (4.1, 4.2) PFTAC will also support HQ-

financed work on the further development of
GDP-E (4.1). Contingent on resource
availability, support will also be provided for
enhancing balance of payment statistics, in
particular and additional price indices (4.9).
In financial sector supervision, the PFTAC
advisor will continue to be available for
consultations with RBF staff and will work on
regional issues with the RBF’s head of bank
supervision who is executive director of AFSPC.
No substantive TA in this area is anticipated as
Fiji is largely self-reliant and receives APRA
support.
In the macroeconomic area, work will focus
on building macroeconomic modeling and
analysis capacity in RBF (5.1, 5.2) with the aim
of having better inflation and external
forecasts to feed into monetary policy making.
Work on developing fiscal forecasts, including
for the natural resource sector will continue
with the Ministry of Finance (5.3, 5.5). Subject
to inputs from the PEM TA project, capacity
building in debt-sustainability analysis may
take place in 2012 (5.4). PFTAC has recently
provided support in modeling and exchange
rate issues.

ANNEX IV. FIJI: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of December 30, 2011)
The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) has
approved 18 loans totaling $303.6 million. The
AsDB has approved 80 TA projects, totaling
$27.0 million since 1970. AsDB opened a Pacific
sub-regional office in Suva in June 2004,
servicing Fiji and five other Pacific nations.
Following the military coup of December 2006,
AsDB’s disbursements and TA operations were
suspended. In April 2007, AsDB adopted an
Approach to Reengagement for Fiji which allows
for the completion of activities ongoing at the
time of the December 2006 coup, but not
approval of a new country partnership strategy
or new operations until Management judges
that five criteria have been met. While three
criteria have clearly been met, the stance of
some AsDB member countries toward the
government and Fiji’s suspension from the
Pacific Islands Forum and the Commonwealth
remain problematic. Periodic reports, to update
AsDB’s Board on the evolving situation in the
country, are prepared in line with the Approach
to Reengagement.
AsDB has three ongoing loan projects—two
that were ongoing at the time of the 2006
coup and one, Emergency Flood Recovery
Project for $17.5 million, was approved in
2009 as an exception to the Approach to
Reengagement. Supplementary financing for
the Third Fiji Road Upgrading Project
($26.8 million) and the Suva-Nausori Water

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Supply and Sanitation Project ($23.0 million)
was approved in 2009. The implementation of
all three projects is proceeding satisfactorily
with the road and water/sanitation projects
expected to be substantially complete by end
2013. The flood recovery loan is also expected
to be completed by 2014. Opportunities for
private sector operations continue to be
considered. Fiji has continued to benefit from
a limited amount of regional technical
assistance (TA) on a case-by-case basis, but
there are no ongoing country program TAs.
AsDB undertook a review of country portfolio
performance in 2010. While AsDB-financed
projects have not experienced significant
counterpart resource constraints to date, the
sustainability of the absorptive capacity of
various government agencies particularly as a
result of the migration of skilled staff to
implement programs is a long-term concern.
When the conditions for reengagement are in
place, a Country Partnership Strategy will be
prepared with government. Future operations
would likely include areas where there is a
clear poverty alleviation focus, both within
AsDB’s traditional sectors of assistance in Fiji
and also in relevant areas prioritized under
AsDB’s Strategy 2020. Grant co-financing and
capacity building technical assistance are also
likely to play important roles in any future
strategy.

REPUBLIC OF FIJI 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

ANNEX V. FIJI: STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of December 30, 2011)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Despite significant shortcomings in some areas, especially GDP and balance of
payments data, core economic and financial data provided to the Fund are generally adequate
for surveillance. Macroeconomic data are slowly improving, owing in part to the considerable
technical assistance provided by the Fund and PFTAC in recent years.
The Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) publishes the Annual Report, the Quarterly Review, and the
Monthly Economic Review. The Fiji Bureau of Statistics (FBOS) publishes a quarterly Current
Economic Statistics and a monthly Statistical News. The Ministry of Finance (MoF) issues the
Budget Address and the Supplement to the Budget Address on an annual basis. All of these
publications are received by APD on a regular basis.
Formal participation in the GDDS commenced on May 9, 2000, marked by the posting of the
metadata on the IMF’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. The metadata were last updated
in November 2002. The country has maintained its commitment to use the GDDS as a framework
for statistical development.
National Accounts: Production-side estimates of GDP at current and constant prices are
available up to 2010. Revised data were published in September 2010 using the 2002 Household
Income and Expenditure Survey, a new business census, and estimates of the informal sector.
Expenditure-side GDP data in constant prices are not available and expenditure-side GDP data in
current prices are only available through 2005. In addition, GDP broken down by income is only
available through 2005.
Price statistics: The FBOS is updating the CPI weights from the current 1993 base using results
of the 2002 Household Expenditure and Income survey. There have been persistent difficulties in
compiling export and import unit value indexes, mainly due to lack of continuity that resulted
from a switch to ASYCUDA for customs processing late in 1999. The FBOS plans to re-introduce
trade price indexes with a starting period of 2002 (to coincide with the new benchmark year for
national accounts).
Government finance statistics: Public debt data remain weak. Following a PFTAC supervised
project, reporting of data for publication in the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) Yearbook has
resumed. Data include a statement of sources and uses of cash for budgetary central
government, subdivisions of receipts and payments by economic category and outlays by
function. Data for 2006 in the format of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 are
available. Some inconsistencies remain between the GFS data and fiscal data provided to APD,

especially in the areas of nontax revenue, wages and salaries, other purchases of goods and
services, and subsidies and transfers. Other problem areas include a lack of transparency in
budget reporting, with some agencies outside the budget, including the Fiji Revenue and
Customs Authority; and an absence of published updates on the budget outcome and financing
sources.
Monetary statistics: Data on the monetary authorities and the deposit money banks are
comprehensive and provided to APD and STA on a regular and timely basis. Data on nonbank
financial institutions, including the Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF), are less regular, timely,
and reliable. With FNPF representing a large part of the financial sector, the unavailability of a
consolidated financial survey hampers economic and financial analysis. The RBF is in the process
of broadening its monetary survey into a depository corporation survey and compiling a financial
survey that covers nonbank financial institutions. A November 2005 expert mission, during a
PFTAC monetary statistics workshop, reviewed the compilation procedures and provided training
and a work plan for the RBF to comply with the methodology of the Monetary and Financial
Statistics Manual and to report using the standardized report forms (SRFs). Follow-up missions in
February 2008 and July 2011 provided advice on introducing the SRFs and developing an
integrated monetary database that will meet the data needs of the RBF, APD, and STA.
Balance of payments: The FBOS is nearing the end of a major PFTAC assisted project to compile
new balance of payments and revise historical data. Revised annual balance of payments data
were published in June 2010 that significantly reduced errors and omissions in 2008 from over
10 percent of GDP to about 6 percent of GDP. Initial estimates of quarterly balance of payments
data and the annual investment position were also published in June 2010. A separate project to
publish data on international trade in services is also nearing completion, while technical
assistance to address problems in the capital and financial accounts will start shortly. Balance of
payments data for the period up to end-2006 were reported to the Statistics Department for
publication in the 2007 Balance of Payments Yearbook. Problems remain in the measurement of
external debt, due to the absence of a consistent framework and insufficient coordination
between the RBF, the FBOS, and the MoF.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Fiji is a GDDS participant. The statistics advisor based at PFTAC in Suva is the GDDS Project
Manager for the Pacific region.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Fiji
On January 20, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Fiji.1
Background
Fiji’s economy is growing at a very slow pace, and that overshadows all other economic
concerns. After averaging 2¾ percent during the 1990s as well as the first five years of the new
millennium, growth dropped to under ¼ percent on average over the last five years, and while
urban poverty has declined, rural poverty remains stubbornly high.
After contracting for two years, the economy rebounded in 2011, growing by about 2 percent, by
far the best result of the past five years. But this was partly a bounce-back from a downturn,
and it seems unlikely, given fundamental and economic constraints, that growth will exceed
1½ to 2 percent on a sustained basis unless structural reforms are accelerated. Risks around
this outlook are tilted to the downside, given political uncertainties, structural weaknesses, and
the fragile global economy.
Inflation has risen sharply but should moderate soon. Headline inflation hovered around
10 percent year-on-year for several months in 2011, driven by imported food and fuel prices as
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

2
well as one-off increases in the VAT, various administered prices, and the electricity tariff. There
is little evidence of generalized price pressures, and core inflation remains moderate.
Commodity prices are now falling, and the one-off factors will drop out. Inflation should be
around 6 percent by the beginning of 2012 and fall toward 3½ percent over the medium term,
reflecting the anemic growth outlook, projected small declines in oil prices, and the authorities’
tight control of public wages.
Monetary conditions are accommodative and the system is awash with liquidity on account of
foreign exchange inflows. However, credit growth has been slow, and banks’ loan-deposit ratio
remains below 90 percent. While lending to the private sector is now rising at about 5 percent,
the RBF is concerned that SMEs and others are being shut out. After holding steady for six
months, the RBF cut its policy rate in late October by 100 basis points, to ½ percent. It is also
considering an SME lending guarantee scheme, among other measures, to spur lending.
Higher food and oil prices have contributed to weak external balances. Fiji’s current account
deficit is expected to register around 12 percent of GDP in 2011. Over the medium term,
however, as remittances, tourism receipts, and goods exports, including sugar, grow while oil
imports flatten out and non-oil imports grow moderately, the current account deficit could narrow
to around 8 percent of GDP, leaving the overall balance in surplus. Gross reserves are thus
kept healthy, despite increased dividend repatriation and some offshoring of Fiji National
Provident Fund’s (FNPF) investment. Econometric estimates suggest that the exchange rate is
broadly in line with fundamentals.
The fiscal deficit is expected to have widened to 3½ percent of GDP in 2011 and projected to
fall again in 2012, reflecting trends in Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC) restructuring costs. Debt is
currently above 50 percent of GDP—relatively high for a small economy vulnerable to shocks—
and the government also faces contingent liabilities of more than 15 percent of GDP, as well as
unfunded FNPF liabilities. The authorities’ planned fiscal trajectory, which would put the deficit
at around 2 percent of GDP in 2012 and reduce it to 1½ percent of GDP from 2013 onward,
would reduce the debt ratio steadily, but additional measures may be needed to achieve that
trajectory.
The financial sector is stable, but FNPF finances are unsustainable over the long run. The
banks are well capitalized, with low NPLs and adequate loan loss provisioning. The financecompany and insurance sectors are stable, but the largest nonbank financial institution, the
FNPF, is actuarially unsustainable: its current pension annuitization rates, which vary from 15 to
25 percent for different pensioners, imply negative net cashflows by 2030 and depleted assets
by 2056.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the recent rebound of Fiji’s economy and viewed the authorities’
macroeconomic policies as generally appropriate. Directors concurred that boosting sustainable
growth and reducing poverty through structural reform is the top priority.

3
Directors welcomed the authorities’ fiscal consolidation plans, growth friendly tax rate
reductions, and increased public investment. They noted, however, that additional measures
may be needed to achieve the deficit targets. Curbing discretionary tax concessions would raise
revenue while improving the system’s transparency and efficiency.
In light of the benign inflation outlook, Directors saw the accommodative monetary stance as
broadly appropriate. Given the structural lack of credit demand and the weak transmission
mechanism, the effectiveness of low policy rates may nevertheless be limited. Directors
cautioned against credit growth targets, which could distort lending and lower credit quality.
They agreed that the exchange rate peg has been a useful nominal anchor. While the rate is
broadly aligned with fundamentals, it should be adjusted regularly to avoid the need for large,
disruptive step devaluations.
Directors noted that high debt and poor monetary transmission limit Fiji’s capacity to respond to
a global downturn. In an extreme scenario, however, some fiscal stimulus—and possibly
exchange rate adjustment—could be justified.
Directors saw reform of the Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF) as the key financial sector
priority. They welcomed the announced introduction of actuarially sound pension rates and
supported the FNPF’s effort to rehabilitate existing investments and diversify abroad.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ focus on structural reform and stressed that improvements
in the investment climate are key to enhancing policy effectiveness and raising growth. In this
context, they called for continued progress in resolving political uncertainties and a more
consultative approach to policymaking.
Directors supported the reform plans for land policy, the sugar sector, the civil service, and
public enterprises, while encouraging faster progress in many areas. They called on the
authorities to rapidly scale back the price control regime, strengthen antitrust enforcement, and
increase social transfers to cushion the adverse impact on the poorest. Directors also urged the
removal of remaining exchange restrictions.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program

Statement by Aida S. Budiman, Alternational Executive Director and
Ernando Santos De Leon, Senior Advisor
January 20, 2012
Our Fijian authorities would like to express their gratitude to staff for the useful assessment
of Fiji’s recent economic performance and outlook. The analysis provided in the report
could serve as useful reference in efforts of authorities to promote sustainable and more
vibrant economic growth in the years to come. Authorities agree with the general thrust of
the report although there are differences of perception on how strong the recent and future
policy changes as well as reforms will impact positively on economic fundamentals. There
are challenges faced by the economy, but the authorities’ resolve to continuously pursue
structural and political reforms as well as implement stabilization measures should help
foster improved investment climate conducive to stronger economic growth over the medium
term.
Recent developments and outlook
Fiji’s economy rebounded in 2011 after exhibiting contractions for two consecutive years due
partly to the global financial crisis. In particular, annual growth could be about 2 percent in
2011, which is the highest rate of expansion since 2006. Economic growth was accounted
for mainly by agriculture, notably sugarcane production which rose sharply from 2010’s
year’s record low and other subsectors recovering from cyclone damage. Authorities expect
the economy to post respectable growth over the medium term. Indeed, there are downside
risks to the growth outlook, such as structural impediments, political uncertainties and fragile
global economy. However, given the structural and political reforms earlier put in place and
future plans for reforms, authorities are confident that a faster pace of economic growth is
achievable.
Monthly inflation rate was elevated in most months of 2011 owing to external and domestic
supply-side shocks. However, core inflation remains moderate, indicating that there is little
evidence of a general increase in price level. Inflation rate has started to decelerate in recent
months as fuel and food import prices has started to decline. This factor along with the
diminished effects of the earlier increases in VAT rate and electricity tariff restructuring are
expected to result in a benign inflation outlook.
The fiscal deficit is estimated to have widened to 3.5 percent of GDP in 2011 due mainly to
the restructuring cost of Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC), even as revenues continue to rise. In
2012, falling FSC restructuring costs and sustained improvement in revenues are expected to
result in further reduction of the fiscal deficit to 1.9 percent of GDP.
Meanwhile, the banking and insurance sector remain sound and stable. Banks are well
capitalized with low NPLs and adequate loan loss provisioning. Authorities recognize that
the viability of Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF), which is the largest non-bank financial

2
institution in the country, could pose a challenge to the stability of the financial system.
Putting the current reform of FNPF as key priority, the authorities have issued FNPF Decree
2011 requiring a more robust governance framework for the FNPF, solvency requirements to
be met by each fund that the FNPF establishes and reduced annuity rates which will support
the sustainability of the FNPF moving forward. FNPF Decree shall take effect from March 1,
2012.
On the external front, higher commodity prices have widened the current account deficit to
an estimated level equivalent to 11 percent of GDP in 2011. However, improving
remittances and tourist receipts as well as exports of goods, coupled with a moderate growth
of imports will contribute to a lower current account deficit and a small overall BOP surplus,
over the medium term. In turn, allowing for a healthy level of international reserves over the
medium term.
Macroeconomic policies
Authorities recognize the importance of sustaining the reform momentum over the medium
term to allow the economy to shift to a more vibrant and sustainable growth path. At the
same time, authorities believe that a more active role by the government to stimulate the
economy is warranted over the short term, while waiting for the reform measures to bear
fruit.
On Fiscal policy. Revenue generating measures were put in place to sustain capital
expenditures, while reforms in the tax regime and administration were amended to promote
investment activities in 2011. Similar investor-friendly tax measures were also included in
the 2012 budget. In particular, corporate tax rate was cut from 28 percent to 20 percent.
Personal income tax rate was reduced for most taxpayers to promote consumption spending.
However, this was accompanied by revenue enhancing measures such as a new social
responsibility levy of 23 percent or more on the highest earners for a more equitable tax
burden and other tax broadening measures. The 2012 Budget framework also addresses the
issue of discretionary concessions by including concessions granted under Section 10 of the
Customs Tariff Act1 into the tariff code administered by the Fiji Revenue and Customs
Authority and narrowing the eligibility criteria to reduce the number of concessions
approved. Authorities are confident that these revenue reforms will allow them to sustain an
appropriate level of public investment that will help enhance competitiveness and support
growth over the medium term, while optimizing its short term fiscal cost. The expected rise
in investments will subsequently contribute to the attainment of the objective to keep fiscal
deficits at 1.9 percent of GDP in 2012 and 1.5 percent of GDP from 2013. In turn, resulting
in steadily falling public debt to GDP ratio.
On Monetary Policy. Given the benign inflation outlook, an accommodative monetary policy
is appropriate to support growth. However, authorities recognize the need for continued
1

A section in the Customs Tariff Act which provides the Minister for Finance discretionary powers to reduce or
waive customs duty.

3
vigilance for any signs of buildup of inflationary pressures and readiness to be proactive in
stemming inflation. In this respect, authorities have continuously communicated to market
players of such monetary policy intent.
The growth of domestic liquidity had risen substantially in mid 2011 due to foreign exchange
inflows, before falling back a little towards the end of the year. However, private sector
credit grew at a relatively subdued pace. Authorities are concerned that the observed rise in
bank credit is not trickling in to SMEs and other priority sectors. In view of this, RBF
decided to cut the policy rate in October 2011, after holding it steady for six months to spur
bank lending to the priority sectors. Authorities emphasized that their intent to increase bank
lending to SMEs will not be at the expense of relaxing credit standards. Likewise, authorities
believe that increasing credit access of SMEs and other priority sectors will contribute to a
more inclusive growth and help alleviate rural poverty. However, they are well aware that
such should be pursued without undermining the soundness and stability of the financial
system.
Structural Reforms
Authorities are of the view that addressing political uncertainties and structural impediments
are the only path towards a sustainable and higher growth trajectory. In this regard, the
earlier announced lifting of the Public Emergency Regulations was effected on January 7,
2012 so as to facilitate national consultations on a new constitution, while the electoral
allocation made in the 2012 budget signals a clearer path toward the holding of a 2014
election. In the area of dismantling structural impediments to growth, several sector-specific
reforms to unravel the economy’s potential are in progress.
For instance, institutional capacity was enhanced for encouraging competition within Fiji’s
marketplace and regulating prices when necessary in 2010. The list of controlled items has
shrunk over the years. To date, price controls are confined to basic hardware items, such as
bagged and bulk cement, concrete blocks, roofing products and electrical products. However,
authorities are cognizant that price controls are a temporary arrangement and should be
removed. Ensuring more productive use of the nation’s land has been a major focus of the
authorities’ reform efforts. The maximum allowable lease tenures have been extended and a
Land Bank has recently been set up to better deploy the nation’s assets. Moving forward, the
focus is towards strengthening institutional capacity for a more competitive mechanism and
efficient vehicle for leasing native lands. Recent reforms in the sugar sector encompass
institutional arrangements, cane production, harvesting and transport system as well as
milling operations. In 2012, FSC’s organizational structure will be reviewed to set the
direction for reorganizing FSC. Strategies to improve harvesting and transportation,
including maintenance of rail networks, are being formulated. Likewise, the Sugar Cane
Growers Fund Act (Cap. 207) will be revised to allow the establishment of a Farmers Bank
(Grameen model).
To better manage contingent liabilities, government guarantees are provided only to selected
entities and is aimed at strengthening and improving their financial performance and to

4
maximize return on shareholders’ funds. With improved financial performance, public
entities will be able to seek credit directly from financial institutions. This will in turn allow
Government to remove its guarantee cover to reduce fiscal strain and strengthen corporate
governance. In exceptional cases, the provision of government guarantees will only be
allowed to expedite infrastructure projects that are of national interest.
In its efforts to alleviate poverty in rural areas as well as support growth, the Government has
allocated $3 million in the 2012 Budget for the set up of a Credit Guarantee Scheme for
SMEs to be administered by the RBF. The decision to pursue this took into account the need
to balance the objective of supporting growth with that of establishing a financially viable
and sustainable credit guarantee facility.
On the financial sector, a reform plan has been adopted since April 2010 consisting of a
series of measures that aim to ensure the long term viability of FNPF. The plan included
implementing steps to reduce the pension conversion rate to a sustainable level, requiring a
more robust governance framework and solvency standards to be met by each fund that the
FNPF establishes, rehabilitating some non-performing assets to ensure they are correctly
valued, modernizing the FNPF Act and upgrading information technology systems. In 2011,
FNPF secured approval from RBF to invest around 4 percent of its assets through the
services of a foreign-based fund manager and has commenced making overseas investments.
As part of the long term plan for enhanced viability, FNPF is pushing to increase the
overseas investment limit to up to 20 percent of its total assets. On reducing the pension
conversion rate, the 2012 budget included policy announcement that an actuarially sound
pension rate, along with transitional arrangements would be introduced on March 1, 2012. In
particular, authorities will implement the planned reduction of the pension conversion rate to
8.7 percent for single life annuities and from 11 percent to 7.5 percent for joint life annuities
from March 1, 2012. Meanwhile, existing pensioners will be given the option to withdraw
from the scheme or rejoin at the reduced level of pension.
Final Remarks
Authorities are cognizant that macroeconomic stability and structural reforms are key to the
attainment of sustainable and higher economic growth path. In this regard, Fijian authorities
will do their utmost efforts to implement their fiscal consolidation path and other important
structural reform as envisaged to boost the economic growth and investment climate. The
medium-term plan of fiscal deficit path, including the revenue reforms, as announced
recently in the 2012 Budget framework will lay a strong foundation for the economy. These
revenue reforms will allow policy room to sustain an appropriate level of public investments
to promote competitiveness while optimizing its short term fiscal cost. Authorities are also
committed to be vigilant for any buildup of inflationary pressures and proactive in promoting
price stability. Likewise, the momentum to remove the structural impediments to growth will
be sustained in the period ahead, along with promoting political stability.
