STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND REQUEST FOR A THREE-YEAR ARRANGEMENT UNDER
THE EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY

KEY ISSUES
Background: Yemen has made good progress since the 2011 crisis in advancing the
political transition. However, the fledgling economic recovery remained insufficient to
make a dent in unemployment and poverty, and fundamental reforms were postponed
for fear of derailing the National Dialogue that was central to the political transition.
The macroeconomic situation weakened further since early 2014, with increased
sabotage of oil facilities leading to a decline in oil revenue and, therefore, a
deterioration in the fiscal and external positions and severe fuel and electricity
shortages. To address the difficult economic situation, the authorities have adopted a
bold reform agenda to preserve macroeconomic stability and set the stage for boosting
growth, employment creation, and poverty alleviation. They requested Fund support
under an ECF arrangement with access of 150 percent of quota in consideration of the
strength of the reforms and large financing needs.
Outlook and Risks: Growth and other macroeconomic indicators are projected to
improve steadily over the medium term as a result of the reform efforts and
improvements in security. Institutional capacity constraints and/or deterioration in
security or the political environment could delay reform implementation, in particular
energy subsidy reforms. Such delays could destabilize the economy and necessitate
even stronger adjustments later on.
Policy Discussions: Discussions focused mainly on sequencing and speed of reforms in
view of the large financing needs of the budget. Since the successful implementation of
the RCF in 2012, there has been an ongoing dialogue with the authorities and a broad
agreement on priority reforms, with differences of views on the timing and feasibility of
the various reforms during the political transition. After the recent progress achieved in
advancing political transition, and the increased economic challenges, the authorities
have decided to move ahead with a strong reform program. The program aims to
reduce the fiscal deficit to more manageable levels and reorient public spending from
generalized subsidies to infrastructure investment and direct social transfers, with the
objective to generate growth and employment and better benefit the poor. The
authorities also agreed with staff on the need to improve fiscal performance by
eliminating ghost workers and double dippers from the civil service payroll, and by

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

increasing nonhydrocarbon revenue. Other agreed reforms aim at ensuring financial
sector soundness and improving intermediation and the business environment to
support growth and job creation.
Other Article IV Issues: An updated debt sustainability analysis indicates that the risk
of debt distress continues to be moderate. Plans to introduce fiscal federalism need to
ensure appropriate expenditure and debt-contracting policies and controls. A gradual
increase in exchange rate flexibility over the medium term would help protect
competitiveness and reserves, and would support growth and job creation. More efforts
are needed to further improve economic data and to strengthen capacity in AML/CFT.

BACKGROUND
1.
Yemen’s geopolitical situation is critical from a regional and global perspective. It
shares long borders with Saudi Arabia and overlooks al-Mandeb Strait across the Horn of Africa.
High levels of poverty and unemployment are contributing to political tensions, with negative
security spillovers. Security is also affected by the conflict with the Houthis and the Southern
separatists, and by the strong presence of Al-Qaeda.
2.
The political transition is advancing, though the outlook remains challenging. After
some delay, the National Dialogue was concluded in January 2014 with an agreement to establish a
six-region federal state.1 The parliamentary and presidential elections have been postponed to 2015
to allow time to complete the transition process. A new constitution is being drafted and will
determine the degree of autonomy that will be granted to the regional governments. Open
confrontation with the different factions, and with Al-Qaeda, remains frequent. Recent increases in
sabotage of oil pipelines and the electricity grid have led to severe shortages of fuel and electricity.
These prompted large demonstrations and a limited reshuffle in the coalition cabinet in June 2014.
3.
Economic growth has been insufficient to meaningfully reduce the widespread poverty
and unemployment. The average growth rate in real per capita GDP was less than 1.5 percent a
year in the decade preceding the 2011 crisis, and has declined since. Yemen ranks poorly in social
indicators. Poverty and youth unemployment which are estimated at 54 percent and 35 percent,
respectively, are among the highest in the world. About 60 percent of children under the age of five
have chronic malnutrition, 35 percent are underweight, and 13 percent have acute malnutrition. In
addition, maternal mortality, at 290 per 100,000 live births, is among the highest in the world.
Infrastructure investment has continued to decline since the crisis, and foreign direct investment
remains concentrated in the hydrocarbon sector, which employs a very small percentage of the
labor force. Yemen also faces severe environmental challenges, especially a rapid depletion of its
scarce water resources (Table 10).
4.
Faced with rapidly deteriorating fiscal and external positions in the first half of 2014,
the authorities requested a three-year ECF arrangement in support of a bold reform program.
This program builds on reform plans that were discussed with staff over the past year. The reform
package aims at reversing the recent deterioration in the macroeconomic situation and promoting
inclusive growth and job creation. These objectives will be achieved through (i) reducing generalized
subsidies and eliminating ghost workers and double-dippers from the public wage payroll;
(ii) increasing infrastructure spending and social transfers; (iii) strengthening public financial

In 2011, political and social unrest caused a crisis which led to a political agreement supported by the Gulf
Cooperation Council. A National Unity Government was formed in December 2011 and President Hadi was elected in
early 2012 to manage an initial two-year transition period. The transition period was extended in 2014 until the
drafting of the constitution and the holding of Presidential and legislative elections.

management and governance; and (iv) improving financial intermediation and the business
environment.
5.
The authorities are fully committed to the reform agenda, and requested an ECF
arrangement to support their strong program and help close the BOP and fiscal financing gap.
Ad referendum agreement on an ECF arrangement was reached twice in 2013, but the program was
not endorsed by the government at that time due to concerns about the impact of fuel price
adjustments. However, following the sharp decline in oil production and domestic supply of fuel
products in the first half of 2014, black market prices reached international prices and lack of
financing reduced the availability of fuel at the subsidized prices. To resolve this situation, the
political leadership made strong public commitments to implement the necessary reforms. A
centerpiece of these reforms is a substantial adjustment in prices in October 2014, aiming at a
reduction of about 50 percent of the subsidy. As a first step, the private sector has been allowed to
import part of its diesel requirements at international prices starting in June 2014. In view of the
strength of the program and the large financing need, the authorities requested access of
150 percent of quota.2
6.
Yemen has a strong track record of implementing reforms supported by the April 2012
RCF. These reforms were successful in restoring macroeconomic stability, and included a substantial
increase in diesel prices. The authorities also implemented important reforms that were
recommended in the context of the 2013 Article IV consultation (Box 1), and which had underpinned
initially two staff-level ad referendum agreements that had been reached in 2013 but not concluded.
In particular, the authorities unified the domestic price of diesel, improved tax compliance, did not
approve requests to extend tax exemptions, contained the wage bill, refrained from central bank
borrowing, and introduced corporate governance reforms in the banking sector, including
publishing the full audited accounts of the central bank.
7.
A Fund-supported program would help unlock disbursements of substantial donor
pledges. Total pledges by the Friends of Yemen to support Yemen’s Transitional Program for
Stability and Development (TPSD) totaled about $8 billion for the period 2012–15. Only one-third of
these pledges have been disbursed thus far, including a $1 billion Saudi deposit at the Central Bank
of Yemen (CBY).3 Donor support is largely earmarked for capital spending and humanitarian needs,
mostly outside the budget. The authorities established an Executive Bureau in February 2013 to
speed up the implementation and funding of projects. More recently, with the urgent need for
donor support to fill the financing gap, and in consideration of the strength of the reforms agreed
by the authorities to address the macroeconomic situation, donors have agreed to shift and/or
increase their disbursements, which are expected to fully finance the program supported by the
proposed ECF arrangement.
2

The access norm for ECF arrangement is 120 percent of quota per ECF arrangement for countries with total
outstanding concessional IMF credit under all facilities of less than 100 percent of quota.
3

In addition to its Friends of Yemen pledges, Saudi Arabia provided about $2 billion to Yemen in the form of an oil
grant in late 2011 and in 2012.

Box 1. Implementation of Key Recommendations of the 2013 Article IV Consultation
In concluding the 2013 Article IV consultation on July 19, 2013, Directors encouraged the authorities to
contain the fiscal deficit, improve the structure of revenue and expenditure, and enhance capacity to
coordinate and execute donor-financed projects. They also called on the authorities to continue to improve
bank supervision, financial intermediation, and the business environment.
Notwithstanding the substantial decline in hydrocarbon revenue in 2014, the authorities have thus far
exercised expenditure restraint and thus contained the fiscal deficit. Good progress has also been made in
improving tax revenue. Furthermore, the wage and generalized subsidy bills have been contained in relation
to GDP. However, direct transfers and capital spending have also declined from their already low levels.
Efforts continued to strengthen bank supervision, although progress has been hindered by delays in
technical assistance due to security constraints. Financial intermediation remained very low, and structural
reforms to improve the business environment have been lagging. Capacity to enhance collaboration with
donors and execution of projects are being improved, including by strengthening and adequately
empowering the management and staff of the Executive Bureau.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
A. Recent Developments
8.
The macroeconomic situation continued to be relatively stable in 2013, and growth
remained moderate. Nonhydrocarbon growth was steady at about 4 percent, while hydrocarbon
growth picked up strongly, reversing part of the oil output decline in preceding two years. As a
result, real GDP growth is estimated to have doubled to almost 5 percent. At the same time, average
inflation edged up slightly to reach 11 percent (up from about 10 percent a year earlier), and the
exchange rate remained stable.
9.
The overall fiscal deficit worsened only moderately in 2013 despite a large decline in
grants. Although grants declined by about 5 percent of GDP, the overall fiscal deficit deteriorated
by only 0.6 percent of GDP, to reach 6.9 percent. This was achieved through a combination of
expenditure restraint and an increase in nonhydrocarbon revenue. Subsidies and transfers were
reduced by about 2.7 percent of GDP, mostly through limiting the supply of fuel products and
shifting the schedule for payment of the subsidy bill by one month. Capital spending was also
reduced by 1.3 percent of GDP. A 2012 decision to generalize an increase in civil servants’
allowances was also not implemented, leading to a 0.9 percent reduction in the wage bill. As a
result, the underlying fiscal deficit (defined as the nonhydrocarbon primary deficit, excluding grants)
narrowed by about 6 percent of GDP. This adjustment was forced by the lack of financing and the
authorities’ determination to refrain from central bank borrowing.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

10.
The widening of the external current account deficit was also moderate in 2013. The
large decline in grants was mitigated by healthy growth in exports and remittances. At the same
time, capital outflows increased, reflecting large scheduled amortization of oil companies’ past FDI
and the nonrecurrence of the large Saudi deposit of 2012. As a result, gross reserves declined by
about $740 million to reach $4,854 million, or 4.5 months of imports, despite the sale to the central
bank of pension funds’ holdings of about $250 million. On the other hand, the real effective
exchange rate appreciated by 6.5 percent due to the relatively high domestic inflation and the
nominal depreciation against the dollar of the currencies of Yemen’s key trading partners.
11.
Monetary policy continued to be generally prudent, but fiscal dominance remained
high. Broad money growth was slightly slower than the growth of nominal GDP, mostly reflecting
the decline in net foreign assets. However, net claims on central government continued to grow
rapidly at about 28 percent. Private sector credit growth was also high, at 39 percent, from a very
low base and after declining in the preceding two years. On February 7, 2013, the CBY reduced the
benchmark deposit interest rate from 18 percent to 15 percent.
12.
The banking system remained stable, but some vulnerabilities remain. Banks are
profitable and liquid, and capital adequacy ratios are high, albeit in large part reflecting the large
zero-risk-weighted government securities on banks’ balance sheets. Nonperforming loans remain
high, as does assets concentration in government securities. Islamic banks have high exposure to
real estate markets abroad. The banking sector remains small, and financial markets and the
payment system are underdeveloped, limiting financial intermediation and monetary policy
transmission.
13.
The recent wave of sabotage to oil pipelines has had strong adverse effects on
macroeconomic developments in the first half of 2014. The frequent sabotage resulted in a
significant decline in oil production and exports. This has led to pressures on the fiscal and external
positions. In the absence of reforms, the fiscal deficit would reach 9 percent of GDP and reserves
would decline to well-below three months of imports. In addition, severe fuel and electricity
shortages have negatively affected economic activity, with real GDP growth expected to decelerate
to less than 2 percent.

B. Outlook and Risks
14.
Yemen’s medium-term outlook is largely predicated on the implementation of reforms
under the ECF arrangement and on improvements in security. Growth is projected to recover
gradually, reaching about 6 percent by 2018 partly reflecting utilization of the idle capacity created
following the substantial slump of 2011, before decelerating somewhat to more moderate levels in
the longer term. The planned increase in fuel prices in October is expected to raise inflation to the
low double digits in late 2014 and throughout most of 2015. Inflation would then decline steadily
starting in late 2015. The fiscal and external positions will improve gradually over the medium term
as a result of reforms, the recovery of hydrocarbon exports, and upward revisions in the contracted
low liquefied natural gas (LNG) export prices.

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

15.
Timely implementation of reforms and concomitant donor support to the budget will
be critical to this encouraging outlook. Delays in implementing reforms, particularly energy
subsidy reforms, would destabilize the economy in the short run, and jeopardize the medium-term
growth and poverty reduction objectives. The outlook is also predicated on the implementation of
other strong reforms to help reorient the budget structure from inefficient expenditures to progrowth and pro-poor expenditures. These include, in particular, civil service reforms, improvements
in tax policy and revenue administration, enhanced public financial management, and structural
reforms to improve financial intermediation and the business environment. Timely donors’ support
to the budget is also important, to reduce the crowding out of private sector credit, and to help
catalyze domestic support for the reforms in the very difficult political and security environment.
16.
Global and country-specific risks to Yemen’s economic outlook are detailed in the Risk
Assessment Matrix (Box 3). Political and security risks constitute the main challenges because they
could further affect oil production, disrupt policy implementation, and discourage investment. The
prospective shift to fiscal federalism, if not well-designed and supported by institution- and
capacity-building, could present fiscal and debt challenges. On the upside, the outlook could benefit
from the recent renegotiation of higher LNG prices and from a faster improvement in security and
oil production. The broad representation of all major political parties in the coalition government
reduces the risk of policy disruptions after the elections, which are likely to take place next year.
A clear public communication of the necessity and benefits of reforms would also help ensure
continued national ownership of the program and reduce the risks of policy slippages.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
17.
Reforms will aim to address both short-term challenges and lay the foundations for
medium- and -long term inclusive and sustainable growth. The key objectives are to contain the
negative macroeconomic impact of the recent oil shock, and to gradually reorient fiscal and
monetary policies to create the conditions for high inclusive growth and poverty alleviation.
Financial sector and structural reforms are also key to meeting these goals. While being strong, the
design of the reform program takes into account the difficult social and political conditions through
appropriate sequencing and protection of the poor. The structural measures that will help achieve
these objectives and goals are listed in Table 2 of the MEFP (Appendix 1).

A. Fiscal Policy for 2014 and the Medium Term
18.
The immediate challenge is to reduce the fiscal deficit for 2014 within the limits of the
available financing, in a manner that will be consistent with preserving macroeconomic
stability. In the absence of immediate corrective measures, the fiscal deficit could have widened to
as much as 9 percent of GDP, from 6.9 percent a year earlier. This deficit would have been
impossible to fill from available external financing and from own resources without jeopardizing the
macroeconomic stability that has been in place since 2012. The authorities therefore decided to act
promptly to reduce the 2014 deficit to 5.4 percent of GDP (and the underlying nonhydrocarbon
primary fiscal deficit excluding grants to 12.7 percent of GDP from 15.2 percent in 2013). Even after
this exceptional effort, there will still be a need for a sizable domestic financing effort, through new
net issuance of government securities, greater external donor support, and recourse to Fund
financing under the requested ECF arrangement. Disbursements under the ECF arrangement will go

directly to finance the Budget and help close the financing gap (Text Table 1). The CBY and Ministry
of Finance will sign a Memorandum of Understanding on the use of Fund resources, which specifies
responsibilities for timely servicing financial obligations to the Fund and for maintenance of a
specific government account at the CBY to receive the Fund financing (prior action; MEFP, Table 2).
19.
The program also aims at improving the structure of expenditure and revenue, and at
further reducing the fiscal deficit over the medium term. The authorities agreed that the
structure of expenditure is currently inconsistent with supporting growth, job creation, and social
protection, and that fiscal consolidation needs to continue in the years ahead. The program
therefore aims at steadily reducing the overall deficit to 4.2 percent of GDP over the medium term,
by increasing nonhydrocarbon revenue and reducing lower-quality expenditures. At the same time,
higher-quality public expenditure (such as direct social transfers and infrastructure investment) will
be increased. The underlying fiscal position (nonhydrocarbon primary balance excluding grants),
which is the fiscal anchor of the reform program, will thus improve during the program period by
about 6 percent of GDP. This fiscal adjustment path is laid out in Text Table 2, and its supporting
measures are detailed below. Public debt will be kept below 50 percent of GDP, and the need for
domestic financing will decline by half to more than 3.5 percent of GDP, thus reducing fiscal
dominance. The improvement in the fiscal deficit will also reduce the pressure on the external
position and would therefore help protect gross reserves.

20.
A centerpiece of the reform package is designed to respond to the recent decline in oil
revenue and fuel shortages by reforming energy subsidies. Official fuel prices are currently at
about half of international levels. The large subsidy has been benefiting the rich disproportionately
and creating an incentive for smuggling, corruption, and inefficient use of fuel, including by the
small electricity producers. At the same time, fuel is largely unavailable to the population at
subsidized prices, and black market prices are reported to have reached international levels. As a
first step toward eliminating these subsidies, the authorities agreed to allow the private sector to
directly import fuel or buy it from the Aden refinery, for their own use at international prices. A
decision to this effect was issued shortly after the mission and was implemented starting in June
2014. This measure will create savings of close to 0.3 percent of GDP, or $130 million in the
remainder of 2014 (prior action; MEFP, ¶ 23). Second, the official fuel prices will be adjusted in
October by about 50 percent on average (MEFP, ¶20). These price adjustments would reduce the
subsidy bill by about 3.5 percent of GDP on an annual basis, although the saving in 2014 will be
limited to 0.2 percent due to the two-month lag in settling the subsidy bill (Box 2; and MEFP, ¶23).
Lastly, an asymmetric price adjustment mechanism will be introduced in mid-2015; this mechanism
will allow domestic prices to increase in response to increases in international prices and gradually
eliminate the residual subsidy over time. Staff initially suggested that the automatic price
mechanism be put in place before end-2014. It was, however, agreed to first assess the impact of
the October reforms, and then conduct a study to design the proposed system. The authorities
requested TA from FAD to ensure proper design and implementation.
21.
The authorities will also postpone implementation of a 2012 decision to increase wage
allowances. This will generate about 0.4 percent of savings in 2014. The program entails a civil
service reform that will be phased in over the medium term. The authorities believe that reforms on
this front will require more time for preparations that include identifying ghost workers and doubledippers. Thus, immediate measures will aim to steadily move from cash payment of wages and
salaries to payments using bank account and postal services (MEFP, ¶24, Table 2). Implementation of
the biometric identification system will be gradually generalized throughout the civil service and the
military, and a census of personnel will be implemented (MEFP, ¶24, Table 2).
22.
The need to immediately improve social protection was also agreed. Yemen’s Social
Welfare Fund (SWF) already covers about 40 percent of the population and is considered one of the
best-operating funds in the region. However, other large inefficient public expenditures have left
little resources for the fund’s transfers to the poor. The implementation of subsidy reform would free
substantial resources for the SWF and other high-quality expenditures. The program, therefore,
entails a 50 percent increase in SWF transfers to the poor, concurrent with the fuel price adjustments
in October (MEFP, ¶23). This would allow for raising the average monthly transfer per family from
about $18 to about $27. Coverage of the SWF will continue to be improved, with the help of the
World Bank and other partners.
23.
Another part of the savings from fuel subsidies reform will be used to increase
infrastructure investment over the medium term. This would help spread the social impact of
reforms beyond the SWF, and would boost job-creation and potential growth. Capital spending has

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

been crowded out by fuel subsidies and the large wage bill. Since 2010, its level in relation to GDP
was halved to reach a low of 2.4 percent. This contributed to the sharp decline in gross domestic
investment, which fell to well below 10 percent of GDP. At the same time, Yemen’s need for
infrastructure investment, including roads, utilities, and irrigation, is large and increasing. The
program will therefore aim at protecting capital spending in relation to GDP in the remainder of
2014, and then steadily increasing it to about 4 percent of GDP over the medium term. Priority will
be given to infrastructure expenditures and efficient public works that are labor intensive. These will
be geographically spread and transparently tendered, to improve inclusiveness and governance. Part
of these investments will be implemented through the Social Development Fund (SDF) which has a
good track record in supporting SMEs. Furthermore, the domestic component of foreign-financed
projects will be secured and timely implemented in coordination with the Executive Bureau so as to
maximize the catalytic effect of public investment.
24.
On the revenue side, reforms will target enhancing tax revenue collection by about
1.2 percent of GDP in 2014. The authorities believed that passing new tax legislation would be very
difficult before the writing of the constitution and the elections planned for next year. Therefore, for
2014, discussions focused on tax and customs administration measures to simplify procedures,
enhance compliance, and fight fraud and smuggling (MEFP, ¶25). Tax compliance in Yemen is very
low by regional and international standards (Figure 3). Yemen has shown a strong track record in
this area in recent years and there remains substantial scope for continued improvement, building
on the progress made thus far. The authorities are determined to continue to improve filing and
payment compliance to 65 percent by end-2014. Furthermore, the authorities will produce an
inventory of all existing exemptions and reduced tax rates, and refrain from introducing any
measures that would expand the scope of tax and customs exemptions, including any amendments
to the 2010 investment law. Reforms in 2015 will include a review of the GST law and the assessment
of the revenue impact of existing tax exemptions, with a view to streamlining them.
25.
The authorities have prepared a contingency plan to offset the impact of downside
risks, should these materialize. The government will closely monitor developments in budget
financing resources and expenditure implementation, and will adjust programmed spending plans
as needed, should there be shortfalls in the financing. At the same time, the government will resist
any new spending beyond the allocated spending envelopes in the revised framework, except for
security and the requirements of political transition (MEFP, ¶21). Should there be need for
emergency spending, authorization for such expenditure will be accompanied by simultaneous
instructions for compensatory cuts on lower-priority spending. The government will also avoid
accumulation of arrears. It will put in place a system to monitor and report expenditure arrears on a
quarterly basis, and will adopt a gradual program to clear all outstanding arrears over the medium
term (MEFP, ¶29).
26.
Public finance management reforms will aim at strengthening budget execution and
reporting. The authorities will complete the deployment of the Accounting-based Financial
Management Information System (AFMIS) into 55 spending units by the end of 2014. In the
following years, they will implement a strategy to transfer the treasury functions from the CBY to the

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

Ministry of Finance in line with past TA recommendations. In addition, ongoing reforms should take
into account future plans to introduce fiscal federalism and ensure that appropriate expenditures
and debt-contracting procedures and controls are introduced to safeguard fiscal discipline under
the prospective federal system.
27.
The authorities will strengthen infrastructure implementation capacity as well as
donor aid coordination. To improve the quality of public sector investment and help catalyze
donors’ disbursements, the government has been undertaking reforms to strengthen project
selection, procurement, implementation, and monitoring, in close coordination with the World Bank
and other donors (MEFP, ¶27). To this end, it established the Executive Bureau in 2013, to help speed
up disbursement of donor support and strengthen project management. Furthermore, the
government, with the assistance of the World Bank, has set up the Mutual Accountability Framework
to monitor progress in donors’ assistance.
28.
The risk of debt distress is currently assessed to be moderate (Supplement for Joint Debt
Sustainability Analysis). Nevertheless, the government is committed to neither contract nor
guarantee nonconcessional external debt, except from international and regional development
institutions, from which it will only borrow at the most concessional terms these institutions provide.
The government will also seek to speed up the promised support from donors. The focus will be on
mobilizing budgetary grants in order to minimize the impact on the debt burden.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

Box 2. Yemen: Reform of Fuel Subsidies
The government intends to raise domestic prices of several petroleum products in October
2014. Prices will increase by 50 Yemeni rials per liter for gasoline, kerosene, and diesel; and by
800 Yemeni rials per gas cylinder. This represents an average price increase of about 50 percent,
which will halve the current gap with international prices. Although well-off households
disproportionately benefit from fuel subsidies, the impact of their reduction cannot be ignored.
According to past FAD TA, increasing fuel prices to full pass-through levels will lead to a reduction
of about 10 percent in real household income for households in the bottom 40 percent of the
income distribution. In addition, decision was made, and implemented, in June to allow the private
sector to import part of its diesel requirements at international prices. The decision is expected to
cover about 20 percent of total diesel consumption.
To mitigate the impact of higher prices on the poor, the authorities will increase allocations
for the Social Welfare Fund (SWF) by 50 percent. Currently, the SWF provides cash transfers to
more than 1.5 million households or roughly 40 percent of the total population. The government
intends to use part of the savings from the subsidy reform to increase monthly cash transfers from
about $18 to about $27 per household. At the same time, it will work in close collaboration with the
World Bank to improve the coverage of the SWF, phasing out transfers to noneligible beneficiaries
and include additional eligible beneficiaries. Savings from the reform will also be used to finance
growth-enhancing and poverty-reducing capital spending.
The expected savings from the reform amount to 3.5 percent of GDP over the program
period. In 2014, savings from fuel price increases will be limited to about 0.2 percent of GDP
because government payments for subsidies generally take place with a delay of one to two months.
Additional savings of $130 million in the remainder of 2014 will be generated from allowing private
sector to import diesel at international prices. In 2015, the full impact of the reform is expected to
reduce the subsidy bill by about 3.5 percent of GDP. Beyond 2015, additional savings would
continue to be reaped from improvements in efficiency and reduced smuggling.
With TA from the Fund, the government is also planning to introduce an asymmetric fuel
price adjustment mechanism to reflect movements in international fuel prices. This will help
depoliticize pricing of energy and increase the expected savings from the subsidy reform over the
medium term. In this context, the authorities will consider adopting a smoothing rule to avoid sharp
increases in domestic prices and unsettle inflationary expectations.

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
29.
Given the difficult fiscal and financing situation, the current monetary stance will be
continued for the remainder of 2014. With inflation currently at around 8 percent, the real interest
rate is rather high. It would, however, be prudent to postpone any reduction in the policy rate in
order to contain the inflationary pressure expected from the necessary adjustments in fuel prices.
Inflation is projected to increase to about 13 percent following the increase in fuel prices in October.

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

CBY will remain vigilant and will stand ready to adjust policies as needed to preserve
macroeconomic stability (MEFP, ¶31). As the inflationary impact of the fuel price increases fades, and
the macroeconomic policy mix improves with the decline in the fiscal deficit, there will be scope to
gradually reduce interest rates. The authorities are also determined to strengthen the central bank’s
independence and to refocus its primary role on maintaining low inflation.
30.
The CBY will aim to modernize its monetary policy framework and to strengthen the
channels of transmission of its monetary policy instruments. The current framework of direct
control of interest rates and reliance on the primary market of government paper would be
gradually phased out in favor of a more efficient indirect approach to monetary policy that will give
greater signaling role to the central bank policy interest rate and would help develop the interbank
market and also enable banks to improve liquidity management. The Sukuk market, which was
introduced in 2011, continues to develop, and provides Islamic banks with additional investment
opportunities to place their liquidity. Progress on this front has been limited, in part due to delayed
Fund TA because of the security concerns. The CBY requested a diagnostic mission and subsequent
technical assistance to enhance its liquidity management capacity and improve inflation forecasting.
31.
The Central Bank will refrain from lending to the government.4 At the same time, the
Ministry of Finance will sign a memorandum of understanding spelling out a schedule for bringing
the government’s outstanding debt to the CBY within legal limits (prior action; MEFP, ¶32, Table 2).
Furthermore, and in line with the recommendations of the safeguards assessment mission, the CBY
will finalize another agreement with the Ministry of Finance, specifying the repayment terms and
interest rates on credit extended by the CBY to public sector enterprises. Given the plans to use the
IMF disbursement for budgetary financing, CBY will formalize with the Ministry of Finance the
respective responsibilities for servicing obligations to the Fund (see ¶18 above). Furthermore, the
planned review of the central bank law will look at areas to further strengthen its independence.
32.
Greater exchange rate flexibility over the medium term would help preserve reserves
and support competitiveness. The CGER-type econometric analyses are not conclusive (Annex I).
While the macroeconomic balance approach points to a possible moderate overvaluation of the real
exchange rate, the external sustainability approach suggests a substantial undervaluation. These
results should, be interpreted with caution, because of data limitations and the structure of the
Yemeni economy—largely dominated by the hydrocarbon sector.5 Although the real exchange rate
appreciated somewhat in 2013, the performance of nonhydrocarbon exports and remittances
appears not to have been affected. However, Yemen’s relatively high domestic inflation and the
recent depreciation in the currencies of its key trading partners have negative implications for
4

The legal limit on government borrowing from the central bank is equivalent to 25 percent of the annual average of
the budget’s ordinary revenue for the three financial years immediately preceding for which accounts are available.

There is a need to improve data on private sector financial flows and stocks, in particular those relating to net
foreign assets of the economy as a whole and nonhydrocarbon FDI. Furthermore, reliable data on relative
productivity are not available.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

competitiveness. A gradual increase in exchange rate flexibility over the medium term is needed to
help protect reserves and support exports and economic growth over the medium term, and to ease
the pressure on monetary policy. A strengthened monetary policy framework as discussed in ¶30,
would be important to increase exchange rate flexibility. CBY’s intervention in the foreign exchange
market will aim at smoothing out exchange rate volatility, while allowing the exchange rate to
respond to market fundamentals (MEFP, ¶33). With reform implementation and increased external
financing under the ECF arrangement, gross reserves are projected to remain above three months of
imports over the medium term. The program sets a floor on net international reserves of the central
bank to ensure this outcome.

C. Financial Sector Reforms
33.
Bank supervision will be further strengthened to ensure the soundness of the system.
Consolidated supervision will be introduced and the legal powers of the CBY strengthened to enable
cross-border supervision. The CBY will also improve the enforcement of prudential regulations as
well as the recently issued banking corporate governance guidelines. Furthermore, CBY will develop,
in collaboration with METAC, prudential regulations that address the risks specific to Islamic
banking. In addition, the banking and central bank laws will be strengthened to address gaps in the
CBY’s power to resolve banks (MEFP, Table 2). To this end, the CBY requested TA from the IMF Legal
Department in drafting the necessary changes to the banking law, and will aim to complete the
drafting of the amendments and submit them to parliament in 2015. Further reforms will aim at
strengthening the Prompt Corrective Action, which specifies rule-based penalties against banks that
exhibit progressively deteriorating capital ratios, in collaboration with METAC.
34.
The program aims at improving access to financial services in order to support
inclusive growth. Reforms in this area include strengthening the public credit registry and
payments system. In 2009 the CBY issued a law on microfinance banks and licenses have been
issued to two deposit-taking institutions to provide microfinance; a third, preliminary license has
been issued. The authorities will build on this progress by promoting mobile and branchless
banking, and will issue the required regulation in collaboration with CGAP and USAID. Furthermore,
the insolvency regime and functioning of commercial courts will be improved to enhance the
banking system’s capacity to enforce foreclosure on collateral.
35.
The authorities have made significant improvements to the AML/CFT legal framework.
They brought into force amendments to the AML/CFT Law aimed at more comprehensive
criminalization of money laundering and terrorist financing, and issued regulations on the freezing
of terrorist assets, with a view to addressing the strategic deficiencies that were identified by FATF.
Going forward additional resources should be allocated to bolster the effective implementation of
the regime.

D. Structural Reforms and Other Issues
36.
The structural reform agenda aims to improve the business environment and promote
inclusive growth. In addition to the macro-critical structural reforms in the fiscal and financial
sector areas, the program focuses on other structural reforms that are also macro-critical from the
growth and job-creation perspective. In particular, Yemen’s rank in the World Bank’s report for
doing business environment further deteriorated to 133 in 2013, from 129 a year earlier. The
authorities will implement reforms to address the deficiencies identified in the underlying survey;
these reforms include streamlining the procedures for starting new businesses, simplifying tax and
customs processes, and strengthening property rights and contract enforcement. Structural
benchmarks include specific measures to simplify the operations of customs and tax assessment and
dispute processes (MEFP, Table 2) in order to address one of the lowest rated categories in the
doing business survey. A Public-Private-Partnership law has been drafted and will be reviewed by
the IFC to ensure that is in line with its earlier TA recommendations. The above structural reforms, as
well as the reorientation of public expenditure to social transfers and infrastructure expenditure, will
be instrumental in creating jobs and reducing poverty.
37.
The Parliament recently ratified Yemen’s accession to the WTO. In addition, Yemen has
become fully compliant with the EITI requirements; its suspended membership has been restored.
Yemen has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2,3, and 4, and maintains an exchange
system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions. The exchange rate regime is classified as a “stabilized arrangement.”
38.
Yemen participates in the GDDS and data are broadly adequate for surveillance.
However, there is a need to improve statistics in the areas of national accounts and CPI, BOP and IIP,
and financial soundness indicators.
39.
The authorities have recently strengthened their outreach effort. The need for and
benefits from the nationally-owned reforms have been highlighted by the President in high-profile
statements and speeches. An interagency outreach coordination committee has been formed, and is
being facilitated by the Executive Bureau. A societal dialogue has been launched, with seminars and
public communication focusing on the necessity and benefits of subsidy reforms.

PROGRAM MODALITIES AND CAPACITY TO REPAY THE
FUND
40.
The proposed ECF-supported program will cover the three-year period 2014–17. It will
be monitored through performance criteria, indicative targets, structural benchmarks, and semiannual reviews. The first two six-monthly reviews will be conducted based on the proposed
quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets through end-June 2015 (MEFP, Table 1), and
structural benchmarks in the fiscal, monetary, and financial sector policy areas (MEFP, Table 2). The
review test dates for these two reviews will be end-December 2014 and end-June 2015. The
definitions of the quantitative performance criteria and related adjusters will be described in detail in
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

the Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) attached to the MEFP. The authorities will
produce a poverty reduction strategy paper by the second review, building on the current
Transitional Program for Stability and Development document.
41.
Yemen’s capacity to repay the Fund is adequate. Proposed access is 150 percent of quota
(SDR 365.3 million), reflecting the balance of payments need and the strength of the reform
program. There will be seven disbursements under the ECF arrangement designed to be
commensurate with the reform efforts (Table 11). As of end-December 2013, the Fund’s exposure to
Yemen stood at SDR 95.7 million, equivalent to 3 percent of gross official reserves and 1.6 percent of
exports of goods and services. The first repayment is not due until 2016 and is moderate at
SDR 7 million; the peak of SDR 73 million in 2023 does not represent a significant burden. Given this
initial low exposure and the macroeconomic projections under the program, capacity to repay the
Fund will remain adequate, with repayments remaining below 6 percent of exports of goods and
services (Table 12). The DSA also indicates that Yemen remains at moderate risk of distress,
notwithstanding downside risks related particularly to security and, thus, oil output projections.
42.
A safeguard assessment was completed in 2013. A new full safeguard assessment will be
completed by the first review under a new ECF arrangement. Risks to the program are mitigated by
the strong prior actions, the phased disbursement schedule commensurate with reform
implementation, and the authorities’ contingency plan to address downside risks should these
materialize.

STAFF APPRAISAL
43.
Yemen has made tangible progress in advancing the political transition, but the
fledgling economic recovery remains vulnerable. The National Dialogue was concluded in early
2014, and an agreement was reached to establish a six-region federal state. A new constitution is
being drafted, with a view to clarifying the degree of autonomy of the regions. The authorities have
been successful in preserving macroeconomic stability; however, real GDP growth remained well
below the level required to make a dent in the very high poverty and unemployment levels.
Sabotage of oil pipelines has intensified since early 2014, weakening the fiscal and external
positions, and leading to severe fuel and electricity shortages.
44.
In view of these challenges, the authorities’ decision to embark on a strong reform
program is welcome. The program aims at reducing the large fiscal deficit and reorienting public
expenditure to pro-growth, pro-poor outlays. It also aims at strengthening public financial
management, enhancing governance and the business environment, and improving bank soundness
and financial intermediation, to support inclusive growth and job-creation.
45.
Staff supports the authorities’ request for an ECF. The ECF arrangement will give an
impetus to the implementation of the strong reform package, and has helped catalyze donor
support to close the financing gap. The above-norm access of 150 percent of quota is proposed in
consideration of the large financing needs and the strength of reforms to be introduced in the

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

context of the difficult economic and political situation and high level of poverty. Staff urges the
authorities to implement the agreed reforms according to the time plan, as any delay could
destabilize the macroeconomic environment and undermine the program’s short- and long-term
objectives. ECF disbursements will go directly to finance the government budget and, together with
donor support, will close the financing gap.
46.
The ECF-supported program entails strong fiscal adjustment and effective measures
to protect the poor. This is to be achieved through reforms to reduce untargeted subsidies, contain
the wage bill, and enhance tax revenue mobilization. Staff therefore welcomes the recent decision to
allow the private sector to import part of its diesel requirements at international prices. In addition
to this measure, fuel prices will be increased in October 2014 by about 50 percent on average, thus
eliminating half of the subsidy. Ghost workers and double-dippers will be removed from the payroll
by steadily generalizing the use of biometric identification cards and making wage payments though
bank accounts and post offices. It is also important to introduce measures to fight smuggling, and
to gradually bring the compliance rate for tax filing and payment towards more reasonable levels,
building on the recent promising progress achieved in this area. At the same time, targeted transfers
to the poor will be increased by 50 percent concurrently with the adjustment in fuel prices.
Infrastructure investment will be gradually increased from its current low level, in order to boost job
creation and potential growth. The government will also improve public finance management,
including completing the deployment of the Accounting-based Financial Management Information
System (AFMIS) and implementing a strategy to transfer the treasury function from the CBY to the
Ministry of Finance.
47.
Monetary policy will remain prudent to limit the expected increase in inflation
resulting from the necessary fuel price adjustments. Over the medium term, reform
implementation will help reduce fiscal dominance and modernize the monetary policy framework
with the view to enhancing the transmission mechanism and strengthening the role of the central
bank in preserving low inflation and macroeconomic stability.
48.
While the export performance and remittances appear not to have been affected so
far, greater exchange rate flexibility in the medium term would help enhance
competitiveness. The exchange rate assessment is inconclusive, partly due to data limitations.
Gradually moving to a more flexible exchange rate, however, would help preserve foreign exchange
reserves, and reduce the burden on monetary policy. In this connection, staff encourages the central
bank to limit its intervention in the foreign exchange market to reducing exchange rate volatility.
49.
Reforms of the financial sector aim at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory
framework and enhancing financial sector infrastructure. Primary reforms aim at strengthening
consolidated and cross-border supervision. Further regulatory reforms include developing
regulation to address risks specific to Islamic banking, and to strengthening the CBY’s powers to
resolve banks AML/CFT supervision. There is also a need to strengthen the public credit registry,
improve the working of commercial courts, and encourage the development of branchless and
mobile banking.

50.
Improving governance and public service delivery is another important pillar of the
government agenda to encourage inclusive, private sector-led growth. Reforms in this area
focus on improving the business environment and enhancing transparency and accountability.
Additional reforms are aimed at enhancing the government’s implementation capacity, to help
better mobilize donor support and improve public infrastructure investment.
51.
Staff underscores the importance of proper design and strengthening of institutional
capacity to ensure a smooth transition to fiscal decentralization. The ongoing drafting of the
constitution is expected to lay out the basis for the new federal system, and potentially have
significant implications for the conduct of government financial operations and fiscal policy going
forward. In this regard, staff highlighted the need to ensure adequate control of expenditure and
debt contracting, and a clear devolution of responsibilities commensurate with the prospective
transfer of resources. Furthermore, there will be need for gradualism during the implementation
phase to allow sufficient time for capacity building, so as to safeguard fiscal discipline and adequate
service delivery during the transition.
52.
The support of the international community will continue to be essential in the period
ahead. Yemen is launching a strong reform program under very difficult conditions. Domestic
financing is limited and the increase in and/or shift of part of donor support to finance the budget
and close the fiscal/BOP gaps is essential to help the program go forward and enable the financing
of much-needed investment and social expenditure.
53.
If the Executive Board approves the proposed ECF arrangement, the next Article IV
consultation with Yemen would be expected to take place under the 24-month cycle, in
accordance with the Executive Board Decision on Article IV consultation cycle as applied to
countries with a Fund Arrangement.

Nature/source of main threats

1/

Overall Level of Concern
Likelihood of realization in
the next three years

Expected impact on Yemen if
risk is realized

Global Risks
Sustained decline in
commodity prices,
particularly oil

Medium: Decline in oil prices
may be triggered by
deceleration of global demand
and coming on stream of excess
capacity in the medium term

High: Yemen’s economy is
highly dependent on oil for
export and budget revenues.
Thus, growth would decelerate
noticeably, mainly due to
reduced oil exports and a fall in
oil-related capital flows. The Rial
could come under sustained
downward pressure.

Protracted period of slower
growth in emerging markets,
especially China

High: Emerging markets have
been showing signs of slowing
down.

High: China is a key trading
partner and accounts for about
27 percent of exports. Yemen’s
growth would be affected
through trade (lower external
demand) channels

A reduction in domestic
demand in Saudi Arabia

Low: The Saudi economy is
currently performing well and
substantial financial resources
provide the fiscal space to
respond to shocks

High: Saudi Arabia is the largest
market for non-oil exports and
the largest host of Yemenis
working abroad. A reduction in
demand would substantially
affect Yemen’s current account
and unemployment.

Country Specific Risks
Political instability and/or a
deterioration in security

Medium

High: The political transition is
fragile as tensions persist and
high unemployment, especially
among the youth, persists. If the
risks materialize, it would
disrupt economic activity and
test the political resolve to
implement reforms.

Decline in oil production

Medium

High: Oil production has been
affected by sabotage activities
and inadequate investments.
Oil production will remain
dependent on the evolution of
these two factors.

(concluded)

Shortfall in donor support

Medium

High: Shortfalls in
disbursement of pledged
donor funds would further
reduce capital expenditures
and increase domestic
financing needs.

Political election cycle could
lead to fiscal overruns.

Medium: Presidential and
parliamentary elections are
scheduled to take place
in 2015 as soon as a new
constitution is ratified; thus
the potential for electionrelated expenditure pressures
is high. Added to this are the
wage negotiations for the
South.
Medium: Yemen has decided
to move to a federal structure
of government

High: A further deterioration
in the fiscal deficit could erode
the government’s capacity to
service its debt, given the
excessive exposure of the
banking system to
government debt.

Federalism could increase
expenditure and debt

High: Fiscal federalism will
need to be carefully designed
and backed by adequate
institution and capacity
building, in order to support
fiscal discipline and ensure
prudent contracting of debt,
sharing fiscal information
among levels of government,
quality of information to be
shared and macrofiscal
analysis, and enhancing
expenditure policy
coordination.

1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to
materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks
surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between
10 percent and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks
and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and
materialize jointly.

2/ The negative direct investment numbers reflect cost recovery by foreign gas and oil companies. In 2012, this also reflectsthe expiration of the foreign concession of Masila oil block and the transfer of its ownership
to government.
3/ Figures from 2014 do not reflect the identified budget support contingent on a Fund-supported program.
4/ includes a US$ 1 billion Saudi deposit in CBY in 2012.

The results of regression analyses indicate that Yemen’s projected CA deficit is larger

than its norm in the medium term. A CGER-type macroeconomic balance (MB) approach suggests
a medium-term CA norm of -0.7 percent,
compared to the underlying current account
projection of -1.6 percent in 2018 that reflects
the projected declining hydrocarbon exports

3.

At the same time, the external stability (ES) approach points to a stronger trade

balance than the level that would stabilize the ratio of net foreign assets (NFA) to GDP.
Assuming a potential growth rate of about 4 percent, a trade surplus (including services and current
transfers) of 0.3 percent of GDP would be needed to maintain the projected level of the NFA-to-GDP
ratio in 2018. Given the high level of current transfer inflows, the underlying trade balance is
stronger than the trade balance norm by 3.4 percent.

5.

CGER-type analyses are inconclusive. According to the CA elasticity used in the CGER

methodologies,3 the MB approach points to an overvaluation of 6 percent. The ERER approach
suggests a larger overvaluation (62 percent), while under the ES approach the real exchange rate is
assessed as undervalued by 25 percent compared to the level that would stabilize the external
position, excluding the income account. However, caution is warranted in interpreting the results of
these two approaches because of data limitations, particularly on Yemen’s international investment
position.

Annex II. Principles of Fiscal Federalism: The Yemen Case1
INTRODUCTION
1.

Following the 2011 crisis, Yemen initiated a National Dialogue (ND) process to reshape

the institutional set-up of the country and redefine power sharing. The ND concluded in early
2014 with the decision to transform the country into a six-region federal state, and grant each
region more autonomy and influence on the distribution of resources. In February 2014, two
commissions were established and given one year to draft a new constitution and design the new
federal system.
2.

Drawing on FAD cross-country experiences, this note examines the fiscal implications

of a federal reform in Yemen and provides general guiding principles on its design. The main
challenges faced by the Yemeni authorities in implementing fiscal decentralization are twofold: to
preserve fiscal discipline and safeguard long-term fiscal sustainability in the context of greater
autonomy at the regional level. The note recognizes that there is no “one size-fits-all” model. Hence,
policy advice needs to be tailored to each country’s specific circumstances, taking into account
macroeconomic constraints, potential trade-offs between efficiency and equity, as well as relevant
institutional factors. The Fund has provided advice to numerous member countries in this area and
stands ready to support the reform efforts of the Yemeni authorities, including by providing
comprehensive technical assistance.
3.

The note has the following structure. Section II provides a quick overview of the key fiscal

characteristics of the government’s budget as well as reform challenges facing Yemen. Section III
reviews briefly the basic agreements regarding the redistribution of resources and responsibilities to
the regions as they agreed within the ND. Section IV discusses various aspects of fiscal
decentralization based on other countries’ experiences and best practices. Finally, section V offers a
summary of main recommendations along with next steps.

BACKGROUND ON YEMEN FISCAL FRAMEWORK
4.

Yemen faces important fiscal challenges. On one hand, there is the pressing need to

secure long-term fiscal and external sustainability in the face of declining hydrocarbon revenues. On
the other hand, the country urgently needs to increase public investment and social spending with
the view to promoting sustainable growth and reducing poverty over the long term. Meeting these
challenges will require steadfast progress in improving nonhydrocarbon revenue mobilization and
restructuring public expenditure, so as to create fiscal space for growth-enhancing and povertyreducing spending.
5.

Yemen’s revenues are dominated by hydrocarbon-related resources. In 2013,

hydrocarbon revenues accounted for about half of total government receipts (12.8 percent of GDP),
while tax revenues did not exceed 30 percent of total receipts (7.1 percent of GDP). Yemen’s tax-toGDP ratio appears low also by international comparison. This seems to reflect a range of factors,
including: (i) a very low general sales tax (GST) rate of 5 percent, the lowest among peers; (ii) a high
threshold for paying GST tax; (iii) serious capacity constraints in tax and customs administration;
(iv) low tax compliance; and (v) limited collaboration between the tax authorities and the business
community. Compared to peers, Yemen’s structure of tax revenues seems to be heavily focused on
the income tax (representing almost half of total taxes); whereas taxes on goods and services
account for less than 3 percent of GDP, as opposed to an average of 5 percent of GDP in lowincome countries.
6.

Recurrent spending represents the bulk of public expenditure in Yemen. In 2013,

current expenditures represented about 90 percent of total spending, with wages and subsidies
accounting for about two-thirds of current spending. In the same year, fuel subsidies were
22 percent of total expenditures and about 6.7 percent of GDP. These levels are fairly high when
compared to peers in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. International comparisons
are also not favorable to Yemen in terms of capital expenditure. In 2013, Yemen’s public investment
declined to 2.4 percent of GDP, a level significantly lower than the average of 9 percent of GDP for
the MENA region.
7.

Against this background, the recent decision to move to fiscal decentralization is likely

to add to the existing challenges and entail significant fiscal risks. Therefore, it is critical that the
authorities think carefully through the steps and design of this reform. In addition, developing
adequate institutions and building capacity will be instrumental to maintaining fiscal discipline in the
context of an overhaul of the roles/ responsibilities of various government levels.

THE ISSUES OF DECENTRALIZATION IN THE NATIONAL DIALOGUE
8.

The National Dialogue (ND) reached agreement to establish a federal state and draft a

new constitution. Last February 2014, a special committee headed by the President announced the
decision to move to a six-region federal structure for Yemen (Azal, Tihama, Saba, Aljanad,
Hadraomout, and Aden), in which each government tier (i.e., central and subnational governments)
will have both executive and legislative bodies. On March 8, 2014, President Hadi announced a
17-member committee and gave it one year to draft Yemen’s new constitution, which, among other
things, will determine the relations governing the interactions between the central and subnational
governments.2 This committee will work also on drafting the new federal system of six regions.
9.

The ND agreement does not go into the intricacies of the fiscal arrangements among

the central government and the regional authorities. In addition to the management of oil and
gas resources, these include the issues of assignments, collection, and management of taxes,
customs revenues, and other nontax resources; as well as the assignment of spending
responsibilities, including in areas such as health, education, and infrastructure.
10.

However, the ND establishes that natural resources belong to the people of Yemen.

The distribution of these resources will be decided in accordance to a formula and fair standards,
which take into account the needs of the producing state as well as of the central government. The
agreement envisages the establishment of an independent national authority in charge of
developing policy for the extractive industry. The sharing of powers and responsibilities in managing
oil and gas resources among various governments is expected to be defined in the constitution.

The design of intergovernmental fiscal arrangements is one of the more complex areas

of public finance. It entails a number of policy and institution-building issues that require careful
coordination and sequencing, and it is strongly influenced by historical, socio-political, and
economic factors. As a result, there is no “one size-fits-all” model: due considerations must be given
to each country’s specific circumstances, macroeconomic and institutional constraints; as well as the
need to strike a balance between efficiency and distributional considerations.

12.

A fiscal decentralization reform should be guided by a number of general principles.

Based on the experience of FAD involvement in member countries at different stages of economic
development, the following guiding principles are identified:


The sequencing of decentralization should ensure that resources are made available to

subnational governments consistent with the assignment of spending responsibilities.


The pace of decentralization should be closely linked to the capacity of subnational

governments to fulfill their assigned spending responsibilities.


Accountability and fiscal responsibility at the subnational level are reinforced by control over

part of own-revenue resources. However, the assignment of own resources must take into account
economic considerations (e.g., mobility of tax base) and institutional capacity constraints, particularly
of subnational tax administrations.


Intergovernmental transfers can offset possible vertical imbalances (i.e., across government

levels) and moderate horizontal disparities (within government levels). These transfers should be
designed to minimize the subnational government’s fiscal vulnerability to cyclical fluctuations.


Borrowing controls at the subnational level need to be designed carefully so as to ensure

fiscal discipline. This may entail reliance on both market discipline and flexible fiscal rules, provided
that timely and reliable information on subnational finances is available.
13.

The effectiveness of fiscal decentralization may be undermined by two factors. First,

failure by local policymakers to internalize the cost of local spending often results in overspending
and deficit bias (i.e., the common pool problem). Second, the expectation of local politicians to be
bailed out by the central government reduces incentives to exert fiscal responsibility
(i.e., soft budget constraint).

A. Macrofiscal Implications of Decentralization
14.

The macrofiscal implications of decentralization vary with the design of

intergovernmental fiscal relations and with the degree of decentralization. Although fiscal
stabilization is the responsibility of the central government, decentralization can affect in different
ways the conduct of fiscal stabilization and medium-term fiscal sustainability, depending on
subnational governments’ ability to carry out increased responsibilities. For example, when local
governments manage a significant share of revenues and/or spending, the central government may
not have enough resources for fiscal stabilization or redistribution. Similarly, central government

48

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

efforts to inject stimulus into the economy may be partly offset by subnational procyclical fiscal
retrenchment during a downturn (as happened during the Great Depression). In certain conditions,
more decentralized spending and taxation decisions may limit the central government’s capacity to
offset slippages at the subnational level. In this regard, nationally binding rules and/or effective
intergovernmental cooperation mechanisms may be needed to promote both short-term fiscal
stabilization and medium-term fiscal sustainability. Finally, the impact of subnational fiscal
operations on fiscal procyclicality and discipline depends on how these operations are financed.
15.

Maintaining fiscal discipline is a key challenge for countries that consider fiscal

decentralization. In designing a reform, therefore, policymakers should give due consideration to
the following questions:


What should be the appropriate mix of expenditure and tax policies that supports fiscal

discipline and a hard budget constraint?


How should the intergovernmental transfer system be designed to ensure appropriate

funding of subnational operations, without undermining the incentives to pursue sound policies?


What type of institutional mechanisms can ensure accountability for good results?

B. Fund’s Advice on Design and Management of Decentralization
16.

A necessary condition for fiscal discipline is a broad matching of spending

responsibilities with the overall resources at each level of government. This requires that the
devolution of resources at the local level be defined in line with expected subnational expenditure
needs. Once spending responsibilities are defined, it is possible to determine the appropriate mix of
taxes and transfers for different government tiers. However, revenue assignments and transfers must
be adequately clarified to impose effective fiscal discipline at the local level.
17.

Delays in the devolution of spending responsibilities relative to resources may lead to

a deterioration of subnational fiscal positions overtime. In the initial stages, subnational
governments’ spending may be constrained by their (weak) capacity. However, over time, the
availability of resources will eventually lead to a rise in subnational spending with ensuing
consequences for local fiscal balances. The emergence of deficits at the center may thus not be
compensated by surpluses at the subnational level, leading to a deterioration of general
government’s budget and debt positions over time. On the other hand, stress at the central
government level could trigger devolution of spending responsibilities to local governments without

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

49

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

a corresponding transfer of resources, with the result that subnational governments’ borrowing is
placed on an unsustainable path.
18.

In light of these challenges, designing fiscal decentralization reforms requires a

consistent and well-coordinated package of measures. Typically, countries tend to change some
specific aspects of their system of intergovernmental fiscal relations (e.g., introducing new revenuesharing schemes or changing the transfer system). These changes, however, may eventually create
imbalances across government levels and undermine the effectiveness of fiscal policy, if they are not
designed as part of a comprehensive framework. Such a framework should: (i) define spending
responsibilities; (ii) ensure sound public financial management; (iii) define intergovernmental
revenue arrangements; and (iv) identify mechanisms to control borrowing.
19.

The definition of spending responsibilities entails theoretical and practical

considerations. In theory, the assignment of spending responsibilities should be driven by
efficiency considerations (e.g., each public service should be provided by the jurisdiction that is
capable of internalizing the benefits and costs of such provision). In practice, however, spending
assignments also reflect political considerations. This often leads to an overlap of spending
functions undertaken by different government levels; typical examples are health care, education,
and social welfare, environment, infrastructure, and water and sanitation. In light of these overlaps, it
is essential to define clearly which government level is responsible for what kind of expenditure, so
as to ensure the appropriate balance between spending mandates and resources to fund them.
20.

A clear and transparent PFM framework facilitates consistent decision-making at all

governmental levels and ensures accountability for effective use of public resources. Sound
PFM arrangements need to be supplemented by institutional mechanisms governing the
responsibilities and financing of different levels of government, which will generate the incentives to
manage resources in an efficient manner. In countries where subnational PFM systems do not meet
minimum adequacy standards, strengthening PFM arrangements should be a prerequisite for
increasing decentralization. The critical elements of adequate PFM systems and good governance at
the subnational level include: (i) a realistic budget envelope prepared in a timely manner;
(ii) an appropriate budget classification system; (iii) effective audit and control mechanisms; and
(iv) requirements for timely and accurate reporting.
21.

The definition of intergovernmental revenue arrangements is guided by a number of

considerations. In theory, funds should follow functions so that the spending responsibilities of
local governments would be adequately financed through a combination of own-source revenue,
shared taxes, transfers, and borrowing. However, defining the right financing mix requires a delicate

50

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

balancing act. Although allowing access to own revenue at the margin through local taxation is
essential to promote fiscal discipline and accountability, excessive tax autonomy may create
inefficiencies and undermine the stabilization role of the central government. Normative theories of
fiscal federalism identify a number of principles for “optimal” tax assignments:


Taxes with large and elastic bases—such as income taxes—should be assigned to the central

government for macroeconomic stabilization and income redistribution.


Benefit taxation should be used by various government tiers: local services or services with

local benefit zones should be financed with local taxes, while services with significant externalities
should be financed with region wide taxes or transfers.


Local tax bases should be relatively immobile to prevent revenue losses due to tax

competition; bases should also be evenly distributed across jurisdictions to avoid horizontal fiscal
imbalances.


The definition of revenue assignments should take into account existing administrative and

capacity constraints.
22.

Options for intergovernmental revenue arrangements provide different degrees of

subnational revenue autonomy. There are three types of arrangements:


Own revenue assignments, which allow some degree of discretion to subnational

governments.


Revenue-sharing arrangements that allocate to local governments’ shares of taxes whose

bases and rates are defined (and typically administered) by the central government.


Intergovernmental grants that transfer budgetary resources to subnational governments.

23.

Natural resource revenues are better managed by the central government in light of

their volatility and geographical concentration. Revenue-sharing arrangements on an origin basis
can create significant horizontal disparities, and put additional burdens on local governments that
are typically not well equipped to deal with the inherent volatility of resource revenues. High
volatility in natural resource revenues can be a major cause of fiscal pro-cyclicality. The central
government is better placed to carry out macroeconomic stabilization policies, while subnational
authorities should focus on addressing local infrastructure needs and providing key social services.
24.

Controls on subnational borrowing buttress fiscal discipline by preventing excessive

borrowing. This could produce adverse externalities on the central government, including putting
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

51

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

upward pressure on interest rates and risk premia on government bonds, or through the cost of
bailouts. Borrowing controls can be grouped into four broad, not mutually exclusive, categories:
(i) reliance on market discipline, which requires a number of preconditions seldom met in practice;
(ii) cooperation between central and subnational governments in the setting of borrowing limits;
(iii) rules-based controls; and (iv) administrative or direct controls on borrowing. In the early stages
of decentralization, it is probably best to limit the subnational governments’ capacity to borrow
(both in the domestic as well as the international financial market) until a national debt management
strategy is in place.

LESSONS LEARNED AND CHALLENGES
25.

An effective fiscal decentralization should strike the right balance among several

considerations. These include: (i) existing macroeconomic constraints; (ii) potential tradeoffs
between efficiency and equity; (iii) institutional factors (e.g., constitutional and other legal
constraints), and (iv) the capacity of local governments to entrench fiscal discipline, spend well, and
raise own revenues.
26.

The experiences of countries at various levels of development suggest the following

general lessons:


Decentralization should be carefully sequenced. The objective is to ensure that resources
are made available to subnational governments in parallel with the assignment of their
spending responsibilities.



The pace of decentralization should be closely linked to capacity. This is instrumental for
subnational governments to carry out effectively the functions assigned to them.



The responsibilities in provision of services should be clearly attributed. This is
particularly important to avoid duplication, waste, and loss of accountability when spending
responsibilities overlap across levels of government.



Complementary reforms at the central government are often needed. These would
include an overhaul of the civil service, as well as other institutional and regulatory
frameworks.



Sound PFM systems are essential at all government levels. They ensure transparency of
the budget process in all its phases.



Devolution of resources should be commensurate with spending responsibilities.
Subnational governments must be provided with a resource envelope that ex ante would
allow them to carry out appropriately their assigned spending responsibilities.

52

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN



Responsibility over natural resource revenues should generally remain with the central
government. However, control over a portion of subnational resources is key to promoting
local governments’ fiscal responsibility and accountability.



Intergovernmental transfers play a significant role. They are needed to offset the
resulting vertical imbalances and to moderate horizontal ones.



Limits to subnational borrowing help ensure adequate fiscal discipline. In addition,
availability of relevant information is crucial to enforcing any form of control, including those
on floating debt and contingent liabilities (especially guarantees and PPPs).

Box 2. The New Federal Structure of Yemen 1/
In line with the NDC recommendations, a committee headed by the President agreed on the
structure of the country compromising six regions. The new structure will be imbedded in the
constitution which will need to be endorsed in a referendum. The following are the agreed regions:


Azal, which comprises the central and northern highland governorates of Sadah, Amran,
Thamar, and the Sana’a governorate. Historically these governorates have played a
prominent role in the political scene of Yemen for centuries.



Tihama, which includes the northwestern governorates of Rayma, Mahweet, and the Red
Sea coastal governorates of Hajaa and Hodida. Tehama is mostly dependent on fisheries and
agricultural, and is much less tribal than Azal.



Saba, which comprises the northern governorates of Marib, Aljawf, and Albayda. The Saba
region is mostly desert with some farm land. Marib produces crude oil and is the location of
Yemen’s LNG gas upstream facilities.



Aljanad, which covers the central/southern governorates of Taiz and Ibb. This is the most
densely populated region in Yemen, and its land is highly fertile. Its inhabitants are more
educated, and it has a large presence in the civil service and commerce.



Hadramout, which includes the governorate of Shabwa, Hadramout, Almahra, and the
island governorate of Suqatra. Hadramout has all the oil wealth in the country outside of
Marib, and hosts the facilities that process the gas from Marib.



Aden, which comprise the southern governorates of Aden, Lahj, Aldhalea, and Abyan. This
region has little natural resources, and is more tribal than the western province of
Hadramout. It has played a prominent role in the political, civil, and military scene of South
Yemen.

Appendix I. Letter of Intent
July 1, 2014

Madame Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431

Dear Madame. Lagarde:
We would like to thank the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the continued cooperation and
policy advice over the past several years as the Government of Yemen has sought to maintain
macroeconomic stability in a challenging political and security environment, and would like to
request a three-year arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) for budgetary support
and to help close the BoP financing gap.
As you know, in 2011 Yemen experienced social unrest and political events that destabilized the
macroeconomic environment and led to an output decline of more than 12 percent, and worsened
already high unemployment and poverty levels. The stabilization efforts of the Government of
Yemen—supported by the IMF in the context of the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF), and by donors
including, in particular, Saudi Arabia—helped restore macroeconomic stability and promote a
gradual recovery. However, energy subsidies and public sector wages absorb most fiscal revenues,
leaving little scope for urgently needed growth-enhancing infrastructure investment and social
expenditures. The contribution of the non hydrocarbon sector to growth remains low, hampered by
a poor business environment and low private sector credit.
Macroeconomic stability has again come under threat in 2014. Sabotage activities reduced
hydrocarbon revenues and exports, financing the larger fiscal deficit is challenging, and foreign
exchange reserves are declining. In the absence of strong reforms and external budget support, the
hard-won macroeconomic stability gains could be threatened and the high levels of poverty and
unemployment could undermine the government’s efforts to complete our political transition and
achieve social stability.
The government is committed to preserving macroeconomic and financial stability and placing the
economy on a path of sustained and inclusive growth. Our program is predicated on
implementation of strong reforms, which include increasing nonhydrocarbon revenues, reorienting
expenditures from generalized energy subsidies to growth-enhancing capital expenditures; effective

58

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

protection of poor and vulnerable groups through well-targeted social protection schemes;
strengthened public financial management and civil service reform; an appropriate macroeconomic
policy mix of fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies to balance price stability and growth while
maintaining adequate foreign exchange reserves; banking sector reforms to ensure financial
stability; and structural reforms to improve the business environment, production and export
diversification, financial intermediation and access.
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) sets forth the policy
measures the government intends to implement to attain its objectives. In support of the policies in
the MEFP, the government requests that the Executive Board of the IMF approves a three-year
arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) with access in the amount equivalent to
SDR 365.25 million (150 percent of quota) and disburse the amount equivalent to SDR 48.75 million
(20 percent of quota) upon approval of the arrangement. Fund financing will help address the
balance of payment problem including for closing the large financing gap directly, and will also
provide a catalytic framework for the disbursement of donors’ pledges and the better utilization of
the disbursements.
The government of Yemen will provide data and information to the Fund on the progress in
implementing the agreed economic and financial policies. It believes that the policies set out in the
attached MEFP are adequate to achieve the objectives of the program, but will take any further
measures that may be appropriate for this purpose. The government will consult in advance with the
Fund should revisions be contemplated to the policies contained in the MEFP, in accordance with
the IMF’s policies on such consultations.
In line with our commitment to transparency, we consent to the publication of this Letter of Intent,
the attached MEFP, and the attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding, as well as the IMF
staff report relating to our request for the ECF arrangement, following approval of the IMF Executive
Board.
Sincerely yours,

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

Attachment I. Memorandum of Economic and Financial
Policies
1.

This memorandum reviews recent economic developments and summarizes the

government’s economic objectives and policy framework for 2014–17, for which we are seeking
financial support under a new three-year arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) with
the IMF. Donors pledged about US$8 billion over the 2012–15 period to support the government
program, and two thirds of these pledges remain to be disbursed.
2.

Previous Fund-supported programs helped achieve macroeconomic stability. Our track

record under the early stage of the 2010 ECF arrangement was strong. Following the political
events of 2011 led to the cancellation of the 2010 ECF arrangement and IMF support under the
Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) in April 2012, the government was able to meet all indicative targets
under the RCF and implemented additional fiscal measures, including selected fuel price increases.
These measures, together with financial support from Saudi Arabia and other donors, helped the
government stabilize the macroeconomic environment, and was able to build on that progress and
maintain macroeconomic stability during 2013.
3.

Notwithstanding this progress, enormous challenges remain. Poverty is widespread

and unemployment is very high, particularly among the youth. This contributes to undermining
political and security stability, further compounded by internal conflicts and the presence of AlQaeda Movement. Worsening ground water shortages also depress economic activity, particularly
agricultural output growth.
4.

Recent sabotage activities on energy facilities curtailed hydrocarbon production ,

leading to lower hydrocarbon fiscal revenues and exports. As a result, fiscal pressures have
increased, international reserves declined and financing needs have become very large. This has
added to the urgent need for policies to enhance security of energy facilities and stem the
deterioration in the fiscal and reserve positions. In addition, substantial fiscal and structural reforms
are needed to create space for efficient pro-growth and pro-poor expenditures as well as to create a
business environment conducive to private sector investment.
5.

The government would like to build on the progress it has been making in the context

of the Transitional Program for Stability and Development (TPSD) for 2012–2014. Its objectives
are to mitigate the negative macroeconomic impact of the sharp decline in hydrocarbon production;
ensure an appropriate mix of fiscal, monetary, exchange rate policies; and implement structural
policies to create the conditions for sustained high and inclusive growth over the medium-to-long

60

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

run. This will require substantial fiscal adjustment which will be achieved by reducing energy
subsidies, containing public sector wages, and increasing non hydrocarbon tax revenues as well as
external financing to close the financing gap in 2014. Sustained implementation of these reforms
will help create fiscal space for growth, enhancing infrastructure expenditures, and targeted social
transfers, as well as reduce dependence on oil revenues. Monetary policy will continue to aim to
balance price stability and medium term growth objectives. Exchange rate policies will aim at
minimizing volatility while preserving reserves and supporting competitiveness. Our structural
policies will be designed to create a business environment conducive to private sector investment,
support gradual output and export diversification, improve public financial management, and
enhance governance.
6.

Our policy framework will also be informed by the staff recommendations made in the

context of Article IV Consultations and Technical Assistance.

I. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
7.

Overall macroeconomic conditions: The macroeconomic situation has remained stable

through 2013, but the economic recovery is fragile. Real GDP growth is estimated to have improved
from 2.4 percent in 2012 to 4.8 percent in 2013, but was lower than potential due to continuing
sabotage of oil facilities. Non-oil GDP growth continued to grow by about 4 percent. Average
inflation edged up slightly to 11 percent in 2013, compared to 10 percent in 2012 while the nominal
exchange rate remained stable at around Yrl 214.9 per US dollar.
8.

Fiscal Developments: The overall fiscal position worsened moderately in 2013 where the

budget deficit amounted to 6.9 percent of GDP compared to 6.3 percent in 2012 according to the
IMF staff estimates ( 4.9 percent according to the Ministry of Finance classification), while the
nonhydrocarbon primary balance excluding grants improved by about 6 percent of GDP. Underlying
this outcome, hydrocarbon revenue declined in relation to GDP by about one percentage point, and
external grants declined by about 5 percent of GDP from their exceptionally high level in 2012. To
counter these adverse developments, the government reduced expenditures for subsidies and
wages, and improved nonhydrocarbon revenue. Transfers and capital spending were also reduced
by about 0.5 percent and 1.3 percent of GDP, respectively. The government faced significant
challenges in financing the deficit with only Treasury bill and Sukuk issuance, and had to convert
pension funds’ foreign currency deposits into government bonds as well as advance central bank
payment of the 2013 profit, which normally would have been paid in 2014.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

61

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

9.

External sector developments: Despite improvements in the trade balance and in

remittances, the external current account deficit widened to 2.7 percent in 2013, due to the large
decline in grants. The improvement in the trade balance mainly reflected a compression in fuel
imports from their 2012 spike, increases in both hydrocarbon and non hydrocarbon exports, and the
successful renegotiation of the price for a substantial part of our LNG exports. Workers’ remittances
also continued to grow. Financial flows were however at much lower levels than in 2012—when the
Central Bank of Yemen benefited from a $1 billion deposit from Saudi Arabia—because of
repatriation of part of initial direct investment by hydrocarbon foreign companies in 2013 (in line
with the cost recovery arrangements in our hydrocarbon agreements). As a result of the higher
current account deficit and lower financial flows, foreign exchange reserves declined by about
US$800 million. The pension funds’ sale of their foreign currency deposits to purchase treasury
bonds helped moderate the decline in reserves.
10.

Monetary and exchange rate developments: Money supply growth moderated to

12.5 percent compared to 21.5 percent in 2012, reflecting the decline in net foreign assets. Private
sector credit expanded by 39 percent, from a very low base and after two years of consequent
declines and net claim on central government continued to grow rapidly at about 28 percent. On
February 7, 2013, the CBY reduced the benchmark deposit interest rate from 18 percent to
15 percent. The nominal exchange rate remained stable.
11.

Financial sector performance: The banking system has remained stable, but important

vulnerabilities remain. Banks are profitable, liquid and capital adequacy ratios (CAR) are high, albeit
in large part reflecting the large zero-risk-weighted government securities on banks’ balance sheet.
However, nonperforming loans (NPLs) are high though covered and there is concentration of credit
loans through bank investments in government securities, and exposure to real estate markets
abroad. The banking sector is small and underdeveloped and contributes little to growth. The
financial markets and the payment system are also underdeveloped and constrain monetary policy
transmission and economic growth.
12.

The environment for doing business: The environment for doing business remains

difficult. The government shall seek to improve it, especially with regard to availability of funding for
the private sector, protection of investors, liquidation procedures, and provision of electricity and
other services. This would help to improve Yemen’s rank in the World Bank’s report for doing
business environment.
13.

Performance in the first quarter of 2014: Economic developments in the first quarter of

2014 were adversely impacted by sabotage attacks on the oil pipeline. The repeated attacks on oil

62

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

facilities caused a decline in Yemen's hydrocarbon production and exports, and also in the quantities
of crude oil allocated for domestic consumption, exerting new severe pressures on the fiscal and
external positions, and causing severe electricity and fuel shortages and a slowdown in economic
activity.

II. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
14.

The Outlook: The near term is likely to be very challenging but we expect to consolidate the

macroeconomic gains over the medium term under the proposed program which anchors
substantial reforms in the key fiscal areas of subsidies and the wage bill, assuming the security
situation improves to reduce disruptions to hydrocarbon production. Uncertainties in the political
and security situation cast a shadow over our reform efforts but we are resolved to implement the
reforms as any delays, particularly in the fiscal area and/or in donors support, would risk
destabilizing the economy in the short run and would jeopardize the medium-term growth
objectives. The prospective shift to fiscal federalism will also require a careful design and institution
and capacity building, to avoid fiscal and debt challenges and ensure that it delivers fairly on the
needs of the population.

III. THE ECONOMIC PROGRAM FOR 2014–17
15.

Program objectives: The program for which the government seeks support aims to

maintain macroeconomic stability, enhance fiscal and external sustainability, and promote sustained
and inclusive growth. The government strategy will be to: (i) reduce generalized fuel subsidies,
contain wages, increase non hydrocarbon revenues so as to create fiscal space to increase growth
enhancing infrastructure and social expenditures; (ii) ensure an appropriate mix of fiscal, monetary,
and exchange rate policies to balance price stability with growth objectives, preserve reserves,
improve export competitiveness and lay the basis for export diversification, and maintain debt
sustainability; and (iii) implement structural reforms to improve the business environment and boost
the recovery of the private sector investment; and (iv) strengthen public financial management to
improve governance, transparency and efficiency in public expenditures. The success of our strategy
will largely depend on the government’s ability to contain the fiscal deficit in 2014; the speed with
which donors disburse the pledges made in the Friends of Yemen meetings for project financing;
and the availability of external budget support.
16.

Macro targets for 2014: Real GDP growth is expected to reach modest rates of 1.9 percent,

reflecting the decline in the growth rates of hydrocarbon GDP by more than 8 percent in 2014. The

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

63

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

fiscal deficit is projected to be contained around 5.4 percent, the current account deficit around
1.3 percent while reserves could decline to close to about 3 months of imports. Inflation will likely
increase in the fourth quarter to reach 13 percent by end of year, reflecting the direct and indirect
impact of fuel price adjustments that are planned for October 2014.
17.

Medium term macroeconomic targets: Our goal is to attain and sustain real GDP growth

of at least 5 percent over the medium term. This reflects increased utilization of idle capacity, donor
supported investment, and the rekindling of private sector activity absorbing the growing labor
force. We expect nonhydrocarbon production to recover to pre-political events levels and to grow
steadily over the program period by 5 percent while oil production, which had declined because of
sabotage activities, is expected to achieve modest positive growth until 2017, as security improves
with progress in the political transition and the additional efforts the government is making to
secure the oil pipelines in collaboration with the UN and international partners. Although inflation
could edge up in the last quarter of 2014 to 13 percent because of the direct and indirect effects of
the domestic oil price adjustment, we expect the second round effects to abate in the subsequent
years and inflation to taper down to around 8 percent. The committed donor pledges if disbursed
together with a stable economy should help support the balance of payments and keep
international reserves at around 3 months of imports, provided the financing gap is filled. Given the
planned fiscal measures that include reduction in subsidies, the fiscal deficit is projected to stabilize
around 4 percent of GDP and public debt is expected to remain around 48 percent.

A. Fiscal Policies and Reforms
18.

Our objectives in the fiscal area are to enhance fiscal sustainability while supporting

growth and poverty reduction. The large size of subsidies and the wage bill constrains the fiscal
space to increase capital expenditures that can generate growth as well as our capacity to extend
targeted social transfers. The government will, therefore, focus our efforts at improving the structure
and quality of public expenditures by reducing the inefficient generalized subsidies that do not
adequately benefit the poor, and by addressing the problem of ghost workers and double dippers
so as to contain the wage bill. We will also intensify efforts to increase non hydro carbon revenues
by ensuring improved tax compliance and strengthening customs controls. The government will also
increase growth enhancing capital expenditures and social transfers.
19.

The immediate challenge is to address the difficult fiscal and external situation

triggered largely by sabotage of the oil pipeline. In the absence of corrective measures, the fiscal
deficit could widen from the 2014 budget projection of 6.8 percent to 9 percent of GDP. Under

64

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

current policies and given current level of grants, a financing gap of about 3.5 percent of GDP would
emerge.
20.

Available financing options are inadequate to fund this magnitude of the deficit, and

the government has therefore identified revenue and expenditure measures to reduce the
financing gap. The objective is to undertake a fiscal adjustment of about 3.6 percentage points of
GDP, which could reduce the deficit to close to 5.4 percent of GDP in 2014. On the revenue side,
exceptional efforts will be made to improve tax revenues by about 1 percent of GDP including by
recovering tax arrears, improving tax compliance and combating smuggling. The government will
simplify the tax dispute procedures, activate the joint tax and customs coordination committee,
improve payment compliance of registered large tax payers to 65 percent by end December 2014,
enhance tax controls and strengthen coordination between the tax and customs authorities, and
improve controls at customs stations. While our targets to increase tax revenue are ambitious, they
are in line with the improvement we have achieved in recent years. On the expenditures side,
corrective measures will produce savings for about 2 percent of GDP by allowing the private sector
to import diesel for a substantial part of its requirement and reducing subsidies on petroleum
products, effective as of October 1, 2014 (structural benchmark). The government will also keep
capital expenditure at its 2013 level (2.4 percent of GDP) and postpone the payment of one off wage
allowances, while keeping current on all other commitments on wages in line with the 2014 budget
approved by Parliament. We shall be monitoring both expenditure and revenue closely and will
revisit our planned expenditure should our tax revenue perform below its target.
21.

The government will also enforce strict spending rules to avoid budgetary

overspending and further deterioration of the financing gap. While budgetary resources are
constrained, the government faces increased above-budgeted spending pressure for several
reasons, mainly security and political reasons. In this regard, the Minister of Finance will instruct in
writing government spending agencies, including line ministries and all other agencies, to strictly
stay within their budget envelopes. When unavoidable, the authorization of spending over and
above budgetary allocations has to be accompanied by simultaneous instruction for compensatory
cuts on lower priority spending; the latter should be immediately communicated to the relevant
government entities to integrate into their annual spending plans.
22.

Over the medium term, the government will target reducing the fiscal deficit to about

4.3 percent by the end of the program. The nonhydrocarbon primary deficit, excluding grants, will
decline steadily from 15.2 percent of GDP at end 2013 to about 9.4 percent by 2017. Continued
consolidation would keep the debt to GDP ratio below 50 percent. The fiscal consolidation will be
achieved through both expenditure restructuring and revenue enhancing measures. This will include
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

65

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

further reducing the energy subsidies by adopting an adjustment pricing mechanism for petroleum
products (a benchmark), containing the wage bill by addressing the issue of ghost workers and
double dippers, and increasing non oil revenue mobilization through a reform of revenue
administration in line with previous Fund TA, and improving transparency and accountability. These
measures will free resources to increase capital expenditures and social transfers. Donor support will
also be critical and the government will increase our outreach to development partners.
23.

The government intends to reduce subsidies further and to increase capital

expenditures and targeted transfers to the poor. We have already allowed the private sector to
import a substantial part of its diesel usage at international prices either directly or through the
Aden refinery starting in June 2014 (prior action). Additional subsidy reform measures, specifically
price adjustment of fuel prices by an average of about 50 percent, will lead to a reduction in energy
subsidies by about 4 percent of GDP over the program period. The government will also introduce
an automatic fuel price adjustment mechanism to respond to increases in international prices in
order to preserve and increase the savings from the subsidy reform. The government is cognizant of
the potential adverse impact of these measures on the poor and therefore will concurrently increase
the allocations for the Social Welfare Fund (SWF) by 50 percent starting in the last quarter of 2014.
In collaboration with the World Bank, the government will continue to improve the coverage of the
SWF and phase out transfers to noneligible beneficiaries. Some of the savings will also be applied
towards capital expenditures that are designed to create employment.
24.

Spending on wages and salaries will be capped to contain the wage bill while

improving benefits for the civil service. The government is committed to seek savings through a
reduction in ghost workers and double dippers. Reforms in this area will include the full
implementation of the biometric identification system throughout the general civil service including
the military and police, as well as the implementation of a census for the civil service and the
military. We will also gradually move from cash payment of wages and salaries for civil servants to
payments using bank accounts. As first step, the Council of Ministers will adopt soon an action plan
to move progressively from cash payments for wages and salaries to payments using bank accounts
and postal offices within two years (prior action).
25.

The government is continuing its efforts to increase non oil revenues and reduce

dependence on hydrocarbon revenues. We intend to increase tax revenue by about 0.5 percent of
GDP annually, and to raise our tax-to-GDP ratio which currently remains low by regional as well as
international standards. Towards this objective, we will implement measures to stabilize the GST and
improve further on time filing and payment compliance of registered large tax payers to a target of
80 percent by December 2016 in line with FAD recommendations. The GST will be increased from
66

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

5 percent to 10 percent and unified at 90 percent for all tobacco produces while its coverage will be
expanded to include all imported used vehicles and spare parts. A Ministerial directive will also be
issued to establish a tax fraud investigation unit to strengthen ex post controls and improve tax
compliance, and will establish procedures for the implementation of a new customs valuation
system that meets the requirements of the WTO, with the assistance of reputable international
institutions. The tax litigation process will be simplified by eliminating the dispute committee and
limiting the appeal process to the court of first instance and the court of appeals. .
26.

The government will review existing tax and customs exemptions and reductions with

the view to limit them. It will produce an inventory of all existing tax exemptions and reduced tax
rates. It will also define a reference tax system and identify all exemptions towards a full assessment
of tax expenditures. It will not allow any new measures designed to expand the scope of tax and
customs exemptions, including any amendments to the effective laws.
27.

We will speed up reforms to strengthen capacity for project implementation and

donor aid coordination. To improve the quality of public sector investment and help catalyze
donors’ disbursements, we will undertake measures to strengthen project selection, procurement,
implementation and monitoring, in close coordination with the World Bank and other donors. We
have already established an Executive Bureau to coordinate projects locally and with donors, and
have strengthened its management. Furthermore, in coordination with the World Bank, we have set
up the Mutual Accountability Framework to monitor progress in donors’ assistance as well as follow
up on our commitments.
28.

We will maintain the momentum in implementing public finance management

reforms. These reforms will aim at strengthening the treasury function at the Ministry of Finance
and improving the process for planning and execution of government spending. We are currently
deploying the Accounting-based Financial Management Information System (AFMIS) to bring the
total to 55 units by the end of 2014. We will also adopt a strategy for transferring the treasury
functions from the CBY to the Ministry of Finance in line with recent IMF FAD TA recommendations.
These reforms and their time line are being coordinated with METAC experts that have been
providing TA.
29.

In addition, the government will adopt a gradual program to clear outstanding

payment arrears over the medium term. In this regard, we will monitor expenditure arrears on a
quarterly basis.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

67

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

30.

The risk of debt distress is currently assessed to be moderate and the government will

not contract or guarantee nonconcessional external debt, except from international and
regional development institutions, from which we will only borrow at the most concessional terms
these institutions provide. The government will also seek to speed up the promised support by
donors. Given the difficult political and social conditions of the country, the focus will be on
mobilizing budgetary grants to help mitigate the budgetary pressures without further worsening the
debt burden.

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
31.

Monetary policy will continue to aim at maintaining price stability and fostering

private sector credit to support economic growth. Despite the reduction in the benchmark
deposit rate in February 2013, interest rates remain high and constrain the expansion of credit to the
private sector which is necessary to ensure private sector led growth. In addition, large fiscal
financing needs have led to crowding out the private sector and exert upward pressures on interest
rates. The policy mix will need to be gradually rebalanced to allow for a reduction in the currently
high interest rates over the medium term. Reducing fiscal dominance will be a key objective of our
program in order to alleviate the constraints on monetary policy. We will also continue to remain
vigilant to both upside and downside risks and we stand ready to adjust policies using the full range
of our monetary policy instruments. We also remain committed to an independent central bank that
sets monetary policy with a view to maintaining low inflation.
32.

The Central Bank will refrain from new lending to the government. The political events

and economic crisis of 2011 led the CBY to extend credit to the government beyond the limits
specified in the Law. Going forward, we will avoid monetizing the fiscal deficit, and will develop a
program to normalize the government’s position. In this regard, the CBY will draw up a
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Ministry of Finance that stipulates our agreement
on the time schedule to bring down the government’s outstanding credit within legal limits. We will
also finalize an agreement between the CBY and the Ministry of Finance that stipulates repayment
terms and interest rates for credit extended by the CBY to Public Sector Enterprises. Given the plans
to use the IMF disbursement for budgetary financing, CBY will formalize with the Ministry of Finance
in an MOU the respective responsibilities for servicing obligations to the Fund and for maintenance
of a specific government account at the CBY to receive Fund resources.
33.

We will be reviewing our monetary policy framework and improve the design of our

monetary policy tools. We plan over the medium term to move from the current framework of
direct control of interest rates and reliance on the primary market of government paper to a more

68

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

efficient indirect approach that helps develop the interbank market and also enables banks to
improve liquidly management. The Sukuk market which was introduced in 2011 continues to
develop and provides Islamic banks with additional investment opportunities to place their liquidity.
We welcome further technical assistance to enhance liquidity management capacity and improve
inflation forecasting.
34.

Despite the moderate appreciation of the real exchange rate in 2013, competitiveness

remains adequate. Output and export diversification is critical for external sustainability and
inclusive growth and is a central objective of our development strategy. We will, therefore, continue
to maintain an exchange rate system that allows the rate to be market determined and our
interventions in the foreign exchange market will be limited to smoothing out volatility. Some
exchange rate flexibility will also be permitted over the medium term to help protect reserves and
support export and economic growth, and also ease the pressures on monetary policy. The fiscal
policies and reforms that we will be taking will support our efforts to maintain adequate foreign
exchange resources as an important buffer against external shocks.

C. Financial Sector Stability and Development
35.

Our financial system has remained stable, but there is need to improve its resilience to

shocks. Recent stress test results indicated liquidity and solvency risks stemming from credit risk,
loan concentrations, and concentration of bank investments in government securities. This will be
mitigated by enforcing prudential regulations and strengthening the regulatory and supervisory
framework, including by introducing consolidated supervision and enhancing the legal powers of
the CBY to enable it undertake cross border supervision. We will also develop prudential regulations
that address the risks specific to Islamic banking in collaboration with METAC. We issued the
banking corporate governance guidelines and we will be enforcing these regulations. We have
benefitted from METAC in undertaking earlier reforms and will continue our collaboration to
strengthen the regulatory and supervisory framework.
36.

Sustained financial stability also requires orderly resolution of banks when stresses

emerge and we will be strengthening our banking and central bank laws. The review of our
banking law revealed significant gaps, particularly with respect to powers to resolve banks. We will
collaborate with the IMF legal department in drafting the suggested changes to the law and will aim
to submit the amended law to parliament by June 2015. We will strengthen the Prompt Corrective
Action (PCA) in collaboration with METAC. We will also request a review of the Central Bank Law to
ensure adequate powers to effectively execute our mandate.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

69

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

37.

To enhance our effectiveness in regulating and supervising the financial system, we

will also reform the financial infrastructure. We are collaborating with the World Bank in
strengthening the public credit registry and payments system and have already issued tenders for
these projects. We are committed to strengthening the insolvency regime to enhance the banking
system’s capacity to enforce their rights to foreclose on collateral pledged by borrowers as security
for loans and we will make efforts to improve the functioning of our commercial courts.
38.

We will also undertake the reforms needed to improve access to financial services. Our

financial system is small and underdeveloped, and credit intermediation is among the lowest in the
world. In 2009, we issued a law on micro finance banks and since then we have given licenses to two
deposit taking institutions to provide micro finance while another bank has been given a preliminary
license. We will build on these efforts and promote mobile and branchless banking, and in this
regard we will issue the required regulation in collaboration with CGAP and USAID. These initiatives
together with the fiscal consolidation efforts to create space for private sector lending will
contribute to deepening the financial system, promote financial intermediation and increase the
financial system’s contribution to growth.
39.

We have made significant improvements to our AML/CFT legal framework. To meet

our commitments stipulated in the action plan to address the strategic deficiencies that he FATF
identified, we adopted and brought into force amendments to the AML/CFT Law that adequately
criminalizes money laundering and terrorist financing and issued regulations on the freezing of
terrorist assets. Going forward, we will require technical support to facilitate implementation.

D. Structural Reforms
40.

We will implement structural reforms to diversify our production and export structure

away from hydro carbons as part of our strategy to achieve inclusive growth. We will adopt a
multi faceted strategy to improve the business environment, increase credit to small and medium
sized enterprises, and coordinate with donors to support priority sectors such as electricity, tourism,
fisheries, manufacturing and agriculture. We will introduce reforms to address the deficiencies in the
business environment that were identified by the World Bank’s Doing Business Survey, including
reducing corruption and red tape and strengthening property rights. The Parliament ratified the
WTO agreement; and with the submission of the 2011 EITI report the suspension of Yemen has been
lifted so that Yemen is now fully EITI compliant. The government will ensure that the proposed
Public-Private-Partnership legislation is in line with best practices.
41.

Growth has been insufficient to reduce the widespread poverty and unemployment.

Poverty and unemployment are high, and many social indicators are among the lowest. The
70

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

government recognizes that economic growth is fundamentally important for poverty reduction and
that growth-promoting policies must be environmentally, socially, and economically, sustainable.
The government intends to address these challenges and will develop a Poverty Reduction Strategy
(PRS) by the time of the completion of the second review under the ECF arrangement. A key
objective of the PRS would be inclusive, diversified, and sustainable growth, which goes hand in
hand with employment generation and income equality. Effective management of oil and LNG
resources holds is key to unlocking wide-ranging socio-economic benefits to the population at
large. The ECF-supported program seeks to underpin this effort by facilitating high quality public
investment and growth enhancing reforms in the context of macroeconomic stability.
42.

Donor support will be critical in enabling us achieve the program objectives. Yemen’s

development and poverty reduction needs are enormous and donor disbursement of the pledged
support will be critical in facilitating the implementation of the projects included in the TPSD, help
realize higher economic growth, reduce poverty and unemployment, and help meet the Millennium
Development Goals. We will increase our outreach to donors to accelerate the disbursement of the
pledged financial support and to convert some of the project finance into budgetary support. We
will also ensure that financial support from our international partners is deployed in areas that can
provide an enabling environment for private sector growth, including irrigation,
telecommunications, road, water networks, and electricity.

E. Other Issues
43.

We will be undertaking measures to improve the data for macro financial surveillance

and program monitoring. Current delays in national accounts and other macro data impair policy
formulation. We will make efforts to develop quarterly GDP data, monthly leading indicators of
economic activity, and prices and macro financial data that could form part of an Early Warning
System. The household survey is currently underway and we intend to undertake a labor survey in
2014, since the last one was conducted in 2009.
44.

We will continue to strengthen governance arrangements at the CBY. We have

implemented most of the measures that were recommended by the safeguard assessment mission,
including strengthening the internal audit function and publishing the detailed audited accounts for
2011 and 2012. We will continue to publish detailed audited accounts of the CBY. We will also
collaborate with safeguard mission in accordance with the requirement of a new ECF arrangement.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

71

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

F. Program Modalities
45.

The proposed ECF supported program will cover a three-year period beginning July

2014, with semi-annual disbursements from the IMF contingent upon successful completion
of reviews. It will be monitored through performance criteria, indicative targets, structural
benchmarks, and semi-annual reviews, and there will be seven disbursements designed to be
commensurate with the reform efforts. Quantitative performance criteria are proposed for endDecember 2014 and end-June 2015 to be monitored respectively at the first and second reviews.
The proposed semi-annual targets for end-December 2014 and end-June 2015 (performance
criteria) and end-September 2014 and March 2015 (indicative targets) are set forth in Table 1. These
include: (i) a ceiling on domestic financing of the budget of the central government and local
administrations; (ii) a ceiling on net domestic assets of the CBY; (iii) a floor on net international
reserves of the CBY; and (iv) a continuous ceiling on the contracting or guaranteeing of non
concessional external debt by the public sector; and (v) a floor on disbursements of benefits by the
Social Welfare Fund.
46.

A number of structural benchmarks are detailed in Table 2 and the first part of the

program will include strong prior actions. We will closely monitor financial and economic
developments in coming months and will implement any measures that may be needed to
safeguard macroeconomic stability in consultation with IMF staff.
47.

The attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) sets out the modalities

of program monitoring. These include definitions of performance criteria and indicative targets;
application of adjustors for deviations from oil revenues and external financing; and data sources
and frequency of data reporting. The Ministry of Finance will take the lead in collection, vetting, and
provision of data to the IMF in a timely fashion for the purpose of program monitoring in line with
the requirements as specified in the TMU and its Table 1 on reporting standards.

Attachment II. Technical Memorandum of Understanding
1.

This Memorandum sets out the understanding reached between the Yemeni authorities and

the Fund staff regarding the definitions of performance criteria and indicative targets, as well as data
reporting requirements for the 2014–17 Extended Credit Facility (ECF) Arrangement (Table 1).
2.

The ECF Arrangement is built upon five performance criteria for the end of semi-annual

intervals (test dates) during December 2014–June 2017 period. Performance criteria and indicative
targets are set out in Table A of Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies. Performance
criteria and indicative targets are set subject to adjustors as applicable, which will be monitored as
memorandum items.
3.

The exchange rate of Yemeni rial to the U.S. dollar for the purposes of the program is set at

Yrls 214.89 = US$ 1.

I. PERFORMANCE CRITERIA AND INDICATIVE TARGETS
A. Floor on Net International Reserves of Central Bank of Yemen
4.

For purposes of this criterion, net international reserves (NIR) of the CBY are defined as

reserve assets minus reserve-related liabilities, consistent with the definition of the Sixth Edition of
the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual. Reserve assets are defined
as those external assets readily available to, and controlled by, the CBY. Reserve-related liabilities of
the CBY are defined as foreign currency liabilities of the CBY that can be considered as direct claims
by nonresidents on the reserve assets of Yemen.
5.

NIR of the CBY are defined for this purpose as readily available external assets of the CBY

(this includes following categories: monetary gold, foreign exchange deposits held with nonresident
financial institutions; foreign securities; SDR holdings; and reserve position in the International
Monetary Fund) minus CBY external liabilities (this includes SDR allocations; liabilities to the Arab
Monetary Fund (AMF) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF); the $1 billion deposit of Saudi
Arabia, and other short-term liabilities to nonresidents). Pledged and otherwise encumbered assets,
including, but not limited to, reserve assets used as collateral (or guarantees for third party external
liabilities) are excluded from reserve assets, and (ii) external assets not controlled by the CBY
(foreign currency deposits at CBY of banks’, pension funds’ and public enterprises’), are not included
in reserve assets. The term “public enterprises” relates to all enterprises where the central
government and local administrations combined have stake of 50 percent and above.

78

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

6.

For program monitoring purposes, NIR of the CBY as of the test dates are measured as the

change in millions of US dollars from the beginning of the calendar year.

B. Ceiling on Net Domestic Assets of Central Bank of Yemen
7.

Net domestic assets (NDA) of the CBY are defined as reserve money minus net foreign

assets of CBY.
8.

Reserve Money is defined as the sum of currency in circulation (outside banks), banks’

domestic cash in vaults, and banks’ required and excess deposits with the Central Bank of Yemen
(CBY). It includes commercial banks’ required and excess reserves on foreign currency deposits
valued at the program exchange rate. It does not include deposits held in the CBY by the central
government and local administrations, pension funds, public enterprises, and counterpart funds. The
term “banks” relates to all commercial and Islamic banks.
9.

Net foreign assets are NIR as defined under paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 plus other external assets,

including but not limited to: (i) capital subscriptions in international institutions; (ii) foreign assets in
nonconvertible currencies; (iii) external assets that are in any way encumbered or pledged, and
(iv) external assets not controlled by the CBY (foreign currency deposits at CBY of banks’, pension
funds’ and public enterprises’), less any medium- and long-term foreign liabilities of the CBY.
For program monitoring purposes, NDA of the CBY as of the test dates are measured as the change
in billions of Yemeni rials from the beginning of the calendar year. Reserve money, however, is
measured in billions of Yemeni rials as a stock level at the test date.

C. Ceiling on Domestic Financing of the Budget
10.

Budget refers to the budget of the central government of the Republic of Yemen and local

administrations. It does not include extra budgetary funds (funds with independent or adjunct
budgets), and public enterprises.
11.

Domestic financing of the budget is defined as the sum of net claims of the CBY and

domestic commercial banks on the central government and local administrations and net holdings
of government securities by resident nonbanks. Net claims of the CBY and banks are defined as
central bank and banks’ advances and credits to the central government plus government paper
held by the central bank and banks minus the central government’s deposits at the central bank and
banks. Government paper includes but is not limited to T-bills (at purchase value), T-bonds, Islamic
bonds (sukuk and other), and repurchases of government securities of various maturities.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

79

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

For program monitoring purposes, Domestic financing of the budget as of the test dates is
measured as the cumulative change in billions of Yemeni rials from the beginning of the calendar
year.

D. Floor on Disbursements by the Social Welfare Fund
12.

This refers to the disbursements by the Social Welfare Fund (SWF) to the poor that have

been identified and registered as regular beneficiaries of the SWF. For program monitoring
purposes, disbursements of the SWF as of the test dates are measured as the cumulative change in
billions of Yemeni rials from the beginning of the calendar year.

E. Ceiling on Contracting or Guaranteeing of New Nonconcessional
External Debt with Maturities of More Than a Year by the Public Sector
13.

For program purposes, the definition of debt is set out in Executive Board Decision

No. 12274, Point 9, as revised on August 31, 2009 (Decision No. 14416-(09/91)). This performance
criterion refers to the contracting or guaranteeing of new nonconcessional external debt with an
original maturity of over one year. External debt is defined as debt contracted from nonresidents.
The ceiling applies to debt and commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not yet
been received. The term “public sector” relates to the government and public enterprises as defined
in paragraph 5. Nonconcessional loans are defined as having a grant element equivalent to less than
35 percent calculated as follows: the grant element of a debt is the difference between the present
value (PV) of debt and its nominal value, expressed as a percentage of the nominal value of the
debt. The PV of debt at the time of its contracting is calculated by discounting the future stream of
payments of debt service due on this debt. The discount rate used for this purpose is 5 percent.
The ceiling excludes the use of IMF resources. In addition, the ceiling excludes loans from the Arab
Monetary Fund and those from regional developmental/financial institutions (specifically, the Arab
Fund for Economic and Social Development (AFESD), the Islamic Development Bank, the Kuwait
Fund, and the OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID)) that carries a grant element of
25 percent or more. Also excluded from the ceiling are debts incurred to restructure, refinance, or
prepay existing debts, to the extent that such debt is incurred on more favorable terms than the
existing debt and up to the amount of the actually restructured/refinanced/prepaid debt.

II. ADJUSTORS
A. External Budget Grants and Loans
14.

Net external budget grants and loans consists of cash disbursements of external cash grants

and budget support loans to the budget, less cash amortization payments for budget support loans.
Transactions of external grants and loans are to be valued at the program exchange rate.
15.

The floor on NIR will be adjusted downward, while the ceilings on NDA and domestic

financing of the budget will be adjusted upward by the full cumulative amount of any shortfall in net
external budget grants and loans. In case of excess net external budget grants and loans, ceilings on
NDA and domestic financing of the budget will be adjusted downward for the portion of net
external budget grants and loans that is not spent on capital expenditures, while the floor on NIR
will be adjusted upward for the portion of net external grants and loans that is not spent on capital
expenditures financed through imports.

B. Crude Oil and LNG Export Revenue of Government
16.

The programmed quarterly crude oil and LNG export revenue of government shown in the

Table A of the MEFP under memorandum item for the end of the quarter are compared to the actual
government crude oil and LNG revenue reported by the CBY/ Ministry of Oil in order to determine
the excess or shortfall in cumulative government crude oil and LNG receipts. The data on
government crude oil and LNG revenue will be converted to rials at the program exchange rate.
17.

The data on crude oil and LNG export revenues of the government for the end of the

quarters are applied as adjustors to the floor on net international reserves and to the ceilings on net
domestic assets and domestic financing of budget. The floor on NIR will be adjusted upward, while
ceilings on NDA and domestic financing of budget will be adjusted downward by the full cumulative
amount of any excess in cumulative government crude oil revenue and LNG export receipts vis-à-vis
the programmed level. In the case of shortfall of cumulative government crude oil revenue and LNG
export receipts, the floor on NIR will be adjusted downward by the full cumulative amount of any
shortfall, while ceilings on NDA and domestic financing of budget will be adjusted upward for the
50 percent of any shortfall in cumulative government crude oil revenue and LNG export receipts visà-vis the programmed level.

Safeguards Assessment:
An update safeguards assessment was completed in June 2013 with respect to a disbursement
made under the Rapid Credit Facility in April 2012. The updated assessment noted that steps have
been initiated to strengthen the Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) governance and financial statements
are prepared and audited in accordance with international standards. CBY has enhanced
transparency with the publication of the full set of audited financial statements as recommended by

the update assessment. The assessment also recommended that the CBY, in coordination with the
Ministry of Finance, finalize an agreement on repayment terms for credit extended to the
government and that the capacity of the internal audit function be further developed.
Exchange Arrangements:
The currency of Yemen is the Yemeni rial. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as
stabilized, and the de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating.
Yemen has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Articles of Agreement
and maintains an exchange system that is free of multiple currency practices and restrictions on the
making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. In accordance with UN
Security Council Resolutions, Yemen has taken measures to block the accounts of certain individuals
and organizations and has notified the Fund of these measures in accordance with Decision 144.
Article IV Consultation:
The latest Article IV consultation was concluded on July 19, 2013. The next Article IV consultation
with Yemen would be expected to take place under the 24-month cycle, in accordance with the
Executive Board Decision on Article IV consultation cycle as applied to countries with a Fund
Arrangement.

WORLD BANK RELATIONS
1.
As of April 2014, the active IDA and TF portfolio in Yemen includes 34 projects with
US$983 million in commitments, of which about US$536 million in undisbursed balances remain.
The Bank is pursuing efforts to restructure its portfolio in Yemen, with a view to improving
implementation performance, which was affected by the political crisis. Bank’s regular
implementation support efforts are complemented by third-party monitoring and independent
verification measures to ensure satisfactory progress and fiduciary integrity of its ongoing portfolio.
2.
The framework for Bank support to Yemen (an ISN1) which was endorsed by the Board in
November 2012 will be expiring at the end of June 2014. Given that the transition period has been
extended in Yemen, the Bank team is exploring the possibility of extending the ISN for a few months
and initiating the analytical work and consultations required for the preparation of the new Country
Partnership Framework (CPF) in FY15. The strategy and the Bank program will be developed in line
with Government of Yemen priorities and will focus on the economic development agenda in light
of the outcomes of the National Dialogue (ND). The Bank has already fielded a multi-sectoral
scoping mission in March 2014 and discussed an initial set of areas including definition of the
structure of the state, fiscal decentralization, and local service delivery and governance. Bank work in
the next 12 to 18 months is listed below.

1

The strategic pillars of the ISN include: (i) achieving quick wins and protecting the poor by creating short-term jobs,
restoring basic services, improving access to social safety nets, and revitalizing livelihoods; (ii) promoting growth and
improving economic management by helping maintain macro stability, strengthening fiscal policies and public
financial management, and improving the enabling environment for private sector growth and competitiveness; and
(iii) enhancing governance and local service delivery by supporting transparency, accountability, capacity building,
institutional strengthening, and improved citizen engagement.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data remain broadly adequate to conduct surveillance. However, some weaknesses persist
(including delays in reporting). A broad effort is in place to address shortcomings in most data with
technical assistance from the Fund and other donors. In particular, national accounts data should be
a priority for improvement.
2.
The Republic of Yemen has participated in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS)
since April 26, 2001. While some progress has been made, considerable scope remains to improve
the collection and dissemination of economic statistics in line with Yemen’s commitments under the
GDDS.
3.
The most reliable and timely data are those on the monetary sector produced by the
Central Bank of Yemen (CBY). The CBY disseminates data on total official reserve assets and
monetary statistics with a lag of one month. To strengthen monetary statistics further, a multisector
mission in August 2000 recommended that: (a) repurchase agreements be treated as collateralized
loans; (b) all nonstandard loans be reclassified as claims on the relevant sector; (c) counterparty for
several monetary accounts be more accurately identified; and (d) a number of monetary accounts be
disaggregated so as to present position on a single financial instrument. In June 2003, the
authorities began reporting to STA a more disaggregated set of data that allowed for improved
sectoral and instrument classification. Publication of the revised monetary statistics for
December 1999 and onward, based on the more detailed data reporting, began in the August 2003
issue of IFS. In March 2007, with the availability of more detailed data, the definition of broad money
was broadened to include the deposits of the pension funds, starting with data for December 1999.
CBY does not yet report monetary data to STA using Standardized Report Forms (SRFs).
4.
Although important progress has been achieved in terms of coverage, classification, and
compilation methods of national accounts in accordance with the System of National
Accounts 1993 (1993 SNA), significant work remains to be done to improve quality of the data and
the compilation methods. The Central Statistical Organization (CSO) has benefited from substantial
TA in national accounts and price statistics provided by METAC and with the support of the IMF’s
Statistics Department (STA). A series of peripatetic missions have been conducted to date, with the
most recent mission on national accounts conducted during December 2010. As a result of this
support, the CSO has succeeded in (i) improving the GDP estimates at current and constant prices
for the period 1999–2005; (ii) constructing the new GDP series for 2000–2008, which include GDP
(public and private) by economic activities at current and constant prices, and expenditure
components of GDP at current prices; (iii) partially solving fluctuations in the nominal GDP values as
well as in the volume measures of GDP for select economic activities; and (iv) addressing various
methodological issues including assumptions concerning the intermediate consumption in different
activities. The assistance from United Nations Economic and Social Commission for West Asia
(ESCWA) during 2007, 2008 and 2009, has resulted in a new National Accounts series, which the CSO
has adopted and published on their website (June 2009).

5.
However, the 2010 STA mission noticed a number of weaknesses. Notably the mission
recommended improving data on the informal economy, updating the frame and the sampling
design for economic survey, using an improved set of deflators for calculating the GDP and GDP
expenditure components at constant prices, conducting small surveys to update assumptions as in
agriculture for estimating the inputs, .and conducting a labor force survey since the last survey dates
back to 1999. Regarding price statistics, some improvements have been made in the compilation of
the consumer price index and the production of foreign trade price indices. As part of METAC’s work
program a technical assistance mission on price statistics visited Sana’a during December 2–13, 2012
to assist the CSO in developing and compiling a Producer Price Index (PPI). With the assistance of
STA, the CSO has constructed a CPI that is consistent with international standards, with weights
derived from the 1998 Households Budget Survey (HBS). The Consumer Price Index (CPI) has a
broad geographic coverage and a sufficient number of consumption items, although some
deficiencies remain in data collection practices. STA real sector missions have recommended further
improving the sources of data in general, expanding the price statistics to cover different areas, and
enhancing training and internal coordination within the CSO. Staff of CSO has updated the weights
of the CPI basket to reflect the results of the 2005 HBS, and has reduced the number of
commodities in the basket from the coverage of 900 goods in the basket to coverage of 435 goods.
To address problems in the field, the CSO has introduced a new framework to ensure consistency in
data collection according to the following criteria: timing, good specifications, and location.

Fiscal data reliability and timeliness are improving. Fiscal data are published in the quarterly
Bulletin of Government Finance Statistics (GFS Bulletin) on the Ministry of Finance website
(www.mof.gov.ye), which provides annual, quarterly, and monthly data with significant lags and
irregularity. The authorities have reported data for publication in the Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook from 2000 onwards; the latest data are estimates for 1999. No sub-annual data are
reported for publication in International Financial Statistics. The GFS mission that visited Sana’a in
January 2004 found that, while data coverage and detail had improved, there were still numerous
departures from international standards in classification and coverage. The mission encouraged the
authorities to include additional information on financing and debt in the GFS Bulletin. The mission
also recommended that the authorities expand their data dissemination by communicating the GFS
Bulletin, or the relevant data, to the IMF Statistics Department for re-dissemination and for renewing
the dialogue and remote technical assistance for developing their GFS. The August-September 2007
Multisector Statistics mission found that many of the previously identified weakness data
compilation and timeliness remained. The concepts and definitions used to compile GFS are in
transition from GFS 1986 to GFSM 2001, and the authorities’ GFS Bulletin reports fiscal data using a
mixture of both.

The CBY is responsible for compiling and disseminating balance of payments statistics, and
more recently, the international investment position (IIP) statistics based on the IMF’s Balance of
Payments Manual, fifth edition. Compilation tasks are performed on ad hoc basis, mostly relying on
survey-based questionnaires with a response rate that is generally poor. The quality of the
questionnaires themselves is also weak due to the limited expertise and experience in developing
such material. There are also inadequacies in documented sources and methods, and the limited

financial and material resources dedicated to balance of payments compilation. The CBY publishes
quarterly external debt statistics within one quarter of the reference period for the banking sector,
general government, and monetary authority. Successive STA balance of payments statistics
missions (2002, 2003, and 2005) have sought to facilitate implementation of the action plan
recommended by the IMF’s resident advisor on balance of payments statistics (1998–2000), with
limited success. Coverage of the oil and gas industry transactions remains weak. Data questionnaires
on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and selected items in services have either been discontinued or
not followed up. The shortage of qualified staff dedicated to the compilation as well as coordination
shortcomings between the CBY and other government agencies (such as the customs authority, the
CSO, and the ministry of oil and mining resources) are partly responsible for the slow progress. STA
missions have consistently called for better coordination between the CBY and other government
agencies for timely and effective data collection and compilation, improved staffing and training,
and the reinstitution of discontinued surveys. A balance of payments mission in September 2005
found that the CBY had made some progress on increasing manpower and equipment in the
balance of payments division, as well as training through the Arab Monetary Fund. The mission also
focused on the present method of estimating inward worker’s remittances. Yemen has submitted
quarterly balance of payments data to STA until end-2006, although the latest data published in the
IFS and Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook (BOPSY) relate to end-2005. Quarterly IIP data has
also been supplied to STA for 2003 and 2004.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION AND REQUEST FOR A THREE-YEAR
ARRANGEMENT UNDER THE EXTENDED CREDIT
FACILITY—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

July 3, 2014

Approved By
Daniela Gressani and Bob
Traa (IMF) and Bernard
Funck and Jeffrey D.

and the International Development Association

Risk of external debt distress:
Augmented by significant risks
stemming from domestic public
debt and/or private external debt?

Moderate
Yes (domestic debt)

This debt sustainability analysis (DSA) updates the joint IMF/IDA DSA from July 2, 2013.
The results indicate that Yemen continues to face a moderate risk of debt distress. Although
the level of public and publicly guaranteed external debt is modest, it is vulnerable to
shocks to export receipts. Public domestic debt is large, leading to increased vulnerabilities,
particularly to a growth shock.1

1

This analysis is based on the joint Fund-Bank debt sustainability framework for conducting debt sustainability
analysis in low-income countries. Under IDA’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), Yemen’s
three-year average score in 2010–12 is 3.04 and its policy performance is categorized as weak. This DSA
update uses the indicative thresholds for countries for this category.

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

A. Underlying Assumptions
Apart from short-term projections, no major changes have been made to macroeconomic
projections compared to the previous DSA (Box 1). Over the long term, real GDP growth is
assumed to be about 4.5 percent, while exports and imports of goods and services are assumed to
grow by about 5.5 percent and 3 percent, respectively. Inflation is assumed to stabilize at
6.5 percent. Projections for workers’ remittances have been revised upwards in view of their strong
performance in recent years, and LNG exports will be boosted by upward revisions to export prices
in the contracts recently concluded or expected to be concluded.

B. External DSA
Under the baseline scenario, all public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt indicators are
below the policy-dependent thresholds over the projection period (2014–2034). The present value
(PV) of debt-to-exports ratio is projected to peak at about 65 percent in 2026 before declining to
57 percent, compared to the threshold applied to Yemen (100 percent) (Table 1). In terms of the
composition of public external debt, no contracting of commercial debt is assumed under the scenarios.
However, about 40 percent of official debt is assumed to be semi-concessional (loans with a grant element
of 25-35 percent) or reflecting obligations owed to the IMF and the Arab Monetary Fund.
Under the alternative scenarios and stress tests, all indicators remain below the thresholds, with one
exception (Table 2 and Figure 1). The PV of debt-to-exports ratio is projected to rise above 100 percent in
2016 under the most extreme shock to export receipts and to remain so throughout the projection period.
These findings highlight Yemen’s high dependence on oil exports for its external sustainability.
Yemen’s international investment position has not been published since 2008. Data on private
sector flows and stocks, including nonhydrocarbon FDI and other private investment flows need to
be improved. Existing shortcomings result in substantial unidentified flows that can be better
classified if data improve.

C. Public DSA
Yemen’s public debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds the policy-dependent benchmark in 20132 and remains
above it through 2034 (Table 3). Even though the level of public and publicly-guaranteed external debt is
comfortably low (about 8–16 percent), the PV of total public debt-to-GDP ratio amounts to 49 percent in
2013, exceeding the benchmark of 38 percent applied to Yemen. The public debt-to-GDP ratio increased
2

Yemen’s public debt at end-2013 was about 49 percent of GDP; 15 percentage points in external debt and
34 percentage points in domestic debt. All external debt is concessional, long term, and mostly denominated in US
dollars. Domestic debt is all in local currency. About 25 percent of it is owed to the central bank in the form of loans
that will be reduced by about 15 percent annually starting in 2017. About 30 percent is owed mostly in 5 years bonds
to the corporate sector, insurance companies, and pension funds. Finally 45 percent is owed to the banking sector,
most of which are in six months bills held by conventional banks, and only 5 percentage points are in 5–14 years
sukuk held by Islamic banks.

Box 1. Assumptions for the Macroeconomic Framework
Growth: In the medium term (2014–19), real GDP growth is projected to average about 4.6 percent, which is
slightly higher than the 10-year historical average before the political crisis (4.3 percent). This reflects projected
recovery from the recent economic slowdown because of the supply shock, increased international assistance,
including the proposed ECF arrangement, and utilization of idle production capacity. For the long term growth is
projected to average 4.5 percent (2020–34). Given the gradual decline in oil production, non-hydrocarbon growth
is essential. Following the political transition and under the ECF-supported program, the government will
undertake structural reforms to improve the business environment and attract sizeable donor-funded public
investment. Reprioritization of expenditures should support infrastructure investment, while reduction in crowding
out would lead to growth in credit to the private sector, boosting non-hydrocarbon growth. The assumptions on
nonhydrocarbon growth rates average 5.2 percent in 2014–19 and 4.7 percent in the long term. These are broadly
in line with the historical experience.
Hydrocarbon Sector: As in last year’s DSA, oil production is assumed to continue towards the end of projection
period, in line with the authorities’ projections and consistent with the assessment of main credible independent
sources (e.g. British Petroleum Oil Statistics, Oil & Gas Journal, and Economic Intelligence Unit), which put Yemen’s
proven oil reserves at about 3 billion barrels. Assuming a partial recovery in oil production over the medium term,
and subsequent declines of 3 percent per year over the long-term, Yemen would use only about half of its proven
reserves by 2034. Yemen has a large potential in the LNG sector. The DSA assumes no increase in LNG production
over the medium-term and an average annual increase at 7 percent from 2025 onwards.
Inflation: Inflation is projected to edge up in 2014–15 owing to the impact of higher fuel prices following reforms,
and to gradually decline to single digits in the medium term with the recovery of economic activities. It would then
moderate to an average of 6.5 percent in the long term, assuming that the central bank refrains from financing the
government budget and ensures the stability of the real exchange rate.
Public finance: Despite the pressure on the fiscal position following the shock to oil production in early 2014,
strong fiscal adjustment will be undertaken under the ECF-supported program and will continue at a more gradual
pace over the projection period. The ratio of total revenues (excluding grants) to GDP would thus hover
around 20 percent. On the expenditure side, the government’s efforts to control the public wage bill and fuel
subsidies, including by removing ghost workers and double dippers as well as increasing domestic petroleum
prices, are expected to lead to a reduction in overall expenditures from 29.6 percent of GDP in 2014
to 22.1 percent in 2034. As a result, the overall fiscal deficit would gradually decline to around 3 percent of GDP by
2034.
External sector: Exports are expected to decrease in the medium term, reflecting a declining oil production.
However, a gradual increase in non-oil exports and, more importantly, LNG exports, will offset the decrease in oil
exports in the long run. The value of LNG exports will be boosted by higher LNG prices on account of recently
renegotiated LNG export contracts. Nonhydrocarbon export growth would be around 6.4 percent in 2015–19, and
would stabilize at around 5.5 percent in the long run. Import growth is projected at a conservative average of
2.9 percent over the projection period, reflecting fiscal adjustment. The current account deficit would gradually
increase to about 2 percent of GDP in the medium term and would slowly widen over the projection period to
about 3–4 percent of GDP. Official creditors are expected to continue providing financing on favorable terms.
Improved security conditions and business environment would attract more foreign direct investment.

by 12 percentage point of GDP from 2008 to 2013. Most of the debt remained denominated in local
currency. The maturity of domestic debt is shorter than external debt. The creditor base is domestic and
very narrow. Key holders of domestic debt are commercial and Islamic banks, the Pension Fund, and a
telecommunication company. These facts suggest substantial rollover and interest rate risks when facing a
shock. The expansion of domestic public debt also resulted from financing of the budget by the central
bank in the aftermath of the 2011 crisis. Data on contingent liabilities are not available, but there is some
anecdotal evidence that indicates the existence of such liabilities.
The alternative scenarios and stress tests point to the importance for Yemen to embark on fiscal
consolidation (Table 4 and Figure 2). They suggest that Yemen’s public debt position is particularly
vulnerable to GDP growth shocks.

D. Conclusion
Based on an assessment of PPG external debt, Yemen continues to face a moderate risk of debt
distress. The assessment of the risk is reinforced by significant vulnerabilities related to a high level of
public domestic debt. While the debt profile remains sustainable in a scenario of recovery and stability
under continued prudent policies, it is subject to substantial downside risks, including a deterioration of the
security environment and a decline in oil production and exports.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment. However, they highlighted the downside risks,
especially in view of the potential impact of the projected decline in oil production, and the risk of
deterioration in the fiscal and external accounts in case of slippages in policy implementation that might
result from deterioration in the security situations.

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND REQUEST FOR A THREE-YEAR ARRANGEMENT UNDER
THE EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY—SUPPLEMENTARY
INFORMATION
Approved By:

Prepared by MCD

Daniela Gressani
and Bob Traa

1.
Staff wishes to highlight developments since the staff report was circulated to the
Executive Board on July 7, 2014. This information does not alter the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
2.
The Executive Board meeting on Yemen was postponed from July 18, 2014 to
allow time for the authorities to implement key prior actions. Regarding prior action 1, as
described in the staff report, the authorities allowed the private sector to import or buy
diesel for their own use at international prices as a first step to reduce the subsidy bill.
Accordingly, the private sector began buying part of the diesel for its own use at
international prices from the Aden Refinery. A formal decision to this effect was taken
and implemented in June, although some unsubsidized private sector purchases took
place as early as May. Consequently, staff considers that the objective of prior action 1
has been achieved, although the decision was approved by the Prime Minister, not the
Council of Ministers. Moreover, On July 30, 2014, the authorities raised domestic retail
prices for gasoline, diesel, and kerosene to levels higher than the MEFP had envisaged for
October and sufficient to eliminate subsidies on these products—which make up the bulk
of fiscal subsidies—at current international prices. The price per liter of gasoline was
raised from Yrls 125 to Yrls 200, diesel from Yrls 100 to Yrls 195, and kerosene from
Yrls 100 to Yrls 200, exceeding the planned increases to Yrls 175, 150, and 150,
respectively, indicated in the MEFP. Accordingly, the fiscal burden of subsidies that prior
action 1 sought to address has been further alleviated by retail price increases.
3.
On August 3, 2014, the Council of Ministers approved a plan to enforce the use
of a biometric identification system throughout the general civil service, including the

REPUBLIC OF YEMEN

military and police, and the making of all wage payments through bank accounts and
post offices. Accordingly, prior actions 2 and 3 have been implemented.
4.
Prior actions 4, 5, and 6 have also been met (as described in Table 1 of this
supplement).
5.
The fiscal outlook has improved relative to the assessment in the staff report in
light of subsidy removal for the above fuel products, as well as higher-than-programmed
grants from Saudi Arabia. The authorities have confirmed that the savings from subsidies
reform, as well as the grants, will be used in line with the MEFP, mostly to increase capital
expenditure and social transfers.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of
Yemen
On September 2, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Yemen.
The macroeconomic situation continued to be relatively stable in 2013 and growth remained
moderate. Nonhydrocarbon growth was steady at about 4 percent, while hydrocarbon growth
picked up strongly, reversing part of the oil output decline in the preceding two years. As a
result, real GDP growth is estimated to have doubled to almost 5 percent. At the same time,
average inflation edged up slightly to reach 11 percent (up from about 10 percent a year
earlier), and the exchange rate remained stable.
The overall fiscal deficit worsened only moderately in 2013 despite a large decline in grants.
Although grants declined by about 5 percent of GDP, the overall fiscal deficit deteriorated by
only 0.6 percent of GDP to reach 6.9 percent. This was achieved through a combination of
expenditure restraint and an increase in nonhydrocarbon revenue. Subsidies and transfers
were reduced by about 2.7 percent of GDP, mostly through limiting the supply of fuel
products and shifting the schedule for payment of the subsidy bill by one month. Capital
spending was also reduced by 1.3 percent of GDP. A 2012 decision to increase civil servants’
allowances was not implemented, leading to a 0.9 percent reduction in the wage bill. As a
result, the underlying fiscal deficit (defined as the nonhydrocarbon primary deficit excluding
grants) narrowed by about 6 percent of GDP. This adjustment was forced by the lack of
financing and the authorities’ determination to refrain from central bank borrowing.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
The widening of the external current account deficit was also moderate in 2013. The large
decline in grants was mitigated by a healthy growth in exports and in remittances. At the
same time, capital outflows increased, reflecting large scheduled repatriation of past oil
companies’ foreign direct investment and the nonrecurrence of the large Saudi deposit of
2012. As a result, gross reserves declined by about US$740 million to reach US$4.9 billion,
or 4.5 months of imports despite the sale to the central bank of pension funds’ foreign
currency holdings of about US$250 million. On the other hand, the real effective exchange
rate appreciated by 6.5 percent due to the relatively high domestic inflation and the nominal
depreciation against the dollar of the currencies of Yemen’s key trading partners.
Monetary policy continued to be generally prudent, but fiscal dominance remained high.
Broad money growth was slightly slower than the growth of nominal GDP, mostly reflecting
the decline in net foreign assets. But net claims on central government continued to grow
rapidly at about 28 percent. Private sector credit growth was also high at 39 percent, from a
low base and after declining in the preceding two years. On February 7, 2013, the Central
Bank of Yemen reduced the benchmark deposit interest rate from 18 percent to 15 percent.
The banking system remained stable, but some vulnerabilities remain. Banks are profitable,
and liquid and capital adequacy ratios are high, albeit in large part reflecting the large zerorisk-weighted government securities on banks’ balance sheet. Nonperforming loans remain
high, and so is asset concentration in government securities. Islamic banks have high
exposure to the real estate markets abroad. The banking sector remains small and
underdeveloped, and financial markets and the payment system are underdeveloped, limiting
financial intermediation and monetary policy transmission.
The recent wave of sabotage of oil pipelines has had strong adverse effects on
macroeconomic developments in the first half of 2014. The frequent sabotage resulted in a
significant decline in oil production and exports. This has led to pressures on the fiscal and
external positions. In the absence of reforms, the fiscal deficit would reach 9 percent of GDP
and reserves would decline well below 3 months of imports. Severe fuel and electricity
shortages have negatively impacted economic activity, with real GDP growth expected to
decelerate to less than 2 percent.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities for policies that have preserved
macroeconomic stability in a challenging political and security environment. Directors
2

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any
qualifiers used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

agreed, however, that GDP growth continues to be insufficient to bring down Yemen’s high
unemployment and pervasive poverty. Accordingly, they welcomed the authorities’
ambitious reform program to be supported by an arrangement under the Fund’s Extended
Credit Facility which will boost the pace of activity, address the country’s fiscal and external
imbalances, and catalyze donors’ support.
Directors concurred that a substantial overhaul of the poorly targeted and distortionary
system of energy subsidies needs to be the centerpiece of the reform package. They
considered that the recent adjustment in the prices of key fuel products is an important step in
this direction. Directors also welcomed the authorities’ plan to use part of the savings from
subsidy reforms to finance high-quality infrastructure investment and to increase social
transfers to the poor.
More broadly, Directors encouraged the authorities to reduce the fiscal deficit over the
medium term by continuing to improve the structure of expenditures and revenues. In this
regard, they endorsed plans to further reduce untargeted subsidies, better control the public
sector wage bill, and improve tax compliance and administration. Directors also underscored
the importance of strengthening public financial management, as well as the institutional
capacity to implement fiscal decentralization.
Directors cautioned that, in the period ahead, monetary policy should aim at containing the
impact of subsidy reforms on prices and encouraged the authorities to adjust the stance as
needed to preserve macroeconomic stability. In this regard, reforms to strengthen central
bank independence remain an important policy priority. While taking note that data
limitations and other factors hamper the staff’s assessment of the real effective exchange rate,
Directors were of the view that greater exchange rate flexibility would help protect reserves
and support competiveness.
Directors recommended further strengthening prudential oversight of banks and enhancing
financial market infrastructure. Priorities include addressing gaps in cross-border
supervision, the regulation of Islamic banking, and the bank resolution framework, as well as
strengthening the enforcement of the regime to combat money-laundering and the financing
of terrorism.
Directors encouraged the authorities to improve governance and public sector service
delivery to support inclusive, private sector-led growth. They also noted that improved
economic and financial statistics would help guide economic policy making and surveillance.

IMF Executive Board Approves a 3-Year, US$552.9 Million Extended Credit Facility
Arrangement with Yemen
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a three-year
Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement with the Republic of Yemen for an amount
equivalent to SDR 365.25 million (US$552.9 million; or 150 percent of Yemen’s quota) to
help maintain macroeconomic stability and promote inclusive growth. As a result of the
Board’s decision, an amount equivalent to SDR 48.75 million (about US$73.8 million) is
available for immediate disbursement. The remaining amount will be phased in semi-annual
disbursements, subject to six reviews.
Following the Executive Board discussion on Yemen, Mr. Naoyuki Shinohara, Deputy
Managing Director, and Acting Chair, said:
“The Yemeni authorities have made commendable efforts to support macroeconomic
stability and growth. Nonetheless, political and security challenges have continued to weigh
on the policy environment and economic outcomes. In particular, fiscal and external balances
have weakened due to delays in key reforms and increased sabotage of oil facilities. Looking
ahead, the main challenges are to improve the fiscal and external positions, as well as support
inclusive growth and job creation.
“The authorities have launched an ambitious economic program to meet these challenges and
durably reduce Yemen’s high unemployment and widespread poverty. The authorities’
program, to be supported by a three-year arrangement under the Fund’s Extended Credit
Facility, is designed to address balance of payments needs, close the fiscal financing gap, and
maintain macroeconomic stability while protecting the most vulnerable groups.
“The centerpiece of the authorities’ reform package is phasing out large and inefficient fuel
subsidies. A first step in this direction has already taken place and will be complemented by
well targeted social transfers to the poor. Additional fiscal measures will aim at reducing the
budget deficit over the medium term by reforming the civil service and improving tax

2

compliance. These measures will also free budgetary resources for needed infrastructure and
social spending.
“To preserve macroeconomic stability in the near term, the central bank needs to adjust
monetary policy as needed to limit the impact of subsidies reform on inflation. It should also
continue to improve its monetary framework to strengthen policy transmission and support
greater exchange rate flexibility. The financial sector reforms planned by the authorities aim
at strengthening bank regulation and supervision as well as at enhancing market
infrastructure.”
ANNEX:
Recent Developments:
The macroeconomic situation continued to be relatively stable in 2013, and growth remained
moderate. Non-hydrocarbon growth was steady at about 4 percent, while hydrocarbon
growth picked up strongly, reversing part of the oil output decline in the preceding two years.
As a result, real GDP growth is estimated to have doubled to almost 5 percent. At the same
time, average inflation edged up slightly to reach 11 percent (up from about 10 percent a year
earlier), and the exchange rate remained stable. Inflation moderated in the first half of 2014,
but oil production declined due to sabotage activities, leading to severe fuel and electricity
shortages.
Yemen has progressed in its political transition since the 2011 crisis. However, the economic
recovery remained insufficient to reduce the high levels of unemployment and poverty. The
average per capita GDP growth rate was less than 1.5 percent a year preceding the 2011
crisis and has declined since. Poverty and youth unemployment, at about 54 percent and 45
percent respectively, are among the highest in the world. Infrastructure investment has also
continued to drop, and foreign direct investment remains concentrated in the hydrocarbon
sector that employs a small percentage of the labor force.
Program Summary:
Faced with a rapidly deteriorating economic situation in the first half of 2014, the authorities
have initiated a bold economic reform program to reverse the recent deterioration in
macroeconomic conditions and to support growth, encourage job creation, and protect the
poor. Notwithstanding political challenges, the authorities’ program combines a package of
strong policy measures and structural reforms with external financing support.
Key elements of the Fund-supported program are to:
Strengthen fiscal adjustment and protect the poor. This is to be achieved through reforms
to reduce untargeted subsidies, contain the wage bill, and enhance compliance of large tax

3

payers. Targeted cash transfers to the poor will be increased by 50 percent following the
adjustment in the fuel prices. Infrastructure investment will be gradually increased in order to
boost job creation and potential growth. The government will also improve public finance
management.
Maintain prudent monetary and exchange rate policies. These will aim at containing
inflation, enhancing competitiveness, and avoiding exchange rate volatility while preserving
foreign exchange reserves.
Reform the financial sector, improve governance, and encourage inclusive, private
sector-led growth. Primary reforms aim at strengthening consolidated and cross border
supervision, developing regulation to address risks specific to Islamic banking, and
strengthening the Central Bank of Yemen’s powers to resolve banks. Governance reforms
include improving the business environment, transparency and accountability. Additional
reforms are aimed at enhancing the government implementation capacity to help mobilize
donor support and improve public infrastructure investment.
The support of the international community will continue to be essential in the period ahead.

Statement by A. Shakour Shaalan, Executive Director for Yemen
September 2, 2014
1.
On behalf of the Yemeni authorities, I would like to thank staff for their continued
engagement with Yemen and the valuable policy advice during both the Article IV mission and
the program negotiations.
Recent Developments and Request for an ECF
2.
In spite of a challenging political and security environment, the authorities have
maintained macroeconomic stability in the past year, thanks to their prudent policies and
continued support from the Gulf Cooperation Council and particularly from Saudi Arabia, which
provided last month an additional sizable support to the government of about $1.2 billion, about
a third of it earmarked for social spending. However, the country continues to face significant
social and development needs, with more than 50 percent of the population living below the
poverty line. In addition, the recent attacks on oil pipelines and the electricity grid led to severe
fuel and electricity shortages and resulted in a rapid deterioration in the fiscal and external
positions in the first half of 2014. In response, the authorities took bold measures under difficult
social and political circumstances in order to preserve macroeconomic stability. These included
the removal of subsidies on key fuel products at the end of July 2014.
3.
The Yemeni authorities are requesting an Extended Credit Facility (ECF) in support of
their strong economic program which aims at responding to the country’s urgent balance of
payments needs and closing the fiscal financing gap. Under the program, the authorities plan to
restore macroeconomic stability while protecting the most vulnerable groups and laying the
foundation for inclusive and sustainable growth. The authorities have already demonstrated
strong ownership and commitment to this program by implementing or exceeding all of the
prior actions, including the removal of fuel subsidies at a critical juncture, ahead of schedule and
beyond what was agreed in the Fund program.
4.
It is hoped that the ECF arrangement will continue to catalyze additional support from
donors and international institutions. So far, only a third of the Friends of Yemen’s pledged
resources have been disbursed. The authorities are particularly grateful to all the donors who are
supporting their transition efforts. Speeding up donor disbursement remains essential to help
Yemen address its challenges and promote stability in the near future.
The Government’s Economic Program for 2014-2017
5.
In response to the challenging economic situation, the authorities have started
implementing a reform program aimed at (i) maintaining macroeconomic stability, (ii) enhancing
fiscal and external sustainability, and (iii) promoting sustained and inclusive growth.

2
Fiscal Reforms
6.
The authorities’ fiscal strategy is focused on the need to contain the deteriorating fiscal
position in the wake of repeated sabotage of the country’s oil and gas pipelines. They plan to
reduce the fiscal deficit to more manageable levels while creating the space needed for poverty
reduction and development spending. Fiscal adjustment will be mainly achieved by significantly
reducing energy subsidies, containing the wage bill, and increasing non-oil tax revenues. The
negative impact on the most vulnerable will be offset by increasing targeted social transfers.
7.
On the revenues side, the authorities will continue their efforts to increase tax revenues,
which are low compared to regional and international standards, thereby reducing their
dependence on oil revenues. They will increase the revenue of the General Sales Tax and expand
its coverage while improving payment compliance of the registered large tax payers in line with
FAD recommendations. Exceptional efforts will be made to recover tax arrears, improve tax
compliance, strengthen customs controls to combat smuggling, and reform the revenue
administration. In addition, the authorities will review all existing tax and customs exemptions
with the objective of limiting them.
8.
On the expenditures side, corrective measures will produce considerable savings mainly
through reducing by more than half petroleum subsidies, and controlling the growth of wages
and capital expenditures. In addition, the government has adopted an action plan to pay wages
and salaries using bank accounts and postal offices. This will contain the wage bill by reducing
the number of ghost workers and double dippers. Moreover, a presidential decision has been
taken recently to cut government spending including by freezing recruitment at all state
institutions, and modifying government officials’ travel and transport benefits.
9.
Public financial management reforms will continue to be implemented to improve the
efficiency and transparency in public expenditures, throughout the strengthening of the treasury
at the Ministry of Finance, as well as the improvement of processes for planning and execution of
government spending. The authorities are well aware that the shift to fiscal federalism would
require careful design and adequate capacity building, and will take all the necessary measures
for a smooth and well planned transition. In order to avoid budgetary overspending, the
authorities will enforce strict spending rules. They will resist any new spending request that
exceed the allocated spending envelopes, except for any necessary requirements.
10.
Energy subsidies reform measures are the centerpiece of the program and will lead to a
reduction in subsidies of more than 5 percent of GDP over the program period compared to an
initial saving of 4 percent of GDP under the Fund program. The domestic price of gasoline, diesel,
and kerosene were increased respectively by 60 percent, 95 percent, and 100 percent beyond
what was agreed initially. In addition to these significant fuel price adjustments, the government
will work on introducing an automatic fuel price adjustment mechanism to respond to
fluctuations in international prices in order to preserve the savings from the energy subsidies
reforms. More importantly, and in order to offset the impact of the price increases on the poor,
the authorities will increase the Social Welfare Fund (SWF) transfers by fifty percent starting with

3
the last quarter of 2014. In parallel, the government will continue to improve the coverage of the
SWF in collaboration with the World Bank and other development partners.
11.
The government will adopt a program to clear outstanding payment arrears over the
medium-term. Given the pressing development and social needs of the country, the focus will be
on mobilizing budgetary grants to avoid increasing the debt burden.
Monetary and Financial Sector Policies
12.
Monetary policy will continue to aim at maintaining price stability and supporting
economic growth while preserving reserves. The Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) has lowered its
benchmark interest rate last year in order to encourage credit to the private sector. However, and
given that inflation is projected to increase to double digits as a result of the fuel price increases,
the CBY will continue to monitor economic developments and stands ready to adjust policies as
needed.
13.
The authorities are committed to preserve the independence of the CBY and will refrain
from monetizing the fiscal deficit going forward. In this regard, the CBY has signed a
memorandum of understanding with the Ministry of Finance to bring down the government’s
outstanding credit within the CBY legal limits. In addition, the CBY has recently published the full
set of its audited financial statements, in an effort to enhance transparency and good
governance.
14.
While the banking system remains stable and profitable, the CBY is committed to ensure
its soundness and to increase consolidated and cross-border supervision. The CBY will also
continue to improve prudential regulations especially those related to Islamic banking.
Other Structural Reforms
15.
The Yemeni government will continue its diversification efforts as well as promoting
alternative sources of growth and employment generation. The authorities are committed to
improve the business environment and promote private sector investment. They have identified
the main challenges to doing business in Yemen and have launched several actions to address
them.

16.

The reform of the electricity sector remains a top priority for the government. The Public
Electricity Corporation has been asked to review all the ongoing power lease contracts as well as
unify and lower the cost price of purchasing power. The government is working on expanding
gas and coal powered plants to replace diesel plants. In this regard, plans to install and operate
Mareb’s second gas powered station will be expedited. In addition to resolving outstanding
security problems at production sites, the cost of drilling and extracting oil will be reviewed with
the aim of bringing costs down to the global averages.
