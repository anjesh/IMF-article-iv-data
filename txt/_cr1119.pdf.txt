2010 Article IV Consultation, First Review Under the Policy Support Instrument,
and Modification of Assessment Criteria
Prepared by the African Department
(in consultation with other departments)
Approved by Saul Lizondo and Christian Mumssen
December 6, 2010

Discussions were held in Kigali during October 12–26. The team included Ms. McAuliffe
(head), Mr. Davoodi, Mr. Opoku-Afari, and Mr. Yabara (all AFR), Mr. Geiregat (SPR), and
was assisted by Mr. Gershenson, resident representative. The team met with Minister of
Finance and Economic Planning Rwangombwa, Governor of the National Bank of Rwanda
Kanimba, heads of key government agencies, other officials, representatives of the private
sector, and commercial banks.
High-level outreach and seminar. A series of high-level meetings and outreach events were
held for the full parliament, Cabinet of Ministers and other high level government officials,
civil society, private sector, development partners, and the press. The meeting with Cabinet
discussed the challenges of scaling up investment in infrastructure in a sustainable manner.
The outreach and meetings were very well received and all participants requested that the
dialogue continue on future missions.
The exchange rate regime is classified as crawl-like arrangement, effective January 4, 2010,
given the recent movement of the Rwandan franc against the dollar. Rwanda has accepted the
obligations of Article VIII, sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains a system free of restrictions on
the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.

2
Key Issues and Recommendations


Context: Recovery has resumed, while inflation remains subdued in 2010. Looking
ahead, growth remains steady but inflation is projected to pick up slightly in 2011.
Downside risks relate to slower pickup in external demand and domestic credit. After a
large increase in 2009–2010, donor flows are expected to return to trend levels, but
decline gradually over the medium-term.



Unwinding fiscal stimulus gradually: The unwinding of a sizable stimulus in 2009–10
is underpinned by the ongoing front loading of revenue increases, despite some recent
downward revision in the revenue outlook. The authorities are strengthening their
medium term fiscal framework which envisages further consolidation over the mediumterm. Looking ahead, tax policy reforms are needed in order to support the ongoing
improvements in tax administration.



Mapping an Effective Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy: The accommodative
monetary policy stance is appropriate, but needs to be revisited depending on inflationary
pressures. The NBR should continue to use appropriate mix of monetary policy
instruments, including greater exchange rate flexibility, to support the objective of
maintaining low and stable inflation.



Strengthening Financial Stability while Deepening Financial Markets: The authorities
are on track to complete the planned number of on-site bank inspections. However, the
high turnover of trained bank examiners continues to weaken the supervisory capacity at
the NBR, and remains a potential source of vulnerability. There is a need to deepen the
financial sector, but the decision to grant lending licenses to additional micro finance
institutions and saving and credit cooperatives is a cause for concern, given the high and
growing non-performing loans in the sector as well as limited supervision capacity at the
NBR and other institutions.



Boosting Competiveness and Growth: Staff analysis indicates that the real exchange
rate is broadly in line with fundamentals. The authorities are mindful of a low export
revenue base and intend to improve Rwanda’s competitiveness and growth through
improving the business environment, developing a viable export diversification strategy
and scaling up investment in strategic sectors using nonconcessional financing and Public
Private Partnerships (PPPs). Staff welcomes the authorities’ cautious approach to granting
tax incentives to potential investors and to fully assessing fiscal risks associated with
PPPs.



Fund relations: On June 16, 2010, the Executive Board approved a three-year
PSI-supported program. All end-June assessment criteria were met, and notable progress
was made in implementing structural benchmarks. Staff recommends completion of the
first review under the PSI, and modification of the assessment criteria for end-December
2010.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Rwanda has achieved high growth and macroeconomic stability over the last
decade, but poverty remains high. Growth has averaged about 8 percent a year.1 Inflation,
though volatile, is now in low single digits, and international reserves are at comfortable
levels. The financial sector has deepened over the last decade with the ratio of private sector
credit to GDP increasing six-fold to 12 percent of GDP. Rwanda’s resilience to external
shocks has also improved further―thanks to prudent policies, substantial debt relief, and
heavy reliance on concessional borrowing. However, poverty remains high, with 57 percent
of the population living below the national poverty line in 2006. Although Rwanda is
unlikely to meet most of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), including halving its
poverty by 2015, significant progress has been made in many areas (Table 1 and Box 1).
Box 1. Rwanda’s Progress in MDG Goals1
 Number of seats held by women in the Rwanda’s parliament increased from 17 percent
in 1994 to 52 percent in 2008, the highest in the world.
 Rwanda is very likely to meet—and possibly even surpass—the MDG targets for child
and maternal mortality by 2015.
 The rate of births attended by skilled staff increased from 39 percent to 52 percent
between 2005 and 2008.
 Proportion of children under five sleeping under insecticide-treated bed nets increased
from 4 percent in 2000 to 56 percent in 2008/09.

2.
The authorities have strengthened their policies, in line with advice from the last
Article IV consultation and subsequent program discussions. Policy implementation has
improved significantly, including reforms in Public Financial Management (PFM) through a
basket fund supported and monitored regularly by donors; delivering positive real interest
rate on bank deposits; using countercyclical fiscal and monetary policies to mitigate the
adverse effects of the global economic downturn; allowing for greater policy interest rate and
exchange rate flexibility; and implementing a sweeping set of reforms of the business
environment that that has placed Rwanda among the top reformers in the World Bank’s
Doing Business Index in 2010 and 2011. Notwithstanding these achievements, the authorities
recognize Rwanda’s vulnerabilities―low government revenues, a narrow export base, and
severe bottlenecks in infrastructure―and have embarked on a program supported by the
1

In August this year, Fitch upgraded Rwanda’s sovereign rating by a notch to ‘B’, citing gains made from a
sustained period of strong growth and improvement in the business environment.

6
Fund’s Policy Support Instrument (PSI) aimed at mitigating these vulnerabilities while
consolidating gains in macroeconomic stability (Box 2). The authorities’ reform agenda is
also supported by the World Bank, DFID, and other development partners.
Box 2: Key Objectives of the PSI
The PSI supports the authorities’ program to achieve sustainable broad-based high
growth and poverty reduction, in line with their Economic Development and Poverty
Reduction Strategy (EDPRS), while maintaining macroeconomic stability. Consistent
with these objectives, the program aims to:


Maintain a sustainable fiscal position, with increasing mobilizing domestic revenues
aimed at reducing Rwanda’s aid dependency;



Strengthen monetary and exchange rate policies to ensure low and stable inflation;



Reduce financial sector vulnerabilities by strengthening banking supervision, and
deepening the financial sector by enhancing access to credit; and



Underpin growth with structural reforms to diversify the export base and improve the
business environment.

II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Rwanda’s economy is showing clear signs of recovery from the external and
domestic shocks of the past two years, while inflation has remained low (Table 2 and
Figure 1). After slowing to 4.1 percent in 2009 from 11.2 percent in 2008, real GDP growth
for 2010 is expected to reach 6.5 percent, driven by a rebound in exports and stronger-thanexpected growth in services (mainly in telecommunications) and construction―sectors that
were adversely affected by the global recession and tight domestic liquidity. High-frequency
macroeconomic indicators for the first three quarters of 2010 support the pickup in economic
activity (Figure 2). For the first time in many years, annual inflation has remained below
5 percent in 2010, reflecting in large part the benign external environment, especially stable
food and fuel prices. Higher export performance, reflecting a rebound in international prices
and stronger-than-expected volumes of coffee, tea, and non-traditional exports, has
contributed to a narrowing of the external current account deficit (excluding grants) to
17.3 percent of GDP in 2010, from 18.6 percent in 2009, while international reserves remain
at comfortable levels (Table 3 and Figure 3).
4.
Fiscal performance in FY 2009/10 was better than projected.2 Domestic revenue
collection exceeded the indicative target for the PSI during January-June 2010, mainly on
2

Fiscal year runs from July to June.

7
account of taxes on goods and services and direct taxes (Table 4 and Figure 4). Overall
spending in the second half of the fiscal year was in line with the PSI program, as overruns in
current expenditures, namely goods and services, were offset by lower-than-expected net
lending.3
5.
Monetary policy has been accommodative, but private sector credit has been
slow to respond. Despite three cuts in the central bank’s policy rate (the key repo rate) since
November 2009 by a cumulative 300 basis points4, commercial banks’ lending rates have
remained persistently high, while they continue to maintain a cautious credit stance. Credit to
the private sector has rebounded from the low levels in 2009, but the pace is much slower
than envisaged in the program for 2010 (Table 5 and Figure 5). Non-performing loans and
loan loss provisions have continued to edge down in 2010 (Table 6 and Figure 6).
6.
With the introduction of the interbank exchange rate corridor framework in
March 2010, the Rwandan franc has begun to move in line with macroeconomic
fundamentals. The franc depreciated by 2.5 percent against the US dollar between April and
October 2010, a larger movement than observed in 2009 as a whole. The depreciation of the
franc against the US dollar reflected the strengthening of the dollar against the major
international currencies (euro and pound sterling) over the first three quarters of 2010, similar
to the depreciations of other EAC currencies against the US dollar in the period.

Lower revenues and delays in grants during the first quarter of 2010/11 (July – September 2010) contributed
to temporary build up in arrears (Rwf 7 billion, equivalent to 0.2 percent of GDP), despite lower-thanprogrammed spending.
4

The central bank also lowered its reserve requirements from 8 to 5 percent in February 2009.

As of 2009/10 Rwanda has a better track record than other EAC in meeting the
EAC convergence criteria. Among the four EAC criteria, only the overall balance (excl.
grants) was not met due to historically high levels of donor flows designed to mitigate the
impact of the global economic downturn.

III. PROGRAM PERFORMANCE
8.

Performance under the PSI has been satisfactory.



All quantitative assessment criteria and structural benchmarks under the PSI
program for end-June 2010 were met (MEFP Tables 1 and 2). The indicative
target on domestic debt of the public sector was missed at end-June, as the
government had to issue Treasury bills to ease its tight cash flow due to late donor
disbursements. The debt is expected to be repaid soon as donor funds have already
been disbursed.



Structural reforms are broadly on track. Notably, public financial management
has continued to improve with the rollout of core modules of the Integrated Financial
Management Information System (IFMIS/Smartgov) to 94 agencies, while revenue
administration has been strengthened with the Rwanda Revenue Authority (RRA)
taking over the collection and audit functions of social security contributions. The
National Bank of Rwanda (NBR) has enhanced the effectiveness of monetary policy,
in particular by holding frequent meetings of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC),
backed by an improved communication strategy. Also at the NBR, an exchange rate
corridor framework was introduced as a transition measure toward greater exchange
rate flexibility. All structural benchmarks for July–September were met except for the
submission of an export diversification strategy to Cabinet. Although the draft export
strategy was available by the August benchmark date, it will be submitted to Cabinet
by end-January, pending incorporation of review by stakeholders. The authorities are
on track to meet most of the end-December 2010 structural benchmarks. The

15
submission to Cabinet of the medium-term debt strategy is now planned for endJanuary 2011 (originally planned for end-December 2010) owing to delays in hiring
consultants to assist with the strategy.

by a more business-friendly environment;
(ii) recovery in external demand; and (iii) a pick-up in credit to the private sector. The
outlook assumes a conservative implementation of the government’s investment strategy, in
view of the timing needed to secure the necessary financing.5 With the onset of recovery,
inflation is expected to pick up to 6 percent in 2011 from the exceptionally low levels
recorded in 2010, but should stabilize at 5 percent over the medium term, in line with
projected inflation in the region. The current account deficit in the near term is expected to
widen to 9 percent in 2011 due to higher imports for large investment projects, but is
projected to narrow down to about 4 percent over the medium-term.

10.
Rwanda’s economy has potential for higher growth. Staff analysis shows that
Rwanda’s economy could potentially grow at about 8½ percent over the medium term,
provided that (i) investment is scaled up significantly; (ii) productivity growth increases and
remains elevated; and (iii) there are no adverse shocks. 6 Achieving and maintaining this high
growth rate, however, is challenging and will require additional investments of some
US$200-400 million (or about 4-8 percent of GDP) annually over the medium-term, beyond
assumed investments in the baseline projections (Box 3).

5

Following some delays in 2010 in securing external financing, both FDI and external borrowing, the
government’s large investment projects (namely Rwandair, Kigali Convention Center, etc.) are expected to pick
up in 2011 once the external financing is secured. Thereafter capital spending as a share of GDP is projected to
return to trend levels.
6

See Appendix II.

16
11.
Risks to the outlook are on the downside, reflecting mainly slower pickup in
external demand and domestic credit. Donor flows are expected to remain strong, but
decline gradually over the medium term. Over the longer term, risks to potential growth
include lower levels of investment financing and smaller productivity gains than envisaged in
staff’s estimation of potential growth. There are also upside risks to inflation from higher
global food and fuel prices.
Authorities’ Views
12.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s views on the economic outlook,
although they viewed growth prospects as stronger, with low and manageable risks.
They noted that they expect growth in 2010 and 2011 to be higher than 7 percent,
underpinned by a much higher turn around in construction and services than projected by
staff. Looking ahead, they expect growth to accelerate at a faster pace, reaching 8 percent per
annum by 2014, just below the potential growth estimated by staff. The authorities’ higher
growth path is premised on fully securing the necessary financing, including by crowding in
the private sector, to implement their strategic investments.

Box 3. Sources of Rwanda’s Economic Growth1

Over the medium term, staff’s baseline
projections show economic growth stabilizing at
around 6.5 percent. The projection assumes a
conservative implementation of the government’s
strategic investments, and continued gains in
productivity (productivity gains peak at
2.2 percent in 2015 in the baseline).

There is potential for higher growth in Rwanda. The economy could potentially grow by
8.4 percent per annum, under a best case scenario of significantly higher private investment in
response to an enhanced business environment, and even higher productivity gains. Productivity gains
would have to reach close to 3 percent by 2015 to achieve the higher growth. The best case scenario
also assumes no adverse shocks.

13.
Staff and the authorities agreed that policy implementation should ensure
Rwanda emerge successfully from the global economic downturn. Although the economy
has rebounded, the recovery is still fragile and the global financial crisis may have set back
Rwanda’s progress in MDGs. The government has set ambitious objectives in a number of
areas―including sustaining 7–8 percent annual real GDP growth and achieving middleincome status by 2020―through removing infrastructure bottlenecks, raising agricultural
productivity, pursuing labor intensive growth, and deepening financial markets. The
authorities have prepared a preliminary progress report on their Economic Development and
Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS) 7 which shows some progress in social sectors,
including in education and skills development. However, they also point to binding
constraints such as low investment in key sectors, lack of statistical data for monitoring and
evaluation, and absence of a social protection strategy as hindering further progress in
EDPRS and MDGs.
14.
Accordingly, the authorities are implementing policies in several areas to firm
up the recovery in the short run and consolidate growth at a higher path over the
medium term. Policy discussions therefore focused on the following areas:


Unwinding Fiscal Stimulus Gradually



Mapping an Effective Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy



Strengthening Financial Stability while Deepening Financial Markets



Boosting Competiveness and Growth
B. Unwinding Fiscal Stimulus Gradually

15.
Following a large fiscal stimulus in 2009/10, fiscal policy remains somewhat
expansionary in FY 2010/11 to support the nascent recovery, with gradual fiscal
consolidation planned thereafter. After imparting a stimulus of about 2 percent of GDP
which increased the overall deficit (excl. grants) to 13.2 percent of GDP in 2009/10, the
overall deficit (excl. grants) in FY 2010/11 widens somewhat to 13.8 percent of GDP—a
fiscal impulse of about ½ percent of GDP. The overall fiscal deficit (incl. grants) would
widen by 3½ percent of GDP as external grants decline by an equivalent amount, reverting to
pre-crisis levels.8
16.
To maintain the small fiscal stimulus, spending remains somewhat elevated in
2010/11. Current spending remains unchanged at the 2009/10 level, but the composition of
7

EDPRS covers the 2008–12 periods and was issued to the IMF Board on February 14, 2008. The progress
report will be submitted to the IMF Board with the second PSI review.
8

Donor assistance in the 2009/10 was scaled up in order to mitigate the impact of financial crisis on Rwanda.

20
total spending is reoriented toward domestic capital investment, including energy, schools
construction, and irrigation in agriculture which are expected to have large fiscal multipliers.
The higher total spending requires a temporary increase in net domestic financing, given the
sizable decline in grants.9

Authorities’ Views
17.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to

next three years is premised on unwinding the higher spending levels of recent
years―0.2 percent of GDP annual average

prospect of declining grants and limited
-8
scope for domestic financing. Accordingly,
-10
over the next three years, the authorities are -12
-14
planning on narrowing the overall deficit
-16
(excl. grants) by 2.3 percent of GDP. The
2007
2008
2009
2010
2011
2012
projected fiscal unwinding in Rwanda is in
line with other countries in the region and elsewhere in Sub-Saharan Africa.
18.
Consistent with the gradual fiscal consolidation, the
MEFP ¶21-23
authorities are also targeting zero net domestic financing in
order to further anchor their medium-term fiscal objectives.
They noted that they would continue to implement fiscal policy with a view toward
generating fiscal space that is consistent with supporting growth and maintaining low
inflation, and keeping net domestic financing (NDF) at zero so as not to crowd out the
private sector. They also agreed with staff that the overall fiscal balance (incl. grants) would
continue to be monitored closely as the most comprehensive indicator of fiscal policy that
tracks debt dynamics.
19.
Looking ahead, they intend to strengthen their
MEFP ¶23,25
medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF) and the effectiveness
of the fiscal anchor. The MTEF will be strengthened further by
improving costing of government spending plans, informed by ongoing Public Expenditure
Reviews (PERs). They noted that while the annual budget is cast within a three-year rolling
macro-fiscal framework, better fiscal projections in the outer two years of the framework―in
particular, projection of general budget support grants and enhancing coverage of project
grants―should enhance the credibility of fiscal policy and highlight the role of net domestic
financing as the fiscal anchor. They agreed that their new medium-term debt strategy―to be
submitted to Cabinet by end-January 2011―would also aid in defining a level of net
domestic financing that is consistent with the development of domestic capital market with
longer-dated debt instruments. To further strengthen the MTFF and anchor fiscal
expectations, the authorities will publish on the website of the Ministry of Finance quarterly
reports on budget execution, starting in the first half of 2011 (new structural benchmark), and
intend to combine these reports in the future with a mid-year update of the macro-fiscal
framework.

22
Domestic Revenue Mobilization
20. A lower revenue outlook for 2010/11 has prompted the
authorities to revise the 2010/11 budget, to be submitted to
MEFP ¶7, 20
the parliament by December 2010. Revenue shortfalls for the
fiscal year, estimated at Rwf 8½ billion (0.2 percent of GDP), are mainly due to lower trade
taxes and corporate income taxes. The decline in trade taxes appears to be permanent, as
larger-than-expected shifts in imports from the East African Community (EAC) and
COMESA (Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa), at lower duties, have reduced
import duties and other applicable taxes, a phenomenon that has been observed since July
2009. On the other hand, the lower-than-expected revenues from corporate income taxes are
deemed to be temporary, reflecting losses incurred by companies in 2009. So far, the
authorities have responded to the revenue shortfall by identifying equivalent cuts in non
priority spending, leaving intact net domestic financing at Rwf 80 billion (2.3 percent of
GDP).10
21.
In the meantime, the authorities have also applied for EU-COMESA grants
which would compensate Rwanda for revenues losses from trade liberalization. The
authorities correctly excluded receipts of such grants when they formulated the 2010/11
budget, but have contingency plans to fully spend these grants, if received. In light of the
high level of net domestic financing and the government’s policy of limiting crowding out of
the private sector, staff considers early repayment of the expensive domestic debt as a better
strategy than restoring the expenditures that are identified for cuts in the revised budget.
22.
To support the planned fiscal consolidation, a policy change is needed in
response to a permanent decline in revenues from trade taxes. This could include
stronger revenue administration measures than originally envisaged in the PSI as well as
possible tax policy measures. To this end, staff recommended frontloading some tax
administration measures, including by (i) bringing forward fully automating services of the
RRA District Offices, originally planned for March 2011; (ii) accelerating the audit and
collection of social security taxes by the RRA; and (iii) expediting collection of tax arrears
through the Standard Integrated Government Tax Administration System (SIGTAS),
originally planned for December 2010.
Authorities’ Views
23.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to domestic
MEFP ¶20
revenue mobilization―a centerpiece of the PSI program. They
acknowledged that the original goal to increase domestic revenue
mobilization by 1.4 percent of GDP for 2010/11 is no longer achievable, given the
unexpected revenue shortfalls. Nevertheless, they considered the revised 1.1 percent of GDP
10

Expenditure cuts are concentrated in goods and services, transfers, as well as capital investment.

23
revenue target as sufficiently frontloaded and ambitious compared to the original target. The
authorities also noted that at present they are not considering any tax policy measures, but did
not rule out future reforms in this area. To this end, they have requested a tax policy TA
mission from FAD. While they agreed with the thrust of staff’s proposed frontloading of tax
administration measures, they preferred to maintain their time table of the planned tax
administration measures, but step up their efforts for the remainder of the year to further
broaden the tax base, intensify the collection of tax arrears and expedite risk-based auditing
of large and medium-size tax payers.
PFM reforms
24.
Rwanda has made significant progress in PFM reforms. Since 2007, progress has
been achieved in the adoption of best practices in procurement policies, better monitoring
and containment of payment arrears, and improved transparency of tax payer obligations and
liabilities. The 2010 preliminary Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA)
assessment indicates significant increases in PFM scores in many other areas, reflecting in
part progress from a low base since the 2007 PEFA assessment. However, in staff’s view,
weaknesses persist in several PFM areas, including: regular dissemination of key fiscal
information, assessment of fiscal risks of state-owned enterprises, multi-year fiscal planning,
as well as coverage and recording of project grants.
Authorities’ Views
25.
The authorities agreed with the PEFA assessment. They noted
that the higher PEFA scores reflect their progress in PFM reforms over
MEFP ¶26
the past three years, including improvements in the legal framework for
budget preparation and legislative oversight of the budget. Looking forward, the authorities
are further deepening their PFM reforms, drawing on the PEFA assessment as well as their
continued partnership with the donor community and the IMF’s East AFRITAC.
C. Mapping an Effective Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
26.
The NBR pursued an accommodative monetary policy stance to support growth
while inflation reached a historic low. Despite repeated cuts in the policy rate and lowering
of reserve requirement on bank deposits, commercial banks’ lending rates remained
stubbornly high. Staff analysis of monetary transmission mechanism shows that interest rate
pass-through is weak in Rwanda, especially compared to its peers (Kenya, Tanzania and
Uganda) which have deeper financial markets (Box 4). Despite NBR’s monetary easing,
credit growth has been slow to respond as banks seem to have responded by boosting their
excess reserves rather than lending. However, the recent increase in loan approval by banks, a
leading indicator of future movements in credit to the private sector, is encouraging. Credit
growth is expected to increase from a mere 6 percent at end-December 2009 to just over
10 percent by December 2010. Looking ahead to 2011, given the projected net credit to the

24
government, reserve money is expected to grow somewhat faster than nominal GDP,
accommodating growth in credit to the private sector of about 22 percent, as the recovery
takes hold.
Authorities’ views
27.
The authorities concurred with staff on the need to
MEFP ¶31-32
maintain the current accommodative monetary policy stance,
but they noted that they will continue monitoring inflationary pressures and take
actions if needed. They attributed the low inflation in 2010 to a number of factors, including
the global disinflationary trend, a relatively stable exchange rate, modest increases in
monetary aggregates, as well as a good harvest that kept domestic food prices low. With the
expectation of a continued economic recovery and a pickup in credit to the private sector,
they did not anticipate continued low inflation in 2011 and agreed with staff that inflation is
likely to edge up to 6 percent at end-2011, up from a projected 4.6 percent at end-2010.
28.
The NBR has become more proactive than in the past in conducting monetary
policy. The quarterly MPC meetings and development of high-frequency data now allow the
NBR to respond more quickly to prospective shifts in aggregate demand, aggregate supply
and liquidity conditions. The authorities acknowledged that further enhancement in
forecasting liquidity and monetary operations are needed to better control reserve money
growth. Accordingly, they look forward to the forthcoming TA in the area provided by MCM.
29.
The authorities agreed that, as in the other low income countries, it would be a
challenge to strengthen the monetary transmission mechanism in Rwanda. They expect
lending rates to decline early next year, commensurate with the expected declines in costs of
attracting deposits. They expect monetary transmission to strengthen over time with further
deepening of the financial sector and increasing competition in the banking system.
Exchange Rate Policy
30.
Exchange rate flexibility should be further enhanced to reflect market
fundamentals and to support the objective of maintaining low and stable inflation. To
achieve this, the NBR would need to build the capacity to determine when to intervene and
re-base the exchange rate corridor, in line with changes in economic fundamentals and
subordinate open market operations in the foreign exchange market to reserve money anchor.
Authorities’ views
31.
The NBR will continue to use an appropriate mix of
MEFP 33-35
monetary policy instruments, including the sale of foreign
exchange to banks, to support the objective of maintaining inflation at low levels. They
noted that the exchange rate has moved more since the introduction of the corridor earlier
this year than during the entire year 2009. With assistance from MCM, the NBR intends to

25
further refine the exchange rate corridor which will permit greater exchange rate flexibility
that reflects market fundamentals. To reinforce the operation of the corridor further, the NBR
intends to remove the current average reference rate (ARR) and introduce market-based
customer buying and selling rates (new structural benchmark).

Box 4. Monetary Transmission Mechanism in Rwanda
Bank lending rates in Rwanda remain high
and persistent, despite fluctuations in central
bank policy rate. Deposit rates and treasury-bill
rates have declined since their local peak in July
2009.

30

Interest rate pass-through (from policy rate to
lending rate) is weak in Rwanda, but strong in
Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. A bivariate VAR
model reveals that a 100 basis point (BPS) increase
in the National Bank of Rwanda’s (NBR) policy
rate renders a 2 BPS increase in bank lending rates
in the long-run. While a similar increase in
Uganda’s and Tanzania’s policy rates pushes up
lending rates by 44 BPS and 32 BPS, respectively.
The long run pass through in Kenya is complete (a
100 basis point increase), exceeding the rest of the
EAC.

Short-run responses are smaller, but similar
across Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya, and nonexistent in Rwanda. For instance, a 100 BPS
increase in the Central Bank of Kenya Rate yields a
19 BPS increase in lending rates in the short run,
but a 100 basis point increase in the long run.
Changes in deposit rates strongly respond to
changes in lending rates in Kenya and Tanzania,
where financial markets are relatively deeper and
well structured, but not in Rwanda. Deposit rates in
Rwanda tend to be sticky and spread between
lending and deposit rates tend to widen with
changes in lending rates.
Weak monetary transmission mechanism:
To mitigate tight liquidity in 2009, the NBR
lowered its required reserves ratio from 8 to
5 percent in February 2009. Banks seem to have
responded by simply boosting their excess reserves
though demand for credit may have slowed down at
the same time due to lower economic growth
following the global recession.

D. Strengthening Financial Stability while Deepening Financial Markets
32.
The banking sector generally remains sound, profitable, and well capitalized.
However, banks have been cautious in resuming lending to the private sector, reflecting in
part their attitude towards elevated risks following the tight liquidity conditions in 2008–
2009, even though internal NBR stress test show that banks’ capital would be resilient to a
further deterioration in loan portfolio. High turnover of trained bank examiners continues to
weaken the supervisory capacity at the NBR, and remains a potential source of vulnerability
in the financial sector.
33.
The authorities are taking steps to improve access to finance. Among the EAC,
Rwanda has the lowest financial market depth as measured by either the ratio of private
sector credit to GDP or bank deposits to GDP. Survey results also show that some 80 percent
of the population, mostly in the rural areas, does not have formal access to financial products.
The authorities recently granted licenses to some 400 Savings and Credit Cooperatives
(SACCOs) to operate as deposit-taking institutions, with a view to grant them lending
licenses as well.

A Kenyan media group was cross listed on the Rwanda over the counter equity market in November 2010.

34.
There is need to increase access to finance, particularly to reach the large
unbanked segments of the population. However, the accelerated pace in expanding the
reach of micro finance institutions (MFIs) and SACCOs, is a cause for concern in light of the
high and growing non-performing loans in the sector, as well as capacity constraints at the
NBR and other institutions to supervise these financial institutions. A rapid scaling up of
these financial institutions, especially in granting licenses to lend―without first putting the
necessary supervisory capacity in place―increases the risk of non-performing loans and loss
of deposits, defeating the purpose of expanded financial inclusion. A forthcoming Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) update (planned for early 2011) is expected to review
the current licensing policy for both banks and non-bank financial institutions.

28
Recommendations from the FSAP would form a basis for a possible policy reform of the
licensing policy of the NBR.
Authorities’ views
MEFP ¶37-39

35.
The authorities view financial deepening as important
while taking steps to address limited supervision capacity. They noted that they cannot
deny lending licenses to SACCOs once they meet the minimum standards, but have not fully
developed plans on direct supervision or delegated monitoring of MFIs and SACCOs. The
NBR is taking steps to build supervisory capacity and stem the high turnover of experienced
bank examiners, including by revamping its compensation scheme and training plans. The
authorities welcomed the FSAP update as it will help design an action plan to increase
financial inclusion while limiting financial vulnerabilities.

be assessed among the top reformers in the
2011 World Bank Doing Business rankings
(Figure 9). Nevertheless, many challenges remain to narrow Rwanda’s large trade gap. The
authorities have a draft export diversification strategy to broaden the export base beyond the
traditional exports of tea, coffee, and minerals. To attract private investment, the strategy
proposes subsidies, tax incentives and exemptions. The authorities are also implementing an
ambitious investment strategy to address infrastructure bottlenecks, including in transport
and energy, for which they may seek additional non-concessional financing, including public
private partnerships (PPP), in the near term.
Exports of goods and services
Imports of goods and services

Authorities’ views
37.
The authorities are taking a cautious approach to granting tax
MEFP ¶24
exemptions and are mindful of fiscal risks associated with PPPs. They
noted that they would weigh possible adverse effects of tax incentives on their domestic
revenue mobilization efforts. They also noted that although the PPP unit is housed at the
Rwanda Development Board (RDB), the one-stop shop for investors, the Ministry of Finance
will fully assess fiscal risks associated with any PPPs before taking any decisions.

29

Box 5. Exchange Rate Assessment and External Competitiveness
Staff estimates using three complementary approaches suggest that the Rwandan franc is broadly in
line with economic fundamentals but with modest overvaluation in recent years. The estimates are
based on the macroeconomic balance (MB) approach, the external sustainability approach (ES), and the
equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) approach.

an estimated current account elasticity
of -0.46, a real effective exchange rate depreciation of 3.2 percent would be required to close the gap
between the “norm” and the underlying current account deficit.
Exchange Rate Valuation Assessment
(in percent)

External Sustainability: With a projected negative net international investment position of about
45 percent of GDP, the net foreign liability stabilizing current account deficit was estimated at 4.6 percent
of GDP, and given a current account elasticity of -0.46, a real effective exchange rate depreciation of
about 0.5 percent would be required to close the gap.
Equilibrium real exchange rate: Approaches that model the real exchange rate directly suggest that in
general the real exchange rate has broadly been close to its equilibrium level. However, for 2009; the
model suggests a potential currency overvaluation of about 11.4 percent. The real exchange rate
overvaluation for 2010 is likely to be lower than the 11.4 percent in 2009, given that the actual real
exchange rate has depreciated by 6 percent through September 2010, and the likely shift in equilibrium
based on developments in the macroeconomic fundamentals.
Rwanda has made important strides to improve competitiveness. The World Bank’s Doing Business
2011 report ranks Rwanda 58th out of 183 and notes that the country remains among the top global
reformers.1 The Global Competitiveness Report 2010-2011 ranks Rwanda fifth in sub-Saharan Africa
(SSA), and 80th out of 139 countries overall. 2 Notable improvements in recent years include improving the
ease of starting and closing a business, registering property, trading across borders, and investor protection.
While Rwanda compares favorably to its peers in the East-African Community (EAC) and SSA, areas
where additional progress is needed include infrastructure, financial development, health and poverty,
education, and innovation. A survey in the Global Competitiveness Report about perceptions of doing
business listed access to finance, taxation, infrastructure, and education as the most problematic for
Rwanda. While some of these are also constraints on business activity in other EAC countries, access to
finance is considered a bigger problem in Rwanda while corruption and the efficiency of the government
are considered more problematic in other EAC countries.

V. STATISTICAL ISSUES
38.
Substantial progress has been made in compilation and dissemination of
economic statistics, but weaknesses remain in the area of national accounts and balance
of payment statistics. In the area of national accounts, notable improvements include the
disseminating quarterly GDP estimates, updating the household expenditure survey, and
revising the methodology for conducting ex-ante and ex-post agricultural crop assessments.
The ex-post agricultural survey is planned to be used for the upcoming 2011 season A crop
(new structural benchmark). As an interim measure to improve agricultural statistics,
informal ex-post agricultural visits were conducted in 2009 and the first half of 2010 to
corroborate the pre-harvest survey. For 2010, this resulted in a significant downward revision
in the growth rate of agricultural output. The 2010/11 budget has also allocated more
resources to the national statistics office. In other areas, surveys of cross-border trade have
strengthened balance of payments statistics but lack of quarterly BOP statistics hampers
analysis of external trade performance and compilation of national accounts statistics.
Despite recent improvements, weaknesses remain in the methodology of national accounts,
including lack of a comprehensive economy-wide enterprise survey, the need to establish
robust relationship between ex-ante and ex-post agricultural crop yields and uncertainty
surrounding the size of the informal sector.
VI. PROGRAM ISSUES
39.
The program risks may have elevated somewhat, notwithstanding the authorities’
commitment to their program. The main risk includes further deterioration in the revenue
outlook beyond the level that is already incorporated in the revised FY 2010/11 budget.
40.
The appended Letter of Intent and accompanying Memorandum of Economic
and Financial Policies (MEFP) outlines the authorities’ policy objectives for the
remainder of 2010/11. Quantitative assessment criteria and indicative targets and structural
benchmarks for end-June 2011 are shown in Tables 1 and 2 of the MEFP. The updated
MEFP includes three additional structural benchmarks in fiscal, exchange rate policy and
statistics for the period ending in June 2011.
41.
The updated TMU includes some changes and modifications to the assessment
criteria for end-December 2010 relative to the last staff report (IMF Country Report
No. 10/200) and establishes assessment criteria for end-June 2011. The updated changes
are as follows:


The adjustors for net foreign assets and net domestic financing have been revised to
keep pace with the size of delays in donor grants which have grown over time in
Rwanda. This adjustment would allow the authorities greater flexibility in smoothing

33
government spending, addressing temporary cash flow problems and maintaining
prudent reserves.


Reserve money targets have been better aligned with seasonalities in currency in
circulation. This would help the authorities manage repo operations in advance,
thereby aiding in a better control over reserve money, which is the anchor for
monetary policy.



For program purposes, the domestic debt―an indicative target under the
PSI―excludes debt issued by the NBR for monetary policy purposes. This change
removes interference of the cap on domestic debt limit with the central bank’s ability
to effectively mop up excess liquidity to achieve its inflation objective. The proceeds
from the sale of central bank debt would stay in a blocked account at the NBR and
not available for budgetary financing.



In line with the Fund’s new debt limit policy, one state-owned commercial bank is
now excluded from the debt limit under the PSI, on the grounds that the bank poses
little fiscal risk since it has no history of receiving government transfers. This change
would allow the bank to borrow on non-concessional terms without seeking or being
granted a government guarantee. The authorities also requested a second bank be
excluded, the national development bank. The mission considered that this bank did
not qualify for exclusion on the grounds that it poses fiscal risks, including because it
lacks an independent management board and regularly receives budgetary transfers
and tax exemptions. The authorities did not share the staff’s assessment and noted
that the Fund’s policy on exclusions was not sufficiently flexible to allow for countryspecific circumstances, including that the Rwanda government has no history of
interfering in the operations of state-owned banks.

VII. STAFF APPRAISAL
42.
The economic outlook is favorable, but downside risks remain. Over the short to
medium-term, growth is driven by: (i) the government’s investment strategy, supported by a
more business-friendly environment; (ii) recovery in external demand; and (iii) pick-up in
credit to the private sector. Risks to the outlook remain on the downside, reflecting slowerthan-expected pick-up in external demand and in domestic credit.
43.
Rwanda has achieved high growth and macroeconomic stability over the last
decade. Rwanda’s resiliency to external shocks has improved further, thanks to prudent
policies, substantial debt relief, and heavy reliance on concessional borrowing.
44.
Sustained labor-intensive growth is needed to reduce poverty, which remains
high. Removing infrastructure bottlenecks is a step in the right direction. Increase in

34
agricultural productivity could generate sustainable employment for a large segment of the
population who live in rural areas.
45.
The recent implementation of countercyclical fiscal and monetary policies to
mitigate the impact of the global economic downturn is a welcome departure from the
procyclical policies of the past. The authorities should build on this momentum to enhance
their capacity to implement countercyclical policies in the future.
46.
The authorities’ medium-term path toward fiscal consolidation is welcomed.
After a large stimulus in 2009/10, a further though much smaller stimulus in 2010/11 seems
to be appropriate as it further supports the nascent recovery. Looking ahead, fiscal
consolidation is anchored on: (i) gradually reducing spending, while protecting priority
spending in line with poverty reduction strategy; (ii) boosting domestic revenues through tax
administration while addressing shortfalls in trade taxes. Tax policy reforms should also be
considered in the future in order to support the authorities’ domestic revenue mobilization
efforts.
47.
The medium term fiscal framework needs to be strengthened further. Important
steps include: better costing of government spending plans in the MTEF, better alignment of
projected external grants with a level of NDF that is informed by a MTDS, as well as
continued commitment to quarterly dissemination of fiscal data and fiscal strategy which
would anchor fiscal expectations.
48.
Reforms of PFM and debt management capacity and expenditure rationalization
need to be implemented vigorously. These include implementing well designed public
investment projects and their monitoring, improving the coverage of project grants, and
enhancing the overall capacity to assess the costs and benefits of scaled-up nonconcessional
financing, including fiscal risks associated with the PPPs.
49.
The monetary transmission mechanism needs to be strengthened. This includes
strengthening monetary operations of the NBR, enhancing exchange rate flexibility, creating
an active interbank market and deepening the financial markets. Although some of these
reforms are expected to gradually strengthen the interest rate pass-through, the NBR should
continue to use its reserve money as the anchor in conducting monetary policy while using
changes in its policy rate to strengthen its signaling role and interest rate pass through.
Development of an active debt market with longer-dated debt instruments would be a
welcome step as it creates a yield curve for the monetary authorities to shape inflation
expectations. However, progress in this direction requires a demonstrated need for ongoing
government financing requirement― anchored in the government’s MTDS as well as asset
and liability management―and a secondary market that provides a benchmark for
government debt instruments of varying maturities.
50.
The NBR’s MPC decision process and review of financial stability should be
further enhanced by a sustained scaling up of analytical support. The authorities should

35
build up the necessary expertise to provide analytical support for the MPC and monitor the
implementation of the new exchange rate framework. The authorities should continue
reforms (with assistance from MCM) toward greater exchange rate flexibility to enhance
monetary policy effectiveness and ensure that exchange rate responds to movements in
economic fundamentals. Further analytical work on financial stability aspects of the NBR’s
semi-annual policy statement could also benefit from the FSAP Update mission planned for
early 2011.
51.
The NBR should develop an action plan that trains and retains staff for the
banking supervision department. A transitional plan is needed to mitigate financial sector
vulnerability while waiting for the FSAP Update to take up the issue in early 2011.
52.
Deepening access to finance matters for growth and poverty reduction. However,
the decision to grant license to lend to over 400 SACCOs and MFIs should take into account
the limited supervision capacity at the NBR and other institutions. Recommendations on
requirements for NBR’s lending licenses for SACCO’s and MFIs should await the outcome
of the upcoming FSAP Update.
53.
The real exchange rate is broadly in line with the fundamentals, although
Rwanda is still an expensive place to do business. Improvements in business climate,
infrastructure, and skills mix and education of the labor force are key to lowering the cost of
doing business. Public investment in these areas would therefore be preferable to granting tax
exemptions to investors, since the latter could jeopardize fiscal sustainability.
54.
Further improvements in national accounts and balance of payments statistics
are needed. Specifically, efforts are needed to develop a comprehensive economy-wide
enterprise survey to reduce uncertainty surrounding the size of the informal sector.
55.
Staff recommends completion of the first PSI review and modification of the
assessment criteria for end-December 2010 under the PSI based on Rwanda’s
performance and the strength of the program.
56.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place within
24 months, subject to the provisions of the decision on consultation cycles in program
countries.

APPENDIX I
LETTER OF INTENT
Kigali, Rwanda
December 4, 2010

Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, N.W.`
Washington, D.C., 20431
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn,
1.
The attached Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) reviews recent
economic developments in Rwanda and implementation of Rwanda’s economic program under
the three-year Policy Support Instrument (PSI), which was approved by the IMF Executive
Board on June 17, 2010. The attached MEFP is an update of the previous MEFP and sets out
policies and programs the Rwandan government intends to implement for the rest of the fiscal
year 2010/11. The PSI will expire on June 29, 2013.
2.
All quantitative assessment criteria and structural benchmarks under the PSI program for
end-June 2010 were met. The indicative target on domestic debt of the public sector was missed
at end-June, as the government had to issue Treasury bills to ease its tight cash flow due to late
donor disbursements. The debt is expected to be repaid soon as donor funds have already been
disbursed.
3.
Structural reforms are broadly on track. Notably, public financial management has
continued to improve with the rollout of core modules of Integrated Financial Management
Information System (IFMIS/Smartgov) to 94 agencies, while revenue administration has been
strengthened with the Rwanda Revenue Authority taking over the collection and audit functions
of social security contributions. The National Bank of Rwanda (NBR) has enhanced the
effectiveness of monetary policy, in particular by holding frequent meetings of the Monetary
Policy Committee (MPC), backed by an improved communication strategy. Also at the NBR, an
exchange rate corridor framework was introduced as a transition measure toward greater
exchange rate flexibility. All structural benchmarks for July–September were met except for the
submission of an export diversification strategy to Cabinet. Although the draft export strategy
was available by the August benchmark date, it will be submitted to Cabinet by end-January
2011, pending incorporation of comments from stakeholder discussions. The government is on
track to meet most of the end-December 2010 structural benchmarks. The submission to Cabinet
of the medium-term debt strategy is now planned for end-January reflecting delays in hiring
consultants to assist with the strategy.

45
4.
In light of the satisfactory program implementation and performance and additional
reforms and policies outlined in the attached MEFP, the government requests completion of the
first review of the PSI.
5.
The Government is requesting modifications to the Assessment Criteria for end
December 2010 approved under the original PSI in June 2010 (IMF Country Report No. 10/200)
to take into account delays in donor budget support disbursements, observed seasonalities in
currency in circulation, and the exclusion of the central bank’s monetary policy instruments from
the domestic debt definition as this could prevent an effective mopping up of excess liquidity to
achieve our inflation objective. The proposed changes are therefore as follows: (i) modifications
to the adjusters on net foreign assets (NFA) of the central bank and net domestic financing
(NDF) to keep pace with the size of delays in donor grants which have grown over time; (ii)
modifications to the definition of reserve money targets to better align to seasonalities in
currency in circulation; (iii) modifications to consolidated domestic debt limit to exclude debt
issued by the central bank for monetary policy purposes in order to allow it to effectively mop up
excess liquidity and achieve its inflation objective; and (iv) modifications to exclude one stateowned bank (Banque de Kigali (BK)) that poses little fiscal risk from the debt limit under the
PSI to allow the bank to borrow on non-concessional terms with long maturities for on-lending
to small- and-medium size firms, and address balance sheet maturity mismatches. The details of
the modifications are in the attached TMU.
6.
The Government requested that a second bank, Banque Rwandaise de Développement
(BRD) also be excluded from the debt limit under the PSI. Fund staff after assessing the bank
decided that the Bank currently cannot be excluded from the debt limit mainly because it
currently poses some fiscal risk as well as the absence of a sufficiently independent Board. The
Government however is of the view that BRD should qualify for exclusion as explained in the
attached MEFP. The Government’s position is strengthened by the fact that BRD has remained
operationally independent from Government and has operated for several years without recourse
to government guarantee. It also has a good past record in managing external credit lines.
It does not therefore pose any fiscal risk on the Government’s budget. It is on these grounds that
we request that the Fund reconsider the exclusion of BRD in the forthcoming PSI review.
7.
The Government believes that the policies and measures set forth in the attached
Memorandum are adequate to achieve the objectives of the PSI-supported program for the
remaining months of the fiscal year. The Government remains committed to these objectives,
and will take prompt actions and additional measures necessary for their achievement. The
Government will consult with the IMF—at its own initiative or whenever the Managing Director
of the IMF requests such a consultation—before the adoption of any such measures or changes to
the policies described in the attached Memorandum.
8.
The Government will provide the Fund with such information as the Fund may request in
connection with the progress made in implementing the economic and financial policies and

46
achieving the objectives of the program. It is expected that the second review will take place
before end-June 2011, and the third review will also take place before end-December 2011.
9.
The Government of Rwanda authorizes the publication and distribution of this letter, its
attachments, and all reports prepared by the Fund staff, which also includes the Article IV
consultation report.
Sincerely yours,

Attachment I. Rwanda: Memorandum of Economic and
Financial Policies
December 4, 2010
UPDATE
1. In this updated Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP), the
Government of Rwanda remains committed to achieving sustained economic growth and
poverty reduction. The strategies to achieve these goals are set out in the Economic
Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS) for 2008–121 and Rwanda’s Vision
2020. To this end, the Government and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are
cooperating on a three-year Policy Support Instrument (PSI) to support macroeconomic
policies and structural reforms that underlie strategies in the EDPRS.
2. This MEFP reviews performance during 2009/10 and the first quarter of the fiscal year
2010/11 and describes policies and targets for remainder of 2010/11 and the medium term.
I.

Performance under the PSI

3. At end June 2010, all quantitative assessment criteria have been met (Table 1). In the
case of the indicative targets, all but one target was met. The ceiling on the stock of
consolidated domestic debt of the public sector was missed due to delays in disbursement of
budgetary grants (World Bank) and the necessity to sell more debt instruments to finance
priority expenditures. The debt is expected to be repaid soon as donor funds have already been
disbursed. All structural benchmarks were met for end-June (Table 2). Structural benchmarks
for July–September have also been met except for the submission of an export diversification
strategy to Cabinet. Although the draft export strategy was available by the August
benchmark date, it will be submitted to Cabinet by end-January 2011 pending further review
by stakeholders. The authorities are on track to meet the end-December 2010 structural
benchmarks.
Growth
4. After a somewhat slower growth in 2009 reflecting the impact of the global financial
crisis and the tight liquidity experienced in the country, a slight recovery has taken place in
2010. Real GDP growth is projected at 6.5 percent in 2010. Growth is led by agriculture
especially food crops which continue to benefit from the large investments in fertilizer,
1

Rwanda’s latest EDPRS (IMF Country Report No. 08/90) and Joint Staff Advisory Note (IMF Country Report No.
08/91) were issued to the Executive Board on February 14, 2008. A progress report will be issued to the IMF Board
before the second PSI review.

48
improved seeds and extension services under our Crops Intensification Program. Growth in
the industrial sector was led by manufacturing especially food processing, electricity, gas and
water as well as construction. In the case of electricity, gas, and water, this sub sector
continues to benefit from the ongoing investments by the Government. The recovery in
construction was mainly due to the resumption of credit to this sub sector as well as
completion of some public projects. The recovery in the services sector reflects the ongoing
improvements in financial services – finance and insurance-and the on-going investments in
communication as well as the recovery in tourism and trade.
Inflation
5. Driven by sustained good performance in domestic food production, decline in import
prices, stable exchange rate and limited growth of money supply, inflation has been
maintained at low levels in 2010 compared to the last two years. Furthermore, improvement in
fiscal and monetary policy management and coordination have continued to limit inflationary
pressures. Overall inflation dropped from 5.7 percent in December 2009 to 1.5 percent in
September 2010, and is expected to be below 5 percent at end-2010, well below the target of
7 percent projected for the year.
Fiscal Performance
6. Fiscal performance during FY2009/10 was on track as the net domestic finance target
was met. The 2009/10 overall fiscal deficit (including grants) was smaller than expected by
2.8 percent of GDP on account of higher revenues and lower spending. Domestic revenue
collections exceeded projections by about 0.7 percent of GDP on account of “one off
“collections of new motor vehicle registration tax at the beginning of the year. On the
expenditure side, total spending was slightly lower by about 2.2 percent of GDP due to lower
spending on foreign financed capital projects. This occurred because of delays in external loan
disbursements. Consistent with EDPRS objectives, the priority spending target was also met.
External grants were in line with the budget for 2009/10.
7. However, based on preliminary data for the first quarter of 2010/11 (July–September)
trade taxes and non-tax revenues fell short of projections in the PSI program, owing mainly to
a much larger-than-expected shift in imports from the EAC and COMESA and corresponding
reduced import duties and other applicable taxes, a trend which had already started in
January–June 2010. Lower revenues and grants contributed to a build-up of arrears, despite
lower-than-programmed spending.
8. Also during the first quarter of 2010/11, delays occurred in the disbursement of external
budget support grants by the World Bank. The short term financing gap was financed with the
issuance of short term debt to the commercial banks. As a result the stock of domestic debt
target at end June 2010 was slightly exceeded.

49
EDPRS implementation
9. The financial year 2009/2010 is the third financial year of implementing the EDPRS. By
end-2009, out of 383 policy actions that were assessed, 374 had been implemented; an
implementation rate of more than 97 percent. Many targets were exceeded and subsequently
revised upwards for future financial years. Notably, progress has been made to improve
infrastructure: 53.8 percent of national roads are now in good condition from a baseline of
11 percent in 2006; over the same period, electricity generation capacity has increased from
45MW to 84MW allowing an increase of 75 percent in the number of connections. Rwanda is
now on track to achieve health and education-related MDGs, including increasing the
coverage and the quality of basic and tertiary education, and strengthening technical and
vocational education and training. It has already achieved MDGs related to gender equality
and has also made good progress towards increasing access to water and sanitation for its
population. In the area of governance, satisfactory progress has been made in strengthening
PFM, justice, decentralization and citizen participation.
External Sector
10. The balance of payments is expected to end 2010 with a small deficit and reserves
coverage would be 4.6 months of imports. The trade deficit would increase but by less than
originally thought, as strong export performance is more than offset by additional imports.
The export rebound in 2010 is due mainly on account of strong performance in the coffee and
tea sectors, as their combined exports are expected to increase by about 40 percent compared
to 2009. Non-traditional exports are also performing well and the results of the Informal
Cross-Border Trade Survey, included for the first time in the export statistics, indicate a net
surplus for informal net exports. Mineral exports would be nearly unchanged from 2009 as
higher prices are offset by smaller export volumes. The tourism sector is rebounding from its
decline in 2009 though not yet to the extent as was expected. Imports in 2010 would increase
by about 20 percent compared to 2009 and be driven by higher imports of energy,
intermediate, and consumer goods. Imports of capital goods would be up only slightly for the
year and fall below expectations on account of slower-than-expected execution of a few large
investment projects. Progress with regional integration has resulted in a shift of imports; data
for January–June 2010 shows that the share of imports from EAC countries has increased to
32 percent when compared with 26 percent in the same period in 2009 and 25 percent in 2008.
As public and private current transfers would increase in 2010 and partly offset the higher
trade deficit, the current account deficit including grants would be about 7 percent of GDP in
2010 (against 7.9 percent of GDP programmed), which is slightly below the level in 2009. On
the financial side of the balance of payments, some plans to finance large projects are
expected to be finalized by the end of the year and its foreign investment component (foreign
direct investment and external borrowing) has been pushed back to 2011. The financial
account is also supported by private external borrowing, including in the telecommunications
to finance equipment and intermediate imports.

50
Monetary and Exchange rate Developments
11. In response to the domestic liquidity crisis which started in 2008, the NBR has
maintained an accommodative monetary policy stance in the last 18 months to boost liquidity
and support the expected turnaround in growth. The policy rate, which also serves as the key
repo rate, has been cut cumulatively by 200 basis points since November 2009. However,
commercial banks have maintained a cautious credit stance while enhancing their risk
management practices and loan recovery processes. As a result, growth in credit to private
sector has been slower than expected, as it is forecasted to increase by about 10 percent by end
2010, well below the 20 percent growth initially projected.
12. The introduction of the exchange rate corridor framework in July 2010 as a transitional
measure toward a market based exchange rate framework introduced more flexibility in the
movement of the foreign exchange market. The Rwandan franc depreciated by 3 percent
against the US dollar between April and August 2010, higher than the depreciation observed
in the entire 2009.
Financial sector
13. After a challenging year, the banking system in 2010 began to show clear signs of
recovery. In general, banks remain well capitalized, with strong solvency, liquidity and
improving asset quality which have increased public confidence in the banking sector. The
capital adequacy ratio of the banking system stood at 17.6 percent as of June 30, 2010, well
above the regulatory capital of 10 percent for Tier 1 capital and 15 percent for total Capital. A
slight upgrade in asset quality was observed through a decrease in nonperforming loans (NPL)
from 13.1 percent in December 2009 to 12.2 percent at end June 2010. Bank profitability also
increased. At end June, 2010 return on equity and return on assets increased respectively from
6.4 percent to 10.3 percent and from 0.9 percent to 1.3 percent compared to June 30, 2009.
14. In 2010, 6 on-site inspections are planned to be conducted of which 4 have already been
completed. In addition, 4 Banking Regulations were approved by September 2010, one of
which is loan classification and provisioning. The legal framework to operate a private credit
reference bureau has also been developed. The law on credit information system was passed
by the Parliament in May 2010 and a new private credit bureau, CRB Africa, was licensed in
May 2010 and launched in July 2010. Central Bank will oversee the operations of the duly
licensed credit bureau and will continue to sensitize the public on the importance of the credit
reference agencies and legal rights of consumers. The non-bank supervision department
conducted an onsite inspection of Caisse Sociale du Rwanda (CSR) in October 2010.
15. The NBR also adopted a number of regulatory and institutional reforms to further
strengthen the supervision of microfinance (MFIs) and non-bank financial institutions
(NBFI’s). Insurance regulations to implement the new insurance were finalized and published
in the Official Gazette in September 2010 and the last two regulations were approved by the
NBR’s Board of Directors in September 2010 and will be published in the Official Gazette

51
before end-December 2010. Regarding the MFIs, the NBR is implementing the new
regulatory guidelines. In line with the MFIs, NBR intensified on-site inspections depending
on the results of the off-site analysis and meetings with governing bodies of the MFIs with
deteriorating asset quality.
16. The Functional Specifications (FS) for the Automated Transfer System (ATS) has been
approved, hardware and software received and tested by BNR. The system for the backup site
has also been accepted and tested at BNR headquarters, and moved to the interim Disaster
Recovery site at Rwanda Development Board Information Technology (RDB IT) data centre.
The first phase of Rwanda Integrated Payments Processing System (RIPPS) software has been
received and customized to the Functional Specification agreed by BNR and full acceptance
testing of software carried out. The complete system will be up and running on schedule by
end June 2011.
17. The Electronic Transactions Law and the Central Securities Law were published in the
official gazette in May 2010. On the other hand, the regulation on Electronic Funds transfers
and Electronic money and the one governing payments and securities systems were passed by
the BNR board and waiting to be published in the official gazette by end December 2010.
Lastly, Guidelines on cards operations and an oversight framework are being drafted.
Statistical Issues
18. Efforts to improve the quality of national accounts are continuing. In October 2010,
the NISR disseminated its quarterly GDP estimates for the first and second quarters of 2010,
together with minor revisions of GDP estimates for 2008 and 2009. The NISR finalized the
design of Living Standards Measurement Questionnaire (EICV) as committed by the endSeptember structural benchmark. The 2010 household survey incorporating the finalized
questionnaire is to be conducted from November 2010 to October 2011. Progress has also
been made revising the methodology for conducting ex-ante and ex-post agricultural crop
assessments (to be finalized by end-Dec 2010). Starting with the 2011 season A crop, the
NISR are already using the preliminary revised ex-ante survey and will follow up with the
ex-post agricultural crop assessment starting with the season A crop.
II. Objectives and Policies Looking Forward
19. The outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year is in line with our Medium Term
Macroeconomic Framework and program objectives set out in our initial MEFP. Our
overriding objective is to sustain real GDP growth rates above 7 percent per year. Continued
macroeconomic stability is a necessary condition for meeting this challenge. Inflation is
targeted at 6 percent for end-2011 and stabilizing at 5 percent over the medium-term.

52
A. Fiscal Policy
20. The budget for fiscal year 2010/2011 has been revised for fiscal year 2010/11 to take
account of lower revenues offset by expenditures cuts, leaving the overall fiscal balance
(including grants) unchanged. The revised budget will be submitted to Parliament before
end-2010. The original targeted increase in domestic revenue mobilization of about 1.4% of
GDP (compared to 1.1 percent of GDP in the revised program) was based on a much faster
recovery of the monetized sector of the economy and an accelerated increase in revenue yield
from the implementation of the on-going administrative reforms. As a result of a slower
recovery together with larger than projected revenue loss from trade with the EAC and
COMESA region, and poor performance of profit taxes resulting from the financial crisis in
2009, total collections are now expected to be lower by about Rwf 8.5 billion (0.2 percent of
GDP). In order to compensate for the expected revenue shortfalls from trade taxes and
corporate taxes in 2010/11, the authorities will take additional efforts to collect revenues in
other areas, as well as continue to implement ongoing tax administration measures. Looking
forward, the authorities intend to request an FAD mission from the IMF to review tax policy.
The additional efforts for 2010/11 include:


Increase the number of taxpayers by 10 percent from 42,538 (end June 2010) through
end June 2011 as a result of collecting pension funds and using the Block Management
System which will boost tax collections including Income and VAT taxes.



Enforcement efforts shall be intensified to avoid aging of arrears and recover
collectible ones amounting to Rwf 8 billion by June 2011 compared to Rwf 6.5 billion
in the PSI program.



Start using risk-based audit planning, targeting high risk sectors and gives them a
priority to ensure that all large and half of the medium taxpayers sectors are current in
audit by end 2011.

21. Consistent with our policy of maintaining the net domestic finance at the same level as
originally programmed, we will offset the expected revenue shortfall with an expected
compensation from the EAC-Comesa Fund for revenue losses for 2009/10 (US$ 14 million or
about Rwf 8 billion). In case the compensation is not realized, the revised 2010/11 budget will
include identified contingent expenditure cuts in non-priority areas amounting to 0.2 percent
of GDP (see Table below). The use of the government’s overdraft at NBR at the beginning of
2010 was considered one-off event related to delays in donor disbursements. We will continue
to use this facility again for cash flow purposes in future if there are delays in donor
disbursements. However we will give the retirement of such facility priority when the donor
funds are received.

22. For the remaining period of fiscal year 2010/2011, we expect some minor delays in the
disbursement of official external budget support grants. We will finance the temporary
shortfall in resources with short term debt instruments which will increase our domestic debt.
The stock of domestic debt (excluding T-bills issued for monetary policy purposes) at end of
fiscal year 2010/2011 is therefore expected to amount to Rwf 212.1 billion compared to Rwf
177.8 billion at end 2009.
23. Our budget for the medium term will be guided by our medium term expenditure
framework and our approach to prudent fiscal policy. Accordingly, we will aim to continue to
reduce the domestic finance requirements so that the private sector can lead economic growth
and poverty reduction. We expect to reach our objective of increasing revenue from
12.5 percent of GDP in 2009/10 to 14.3 percent of GDP by 2012/13, as estimated in the PSI
program, an important tool not only in securing resources for our development but also in
reducing our reliance on external budgetary grants.
24. Looking ahead, before granting tax exemptions in the context of the export development
strategy and PPPs, the government will carefully assess fiscal risks and any new tax incentives
will remain fully transparent in tax codes and investment codes. MINECOFIN will strengthen
capacity to assess the revenue losses of tax exemptions, in preparation for eventual inclusion
in annual budget documents. Also, the government will ensure that all fiscal risks of any
proposed PPPs are assessed, at an early stage, by MINECOFIN before any decision is taken.
The government is also committed to submit to Cabinet its medium-term debt strategy.
25. The government also intends to improve its communication strategy by preparing
quarterly budget execution reports, and publishing these on its website, within 45 days from
the end of each quarter (continuous structural benchmark). The budget execution reports will
include the central government operation table and an analysis of fiscal outturns against
annual fiscal objectives, with a view to eventually preparing bi-annual reports that also

54
analyze fiscal developments vis-à-vis medium-term fiscal objectives. This will help to ensure
transparency and accountability of public resources.
Public Financial Management
26. The PEFA assessment is near completion. The preliminary 2010 scores improved
significantly from the 2007 assessment (No indicator slipped back, the “A” scores increased
by more than 300 percent whilst the “D” scores declined by 45 percent) underpinned by the
existence of a clear and advanced legal framework particularly for budget preparation and
legislative scrutiny of the budget and improved compliance and oversight across the entire
public financial management cycle.
B. External Sector Policies
27. Consistent with our medium term growth objectives averaging more than 7 percent per
annum, our external current account deficit (excluding grants) which is estimated at about
7 percent of GDP at end 2010 will be expected to widen in 2011 to about 9.5 percent of GDP
before declining slightly in the medium term. Higher imports especially capital equipment for
some of the ongoing strategic investment projects and other consumer goods from the EAC
and COMESA region contribute to the higher imports figure in 2011. Total export receipts (in
US dollar terms) in the medium term are projected to rise slower than originally projected in
the PSI program on account of expected sluggish developments concerning world commodity
prices especially coffee, tea and minerals.
28. As a result, the balance of payments is projected to close in the medium term years with
small deficits which will be financed with some draw down of international reserves. As a
result, we expect gross official reserves to remain on average at a safe minimum coverage of 4
to 5 months of imports.
29. In the area of debt management, we will explore all avenues for concessional financing.
However given the large requirement of resources for the financing of our development
agenda, some non concessional financing will be necessary. We have already agreed to a
ceiling of US$240 million of non concessional borrowing during the PSI period for RwandAir
and the Kigali Conference Center (KCC).
30. Currently two state owned banks, Bank of Kigali (BK) and Banque Rwandaise de
Developpement (BRD) are holding discussions with the African Development Bank (AfDB)
and the Agence Francaise de Developpement (AFD) for non-concessional lines of credit
amounting to about US$55 million. These funds, when secured, would be used for on-lending
to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and others for long-term financing as well as
mitigating asset-liability maturity mismatch in the case of Bank of Kigali. In view of the fact
that both banks are performing well and have strong independent management as well as good
past record in managing external lines of credit, we request that they should be excluded from

55
the DSA definition. We wish to reiterate our position that these banks do not pose any fiscal
risk to the Central Government’s budget.
C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
31. To support the economic growth, the NBR will maintain the current accommodative
monetary policy stance going forward, but would continue to reassess the stance regularly to
ensure underlying inflationary pressures are well anchored. The NBR will also ensure that real
interest rates are kept positive to stimulate domestic savings mobilization and support the
financial deepening required for growth.
32. At the same time, the NBR is committed to keeping inflation low and stable over the
medium term. Inflation is projected at 4.6 percent in 2010, far below the 7 percent projected at
the beginning of the year. The NBR projects a slight pick-up in inflation in 2011 to about
6 percent, with the aim to return to 5 percent in 2012 and stabilize at that rate over the
medium-term. However, the risks of higher inflation remain due to uncertainties related to
exogenous shocks, including food and fuel prices. Broad money growth estimated at about
13 percent in 2010 is projected to grow further by about 13.8 percent in 2011, supported by a
strong recovery in growth in credit to the private sector by about 22.4 percent in 2011, up
from an estimated 11 percent in 2010.
33. NBR will continue to use appropriate mix of monetary policy instruments to manage the
liquidity in the banking system including reserve money targeting and the sale of foreign
exchange to banks to support the objective of maintaining inflation at low levels while at the
same time supporting growth. In addition, the NBR, with the assistance of TA from the IMF,
will further reform the foreign exchange rate market towards greater flexibility, and encourage
further deepening and development of the foreign exchange interbank market. The NBR will
also continue to closely monitor the behavior of the Rwf exchange rate vis-a- vis the
currencies of the major trading partners to limit the volatility of the real effective exchange
rate to ensure competitiveness and boost growth.
34. NBR will eliminate, by end January 2011 (structural benchmark), the Average Reference
Rate (ARR)—currently used as the NBR customer rate and for official accounting purposes.
Henceforth, NBR will operate with new buying and selling customer rates established as
margins on either side of the previous days’ closing market rate. The closing market rate is the
rate of the last market transaction—either between banks (i.e. interbank rate), or between
banks and the central bank (i.e. intervention rate)—of a given day. In the event of no market
transactions on a given day, the latest available closing market rate will prevail. For official
accounting purposes, NBR will use as the Official Rate, the mid-point of the NBR customer
buying and selling spread.
35. NBR will strengthen its capacity in economic analysis (including with technical
assistance from IMF MCM and by training experienced economists in key areas, including
(i) modeling inflation for policy simulations to provide analytical support to the Monetary

56
Policy Committee (MPC) decisions; (ii) to analyze and forecast developments in the balance
of payments; and (iii) build analytical capacity to assess economic fundamentals to determine
when to intervene and re-base the exchange rate corridor.
D. Financial Sector Reforms
36. The NBR will continue to promulgate laws to strengthen the regulation of the financial
sector. The pension law is expected to come into effect by end-March 2011. The two
companion laws, the new insurance contract law (approved by NBR Board in September 2010)
and the mandatory insurance law (still in the drafting process) are also expected to be passed
by the Parliament before end 2011. At the same time Parliament has on its agenda to pass the
law that governs the organization of collective investment schemes (CIS) by end 2010. These
laws are aimed at giving the necessary regulatory backing to the development of the domestic
capital markets in Rwanda. In addition, there are two other CMA draft laws expected to be
passed by the Parliament before end 2010.
37. The NBR has initiated the process of developing an action plan to revamp the general
capacity of its staff, particularly its supervision department by reviewing the general
compensation and professional development scheme. The NBR intends to submit to its Board,
by end-March 2011, an action plan to improve NBR’s compensation scheme and professional
development in order to strengthen improve staff motivation and increase staff retention. In
this regard, NBR is conducting a salary survey, which will be completed by end-March 2011.
38. The Banking Supervision Department is implementing its supervision program for 2010
with the assistance of senior bank examiners from the EAC central banks. Additionally, it
expects to get TA from IMF and World Bank over the period 2011–2012 to enhance capacity
of inspectors. NBR has a 2010–2011 comprehensive training program funded by the AfDB to
build capacity of bank examiners. The program includes attachments to more experienced
central banks and in-country training workshops. The NBR will also continue to hold joint
bank inspection exercises with senior inspectors from other EAC central banks. NBR is on
track to achieve at least 6 on-site inspections in 2010 with NBR staff (structural benchmark
for end-December 2010). This is in addition to continual off-site surveillance for all banks and
regular meetings with commercial bank management consistent with the risk based
supervision framework. It is believed that all these capacity building and staff motivation
initiatives will enable NBR to achieve the PSI objective of being able to conduct on-site
inspections for each bank at least once in every 24 month cycle. Furthermore, the Government
of Rwanda has requested for an FSAP update planned for early 2011 to advice on the
expansion of the financial inclusion while limiting its vulnerabilities. In addition, the FSDP
will be revised taking into account recommendations from the FSAP mission.
39. The NBR is taking steps to increase financial inclusion through NBFIs, while limiting its
vulnerabilities. The NBR is strengthening its capacity to supervise the recent rapid expansion
of MFIs, including some 416 UMURENGA SACCOs, including using Risk Based

57
Supervision (RBS) in some large MFIs by December 2011. This will encourage big viable
MFIs to upgrade to legal status of Micro-Finance Bank, and encourage Banks to expand their
branch network. We do expect that these initiatives will enable Rwanda to achieve the
objective of reaching a goal of 30 percent for financial inclusion by 2012, up from 21 percent
cited by the Finscope Rwanda 2008 survey.
E. Statistics
40. The NISR will continue to improve the quality of the national accounts, in accordance
with the improvement action plan of the national accounts. Using the revised methodology for
the ex-ante and ex-post agricultural crop assessments (structural benchmark, end-Dec 2010),
the NISR will begin conducting an ex-post crop assessments starting with the 2011
agricultural A season (SB end January 2011). The NISR also intends to update the metadata
for the GDDS, and submit it to the IMF for posting by the end of March 2011. The NISR will
also devote resources to hire economists to ensure consistency of its national accounts
statistics with macroeconomic developments.

issued in IMF Country Report No. 10/200.
I. Quantitative Program Targets
2.
The quantitative program will be assessed through assessment criteria (AC) and
indicative targets (IT) for the duration of the program.
3.
AC will apply to the following indicators for end-June and end-December (the test
dates) throughout the program period; other dates are IT:


Floor on stock of net foreign assets (NFA) of the National Bank of Rwanda (NBR);



Ceiling on stock of reserve money;



Ceiling on flow net domestic financing (NDF) of the central government;



Ceiling on contracting or guaranteeing of new nonconcessional external debt by the

IT targets apply to the following indicators throughout the program period:


Floor on flow domestic revenue collection of the central government;



Ceiling on flow net accumulation of domestic arrears of the central government;



Ceiling on stock of consolidated domestic debt of the public sector; and



Floor on flow priority spending.

5.
Assessment criteria on contracting or guaranteeing of new nonconcessional external
debt by the public sector and stock of external payment arrears of the public sector are
applicable on a continuous basis for the duration of the program.
6.

A. Institutional Coverage of the Fiscal Sector
7.
The central government fiscal operation table comprises the treasury and line
ministries, hereafter referred to as the government unless specified otherwise.
B. Targets related to the Execution of the Fiscal Program
Ceiling on net domestic financing of the government
8.
A ceiling applies to NDF, which is measured cumulatively from December 31, 2009
for June 30, 2010; December 31, 2010; and June 30, 2011. Other dates are indicative targets
9.
Definition. NDF of the government is defined as change in the sum of (i) net banking
sector credit to the government and (ii) non-bank holdings of the government domestic debt.
10.

Net banking sector credit to the government is defined as



credit to the government from the banking system (as recorded in the monetary
survey), including credit to the government, provinces and districts, outstanding
consolidated government debt held by the banking system,1 government debt to the
NBR incurred as a result of the 1995 devaluation (Rwf 9 billion), the overdraft to the
prewar government (Rwf 2 billion)2, and overdraft with the NBR. Credit to the
government will exclude treasury bills issued for monetary policy purposes by the
NBR, and the proceeds of which are sterilized in deposits held as other NBR
liabilities.

1

Consisting of bank holdings of treasury bills, bonds (domestic), old development bonds (pre-1994 debt), new
development bonds (including those used for recapitalization of banks), and other accounts receivables.

2

The authorities will inform Fund staff of any substantive changes in government accounts with the banking
system, which may affect the calculation of net bank claims.

62


minus total government deposits with the banking system (as recorded in the
monetary survey), including the main treasury account, line ministries, the fund for
assistance to genocide survivors, the Rwanda Revenue Authority, the electoral
commission, the demobilization commission, fonds routier, privatization account, and
any other autonomous public enterprises and public agencies over which the
government has direct control over their deposits. Thus, this definition excludes any
government deposits, over which the central government does not have any direct
control (i.e., for project accounts, counterpart funds and fonds publics affectés).

11.
Non-bank holdings of the government domestic debt consists of non-bank holdings of
treasury bills, bonds (domestic and nonresident), old development bonds (pre-1994 debt),
new development bonds (including those used for recapitalization of banks), and other
accounts receivables.
12.

Adjusters to the NDF:



The ceiling on NDF will be adjusted upward by the amount of any shortfall between
actual and programmed budgetary grants3(defined in Table 2 of Quantitative AC and
IT), up to a maximum adjustment of US$80 million, evaluated in Rwanda francs at
the program exchange rate. The ceiling will be adjusted downward by the amount of
any excess of actual over programmed budgetary grants above US$24 million,
evaluated in Rwanda francs at the program exchange rate.



The ceiling on NDF will be adjusted upward by the amount of expenditure for food
imports in the case of a food emergency.

13.
Reporting requirement. Data on NDF (showing separately treasury bills and
government bonds outstanding, other government debt, and central government deposits),
each type of debt to be shown by debt holder, and its adjusters will be transmitted on a
monthly basis within five weeks from the end of each month. Deposits of the government
with the NBR and with the commercial banks will be separated from the deposits of the
public enterprises and autonomous public agencies and agencies that the government does
not have any direct control over.
Domestic revenues
14.
Definition. The floor on domestic government revenue is defined as total government
revenue (tax and non-tax revenues), per the central government fiscal operation table, but
excluding external grants, and privatization receipts.

3

Budgetary grants exclude COMESA grants and HIPC grants.

63
15.
Reporting requirement. Detailed data on domestic revenues will be transmitted on a
monthly basis within five weeks of the end of each month.
Floor on priority expenditure
16.
The floor applies to priority spending of the government which is measured
cumulatively from December 31, 2009.
17.
Definition. Priority spending is defined as the sum of those recurrent expenditures,
domestically-financed capital expenditures, and net lending that the government has
identified as priority in line with the EDPRS. Priority expenditures are monitored through the
computerized SIBET expenditure management system which tracks priority spending of the
annual budget at the program level.
18.
Reporting requirement. Data on priority expenditure will be transmitted on a
monthly basis within five weeks of the end of each month.
Net accumulation of domestic arrears of the government
19.
A ceiling applies to net accumulation of domestic arrears of the government which is
measured cumulatively from December 31, 2009.4
20.
Definition. The net accumulation of arrears is defined as the difference between the
gross accumulation of new domestic arrears (measured as the difference between payment
orders and actual payments related to payment orders issued) and gross repayment of any
arrears outstanding on December 31, 2009 (including repayment of float in 2009 and the
repayment of older arrears).
21.
Reporting requirement. Data on repayment of domestic arrears and the remaining
previous-year stock of arrears will be transmitted on a monthly basis within five weeks of the
end of each month.
C. Limits on External Debt
Limit on New Nonconcessional External Debt of the Public Sector
22.
A ceiling applies to the contracting and guaranteeing by the public sector of new
nonconcessional borrowing debt with nonresidents (see below for the definition of the public
sector, concessionality and debt). The ceiling is given in Table 2 of the MEFP which applies
continuously from end-June 2010 to end-June 2013; it excludes the swap agreement of
US$50 million signed in November 2009 between the NBR and the IFC and US$13.1 million
for purchase of two air planes in 2009. The ceiling also excludes non concessional borrowing
by one state owned commercial bank, the Bank of Kigali, which is assumed not to seek or be
granted a government guarantee. The ceiling also applies to private debt for which official
4

A negative target thus represents a floor on net repayment.

64
guarantees have been extended, including future swaps involving foreign currency loans
guaranteed by the public sector (see below for swaps), and which, therefore, constitute a
contingent liability of the public sector.
23.
Definition of the public sector. The public sector comprises the general government
(the central government, the NBR, local governments which include provinces and districts)
and entities in which the government holds a controlling stake— owning more than
50 percent of the shares or the ability to determine general corporate policy.5 This definition
of public sector excludes the Bank of Kigali.
24.
For program purposes, the guarantee of a debt arises from any explicit legal
obligation of the public sector to service a debt in the event of nonpayment by the debtor
(involving payments in cash or in kind), or from any implicit legal or contractual obligation
of the public sector to finance partially or in full any shortfall incurred by the debtor.
25.
Definition of concessionality For program purposes, a debt is concessional if it
includes a grant element of at least 35 percent, calculated as follows: the grant element of a
debt is the difference between the present value (PV) of debt and its nominal value,
expressed as a percentage of the nominal value of the debt. The PV of debt at the time of its
contracting is calculated by discounting the future stream of payments of debt service due on
this debt.6 The discount rates used for this purpose are the currency specific commercial
interest reference rates (CIRRs), published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation
Development (OECD). For debt with a maturity of at least 15 years, the ten-year-average
CIRR will be used to calculate the PV of debt and, hence, its grant element. For debt with a
maturity of less than 15 years, the six-month average CIRR will be used. To both the ten-year
and six-month averages, the same margins for differing repayment periods as those used by
the OECD need to be added (0.75 percent for repayment periods of less than 15 years,
1 percent for 15 to 19 years, 1.15 percent for 20 to 29 years, and 1.25 percent for 30 years or
more).
26.
The definition of debt, for the purposes of the limit in the AC, is set out in point 9 of
the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to External Debt, effective December 1,
2009). It not only applies to the debt as defined in Point 9 of the Executive Board decision,
but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been received. The

5

Government control of an entity can be established based on the following criteria: (i) ownership of the
majority of the voting interest; (ii) control of the board or other governing body; (iii) control of the appointment
and removal of key personnel; (iv) control of key committees of the entity; (v) golden shares and options; (vi)
regulation and control; (vii) control by a dominant public sector customer or group of public sector customers;
and (viii) control attached to borrowing from the government.
6

The calculation of concessionality will take into account all aspects of the loan agreement, including maturity,
grace period, payment schedule, upfront commissions, and management fees.

65
definition of debt set forth in No. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect
to External Debt in Fund Arrangements reads as follows:
(a) The term "debt" will be understood to mean a current, i.e., not contingent,
liability, created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value
in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the
obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency)
or services, at some future point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the
principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts can take a
number of forms, the primary ones being as follows:
(i) loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the
basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future
(including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans and buyers' credits)
and temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized
loans under which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay
interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as
repurchase agreements and official swap arrangements);
(ii) suppliers' credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to
defer payments until sometime after the date on which the goods are
delivered or services are provided; and
(iii) leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the
lessee has the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are
usually shorter than the total expected service life of the property, while the
lesser retains the title to the property. The debt is the present value (at the
inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the
period of the agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation,
repair, or maintenance of the property.
(b) Under the definition of debt set out in point 9(a) above, arrears, penalties,
and judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under
a contractual obligation that constitutes debt. Failure to make payment on an
obligation that is not considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on
delivery) will not give rise to debt.
Limit on the stock of external payment arrears
27.
A continuous assessment criterion applies to the non-accumulation of payment arrears
on external debt contracted or guaranteed by the public sector. External payment arrears
consist of external debt service obligations (principal and interest) that have not been paid at
the time they are due, as specified in the contractual agreements, but shall exclude arrears on
obligations that are subject to rescheduling.

66
Consolidated Domestic Debt of the Public Sector (DD)
28.
For program purposes, DD excludes treasury bills issued by the NBR for monetary
policy purposes. The ceiling on DD applies to domestic commitments contracted or
guaranteed by the public sector. This also applies to private debt for which official
guarantees have been extended either implicitly or explicitly. The authorities would inform
Fund staff of any changes in debt position of public sector entities.
Adjusters:


In the case of a shortfall in programmed grants, the ceiling on consolidated domestic
debt of public sector will be adjusted upward by the same amount as the increase in
the ceiling in the NDF, but capped per paragraph 12.



The ceiling on the DD will be adjusted upward by the amount of expenditure for food
imports in the case of a food emergency.

29.
Reporting requirement. Data on domestic debt of the public sector, including
treasury bills issued by the NBR for monetary policy purposes, will be transmitted on a
monthly basis within five weeks of the end of each month.
D. Targets for Monetary Aggregates
Net foreign assets of the National Bank of Rwanda (NFA)
30.
A floor applies to the NFA of the NBR for June 30, 2010, December 31, 2010 and
June 30, 2011 targets. Other dates are indicative targets throughout the program.
31.
Definition. NFA of the NBR in Rwanda francs are defined, consistent with the
definition of the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) template, as external assets
readily available to, or controlled by, the NBR net of its external liabilities. Pledged or
otherwise encumbered reserve assets (including swaps) are to be excluded; such assets
include, but are not limited to, reserve assets used as collateral or guarantee for third party
external liabilities. Foreign assets and foreign liabilities in U.S. dollars are converted to
Rwanda francs by using the U.S. dollar/Rwanda franc program exchange rate. Foreign assets
and liabilities in other currencies are converted to U.S. dollars by using the actual end-ofperiod U.S. dollar/currency exchange rate. Foreign liabilities include, inter alia, use of IMF
resources (CCFF and post-conflict emergency assistance purchases and SAF/ESAF/ECF
disbursements).
32.

Adjusters:



The floor on NFA will be adjusted downward by the amount of any shortfall between
actual and programmed budgetary grants. This adjustment will be capped at the
equivalent of US$80 million, evaluated in Rwanda francs at the program exchange
rate. In the case of excess of actual over programmed budgetary grants, the floor of
the NFA remains unchanged for the first US$24 million. Subsequently, the floor will
be adjusted upwards by any amount in excess of US$24 million.

67


The floor on NFA will be adjusted downward by the amount of expenditure for food
imports in the case of a food emergency.

33.
Reporting requirement. Data on foreign assets and foreign liabilities of the NBR
will be transmitted on a weekly basis within seven days of the end of each week. This
transmission will include daily and weekly data on the NBR’s foreign exchange liabilities to
commercial banks (including required reserves with the NBR) and the exchange rate used for
their conversion into Rwanda francs will be shown separately.
Reserve money
34.
A ceiling applies to the stock of reserve money for the June 30, 2010, December 31,
2010 and June 30, 2011 targets. Other dates are indicative targets throughout the program.
35.
The stock of reserve money target for a given quarter will be calculated as the
arithmetic average of the stock of reserve money at the end of each calendar month in the
quarter. Daily average of all the three months in the quarter will constitute the actual reserve
money to be compared with the target.
36.
Reserve money is defined as the sum of currency in circulation, commercial banks’
reserves, and other nonbank deposits at the NBR.
37.

Adjuster:



The ceiling on the stock of reserve money will be adjusted symmetrically for a
change in the required reserve ratio of commercial banks. The adjustor will be
calculated as (new reserve ratio minus program baseline reserve ratio) multiplied by
actual amount of liabilities (Rwanda Franc plus foreign-currency denominated) in
commercial banks.

38.
Reporting requirement. Data on reserve money will be transmitted on a weekly
basis within seven days of the end of each week. This transmission will include a daily and a
weekly balance sheet of the NBR which will show all items listed above in the definitions of
reserve money.
II. Other Data Reporting Requirements
39.
For the purposes of program monitoring, the Government of Rwanda will provide the
data listed in Table 1 below, weekly data within seven days of the end of each week; monthly
data within five weeks of the end of each month; annual data as available.
40.
The authorities will inform the IMF staff in writing at least ten business days
(excluding legal holidays in Rwanda or in the United States) prior to making any changes in
economic and financial policies that could affect the outcome of the financial program. Such
policies include but are not limited to customs and tax laws (including tax rates, exemptions,
allowances, and thresholds), wage policy, and financial support to public and private

68
enterprises. The authorities will similarly inform the IMF staff of any nonconcessional
external debt contracted or guaranteed by the government, the NBR, or any statutory bodies,
and any accumulation of new external payments arrears on the debt contracted or guaranteed
by these entities. The authorities will furnish an official communication to the IMF
describing program performance of quantitative and structural assessment criteria and
benchmarks within 8 weeks of a test date. The authorities will on a regular basis submit
information to IMF staff with the frequency and submission time lag as indicated in Table 1.
The information should be mailed electronically to AFRRWA@IMF.ORG .

APPENDIX II
RWANDA–SOURCES OF GROWTH USING A GROWTH ACCOUNTING
FRAMEWORK1
A. Introduction and Summary
1.
Rwanda has maintained remarkable economic growth for more than a decade.
Real GDP growth averaged about 8 percent a year during 1998-2009, up from 2 percent a
year in the 1980s. The growth reflects a strong rebound from the conflict in 1994, but also
has been underpinned by government’s prudential macroeconomic policies and pro-market
structural reforms, supported by the successive Fund-supported programs, as well as
substantive debt relief and scaling up of aid.
2.
Now the key question is – is the growth sustainable? To answer the question, it is
essential to investigate where growth comes from. During the period, investment increased
significantly which reduced a severe infrastructure gap, while the population grew by nearly
50 percent. If the economic growth is solely driven by factor accumulation (capital and labor),
then the recent high growth cannot be sustained in the future, given that the planned fiscal
consolidation and the projected decline in official grants would reduce capital formation.
3.
The analysis of the sources of growth has methodological limitations. In this
appendix, the sources of Rwanda’s economic growth are examined using a growth
accounting framework. Although the framework is widely utilized in empirical studies, it is
known that it has limitations, which mainly come from the fact that productivity is measured
as a residual. As a result, the measured productivity contains not only gains in economic
efficiency, but also a number of other factors, such as external shocks, political stability,
climate conditions, and measurement errors. Another shortcoming, though specific to
Rwanda, is that labor inputs cannot be adjusted for quality of human capital and working
hours, due to the lack of a labor force survey for Rwanda. Thus improvement in human
capital such as through educational attainment will be registered as a part of productivity
growth.
4.
Nevertheless, the exercise provides a useful perspective on Rwanda’s economic
growth. The exercise illustrates that a large part of Rwanda’s impressive economic
growth over the past decade can be explained by productivity gains, and growth could
be further accelerated over the medium term through mobilizing private investment
and enhancing productivity. The details of the methodology and data are shown in Section
B, followed by Section C which reports on the findings.

1

Prepared by Masafumi Yabara (African Department).

71
B. Methodology and Data
5.
The methodology used in this appendix is the one widely adopted in empirical
research on growth accounting and specifically taken from Tahari et al. (2004).2 A standard
Cobb-Douglas production function is written as:
,
(1)
where Y is output, A represents total factor productivity (TFP), K is physical capital, L is
labor force, α is the share of capital in national income, and t represents a year.
6.

Taking natural logarithm of the function and differentiating with respect to time gives:
1

,

(2)
where the dotted variables denote time derivatives. The equation indicates that economic
growth can be decomposed into contributions from TFP and capital and labor inputs. It also
means that once the growth of output, capital, and labor force are obtained, TFP growth can
be estimated as a residual, based on an assumption about α.
7.
Output Y from 1960 to 2009 is measured by GDP at constant prices, taken from the
IMF World Economic Outlook (WEO) database. For capital K, it is assumed that the initial
capital-output ratio in 1960 is 1.5 and capital depreciates by 6 percent every year, while it is
augmented by investment each year. Investment is measured by gross fixed capital formation
at constant prices, also obtained from the WEO database. Labor force data is obtained from
the World Bank Development Indicators database.3 IMF staff projections are used for
projections after 2010. α is set at 0.4, following Tahari et al. (2004), which is in line with an
estimate of the capital share for Rwanda by Coulibaly et al. (2008).4 The findings are robust
if α is alternatively set to be 0.3, a common assumption in studies of TFP growth in
developed economies.

As the data is available only through 2008, it is assumed that labor force grows in 2009 by the average growth
rate of the last five years (2004-2008), 2.9 percent.

C. Sources of Rwanda’s Growth from 1961 to 2009, and beyond
8.
Rwanda’s high economic growth in the last decade has been driven not only by
accumulation of capital and labor, but also by productivity gains. In particular, the
contribution of TFP to output growth rose to 2.1 percent on average for 1998–2009, making a
clear distinction from previous decades. Looking at the recent period of 2004-2009, capital
and TFP played more important role in economic growth, each of which contributed
2.9 percent to output growth on average (Table 1).5 These findings are encouraging, as they
suggest that the government’s policies have succeeded not only in increasing investment in
physical capital, but also in enhancing the efficiency of the whole economy, although, as
stated earlier, TFP includes other factors such as investment in human capital.

contributions from the three factors, due to approximation.

9.
Compared to neighboring countries, economic growth in Rwanda has been
driven more by rise in productivity. Applying the same methodology to four countries
comprising the rest of East African Community (EAC), the share of contribution of
productivity to output growth during 1998–2009 is higher for Rwanda than for the other EAC
countries, except for Tanzania (Figure 1). About 28 percent of output growth in Rwanda is
derived from TFP gains, while only 13 percent of real GDP growth is attributable to TFP
increases in the other EAC countries, on average.
10.
Economic recovery of Rwanda in 2010 is largely supported by strong recovery of
TFP. Staff estimates that real GDP growth will reach 6.5 percent in 2010 up from 4.1 percent
in 2009. According to growth accounting, this recovery is largely explained by significant
improvement of TFP to 1.3 percent in 2010 after registering a negative contribution in 2009,
caused by the domestic liquidity crisis and the global financial turmoil (Figure 1). 6

5

The high productivity gains since 1998 obviously pick up the rebound from the conflict in 1994: however, the
further rise in productivity in the recent years illustrates that the rebound cannot explain all the increases in
productivity after the conflict.
6

In the following arguments, it is assumed that labor force growth for 2010-2015 is the same as in 2009,
2.9 percent a year, the average of 2004-2008, due to the fact that there is no reliable data to make a forecast of
labor market developments.

73
11.
Over the medium term, high economic growth is expected to be maintained,
underpinned by the government’s strategic investments and rise in productivity. Output
growth is expected to hit its peak of 7 percent in 2012, and then stabilize at 6.5 percent. This
growth path is driven by government’s strategic investments, as well as gradual rise in TFP
which is projected to reach 2.2 percent in 2012 and remain at that level in the following years.
The TFP rise offsets the expected decline in government’s investments after 2012, resulting
from fiscal consolidation and reduced official grants (Figure 1).
12.
Rwanda’s economy could potentially grow by 8.4 percent over the medium term,
provided that (i) investment is scaled up to the level of global average; (ii) productivity
growth accelerates and remains elevated; and (iii) there are no adverse shocks. The
projected potential output growth of 8.4 percent is premised on simultaneous occurrence of
highly favorable factors: (i) investment will further increase after 2012, reaching 25 percent
of GDP in 2015, as opposed to the staff projection that investment will gradually decrease to
20.6 percent of GDP by 2015, (ii) productivity growth will accelerate to 2.9 percent in 2013,
the high average TFP growth over 2004–2009, and then stabilize at the level; and (iii) there
are no shocks with adverse effects on output (Figure 1).
13.
Mobilizing private resources through maintaining macroeconomic stability and
pro-market structural reforms is essential in maximizing Rwanda’s potential economic
growth. The investment-GDP ratio of 25 percent is much higher than the projected average
of Sub-Saharan African countries, 21 percent in 2015, and is equivalent to the world average.
In order for this best case scenario to materialize in the midst of the planned fiscal
consolidation and decline in external grants, it is essential that the government maintains
macroeconomic stability and accelerates market-friendly structural reforms, so that private
investment is further mobilized and resources are aptly utilized to enhance the productivity of
the economy.

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the
completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the
decision point. Hence these two amounts cannot be added.
5

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed during the interim
period.
6

The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries
that are qualified for the assistance. The debt relief covers the full stock of debt owed to the Fund as of end2004 which remains outstanding at the time the member qualifies for such debt relief. The MDRI is financed by
bilateral contributions and the Fund's own resources, as well as the resources already disbursed to the member
under the HIPC Initiative (see Section VII above).

5
Decision point—point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a country
qualifies for assistance under the HIPC Initiative and decide on the amount of assistance to
be committed.
Interim assistance—amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision and
completion points, up to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance
committed at the decision point (or 25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional
circumstances).
Completion point—point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its assistance
committed at the decision point, together with an additional disbursement of interest income
as defined in footnote 4 above. The timing of the completion point is linked to the
implementation of pre-agreed key structural reforms (i.e., floating completion point).
IX.

Safeguards Assessments:

The 2007 safeguards update assessment noted that since 2003, the National Bank of Rwanda
(NBR) strengthened its own safeguards: External audits were completed on time, the
Committee of Auditors became operational, and the Internal Audit Department helped in the
strengthening of controls over monetary program data. The update assessment’s priority
recommendations concerned timely publication of the audited financial statements, further
improving external audit arrangements, and full implementation of IFRS. Safeguards policy
does not require an update safeguards assessment in the case of the non-financial
arrangement with the Fund. However, such assessment may be voluntary requested by the
country, and the NBR has made a formal request for the update assessment.
X.

Exchange System:

The currency of Rwanda is the Rwandan franc. On December 1998, Rwanda accepted the
obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the IMF and maintains a system free of
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. As
of November 9, 2010 the official exchange rate was RWF 591.80 per U.S. dollar. Since
January 2010, the Rwanda franc has gradually depreciated against the dollar in a 2 percent
band. Under the revised classification of the exchange rate arrangements, effective January 4,
2010, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to a crawl-like
arrangement from a stabilized arrangement. The de jure exchange rate arrangement is
classified as floating. The official exchange rate (called the Average Reference Rate or
ARR) is calculated on a daily basis by the National Bank of Rwanda (NBR) as a 5-day
moving average of (i) the exchange rate used for transactions between commercial banks and

6
their customers and (ii) the exchange rate used by NBR with its customers. 7 The NBR
applies a margin of +/-0.6 percent to the previous days’ ARR to derive current day’s
customer rate and ensures that the customer rate used for transactions with the government
and market rates do not differ by more than 2%. With a view to introducing more flexibility
in its exchange rate policy, since March 24, 2010, NBR introduced an exchange rate corridor
framework.
XI.

Article IV Consultation:

Rwanda is on the revised 24-month consultation cycle. The Executive Board discussed the
staff report for the 2008 Article IV consultation (IMF Country Report No. 09/58) on January
12, 2009.
XII.

FSAP Participation, ROSCs, and OFC Assessments:

A Report on Observance of Standards and Codes on Fiscal Transparency (ROSC) was issued
in July 2003. A Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) took place in February 2005,
and a FSAP update is planned in February 2011. Rwanda has not had an Offshore Financial
Center (OFC) assessment.
XIII. Policy Support Instrument (PSI):

APPENDIX III. RWANDA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. National
accounts, prices, government finance, and balance of payments statistics have various
weaknesses which hamper economic analysis. Monetary statistics and data relevant for
banking supervision are adequate for program monitoring, but there is some scope for
improvements in quality and timeliness. The country has participated in the General Data
Dissemination System since October 2003. However, the metadata has not been revised since
the participation. In August 2005, the National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda (NISR) was
established following the passage of the new Statistics Law.
National Accounts and Price Statistics
Annual GDP estimates in current and 2006 constant prices are compiled and disseminated by
the NISR, based on the 1993 System of National Accounts concepts. Commendable efforts
have been made by the NISR in recent years to improve the GDP estimates, with technical
assistance being provided by the East AFRITAC and the United Nations Development
Program. In particular, the NISR started to disseminate quarterly GDP estimates from the
second quarter of 2010. Nevertheless, as a country with large agricultural and informal
sectors, significant weaknesses still exist in GDP estimates from the production side:


Agricultural production estimates are extrapolated using pre-harvest crop
assessments, which mainly focus on food security rather than on measuring
production growth, due to lack of ex-post crop assessment surveys. As the estimates
resulting from the pre-harvest assessments are assumed to be generally higher than
actual harvest, the NISR conducts ex-post visits and makes adjustments to the
results of the pre-harvest survey. However, the adjustments made are limited to
certain crops and the visits do not cover the entire nation, as it is a transitory attempt.



Lack of a comprehensive economy-wide business survey precludes a reliable
benchmark of economic activities in the private sector. Instead, proxy indicators
such as monthly VAT turnover data covering the formal sector and financial data
reported by a limited number of large companies are used to estimate the production.



Economic activities in the informal sector are estimated every 5 years making use of
household surveys. They are assumed to grow at the population growth rate, and
currently occupy 19% of GDP. The assumption gives a bias to GDP estimates.

There are considerable issues to be addressed for GDP estimates under the expenditure
approach, too. While the estimates of government consumption, gross capital formation, and
trade in goods and services are compiled from data sources including government budget
reports and balance of payment estimates, the rest of the components, private consumption
and changes in inventories, are estimated as simply a gap between the sum of these
components and a total GDP estimate from the production approach. For gross fixed capital

14
formation, only the estimates of construction and durable equipment are compiled. These
practices significantly hinder the reliable assessment of national savings and investment.
Compilation of quarterly balance of payment estimates is necessary to improve the quality of
estimates of trade, and enable the quarterly compilation of important statistics, such as gross
nation income, national saving, and net lending/borrowing.
Recognizing these issues, the NISR has formulated an action plan providing a comprehensive
list of actions to be taken by June 2013. The NISR is currently preparing for the third
household budget survey (EICV3) to be conducted from November 2010 to October 2011 in
order to produce benchmark data for the 2011 rebase of the national accounts. An enterprise
survey is also planned to be implemented during 2012. The NISR will begin conducting expost crop assessments starting with the 2011 agricultural A season, and is planning to do a
feasibility study further reviewing the crop assessment methodology.
The implementation of the action plan is challenging, illustrating the urgent need for securing
additional staff and resources for the NISR. The NISR is significantly under staffed and
under resourced. In this sense, it is admirable that the Cabinet approved a plan to increase the
number of NISR staff from 40 to 100 and provided a necessary budget for FY2010. The
NISR is expecting to have 70 staff members by the end of the year 2010.
In October 2009, the consumer price index (CPI) was indexed to February 2009 and
reweighted utilizing results from the second household budget survey. The survey was
conducted in 2005-06, with a sample of 6,900 households. Now the index reflects
expenditures of rural households in Rwanda, in addition to those of urban households. A
quarterly PPI (base Q4 2003 = 100) has been produced for manufacturing activities since
2005.
10.
Real sector data are reported regularly for publication in International Finance
Statistics (IFS), although with some lag, particularly for GDP estimates. Data on employment
and wages are not collected, except for the central government.
Government Finance Statistics
Detailed monthly revenues and expenditures are reported to AFR with a lag of five to six
weeks. These data are compiled by the flash-reporting unit of The Ministry of Finance and
Economic Planning (MINECOFIN). A functional classification of government expenditure
has been available since the 2003 budget. Within the economic classification, expenditures
on PRSP-designated “priority areas” are clearly identifiable. The fiscal data do not capture
capital expenditure consistently because capital projects (almost entirely externally financed)
are mainly carried out by line ministries outside the regular budget process. Compilation of
data on external budgetary assistance as well as on external debt would benefit from
strengthened coordination between the finance ministry and the central bank. Efforts are
underway to integrate the development budget into the normal budgetary procedures. Fiscal
data often exhibit discrepancies between deficit and financing estimates. To address these

15
issues, the authorities have made adjustments for changes in the balance of non-core
government accounts, changes in cash in vault at the revenue authority, accounting errors,
and other factors.
No sub-annual data are reported to STA for publication in the IFS, and annual government
finance statistics have not been reported for publication in the GFS Yearbook since 1993.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
The balance sheet of the NBR and detailed data on money market transactions are
transmitted to AFR on a weekly basis with a lag of one week, while the monetary survey and
the consolidated balance sheet of commercial banks are transmitted on a monthly basis with a
lag of about five weeks. Detailed data on interbank money market transactions are also
provided upon request. Monetary data used to be reported separately to STA and published in
the IFS. The reporting of monetary statistics to STA has been delayed during the migration to
the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs) undertaken by the NBR. The interruption in reporting
has been longer than initially planned as the progress of the SRF migration has been
hampered by the scarcity of skilled staff.
An August 2007 STA mission found that (i) a new chart of accounts for commercial banks
was enacted in 2005 and the call report forms sent to the NBR were improved, better
reflecting the methodology of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual; (ii) the data on
the Union des banques populaires du Rwanda—a countrywide mutual bank network—were
included in the broad money survey beginning January 2004; (iii) the data on credit and
savings cooperatives and other microfinance institutions are still not included in monetary
statistics.
External Sector Statistics
Balance of payments statistics are affected by weaknesses in the source data (treatment of
customs data and bank settlement reports). The June 2003 multisector statistics mission
recommended: (1) reorganizing data entry and production of external trade statistics, using
ASYCUDA and Eurotrace software; (2) adapting survey forms sent to companies to the
BPM5 methodology; and (3) collaborating with Central Public Investments and External
Finance Bureau (CEPEX) to obtain data on international and bilateral aid. Subsequently,
STA balance of payments statistics missions followed up in January 2004 and June 2005, as
did AFRITAC missions in October 2006 and June 2007.
Technical assistance resulted in significant improvements. In particular, the collection of data
through direct surveys now seems to be well established, and the rate of response is
satisfactory (except for embassies). Data compilation was the main focus of the June 2006
AFRITAC mission, and many adjustments to customs data were introduced to improve
coverage and valuation. The NBR has started compiling BOP/IIP statistics in conformity
with the BMP5 methodology. Annual balance of payments and IIP data through 2007 have

16
been reported to STA for publication in the IFS and the Balance of Payments Statistics
Yearbook. The NBR in 2009–10 launched several initiatives to improve data coverage,
including (1) a questionnaire on technical assistance related to NGOs; (ii) a cross-border
trade survey capturing all information on trade transactions with neighboring countries which
are not capture by the official customs system; and (iii) a revision of the estimates of
participation of (non-)residents in import transportation services.
Nevertheless, some weaknesses remain, particularly in the compilation of trade data. The
treatment of bank settlement reports is not effective, because of incomplete automation of the
collection of declarations. The coverage of external aid remains a cause of concern. Data
produced by the CEPEX do not include offshore payments, direct payments to contractors,
and technical assistants, nor does it capture aid from important UN agencies and from certain
countries. Only the external aid registered in the Government budget is fully covered.
Concerning the NGO sector, the data should result from the survey of NGOs, but its
coverage is insufficient.
Databases on external public debt are maintained by both MINECOFIN and the NBR.
A committee, composed of staffs from the ministries of finance and economic planning,
foreign affairs, and the NBR, is responsible for collecting, harmonizing, and monitoring
information on external public debt.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation
with Rwanda
On December 20, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Rwanda.1
Background
Rwanda’s economy is showing clear signs of recovery from the external and domestic shocks of
the past two years, while inflation has remained low.
After slowing to 4.1 percent in 2009 from 11.2 percent in 2008, real GDP growth for 2010 is
expected to reach 6.5 percent, driven by a rebound in exports and stronger-than-expected
growth in services (mainly in telecommunications) and construction―sectors that were
adversely affected by the global recession and tight liquidity. High-frequency macroeconomic
indicators for the first three quarters of 2010 support the pickup in economic activity.
Higher export performance, reflecting a rebound in international prices and stronger-thanexpected volumes of coffee, tea, and non-traditional exports, has contributed to a narrowing of

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
the external current account deficit (excluding grants) to 17.3 percent of GDP in 2010, from 18.6
percent in 2009, while international reserves remain at comfortable levels.
For the first time in many years, annual inflation has remained below 5 percent in 2010,
reflecting in large part the benign external environment, especially stable food and fuel prices.
Monetary policy has been accommodative, but private sector credit has been slow to respond,
despite three cuts in the central bank’s policy rate (the key repo rate) since November 2009 by
300 basis points.
Fiscal performance in FY 2009/10 was better than projected, reflecting better than projected
domestic revenue collection while total expenditure including net lending remained on target.
In general, Rwanda’s economy has a higher growth potential of about 8½ percent over the
medium term, provided that (i) investment is scaled up significantly; (ii) productivity growth
increases and remains elevated; and (iii) there are no adverse shocks. Achieving and
maintaining this high growth rate, however, is challenging as it will require additional
investments of at least $350 million (or 7 percent of GDP) a year. Risks to the outlook are on the
downside, reflecting mainly slower pickup in external demand and domestic credit. Donor flows
are expected to remain strong, but decline gradually over the medium term. Over the longer
term, risks to potential growth include lower levels of investment financing and smaller
productivity gains. There are also upside risks to inflation from higher global food and fuel
prices.
Rwanda’s macroeconomic policies are supported by the IMF’s Policy Support Instrument (PSI),
which was approved in June 2010 (see Press Release No. 10/247). The proposed three-year
PSI program aims to consolidate macroeconomic stability while reducing Rwanda’s aid
dependency by: (i) maintaining a sustainable fiscal position through improved revenue
mobilization; (ii) strengthening monetary and exchange rate policies to ensure low and stable
inflation; (iii) reducing financial sector vulnerability by strengthening banking supervision, and
deepening the financial sector by enhancing access to credit; and (iv) diversifying the export
base and improving the business environment.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Rwandan authorities for satisfactory implementation of the
economic program supported under the PSI. Countercyclical fiscal and monetary policies
helped to mitigate the impact of the global economic downturn and contributed to a rebound in
economic activity. Directors noted that the recovery remains fragile.
Continued prudent policies, improved infrastructure, increased agricultural productivity, and
deepened financial markets will be needed to sustain growth and reduce poverty.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to gradually unwind fiscal stimulus and to embark
on a medium-term path toward fiscal consolidation. They encouraged the authorities to consider

3
complementing revenue mobilization efforts with tax policy reforms and supported further
strengthening of the medium-term fiscal framework underlying the planned fiscal consolidation.
Such improvements include better costing of government spending plans in the Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework, improved alignment of external grants with a medium-term domestic
debt strategy, and quarterly dissemination of fiscal data.
Directors commended the authorities for their progress in reforming public financial
management, and emphasized the importance of further enhancing public expenditure
accountability and efficiency. They noted that strengthening of public investment planning and
evaluation and of debt management capacity would be critical for scaled-up infrastructure
spending, in particular when using nonconcessional financing.
Directors underscored the importance of regular review of the monetary policy stance to enable
timely response to any underlying inflationary pressures. They recognized the challenges
involved in strengthening the monetary transmission mechanism, and encouraged more active
use of the policy rate and development of an active debt market with longer-dated instruments.
Directors emphasized the importance of continued analytical support for the Monetary Policy
Committee deliberation process and supported continuation of reforms toward greater exchange
rate flexibility.
Directors noted staff’s assessment that Rwanda’s real effective exchange rate was broadly in
line with economic fundamentals. They underscored the importance of continued improvements
in the business environment and stepped up efforts on structural reforms to broaden the export
base.
Directors welcomed efforts to improve access to finance, but cautioned that accelerating the
expansion of micro finance institutions and savings and credit cooperatives should be balanced
by having in place the necessary supervisory capacity. They emphasized the importance of
developing and implementing a plan to build and retain banking supervision staff. Directors
stressed the importance of enhancing competition in the banking sector.
Directors encouraged the authorities to improve quality of statistics, particularly in the areas of
the national accounts and the balance of payment.

IMF Executive Board Completes First Review Under Policy Support Instrument
for Rwanda
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the first
review under the three-year Policy Support Instrument (PSI) for Rwanda. The Executive
Board also approved modifications of assessment criteria under the PSI.
The PSI for Rwanda was approved on June 16, 2010 (see Press Release No. 10/247) and is
aimed at consolidating macroeconomic stability, achieving sustained broad-based growth,
and reducing Rwanda’s aid dependency. The program focuses on maintaining a sustainable
fiscal position; strengthening monetary and exchange rate policies; and supporting growth
with structural reforms to diversify the export base and improving the business environment.
Following the Executive Board's discussion on Rwanda, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy
Managing Director and Chairman, stated:
“The Rwanda authorities are to be commended for satisfactory implementation of the
economic program supported by the Policy Support Instrument for 2009/10, carried out
against the backdrop of a global economic downturn. Rwanda’s economy is showing clear
signs of recovery from the external and domestic shocks of the past two years. However,
uncertainty in external demand, a slow pick-up in credit to the private sector, and the need to
secure favorable financing to implement their investment plan to close the infrastructure gap
continue to pose policy challenges.
“The authorities are gradually unwinding the fiscal stimulus while at the same time
mobilizing additional domestic revenues and protecting priority spending. Monetary policy
has been accommodative to rekindle credit to the private sector and further support growth.
The authorities are committed to regularly assess the inflation outlook in order to safeguard
the gains made in macroeconomic stability that currently underpin the economic recovery.

2
“The authorities are aware of the need to deepen the domestic financial markets to support
the growing economy, and are implementing a program to increase access to credit through
additional licensing of micro finance institutions and saving and credit companies. Given
rising levels of non-performing loans, further efforts are needed to strengthen bank and nonbank supervision to ensure that higher access to credit does not endanger financial stability.”

Statement by Kossi Assimaidou, Executive Director for Rwanda
December 20, 2010
My Rwandan authorities would like to thank staff for the fruitful discussions held in Kigali
during their last visit. They would also like to extend their gratitude to the Executive Board
and Management for their continued support which has helped Rwanda reach important
milestones on the path of economic progress.
The achievements on the fronts of macroeconomic stability and building an enabling
environment for a private sector led growth have engineered robust and sustained output over
the last decade and also strengthened the resilience of the Rwandan economy to crises. Thus,
after suffering the impact of the global slowdown over the past two years, the economy is
resuming its momentum, thanks to the appropriate policies my authorities are implementing
under the PSI to cope with the various shocks stemming from the crisis. Despite an
unfavorable international environment and other challenging domestic conditions, my
authorities have posted a satisfactory performance over the period under review, meeting all
quantitative assessment criteria and making good progress on key structural reforms.
Going forward, my authorities are cognizant of the daunting challenges still facing the
economy and the country as a whole. Efforts should be stepped up to diversify growth
engines, reduce aid dependency, and curb down the still high poverty rate as envisaged in the
government’s Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EDPRS) 2008-2012.
My authorities are committed to keeping up their track record of sound policymaking while
they endeavor to address those challenges.

I.

Recent Economic Developments and Performance under the PSI

The satisfactory implementation of the PSI has helped Rwanda turn around the adverse
impact of the global crisis and improve the overall economic situation as evidenced by recent
developments. Real GDP growth is expected to reach 6.5 percent at end-year 2010, higher
than the 4.1 percent in 2009, though still well below its pre-crisis level of 11.2 percent in
2008. Key drivers that suffered the impact of slowing global demand are recovering
buoyancy, notably, exports, services, tourism, and construction. This recovery is taking place
in a more stable macroeconomic environment, with inflation lying in low single digits. The
external sector is benefiting from the export rebound and reserves are projected to cover 4.6
months of imports at end-year.
Fiscal performance was on track. Domestic revenue exceeded targets by about 0.7 percent
of GDP, as a result of overperforming taxes on goods and services and direct taxes. Spending
was in line with the program, though foreign financed capital projects suffered delays in
external loan disbursements. My authorities’ fiscal policy was also marked by a large
stimulus in 2009/10 – of about 2 percent of GDP- as a response to the global crisis. Going
forward, my authorities are committed to gradually unwinding the fiscal stimulus and
renewing with their efforts of fiscal consolidation.

Monetary and exchange rate policy has been accommodative to boost growth in the face of
the adverse international situation. The NBR pursued a twofold strategy of repeated cuts in
the policy rate and lowering of reserve requirement on bank deposits. Owing to the cautious
attitude of banks and the still weak monetary policy transmission mechanism, credit growth
has taken time to respond, but is expected to increase to 10 percent by December 2010
against 6 percent at end-December 2009. My authorities will continue their efforts of
deepening the financial sector with the view to improving monetary policy transmission
channels and thus enhancing credit to the private sector. Overall, they are committed to
further improving the conduct of monetary and exchange rate policy, including by building
capacity, improving the functioning of the monetary policy committee, and fine tuning the
mix of instruments.
As regards the financial sector, my authorities and staff share the view that the banking sector
generally remains sound, profitable, and well capitalized. The capital adequacy ratio of the
banking system stood at 17.6 percent as of June 30, 2010. Asset quality slightly improved,
with NPLs decreasing from 13.1 percent in December 2009 to 12.2 percent at end June 2010.
Bank profitability also increased; at end June 2010, return on equity and return on assets
increased respectively from 6.4 percent to 10.3 percent and from 0.9 percent to 1.3 percent
compared to June 30, 2009. Still, my authorities are well aware of the steps that need to be
taken to build a strong financial sector covering the large unbanked segments of the
population and capable of supporting a robust private sector activity.

Challenges and Policies Going Forward

My Rwandan authorities are committed to pursuing the good implementation of the PSI.
Their agenda for the period ahead encompasses policies that will help maintain
macroeconomic stability and achieve robust and sustainable broad-based growth and poverty
reduction. In that regard, my authorities intend to take measures to further unleash growth
potential. Fiscal and monetary policies will be conducted accordingly. My authorities will
also work expeditiously to address a number of bottlenecks and weaknesses that still
constrain the economy.
Boosting competitiveness to realize growth potential
My Rwandan authorities fully agree with staff on the favorable economic outlook and will
conduct policies to boost competitiveness and realize growth potential. Their core objective
in this regard is to post real output growth well above 7 percent over the medium term. To
this end, my authorities intend to pursue reforms aimed at creating an enabling environment
for the private sector, provide economic infrastructure through strategic investments, develop
further the financial sector to boost credit, and implement an export strategy to tap into
external markets.
Specifically, building on the favorable ranking in the 2010 global competitiveness indicators
and World Bank Doing Business rankings, my authorities will step up efforts to attract more
private investment, by granting tax incentives and exemptions. My authorities are determined

3
to lift infrastructure bottlenecks by implementing an ambitious investment strategy through
mechanisms such as PPPs. As for exports, the exchange rate policy will accommodate the
need to remain competitive, while a diversification strategy will be pursued away from
traditional products, for which niche markets will be explored.
Gradually fostering fiscal consolidation
My authorities have conducted countercyclical policies over the past period to dampen the
impact of the global crisis. The fiscal stimulus that was implemented in this regard has served
the country well, but also adversely impacted the overall deficit. As the recovery takes hold,
my authorities are committed to resuming their effort of medium term fiscal consolidation.
Over the next three years, my authorities plan to conduct a twofold strategy of reducing the
level of spending by 0.2 percent of GDP per annum on average and boost domestic revenue
mobilization by 0.6 percent of GDP per annum on average.
As for the revenue loss stemming from the membership in the East African Community
(EAC) and COMESA (Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa), my authorities
have taken temporary measures of spending cuts and intend to conduct extensive analysis on
the issue with the view to adopting permanent measures. My authorities’ fiscal policy will
also emphasize enhanced reforms in PFM, drawing on the PEFA assessment as well as their
continued partnership with the donor community and the IMF’s East AFRITAC.
Strengthening the financial sector
Cognizant of the need to build a deep financial sector as an underlying condition for a
dynamic private sector, my authorities are taking important steps, both to strengthen the
banks and financial companies and improve regulation and supervision. In terms of
deepening and diversifying the financial market, the authorities recently granted licenses to
some 400 Savings and Credit Cooperatives (SACCOs) to operate as deposit-taking
institutions, before later granting them lending licenses as well. Banking regulations have
been adopted this year, as well as other elements of the legal framework. The NBR will
strengthen its supervision by building adequate capacity, and will put particular emphasis on
microfinance institutions with its newly adopted package of regulatory and institutional
reforms.
Further reducing poverty
With 57 percent of the population living below the national poverty line in 2006, reducing
poverty remains the overarching goal of my Rwandan authorities as reaffirmed in their
EDPRS. Progress has been made in this regard. The government’s development program in
the agriculture sector, where most poor populations live, is recording appreciable results. The
country is now on track to achieve health and education-related MDGs, including increasing
the coverage and the quality of basic and tertiary education, and strengthening technical and
vocational education and training. It has already achieved MDGs related to gender equality
and has also made good progress towards increasing access to water and sanitation for its
population. Progress has also been made in the improvement of basic infrastructure,

4
including roads and electricity provision. My authorities are committed to stepping up their
efforts aimed at further empowering the most vulnerable segments of the population with the
view to lifting them out of poverty.
Conclusion
The PSI program offers an adequate framework to my Rwandan authorities to consolidate the
impressive results achieved in policymaking over the past decade with the support of the
international community including the Fund. During the period under review, my authorities
have successfully dealt with an adverse global environment marked by a deep crisis that
turned into recession. Despite the severe impact on the Rwandan economy, my authorities
have taken appropriate measures that helped maintain output in relatively good shape, and a
stable macroeconomic situation.
The performance under the PSI has been satisfactory, and the economy is regaining
momentum. My authorities are fully committed to fostering this recovery by keeping pace
with the reforms. In this endeavor, my authorities continue to count on the support of their
partners, especially the Fund to help make further inroads on the path of growth and poverty
reduction.
