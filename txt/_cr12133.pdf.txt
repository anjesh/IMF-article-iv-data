STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
May 16, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context: The economic recovery is losing steam due to adverse external
developments. Nonetheless, Macedonia is poised to achieve low but positive growth
under the baseline scenario of a shallow recession in the euro area, and BoP pressures
appear contained. Under a downside scenario, growth would be weaker and external
financing pressures could arise.
Fiscal Policy. In the near term, the government will need to reduce expenditure
growth to meet the 2012 deficit target, even beyond adjustments already made in the
supplementary budget. A key longer-term challenge will be to reconcile the competing
objectives of higher public investment and increases in pensions and public wages,
while preserving low public debt and low taxes. Strengthening of fiscal institutions is
needed to improve medium-term expenditure prioritization and budget execution
practices.
Public Finance. Macedonia has secured an external bank loan that will meet its
financing needs into 2013. Over the medium term, public debt management reform
and development of domestic debt markets are called for to reduce dependence on
potentially volatile external debt markets.
Monetary Policy. The central bank has eased slightly after keeping on hold for over a
year, in the context of a slowing economy, low inflation, and muted credit growth.
While this stance is justified by the circumstances, the central bank’s overriding
objective should remain stability of the de facto exchange rate peg.
Financial Sector. Financial stresses in the euro area and the large size of local
subsidiaries of euro area banks call for vigilance. The authorities have appropriately
intensified their financial sector monitoring and contingency planning in response.
Growth. Raising potential growth will be necessary to reduce high unemployment and
improve living standards. The authorities’ strategy appropriately focuses on investment
in infrastructure and education, preserving low taxes, and attracting FDI.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA

1.
Macedonia is a middle income country with a
good record on macroeconomic stability but lower
growth than its peers. The peg to the euro has anchored
monetary policy and helped achieve a long record of low
inflation, while low fiscal deficits have kept public debt
ratios moderate1. Despite sound macroeconomic policies,
growth has fallen short of other countries in the region,
while high unemployment rates, which predate
independence, persist.
2.
The euro area crisis is affecting Macedonian
exports and growth, and could also lead to pressures
on external finances. About 50 percent of exports go to
the euro area, and as in 2008–09, a sharp slowdown in
exports would have a significant impact on growth. Banks
have limited reliance on external financing, which
provides a degree of insulation from external financial
developments. Nevertheless, pressures on external
finances could arise in a downside scenario.

the second review of the two-year Precautionary and
Liquidity Line (PLL) arrangement approved in January 2011. The discussions focused on public
financial management issues, including government payment arrears, and the government’s fiscal
financing plan for 2012. In April the government announced it had reached agreement on a foreign
bank loan that would meet its fiscal financing needs for 2012 and into 2013, and it therefore would
not need to draw upon PLL resources. The authorities informed staff that they would not pursue
completion of the review and would allow the arrangement to expire in January 2013.

The exchange rate regime is referred to as a peg to the euro in this report. Formally, the de jure exchange rate
classification is “floating,” while the de facto classification is “stabilized.” The NBRM buys or sells foreign exchange to
keep the denar trading in a very narrow band around the rate of 61.5 denars per euro.

4.
The recovery slowed in 2011, due largely
to worsening external conditions. The 2010–11
recovery was led by a surge in exports, with domestic
demand picking up in 2011 on the back of lower
interest rates, a moderate resumption of credit
growth, and modest employment gains. In the second
half of the year a slowdown was visible in softening
exports, sales, production, and credit. Average growth
for 2011 was 3 percent, but year-on-year growth in the
fourth quarter was only 0.2 percent.

Quarter-on-quarter, SA
Source: SSO and IMF staff estimates

5.
Staff expects 2012 growth to decline to 2 percent, with significant downside risks. This
projection is based on a scenario with a shallow euro area recession in 2012.


Economic weakness and financial strains in the euro area are expected to feed through
directly to lower demand for Macedonian exports and to some reduction in remittances and
FDI, with indirect effects on domestic demand. Bank credit is expected to grow slowly due to
external uncertainties and to deleveraging and reduced risk tolerance on the part of foreign
parents. The relatively mild impact of the euro area crisis on growth under the baseline
projection reflects Macedonia’s modest external financial linkages, the absence of significant
financial sector or external imbalances, and a strong pipeline of FDI projects.



However, a deeper than expected downturn and intensified financial pressures in the euro
area could have a sizable impact on exports, remittances and FDI, pushing the economy
toward recession and putting pressures on international reserves. This could damage
domestic confidence in the viability of exchange rate peg and prompt an outflow of bank
deposits, adding to reserve pressures. In this scenario, the central bank would likely need to
raise interest rates to protect reserves and the exchange rate peg, further dampening
growth.

Inflation is expected to decline from 3.9
percent in 2011 to 2 percent in 2012. The jump in
headline inflation in 2011 was due to increases in food
and fuel prices, with core inflation a more contained 1.1
percent. In 2012 the impact of food and fuel price
developments is expected to fade, and with growth
remaining below potential, this will support a fall in
inflation. Over the longer term, average inflation has
broadly tracked the euro area, though with greater
volatility due in large part to the greater weights of
food and energy in the Macedonian basket.

8.
The current account deficit was 2.8 percent of GDP in 2011. The current account deficit
widened modestly from 2010 to 2011, reflecting a pick-up in domestic demand and higher fuel
prices. However, these were largely offset by the strong performance of private transfers as residents
converted their euro-denominated assets into denars following the intensification of the euro area
crisis in late 2011. Main sources of external financing included FDI of some €300 million (4.1 percent
of GDP), the €221 million PLL purchase in March, and a €130 million commercial bank loan backed
by a World Bank Policy-Based Guarantee (PBG) in December 2011.
9.
International reserves increased significantly and are at broadly adequate levels. Gross
international reserves rose by €355 million over the course of 2011 (€135 million excluding the PLL
purchase), ending the year at 114 percent of short-term debt by residual maturity and over 4
months of prospective imports. End-2011 reserves were 119 percent of the new Fund measure of
reserve adequacy based on risk-weighted liabilities, which is in the range considered adequate2.

See Assessing Reserve Adequacy, IMF Policy Paper, February 2011. The new metric is a weighted average of
exports, short-term debt at residual maturity, other portfolio liabilities, and broad money. Reserve coverage of 100150 percent of the new metric is considered adequate.

7.
The authorities’ views on the growth outlook were similar to those of staff. The NBRM
recently reduced its 2012 projection from 2.4 to 2 percent, on the back of lower growth expectations
of main trading partners. But overall the authorities believed that the lack of imbalances in the
economy, in particular the moderate current account deficit and contained credit growth, would
limit the impact of adverse external developments. This was in contrast to the run-up to the 2008–09
crisis, when a large current account deficit and rapid credit growth needed to be reined in quickly.
The government’s official projection for 2012 growth was initially 4.5 percent, but it reduced this to
2.5 percent in April 2012 in the face of mounting evidence of slowing growth.

their peak of 19½ percent of GDP in 2011, as euro
area stress subsides. The behavior of private transfers is the main contributor to the projected
increase in the current account deficit in 2012. The real exchange rate appears to be fairly valued,
based on measures such as CGER estimates and relative wage levels.

Box 1. Greenfield FDI in Macedonia
Macedonia has been successful recently in
attracting greenfield FDI. Investments have
branched out of the traditional export-oriented
industries such as food and metal processing
into new and higher value-added industries. In
particular, with the entrance of two large
car-parts manufacturers in 2007, automotive
components have become one of Macedonia’s
main exports. This rapid structural shift in
greenfield FDI reflects Macedonia’s low labor
costs and tax rates, its geographical proximity
to assembly plants in Central and Western
Europe and Turkey, duty-free access to the
European market, and investment incentives
such as tax holidays.

A large pipeline of greenfield FDI projects is planned for the next two to three years, concentrating on the
automotive components industry. This includes both expansion plans in incumbents and investments from new
entrants. Other sectors attracting FDI include construction materials, residential construction, glass (e.g., for
packaging of agricultural products and wine), and food processing.
Given the financial stress in Europe, some of the projects may be postponed or implemented more slowly.
The pipeline consists mainly of confirmed projects for which contracts have been signed, and in some cases
construction is underway. While adverse financial conditions and weaker demand in destination markets may delay
some of these projects, they are expected to materialize in the medium term.

The fiscal deficit was 2.6 percent of GDP in 2011 on a cash basis, as spending was
reduced in line with revenue shortfalls to meet the government’s deficit target. Revenues rose
3.5 percent compared to 2010, below the 12.6

12.
The deficit was somewhat larger on an accrual basis due to arrears. The government
failed to make payments totaling €7.6 million due to an external supplier of medical equipment in
the second half of 2011 and eventually reached agreement to make the overdue payments (plus
interest) in January 2012. It also reported €8 million in arrears on VAT refunds. These two items add
up to 0.2 percent of GDP. There are also widespread reports by businesses of late payments by the
government to its suppliers, suggesting the actual amount of arrears may be higher. Moreover, the
government renegotiated some contracts to extend payments to future years for goods or services
received in 2011.
13.
The 2012 budget calls for a fiscal deficit of 2½ percent of GDP, but is based on highly
optimistic revenue assumptions. The budget is based on a 4.5 percent real growth rate and
assumes total revenue growth of 14.8 percent compared to the outcome for 2011. Similar to 2011,
the budget prioritizes investment spending. It calls for a 52 percent increase in capital expenditure
compared to the 2011 outcome, and a 9 percent increase in current expenditure. Staff project that
revenues will grow 6 percent, significantly below the budget assumption, with the difference
reflecting in part staff’s lower growth projections. Based on staff’s lower nominal GDP forecast, the
authorities’ deficit target translates to 2.6 percent of GDP.
14.
The government submitted a supplementary budget to parliament in April 2012 that
would reduce annual expenditure by 4½ percent (1½ percent of GDP) relative to the budget
while keeping the deficit target unchanged. The proposed cuts focus on capital expenditures
(which would still grow 21 percent compared to the 2011 outcome). The revised budget assumes
revenue growth of 9 percent, still above staff projections (by 1 percent of GDP).

maturity over two years and repo transactions.
16.
In April 2012 the NBRM announced a new set of measures aimed at easing credit
conditions and furthering money market development.


First, it announced it would gradually decrease the amount of outstanding central bank bills by
limiting the volume offered at its auctions and reducing the frequency of auctions to once a
month, which would be expected to lead to lower interest rates. The maximum interest rate
would be 4 percent (the same as the previous benchmark rate) while quantities would be
adjusted to ensure interest rate declines were gradual and consistent with exchange rate
stability. As of early May, after four auctions under the new system, the average interest rate had
declined only to 3.93 percent, despite a significant decrease in outstanding central bank bills. In
early May the NBRM reduced the maximum interest rate to 3.75 percent.



Second, it introduced a 7-day and overnight deposit facility at an interest rate of 2 percent and
1 percent, respectively, which banks could use to place excess liquidity between the monthly bill
auctions.



Third, it initiated a weekly repurchase operation to provide liquidity to banks against their
holdings of treasury and central bank securities and reduced the rate on the overnight lending
facility from 150 bps to 50 bps over the central bank bill rate.

Banking sector indicators suggest the system is
in overall sound shape, and credit growth has been
moderate. As of December 2011, the capital adequacy ratio
was close to 17 percent (with tier 1 capital at 14 percent).
Deposits provided the main source of funding (loans totaled
86 percent of deposits) and reliance on foreign funding was
low. The NPL ratio was 9.5 percent, up somewhat from the

previous quarter but down from its 2010 peak of over 10 percent, and provisions exceeded NPLs.
Profitability was low but positive. Loan growth through December was 8.5 percent (year-over-year),
compared to 9.2 percent deposit growth. Euroization of deposits, while high, had declined to
pre-crisis levels (see Selected Issues Paper).
18.
Banks have limited direct exposure to euro area financial turbulence. Two of the three
large banks (who together account for some 40 percent of system assets) have parents from the
euro area, namely Greece and Slovenia. With the exception of modest amounts of long-term
subordinated debt instruments, they do not depend on their parents for funding, and nor do they
hold significant claims against their parents (which are restricted by related-party limits).
Nonetheless, in the event of an adverse scenario in Greece or the broader euro area, bank-specific
or even system-wide deposit outflows could not be excluded.

Credit growth is expected to be subdued in 2012. On the supply side, banks are likely to
be conservative in light of financial turmoil in the euro area, weakening growth prospects, and low
profitability. Foreign parents of the large banks are likely to reinforce a risk-averse stance as they
seek to strengthen their capital ratios at the consolidated level. The deterioration of the economic
outlook will also weigh on the demand side.

F. Medium-term outlook, risks, and data quality
20.
The medium-term outlook is broadly favorable, as Macedonia builds on its advantages
of low wages and taxes and implements structural reforms to boost potential growth and
employment. The authorities’ pro-growth policies include preserving a low tax environment
(including flat 10 percent corporate and personal income tax rates), investing in infrastructure and
education, and promoting FDI. They are also pursuing structural reforms to improve the business
climate, and adopted a new Energy Law to strengthen the long-term prospects of the energy sector.
These policies have started to pay off, with several foreign investment projects underway. Reflecting
these reforms, Macedonia’s global ranking in the World Bank’s Doing Business report improved
from 34th in 2011 to 22nd in 2012. Other competitiveness indicators paint a more mixed but still

generally favorable picture compared to neighboring countries (Box 3). Key areas to unlock faster
growth and lower unemployment include improved property rights, judicial reform, and education,
where Macedonia scores low on international indices.
21.

The principal risks arise from developments in the euro area (Annex I).


A deeper recession in the euro area would affect Macedonia through lower exports and
remittances and a slowdown in FDI, which would reduce growth and could lead to a loss of
foreign reserves.



In the event of significant intensification of the euro area crisis, pressures on Macedonia’s
exchange rate peg could emerge, potentially leading to outflows of bank deposits and
pressures on foreign reserves.



An adverse scenario in Greece could damage confidence in Greek bank subsidiaries in
Macedonia and also prompt deposit outflows.

22.
Economic and financial statistics continue to be broadly adequate, and the authorities
have subscribed to SDDS. The authorities improved the timeliness and periodicity of their data
provision, leading to SDDS subscription in November 2011. Some remaining data shortcomings
include quality of quarterly real GDP time series and incomplete fiscal data on public enterprises.
The authorities are drawing on EU and IMF technical assistance to further improve national account
statistics.
Box 2. Macedonia’s Response to Past Policy Advice from the Fund
During the 2010 Article IV consultations (concluded in January 2011), Directors commended Macedonia for
its sound macroeconomic and financial policies, while identifying sizeable downside risks from potential
international spillovers.
On fiscal policy Directors agreed that the 2011 deficit target of 2.5 percent of GDP struck an appropriate
balance between debt sustainability and the need to support growth. They advised that the authorities should
consolidate the deficit once a robust recovery is underway. They also stressed the importance of developing the
domestic public debt market. On monetary policy, Directors believed that interest rates were at appropriate levels
and saw limited scope for further reductions. Directors praised the authorities’ commitment to improve data
quality and subscribe to Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS).
The authorities’ policies over the past year have been broadly consistent with the advice of Directors. The
government met its 2011 fiscal deficit target on a cash basis, after containing expenditures in response to revenue
underperformance. The 2012 fiscal deficit target of 2.5 percent of GDP is appropriate in light of slowing growth.
The government took initial steps towards deepening the domestic bond market with two issuances of 5-year
treasury bonds. The NBRM kept interest rates unchanged through April 2012, when it initiated a limited easing, in
the context of a contained current account deficit and increasing international reserves. The authorities have
subscribed to SDDS.

much higher among those who have not completed secondary schooling. Moreover, there is anecdotal evidence that
employers have difficulty finding qualified workers, despite high unemployment.

The authorities’ strategy to reduce unemployment focuses on two fronts. First, it seeks to promote increased growth
through improving infrastructure and attracting investment. Second, it is pursuing initiatives to improve education and
training to better match skills with employer needs. The unemployment agency has designed active labor market polices,
including vocational training and internships. The government also recently passed legislation making school enrollment
compulsory through the secondary level.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Fiscal Policy and Financing
23.
Staff views the planned 2012 fiscal stance as broadly appropriate based on cyclical and
debt sustainability grounds, but consolidation will be needed over the medium term to
stabilize debt ratios at safe levels. In staff’s view, debt sustainability should provide the long-term
anchor for fiscal policy, with cyclical considerations also playing a role, subject to availability of
financing.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT



FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA

The government debt ratio was 28.6 percent of
GDP at end-2011, which is moderate and
consistent with debt sustainability. Staff
recommended reducing the fiscal deficit to below
1.5 percent of GDP over the medium term, which
will be required to stabilize public debt at 30
percent of GDP, consistent with previous staff
advice. Low deficits would also provide space for
counter-cyclical policies during future downturns.
Consolidation must be undertaken in a
medium-term budget framework and will require
the government to prioritize among competing
expenditure goals (¶28).

Foreign borrowing will provide the main source of budget financing in 2012. In
December 2011 the government concluded an external bank loan of €130 million (backed by a
World Bank guarantee). In April 2012 it announced that it had agreed on terms for a €250 million
five-year loan from a foreign bank (which requires approval by parliament before it can be finalized).
Finally, the authorities expect to borrow US$100 million from the World Bank through two DPLs in
late 2012. These sources, together with €60 million in planned domestic Treasury debt issuance, will
cover the 2012 fiscal deficit, pre-finance repayment of a €175 million Eurobond maturing in January
2013, and provide a significant buffer for 2013.

26.
Debt financing remains a significant medium-term challenge. Although the authorities
have met their financing needs for the next year, they remain dependent on access to external
markets to finance their deficits and repay some €750 million (10 percent of GDP) in private external
debt and IMF loans maturing in 2014-17. Such reliance on external financing poses significant risks
in light of uncertainties and volatility in external capital markets. This vulnerability was evident in
2010 and 2011, when the authorities drew on official sources (the SDR allocation in 2010 and the
PLL in 2011) in response to unfavorable conditions on private external markets.
27.
Public debt management reform to deepen domestic markets and improve access to
external sources should be a key policy priority. The domestic debt market is small, with
outstanding debt equal to only 5 percent of GDP (excluding 2 percent of GDP in structural bonds
issued in compensation for transition-related expenses). Deeper domestic debt markets will diversify
funding sources and help insulate public finances from disruptions in access to external markets.
Compared to other countries in the region and elsewhere, the domestic public debt market is small
and dominated by short-term securities, suggesting there is significant room for growth (see
Selected Issues Paper). Moreover, the ample liquidity of the domestic banking system, including
significant holdings of central bank debt instruments, points to room for increased domestic public
debt without crowding out lending to the private sector (¶35). A deeper domestic debt market, with

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA

longer maturities (which will require higher interest rates than those on short-term T-bills), will also
help to build a domestic yield curve and support development of private debt markets. In this
context, the auction of a five-year treasury bond in September 2011 was a welcome development,
although a similar auction in December 2011 raised a smaller amount because the government
failed to offer higher interest rates in response to changed market conditions. The authorities should
also continue to access private external debt markets at an early stage to pre-finance their
borrowing needs, as they are doing in 2012, to guard against the risk that market conditions turn
unfavorable.
Box 4. Debt Market Development in Macedonia
The public debt market in Macedonia is very small
and is dominated by short-term Treasury bills. This
has required the authorities to rely on external markets
for public financing, exposing the country to volatility
of market access. Development of domestic debt
markets and a more strategic approach to external
debt issuance will help strengthen the stability of
public finances. Issuance of longer-term debt will
entail somewhat higher interest rates, but will reduce
rollover risk and help establish a reference yield curve
for private debt markets. The experience of other
countries in the region suggests there is considerable
scope for deepening domestic debt markets, although
this will take time.
An IMF technical assistance mission in October 2011
and an Article IV Selected Issues Paper identified a
number of key recommendations, including:

forecasting, commitment control systems, and medium-term budgeting, in order to improve
budgeting practices and avoid arrears.


16

The revenue assumptions in the 2012 budget are optimistic (even after the revisions in the
supplementary budget), implying the need for further expenditure reductions. The

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

authorities have a strong track of reducing expenditure to meet their fiscal targets. However,
more realistic revenue forecasts would allow earlier and better planning and prioritization to
match expenditures with available resources. Moreover, larger contingency buffers in the
budget would help to accommodate revenue shortfalls.


Commitment control systems should be strengthened and budget laws and procedures
should be strictly enforced to prevent budget users from making commitments that are not
matched by budget appropriations. The government should also ensure that annual budgets
provide funding for multiyear contracts signed in previous years. Progress in these areas will
help to prevent government payment arrears such as those that arose in 2011. The
government should make public the amount of any arrears and commit to reduce them over
time. The practice of seeking to reschedule amounts due to private suppliers should be
discontinued because suppliers may feel they have little choice if they want continued access
to government contracts, and on grounds of transparency.



A greater focus on medium-term budgeting would allow the government to set its priorities
based on a realistic assessment of available fiscal space and required trade-offs. In this
context, the government’s intentions over the medium term to increase investment
spending, raise pensions and public sector wages, and reduce the labor tax wedge—without
raising taxes—will be difficult to achieve without increased deficits or cuts in other spending.
To accommodate higher investment spending the authorities should avoid discretionary
pension increases and continue current policies of public wage restraint. It should also move
forward with plans for public administration reform to improve efficiency and contain the
wage bill over the medium term, which would help to create fiscal space.

29.
The authorities confirmed their commitment to reduce spending in the event of
revenue shortfalls, so as to meet their fiscal deficit target. They explained that the 2012 budget
assumptions on growth and revenue performance had been set in the third quarter of 2011, before
the deterioration in euro areas growth prospects had become apparent to them. The authorities
recognized that revenue growth was likely to fall well short of budget assumptions, which motivated
the spending cuts in the proposed supplementary budget. They were committed to further
expenditure restraint if needed to meet their deficit target.
30.
The authorities’ medium-term fiscal plans call for continued moderate deficits to
provide room to build infrastructure, while keeping public debt at sustainable levels. The
authorities believed that infrastructure investment—including roads, railroads, and natural gas
networks—is a critical priority for growth, and that this justified maintaining moderate deficits on
the order of 2–2½ percent of GDP over the medium term. They indicated that their target ceiling for
government debt was 30 to 35 percent of GDP (a de facto increase from the previous ceiling of
30 percent), which provided the medium-term anchor for fiscal policy. The authorities indicated that
pension increases and social contribution reductions would be undertaken only if they could be
accommodated without increasing the deficit beyond the targeted range.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA

31.
The authorities agreed on the need to improve public financial management systems.
In particular, they indicated that they would upgrade Treasury IT systems in line with
recommendations by a recent Fund TA mission so that all budget users would be required to enter
detailed information on annual and multiyear spending commitments into the Treasury information
system. They believed that in addition to providing for better control over spending commitments,
this would support the medium-term budget process by improving baseline spending estimates.
The government acknowledged only nominal amounts of arrears outside the delayed payments to
external medical suppliers and VAT refund delays. However, the government believed that the
spending reductions in the supplemental budget and the action to secure full financing for the 2012
budget early in the year would help to prevent payment delays from arising in the future.
32.
The authorities agreed on the importance of public debt management and
development of domestic debt markets. They welcomed many of the recommendations of the
recent Fund technical assistance mission in this area. However, the authorities were less certain than
staff about the room for expanding the domestic debt market without crowding out private
investment, and they were concerned that offering higher interest rates in order to place more debt
would lead to higher bank loan rates.

B. Monetary Policy and International Reserves
33.
The exchange rate peg against the
euro has served Macedonia well, delivering
low inflation, a stable real exchange rate, and
moderate volatility of output. CGER estimates
do not indicate significant misalignment, and the
medium-term balance of payments appears
sustainable. Staff continues to view the peg as
appropriate for Macedonia, provided supportive
macroeconomic policies remain in place.

34.
The authorities believed the recent changes to the monetary policy framework were
consistent with the exchange rate peg and affirmed their readiness to raise interest rates if
necessary to respond to potential exchange rate pressures. They explained that the changes had
been introduced against the background of a significant increase in foreign exchange reserves,
favorable BoP developments and prospects, low core inflation, a negative output gap, and subdued
credit growth. In this context they believed the new policies would improve credit conditions in the
economy, boost money market development and would bring a side benefit of improving the
central bank balance sheet position by reducing interest expenses on central bank bills. The NBRM
expected that the new framework could lead to some increase in banks’ holdings of foreign assets in
lieu of central bank bills and a corresponding lower accumulation of NBRM reserves. However, they
believed that bank foreign assets provided a useful buffer to support the exchange rate peg.
35.
Staff broadly shared the authorities’ assessment on monetary policy. Staff agreed that
economic developments provided a supportive context for the recent modest relaxation of

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

prudential requirements and changes to the monetary policy framework. They emphasized that
reductions in the benchmark interest rate should be pursued cautiously and that the NBRM should
remain ready to respond to any BoP pressures that might arise. Staff did not expect the modest
easing would have a significant impact on bank lending, in light of the already ample levels of bank
liquidity. Slow credit growth primarily reflected low demand by borrowers and a more cautious
approach to risk by banks. Staff also underscored that the overriding objective of monetary policy
should be to protect the exchange rate peg and that credit growth and central bank balance sheet
considerations should be subordinate. While the interest rate spread between the central bank
benchmark rate and the ECB policy rate remained above levels of 2006–08—suggesting potential
room for easing—the latitude for maneuver appears limited, given that the policy rate spread over
Euro area rates has historically tracked measures of risk premium (see Selected Issues Paper).
36.
The authorities had also considered the tail risk event that euro area stress could
intensify. In such an event they believed the best course would be to continue to peg. They
believed that the pegged regime had provided a valuable framework for disciplined macroeconomic
policies and had helped to preserve competitiveness.

Staff encouraged the authorities to be prepared for adverse scenarios. Specifically:


The authorities should make progress on closing remaining gaps in the NBRM’s regulatory
toolkit by expanding its ability to provide emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) and passing
legislation to ensure adequate powers to impose fit and proper requirements on bank
owners and managers and to intervene insolvent banks without being subject to court
challenge. These gaps had been identified in the most recent (2008) FSAA and in the 2011
PLL arrangement and should be given greater priority in light of external risks.

Staff advised the NBRM to undertake daily monitoring of deposits to ensure early warning of
any negative trends, to engage in contingency planning, and to review its bank resolution
powers.

38.
The authorities agreed with the need for heightened contingency planning and a full
set of central bank powers to respond to adverse developments. They noted that the recently
established Financial Stability Committee was now meeting quarterly and was focused on closing
the gaps in the regulatory toolkit that had been identified in the FSAA. Although the NBRM still
lacked powers to provide ELA against private loans, it had made progress in expanding the class of
acceptable collateral. The NBRM had also put in place procedures to monitor deposits on a daily
basis and believed that its bank resolution framework was adequate.
39.
The authorities and staff agreed it was important to strike the right balance between
stability-oriented policies and supporting credit growth to the economy. The NBRM
acknowledged the need to preserve adequate liquidity buffers and had reviewed its liquidity
requirement framework and determined that it was consistent with the Basel III framework. The
NBRM also conducted liquidity stress tests on a regular basis, and believed that banks had adequate
liquidity to withstand a severe scenario. The authorities shared staff’s concern that deleveraging by
parent banks could result in tighter credit conditions.

D. Risks
40.
The authorities broadly shared staff’s views on risks. They pointed to the
domestically-financed banking system, low public debt, a contained current account deficit and
adequate foreign reserves as important buffers against risks. Nonetheless, they agreed that growth
would suffer in the event of adverse conditions in the euro area, and that in a case of extreme
financial turbulence the exchange rate peg could come under pressure. With respect to spillovers
from the euro area through the banking system, they did not believe Macedonian banks were
directly exposed to their parents but were mindful of possible confidence effects and were
monitoring deposit trends closely.

STAFF APPRAISAL
41.
Macedonia is well-positioned to avoid an economic downturn in the baseline scenario
of a shallow recession in the euro area. Growth should be supported by a solid pipeline of FDI, a
banking sector that is predominantly funded by domestic deposits, underlying improvements in the
export base, and a contained current account deficit. However, a more adverse scenario in the euro
area could put growth at risk and lead to external financing pressures.
42.
The policy mix appears to be appropriate. The fiscal policy stance is close to neutral and
consistent with debt sustainability, while monetary policy reflects an appropriate balance between
stability and growth. In the event of an adverse external scenario and slower growth, policies would
likely need to become more pro-cyclical. Monetary tightening could be needed to protect the
exchange rate peg, while financing constraints would constrain the use of automatic stabilizers in

20

fiscal policy. Over the medium term, the fiscal deficit should be contained to below 1.5 percent of
GDP to stabilize debt ratios at below 30 percent of GDP.
43.
Reliance on external borrowing from private markets to meet fiscal financing needs is
a vulnerability, which calls for greater focus on public debt management and deepening of
domestic debt markets. The authorities’ decision to access external debt markets early in 2012 to
pre-finance the January 2013 Eurobond repayment was welcome in light of the potential volatility of
external market conditions. Nonetheless, looking forward Macedonia remains exposed to
disruptions in access to external debt markets, which are its main source of fiscal financing.
Development of deeper domestic debt markets is needed to diversify funding sources and reduce
risks. The authorities must be prepared to offer higher interest rates, especially on longer-term
instruments, to expand the domestic market.
44.
The authorities should focus on improving public financial management, including
revenue forecasting, commitment control, and medium-term budgeting. This will help to
reduce the risk of arrears and allow a more considered evaluation of medium-term spending
priorities within the available budget envelope. In the event that arrears arise, transparency about
their amount and a firm commitment to repay them over time would be desirable.
45.
Macedonia faces good medium-term growth prospects. To achieve higher growth
potential it will be important for Macedonia to continue to focus on improving the business
environment, infrastructure, and education, and to preserve its track record of sound
macroeconomic management.
46.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation will be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

1/ Consolidated general government gross debt.
2/ Derived as [(r - (1+g - g + (1+r]/(1+g++g)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate;  = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;  = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and  = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as (1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of April 30, 2012)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance and
monitoring purposes. Areas that would benefit most from further improvement are national accounts
and government finance statistics.

National accounts: Quarterly GDP data in constant pricesfrom the production approach have been
published since September 2011.. Employment data from the company survey continue to be
unreliable.
Price statistics: The CPI series are rebased every year and this has caused small discrepancies in
historical data.

Government finance statistics: Data coverage on government below-the-line financing from
National Bank deposits is inadequate, as a result of different coverage of accounts between the
Ministry of Finance and the National Bank – the government does not regularly report Treasury Single
Account and budgetary FX account balances. In addition, data on arrears, including those on public
hospitals, as well as data on state enterprises, which are not part of the central government, are
limited. Macedonia does not report government finance statistics to the Fund for publication in either
the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSMY) or the International Financial Statistics (IFS).

Monetary sector: EUR receives a monthly electronic report of monetary statistics, covering the
balance sheet of the central bank, the commercial banks and other depository corporations.

External sector: Balance of payment data are compiled on monthly basis. The compilation and
coverage have improved in recent years, and most of the recommendations from the 2004 ROSC
mission and the late 2006 STA mission were implemented
II. Data Standards and Quality

FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA

COORDINATION OF IMF AND WORLD BANK WORK
PLANS
1.
At discussion in May 2011, IMF and World Bank country teams for FYR Macedonia
agreed that growth is returning to Macedonia, but that the country continues to face
challenges that include the need to raise potential growth and tackle high unemployment.
Coming out of the 2009 recession, growth in 2010 reached just 1.8 percent, but has been gradually
accelerating since mid-2010 and is projected to rise to 3 percent in 2011 with domestic demand
adding to the sound export performance. In keeping with returning growth, fiscal revenues are
broadly in line with the budget. Financing for this year’s deficit has been secured by drawing € 220
million from the IMF precautionary credit line. The banking sector remains broadly in good shape,
with the quality of its loan portfolio starting to recover from the 2009-10 deterioration. Balance of
payments pressures remain subdued, as the current account deficit remains moderate and official
foreign exchange reserves are above pre-crisis levels and broadly adequate by most standard
metrics. The exchange rate peg to the Euro, while beneficial for stability, will continue to require
disciplined economic policies. While external financing needs appear manageable, a slowdown in
main economic partners or further pressures on oil and food prices may renew pressures on the
balance of payments. Against this background Macedonia’s main macroeconomic challenges are to
avoid procyclical fiscal policies and maintain fiscal sustainability by meeting the government’s deficit
targets; pursue monetary and fiscal policies that are supportive of the exchange rate regime, price
stability and of economic growth; and safeguard the stability of the financial system, including
through continued sound supervision and regulation as well as contingency planning. Beyond the
current year, maintaining fiscal sustainability while securing adequate budget financing remain
important challenges. In the medium-run, raising potential growth by pursuing structural reform
remains essential.
2.
Based on this shared assessment, the teams identified six areas of structural reform as
macrocritical in light of their importance for stimulating private sector activity, and ensuring fiscal
and external sustainability and financial sector stability.


Public expenditure management and public finance. Improving budget planning and the
structure of public spending are key areas for improvement. Accurate revenue and expenditure
forecasts, based on prudent growth assumptions, are needed to ensure realistic budgets and
avoid supplementary budgets that result from revenue underperformance or underestimation of
spending. Moreover, further expanding the medium-term elements of the fiscal framework
would help to anchor fiscal policy around the goal of public debt sustainability. The domestic
public debt market needs to be developed over the medium term to provide a larger and more
reliable domestic source of fiscal financing and reduce reliance on external funding.



Tax administration. Continued reforms in this area will help to improve compliance and reduce
informality, contributing to a broader and more stable tax base that allows lower tax rates and
adequate fiscal financing. Macedonia has already achieved major gains by unifying the collection

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

of social contributions (pension, health and unemployment) and integrating them with personal
income tax collection, resulting in significant improvement in compliance.


Social sector spending. Pension reform. Considerable reforms have been implemented to put
the system on a sustainable financial basis. Still, with the recent reduction in contribution rates
and changes to the pension indexation formula, the budgetary transfers made to the Pension
and Disability Insurance Fund (PDIF) increased. Social safety net. The social safety net is complex,
with a large number of overlapping programs that are not well-targeted and fail to reach some
of most vulnerable people in society. Efforts are needed to ensure that an increasing share of
transfers reach the poor. Health Sector. Pressures recently re-emerged in the health sector as the
contribution rate was lowered while the basic benefits package remained underfunded and costs
increased. The authorities recognize the need to improve the long-run sustainability of the basic
benefits package and several options for its redefinition are being considered based on a
actuarial analysis supported by the World Bank.



Improving competitiveness. The business climate improved in Macedonia in recent years, but
a number of challenges remain which will require strong, concerted medium-term efforts. Areas
where further efforts can pay off include streamlining administrative procedures, improving
contract enforcement, and facilitating foreign trade, particularly further simplifying procedures
and promoting their usage. Advances are needed in safeguarding property rights and the rule
of law, and facilitating competition through improved market entry and exit. Though the burden
of excessive regulations has been reduced it still impedes economic activity in certain areas and
there is some evidence that policy uncertainty has increased.



Financial sector. Continued strong financial sector supervision and planned improvements in
contingency planning will help to ensure the authorities are able to monitor the health of the
system carefully and respond appropriately to problems that emerge. This includes powers of
the banking regulator to impose fit and proper requirements on bank owners and to intervene
in banks that are not viable. Full implementation in practice of the MoU on crisis coordination
and cooperation between the NBRM, the Finance Ministry (MoF), and other agencies, remains
important to provide a quick response to threats. Increased attention should be put to nonbanking financial sector institutions over the upcoming period to ensure that risks remain
manageable.



Electricity sector. The new Energy Law goes a long way towards full compliance with the
country’s obligations under the Energy Community Treaty. The adoption of secondary legislation
and full implementation of the Law will create a more transparent regulatory framework and
ensure a tariff structure that reflects the costs of service delivery. This will help eliminate hidden
and cross-subsidies that are poorly targeted, encourage inefficient patterns of consumption,
damage incentives for investment, and impose fiscal or quasi-fiscal costs. New investment in
generation capacity is also needed in light of inadequate domestic supplies. In view of financial
and environmental considerations, end-use energy efficiency improvement, use of PPPs and
renewable energy sources should be promoted.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 9

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

3.

FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA

The teams agreed on the following division of labor:



The Bank recently began an assessment of the FYR Macedonia’s competitiveness. In
particular, the assessment will try to identify policy measures to: (i) facilitate the expansion of
exports, as well as expand the range of products and service exported; (ii) upgrade the quality
and value added of export; and (iii) support sectors that have the potential to generate jobs.
The findings of this assessment will feed into the upcoming Macedonia Competitiveness
Development Policy Loan series.



The Bank also started the preparation of the new Country Economic Memorandum which
should help define an overall growth strategy for Macedonia by integrating sustainability and
green growth into the main objectives of stronger growth, job creation and attracting FDI and
EU accession. The objective is to support the Government in: (i) assessing the economic costs
and benefits of a shift to greener growth taking into account projected climate change; and with
this knowledge, (ii) prioritizing actions for implementation.



The Fund will retain the lead in tax administration reform. It has a full-time resident advisor
in place (until August 2011, funded by the Dutch government) as well as a full program of
technical assistance missions. Priorities for the coming year include reviewing the progress in
modernizing revenue administration, addressing compliance problems that have emerged with
the economic slowdown, increasing training for Public Revenue Office staff, and coordinating
technical assistance with other donors.



The Bank will continue the dialogue with the Government in order to reassure the
sustainability of the pension system and prevent a drain on general tax revenues.



An Institutional Development Fund (IDF) will also support institutional development in of
the Ministry of Health in setting up a modern accreditation system to help monitor and evaluate
the quality of care provided by health sector institutions with standards, procedures and
capacity to meet international standards. The accreditation of health facilities will be used as a
tool for continuous quality improvement and ensuring the protection of patients’ rights.



Social safety net. The Bank will continue to advise the government on measures to improve the
functioning of the social safety net through its Conditional Cash Transfers (CCT) operation and
the Programmatic Poverty Assessment analytical work. Immediate priorities include introduction
of a cash benefit management information system and continued implementation of a
conditional cash transfer program to ensure compliance with requirements for mandatory
secondary school enrollment. Streamlining and consolidation of cash benefits and their
improved administration and targeting are expected over the medium-term.



Both the Fund and the Bank will encourage the authorities to implement realistic,
predictable, and transparent budget procedures. The Fund will also encourage the authorities
to anchor fiscal policies in a credible medium-term fiscal framework and is prepared to offer

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

technical assistance for that purpose. In addition, the Fund will provide technical assistance on
domestic debt market development.


A considerable part of the World Bank’s portfolio is providing support to improve the
business environment. Infrastructure improvements are supported under the Regional and
Local Roads Project, Municipal Services Improvement Project and the Second Trade and
Transport Facilitation Project. At the same time, the Real Estate Cadastre and Registration
Project, the Legal and Judicial Implementation Project and the Agriculture Strengthening and
Accession Project support development and reform of institutions to support growth. The
ongoing Technical Assistance for Higher Education aims to assist the authorities in building
skills, while a planned regional report will also evaluate Research & Development practices in the
country. An innovative regional Disaster Management will provide financial protection from
losses caused by climate change and geo-hazards.



The Fund and Bank have both been involved in financial sector reform, including through
the November 2008 joint FSAA update as well as the extensive dialogue during the preparation
of the 2009 World Bank First Development Policy Loan (DPL1). The Fund has also provided
technical assistance in the area of contingency planning, stress testing of the banking system,
and macro modeling. The Bank, through the Policy-based Guarantee (PBG) and the Balkan
Financial Sector Technical Assistance Facility will: i) (with input from IMF staff) assist the
authorities in reviewing the bank resolution framework and the operational capacity of the
Deposit Insurance Fund and ii) provide advice on the operational rules for the Financial Stability
Committee and the design of a solvency test in case of Lender of Last Resort request. The Bank
will also work with the authorities to improve the framework for Motor Third Party Liability
(MTPL) insurance



The Bank has the lead on electricity sector reform. It will continue to encourage the adoption
over time of realistic prices of electricity and elimination of subsidized rates. As part of the
dialogue, the Bank is advising the government on promoting use of alternative ways of financing
energy sector investments (PPPs, including by having IFC as a transaction advisor in a large
hydropower concession project) as well as diversifying energy sources (use of gas, renewables,
wind etc.). The Bank is also providing assistance to strengthen the Energy Regulatory
Commission. The Bank’s Energy Community of South East Europe Adaptable Programmatic Loan
3 (ECSEE APL3) and the Lukovo Pole Renewable Energy Project support improvements of
interconnectivity and the transmission grid and reliability of production. Finally, the recently
restructured Global Environment Facility project promotes energy efficiency in the public sector.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
On June 1, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Macedonia. 1
Background
The economic recovery is losing steam due to adverse external developments. Growth
was 3 percent in 2011, but was slowing in the second half of the year, which was visible
in softening exports, sales, production, and credit. Growth is expected to slow to
2 percent in 2012. The absence of significant imbalances in the Macedonian economy
and limited external financial linkages will help to contain the impact on Macedonia of
weak growth and financial stress in the euro area. Meanwhile, inflation peaked at
3.9 percent on average in 2011 on the back of sharp rises in food and fuel prices, but
core inflation was lower at 1.1 percent. Inflation is expected to decline to 2 percent in
2012. The current account deficit was contained in 2011, at 2.8 percent of GDP, as a
pick-up in domestic demand and higher fuel prices were largely offset by private
transfers. The current account deficit is expected to widen and then level off at around
5 percent of GDP in the medium term, largely matching the inflow of foreign direct
investment. Meanwhile, international reserves increased significantly to over €2 billion at
end-2011, which is a broadly adequate level, and have been stable in 2012.
In the financial sector, non-performing loans (NPLs) remained at elevated levels at just
below 10 percent. Still, provisions exceed NPLs, and the system remained free of
pressures on liquidity or solvency. Moreover, the banking system remained profitable
after provisioning, capital adequacy ratios remained close to 17 percent, well-above
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings
up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

their regulatory minimum, and bank liquidity was ample. Reliance on domestic deposits
as the primary funding source, combined with minimal reliance on external funding and
the lack of exposure to risky external assets, have helped shield the banking system
from euro area developments. Both deposits and loans have continued to increase
modestly.
On fiscal policy, the authorities achieved their 2011 deficit target on a cash basis, by
reducing spending in line with revenue shortfalls, although the deficit would have been
somewhat larger if arrears on government payments and VAT refunds were included.
The 2012 budget called for a deficit of 2½ percent of GDP, but was based on highly
optimistic growth and revenue assumptions. The supplementary budget submitted to
parliament in April 2012 reduced projected revenues and also reduced expenditures,
preserving the original deficit target. The revised revenue assumptions are still
somewhat optimistic—by about 1 percent of GDP according to staff projections—but the
government has committed to adjust expenditures further if necessary to achieve its
deficit target. In this context, Macedonia has a track record of meeting its cash deficit
targets, cutting expenditure when needed to achieve its target.
The authorities announced that they have secured a foreign bank loan that will meet
remaining 2012 fiscal financing needs and provide resources to repay a Eurobond
maturing in January 2013. The loan is expected to be disbursed in the first half of 2012.
The National Bank left interest rates unchanged from December 2010 until April 2012,
while modestly relaxing prudential requirements that had been tightened as a crisis
response in 2008–09. In April, it introduced a set of measures aimed at easing credit
conditions and furthering money market development, including a gradual reduction in
the amount of outstanding 28-day central bank bills, the introduction of a 7 day and
overnight deposit facility and a weekly repo auction. In early May 2012, it lowered the
maximum rate on central bank bills by 25 bps to 3.75 percent. These gradual easing
measures were taken against a background of favorable balance of payments
conditions, slowing growth, subdued inflation, and modest credit growth.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that, while economic growth has slowed, Macedonia’s
medium-term outlook remains generally favorable. To address challenges posed by
possible adverse spillovers from the euro area, Directors encouraged the authorities to
persevere in their pursuit of macroeconomic and financial stability, building on advances
made thus far.
Directors considered the current fiscal stance appropriate. They noted that continued
fiscal consolidation will be important to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio at prudent levels.
In this context, Directors were reassured by the authorities’ intention to meet the 2012
deficit target but noted that further expenditure restraint might be needed. They
underscored that a sound medium-term fiscal framework would help prioritize needed
social spending.
Directors agreed that measures to improve public debt management and deepen the
domestic debt markets should remain policy priorities. Progress on these fronts would

3
reduce dependence on external financing, which could be volatile. Directors also
emphasized the need for stronger public financial management that would improve
budget planning and prevent arrears.
Directors agreed that the current exchange rate arrangement has served Macedonia
well. They encouraged the central bank to stand ready to increase policy rates in the
event that external risks materialize and exchange rate pressures emerge.
Directors concurred that the banking sector remains stable and well capitalized. They
noted its limited reliance on external financing and ample liquidity. Nonetheless,
Directors recommended continued vigilance and encouraged the authorities to make
further progress on addressing regulatory gaps and strengthening their crisis response
capacity.
Directors agreed that well-designed infrastructure investments and further labor market
reforms are essential to raise potential growth and durably reduce unemployment. Steps
in these directions would also cement Macedonia’s success in attracting foreign direct
investment.

1/ Contribution to growth

Statement by Mr. Snel and Mr. Hadzi-Vaskov on Former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia
June 1, 2012
The Macedonian authorities would like to thank the IMF team for the useful analysis and
recommendations included in the staff report. The authorities consider that staff’s analysis
adequately represents the current macroeconomic situation in Macedonia, with a broadly
balanced assessment of the strengths and risks, in particular those related to the challenges
stemming from the euro zone. As demonstrated with past practice, the authorities’ policies
over the past year have been consistent with the advice of Directors during the last Article IV
consultations.
Economic Developments
Macedonia has sound economic fundamentals and maintains a strong track record of solid
macroeconomic and financial policies. After growing by 5.2 percent in the first half of 2011,
economic activity significantly slowed in the second half of the year mainly due to worsening
conditions in trading partners, achieving average growth in 2011 of 3 percent. Against the
background of the unfavorable projections for Macedonia’s main trading partners, the
authorities’ view on the growth outlook in 2012 is similar to staff’s, with prospects for
intensification of economic activity in the second half of the year, after a slowdown in the
first half.
Headline inflation accelerated moderately to an average of 3.9 percent in 2011, mainly as a
result of higher food and energy prices, while core inflation remained low and stable at
1.1 percent. Capital inflows contributed to further accumulation of foreign exchange reserves
to the historically highest level of EUR 2,069 million at year-end.
The pursuit of sound macroeconomic policies in Macedonia has been further acknowledged
by the credit rating agencies. In May 2012 Standard and Poor’s affirmed its BB credit rating
assessment with stable outlook for the Republic of Macedonia on foreign and local currency.
This rating agency based the confirmation of the credit rating on favorable fiscal and external
debt stock positions and on the prospect of eventual accession to the European Union, which
acts as a policy anchor. In November 2011 Fitch also affirmed its BB+ credit rating with
stable outlook on the Republic of Macedonia for foreign and local currency, based on stable
macroeconomic policies, low debt stock and a stable banking system.
The government, having reached an agreement on a five-year foreign bank loan that will
secure its financing needs in 2012 and into 2013, would not need to draw upon the
precautionary and liquidity line (PLL). Therefore, the authorities would not pursue
completion of the review, allowing it to expire in January 2013.

2

Fiscal Policy
Macedonia has maintained fiscal discipline and a track record of prudent fiscal policy in
favorable as well as in challenging times. The Government met its deficit target of
2.55 percent of GDP in 2011 and remains strongly committed to achieve its target of
2.5 percent of GDP in 2012. Faced with deteriorating external conditions, in April the
Government prepared and submitted to Parliament a supplementary budget with reductions
on the expenditure side by 4.5 percent compared to the initial budget, but without change in
the deficit target. Macedonia’s government debt-to-GDP ratio at 26.8 percent by the end of
Q1 in 2012 is among the lowest in Europe, having decreased significantly over the last
decade.
The authorities are committed to improve the public financial management systems,
including by upgrading the Treasury IT systems, in line with recommendations by a recent
IMF TA mission. The authorities also share staff’s view about the importance of further
development of the domestic debt market and have undertaken steps in this direction with the
issuance of 5-year treasury bonds starting in September 2011.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
Despite increased risks stemming from the external environment in 2011, the National Bank
of the Republic of Macedonia (NBRM) managed to extend its strong track record,
successfully maintaining its objectives of stable inflation and a stable denar/euro nominal
exchange rate.
In light of the last changes in the operational monetary policy framework, the NBRM
authorities would like to emphasize that they aim at its expansion and enhanced flexibility,
while simultaneously supporting the further development of the financial markets,
particularly the money markets. Compared to the old framework, where the banks' borrowing
from the central bank was available only by an overnight lending facility at a relatively high
interest rate, the regular weekly repo operations introduced by the NBRM within the new
framework will create an alternative source of bank funding at the policy rate. This
instrument, together with the introduction of the 7-day and overnight deposit facility will
support greater flexibility in liquidity management of the banking system. In order to
promote the use of repo operations and to amplify interbank activity, the NBRM reduced the
frequency of CB-bills auctions from once a week to once within the period of reserve
requirement, and limited the offered amount of CB-bills. The maximum interest rate of
CB-bills was set at the level of 4 percent (the same as the previous benchmark rate), while
quantities offered are adjusted according to liquidity conditions in the banking system. This
ensures that the interest rate is close to the targeted maximum interest rate, consistent with
the exchange rate peg policy. In addition to the above mentioned goals, the latest changes in
the operational monetary framework, in particular the regular repo operations, are in line

3

with the recommendation of the Fund TA mission for domestic debt market deepening.
In early May, 2012, the monetary stance was eased slightly, with the policy rate being
reduced by 25 basis points from 4 percent to 3.75 percent. The change in the policy stance
was pursued against the backdrop of a weaker growth outlook and contained inflationary
pressures, expectations for maintenance of a moderate current account deficit, and financial
inflows abundant enough to allow for further accumulation of international reserves. The
NBRM authorities are committed to basing monetary policy on the overriding objective of
protecting the exchange rate peg and ensuring price stability, while balance sheet
considerations are subordinated to the primary goal, as has always been evidenced.
The NBRM authorities agree that an adverse scenario in Greece and increased uncertainty in
the euro area could put additional downward pressure on exports and FDI inflows, but at the
same time they expect some counterbalancing effect from the adjustment of imports.
Additionally, recent developments from Q4 of 2011 and Q1 of 2012 have shown increased
preferences of the private sector for domestic currency savings and strong private transfers
inflows (cash exchange inflows). Thus instead of increased pressure on the foreign exchange
reserves, actually a de-euroization process in the domestic economy was seen.
Financial Sector
The banking system remains stable, maintaining high liquidity and solvency despite
challenges from the external environment. In contrast to the evidence of
deleveraging/disintermediation in other European countries, the banks expanded their
activities, raising the level of financial intermediation. After increasing by 8.5 percent in
2011, mainly supported by a 9.8 percent growth in deposits from non-financial entities,
banks’ assets continued to grow in the first three months of 2012 at a rate of 8.7 percent
year-on-year.
Denar-denominated deposits increased even faster at 16.7 percent in 2011, especially in
December when almost half of the increase took place, indicating a shift in savings
preferences toward domestic currency. Growth of denar deposits continued in the first
months of 2012, at the rate of 21.6 percent (March 2012 relative to March 2011). Credit
growth was somewhat slower at 8.5 percent in 2011, and 8.3 percent in Q1 of 2012.
Banks maintain ample liquidity and the share of liquid assets in total assets increased from
31.2 percent at end-2011 to 31.5 percent at end of March 2012. While nonperforming loans
(NPL) as share of total loans increased from 9.5 percent at end-2011 to 9.9 percent at end of
March 2012, they remain more than fully covered by provisions. The banking system enjoys
a stable and high level of solvency, with the capital adequacy ratio increasing from
16.8 percent at end-2011 to 17.5 percent at end of March 2012, more than double the
prescribed minimum of 8 percent.

4

The Macedonian banking system is not exposed to foreign funding, as it is mostly financed
by domestic deposits. At the same time, it does not have debt holdings of the periphery euro
zone countries. Moreover, recent stress test simulations indicated that the banking sector is
resilient to shocks, including transmission of adverse shocks from Greece, with the capital
adequacy for each bank staying above the prescribed 8 percent minimum.
Reforms Agenda
Besides maintaining macroeconomic and financial stability, the authorities’ efforts are also
focused on implementation of structural reforms aimed at acceleration of growth, continuous
improvement of the business environment, competitiveness enhancements, creation of new
jobs and a sustained decrease in unemployment.
Regulatory reforms aimed at improving the business environment have been recognized by
respected international rankings. The World Bank’s Doing Business 2012 report placed
Macedonia as the 3rd best reformer among 183 countries in the world. Moreover, Macedonia
is ranked 1st in the region, 22nd in the world (in front of many advanced economies), having
improved by 70 positions on the global rankings in the last five years.
The European Commission and the Republic of Macedonia launched the High-Level
Accession Dialogue (HLAD) on March 15, which provides a platform for strengthened
cooperation, policy discussion and debate. Focusing on key reform priorities and challenges,
the HLAD aims at ensuring better preparation for EU membership and acceleration of the EU
integration process of the Republic of Macedonia. Strengthening of the market economy, one
of the five main themes within the HLAD, focuses on a range of actions, aimed at ensuring
better functioning of markets, including active measures to achieve an inclusive and effective
labor market and address the underlying causes of unemployment.
According to the Government program for the period 2011-2015, attracting foreign direct
investment (FDI) remains the key objective towards achieving the Government’s strategic
priority of higher economic growth and decrease in unemployment on a sustainable basis.
Macedonia has been successful in attracting Greenfield FDI, especially in the automotive
components sector. FDI amounted to EUR 304 million or 4.1 percent of GDP in 2011, higher
than the sum for 2009 and 2010. It is also encouraging to see that growth in FDI was solely
due to higher equity capital and reinvested earnings. Based on improvements in the business
climate, a large pipeline of ongoing and planned projects, and implementation of further
(structural) reforms, the authorities expect a continuous increase in FDI matching the levels
of the most favorable pre-crisis years.

5

Concluding Remarks
The authorities consistently value and make use of Fund advice on fiscal, monetary, financial
and other issues. They remain strongly committed to maintain the set of strong
macroeconomic policies and continue with the consistent implementation of structural
reforms aimed at improving the business environment, accelerating economic growth and
enhancing competitiveness. Recognizing that the main risks to the macroeconomic scenario
are related to the duration and depth of turbulence in the euro zone, the authorities closely
monitor developments in different sectors of the domestic economy, stay vigilant to the
sources of uncertainties stemming from the euro zone, and remain ready to undertake
necessary measures.
