Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2005 Consultation
with Equatorial Guinea
Approved by Siddharth Tiwari and Martin Fetherston
May 3, 2005
• The discussions for the Article IV consultation with Equatorial Guinea were held in Malabo
3.

during January 12-26, 2005. The mission included Messrs. Ames (head), Ellyne, Franken,
Kovtun, Yao (all AFR), Mr. Maseda, and Mrs. López (both TGS). Messrs. Bah and Rutayisire
of the Office of the Executive Director for Equatorial Guinea attended the discussions.
Mr. Carstens, Deputy Managing Director, and Mr. Tiwari (AFR) also participated in the final
meetings. The mission overlapped with an IMF fiscal transparency Report on Observance of
Standards and Codes (ROSC) mission and a World Bank Petroleum Sector and Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) mission.

•

The mission met with the President of the Republic; the Prime Minister; the Ministers of
Finance, National Planning, Economy, and Mines; the National Director of the BEAC; and
other senior government officials. It also met with representatives of the private sector, civil
society, and the donor community.

•

At the conclusion of the last Article IV consultation on November 12, 2003, Executive
Directors agreed that oil-related inflows posed considerable challenges to Equatorial Guinea’s
macroeconomic management, including by raising public spending to unsustainable levels and
exerting significant upward pressures on prices and the real exchange rate. They noted that
these developments threatened non-oil activities and had potentially serious economic and
social consequences. Directors underscored the urgency of developing a medium-term strategy
to transform Equatorial Guinea’s oil wealth into sustained growth and development. They noted
that this would require further improvements in governance and transparency, the development
of a transparent framework to manage the county’s oil wealth, and structural reforms to bolster
the non-oil sector.

•

As a member of the Bank of Central African States (BEAC), Equatorial Guinea has accepted
the obligations under Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement (Appendix I).

•

World Bank assistance has been limited mainly to economic sector work, including with regard
to transparency in oil sector resource management (Appendix II).

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Hydrocarbon production will continue to be the engine of growth for the
foreseeable future. Given that oil and gas are nonrenewable resources and have a
limited impact on employment, the authorities need to develop the non-oil economy.

•

Equatorial Guinea should be able to make rapid progress toward achieving the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). As yet, however, living standards of the
majority of the population have not improved measurably.

•

The country has made important progress in increasing transparency and
accountability in oil sector management and public finance. The authorities
indicated their commitment to implement the recommendations of the fiscal
transparency Report on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) and to
participate in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).

•

The fiscal outcome for 2004 was marked by a stronger-than-expected revenue
performance on account of higher oil prices and increases in hydrocarbon
production. However, this was offset by overruns in capital expenditure,
underscoring the need for better public expenditure management (PEM).

•

The liquidity overhang poses a risk to macroeconomic stability and financial
sector soundness. In view of the insufficient instruments available to the regional
central bank to mop up excess liquidity, the burden of adjustment falls on fiscal
policy.

•

The country’s immediate challenge is to prepare a comprehensive development
strategy that channels the country’s oil wealth into priority sectors while
safeguarding macroeconomic stability. In formulating this strategy, the authorities
will need to balance short-term social needs with longer-term intergenerational equity
considerations.

•

Institutional capacity constraints continue to hinder the authorities’ ability to
formulate and monitor macroeconomic policy. Priority should be placed therefore
on building capacity in the areas identified by the fiscal transparency ROSC and
World Bank EITI mission, as well as on the development of a poverty profile and the
carrying out of a public expenditure review (PER).

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The Article IV consultation discussions took place against the backdrop of
expanded hydrocarbon production, high oil prices, widespread poverty, and concerns
over transparency and accountability. With a small population1 and the third-largest
hydrocarbon production in sub-Saharan Africa, Equatorial Guinea should be able to make
rapid progress toward achieving the MDGs. However, the authorities will first need to
implement a development strategy that directs expenditure to priority sectors, strengthens the
country’s institutional capacity, and creates an environment conducive to private sector
investment.
2.
The authorities’ response to past policy advice has been mixed. They have
adopted the Fund’s recommendations on improving the management of the oil sector,
streamlining the tax system, imposing fiscal rules on current and capital spending, and
increasing fiscal transparency. However, progress in keeping aggregate expenditure within
budget and in developing a poverty reduction strategy has been limited. This reflects
weaknesses in the fiscal framework, as well as limited institutional capacity.
II. BACKGROUND
3.
Since oil production began in 1995, the hydrocarbon sector has been the engine
of growth. Hydrocarbon production has increased from 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent (boe)
a day to 282,000 boe a day in 2003, supporting an average annual GDP growth of 31 percent.
Total proven reserves are estimated at 2.5 billion boe.
4.
Unfortunately, this wealth has not yet led to measurable improvements in living
conditions. Despite an increase in per capita GNP from US$346 (1995) to US$2,211 (2003),
the country’s social indicators have not improved commensurately (Appendix III).
5.
The non-oil economy is narrow and accounts for only 10 percent of GDP.
Construction and infrastructure have been the main sources of non-oil growth, driven by high
government capital expenditure. At the same time, labor migration from the rural to the
urban sector in search of higher wages has contributed to the decline in cocoa and coffee.
The contribution of manufacturing, trade, and commerce to GDP is marginal.

1

According to the United Nations Population Division, the country had 462,000 inhabitants in 2001.
The authorities claim, however, that the population was over one million.

-5-

6.
Equatorial Guinea lacks transparency and accountability in oil sector
management and public finances. This was recently underscored by the controversy
associated with the Riggs Bank scandal. With a view to addressing this problem, the
authorities decided to participate in the UK-sponsored EITI and requested the IMF to
conduct a fiscal transparency ROSC.
7.
Equatorial Guinea’s statistical apparatus remains very weak. The lack of timely,
accurate, and comprehensive macroeconomic data hampers policy formulation. These
problems stem principally from severe institutional capacity constraints.2 Nonetheless, data
provided by the authorities are broadly adequate for surveillance (Appendix IV).
III. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
Real sector
8.
Macroeconomic
developments in 2004 continued to
be dominated by the hydrocarbon
sector, with oil and gas accounting
for about 90 percent of GDP,
98 percent of exports, and over
90 percent of government revenues
(Table 1). Daily production of
hydrocarbons rose to
383,000 boe/day in 2004, from
282,000 boe/day in 2003, largely on
account of improved extraction
techniques.
9.
Real GDP grew by about
34 percent in 2004, driven by the
sharp expansion in hydrocarbon
production. Non-oil GDP increased
by about 13 percent—owing to
continued strong performance in the
construction, infrastructure, and
services sectors—stimulated by
government spending. Inflation is
reported to have decelerated to

6 percent in 2004 (down from a peak of 9 percent in 2001).3
Fiscal sector
10.
The fiscal outcome for 2004 was marked by stronger-than-expected revenue
performance offset by substantial over-spending. The overall fiscal surplus was an
estimated 13 percent of GDP and the primary non-oil fiscal deficit an estimated 17 percent of
GDP (153 percent of non-oil GDP), both lower than budgeted (Tables 2 and 3).4
11.
Total revenue, estimated at 37 percent of GDP, was 44 percent higher than
budgeted primarily on account of a larger-than-expected increase in oil receipts. Oil
revenues rose to 34 percent of GDP owing to both higher world oil prices and increases in
production. An audit of the oil companies was also conducted, which resulted in one-time tax
collections of about 4 percent of GDP. Non-oil revenue, equivalent to 3 percent of GDP, rose
by 12 percent relative to budget due to economic growth and improvements in tax
administration.

while other unreconciled
expenditures accounted for some 1 percent of GDP.5 The cost of the government’s
participation in the LNG project, which was outside the budget in the form of an in-kind
contribution, is now captured in the fiscal accounts.6
3

The composition and weights of the CPI have not been updated since 1985 and do not reflect
current household consumption patterns.

4

The staff believe that the primary non-oil fiscal deficit (which excludes oil revenue, oil-related
expenditure, and interest earned on savings) is the most appropriate fiscal indicator for Equatorial
Guinea, as changes in oil revenues result in swings in the overall balance and primary balance even
though fiscal policy remains unchanged (see Section V).
5

Discrepancies between the fiscal and monetary accounts are treated as “unidentified expenditure”
above the line. These expenditures have ranged from -3 to 8 percent of GDP in previous years.
6

The government’s contribution amounted to about 10,000 barrels of oil a day.

-7-

13.
A new tax code became effective January 1, 2005. It replaces the domestic turnover
tax with a value added tax (VAT); raises the corporate income tax; strengthens the
progressive nature of the personal income tax; raises the tax on gross income for
nonresidents; and reduces the withholding tax for nonresidents on dividends paid and interest
earned in Equatorial Guinea.7 In addition, the tax authority was reorganized.
Monetary and financial sector
14.
Monetary developments continue to be
dominated by fiscal policy. Broad money grew by
an estimated 45 percent in 2004, owing to the large
inflow of government oil revenue and transfers
from international oil companies (Table 4). Excess
liquidity in the banking system continued to rise,
but limited viable lending opportunities kept the
growth in credit to the private sector in check,
thereby helping to contain inflationary pressures.

Guinea is broadly sound, with the regional
banking supervisory agency (COBAC) rating the
three commercial banks well above the average of the members of the Central African
Economic and Monetary Union (CEMAC).8 However, compliance with prudential
regulations continued to be mixed, with all three banks meeting the liquidity prudential
ratios, but only two of the banks observing all of the solvency ratios. Nonperforming loans as
a share of total loans increased to 16 percent in 2004 compared to 13 percent at end-2003, as
banks took on riskier loans due to the excess liquidity situation coupled with limited lending
opportunities. These loans, however, were fully provisioned. A fourth bank had its license
approved in 2004 and is expected to commence operation shortly.

Total external public debt declined to an estimated US$115 million at end-2004
(less than 3 percent of GDP), with external debt service becoming insignificant. Arrears
on external debt to Spain were regularized in 2004 and arrears to Italy are expected to be
regularized shortly. The backlog in external debt payments to the Kuwait Fund continued.10

Equatorial Guinea has observed three of the four CEMAC convergence criteria,
the exception being the inflation criterion which it continues to miss by a wide margin
(Box 1).
Box 1. CEMAC Convergence Criteria
The CEMAC treaty on the convergence of economic policies was ratified by members in 1999. In 2001, the
Council of Ministers adopted the convergence criteria, which focus on price stability, and on debt and fiscal
sustainability.

Equatorial Guinea maintains an exchange rate system free of any restrictions on
current transactions. As a member of the CEMAC, Equatorial Guinea’s nominal exchange
rate is fixed and the real effective exchange rate (REER) is driven principally by the inflation
differential vis-à-vis the country’s major trading partners.11 The REER appreciated by about
5 percent in 2004 for an accumulated real appreciation of 32 percent since 2000.

20.
Equatorial Guinea has adopted the CEMAC common external tariff (CET).12
However, the authorities at times have reclassified goods from higher category tariffs to
lower category tariffs and imposed ad hoc taxes and fees on imports of capital goods.
Significant progress has nonetheless been made with regard to eliminating import tariffs on
goods produced within CEMAC. The authorities continue to retain discretion to set of export
tariffs on coffee, cocoa, and logs.

11

Given the significant structural change in the economy since the onset of oil production, any
estimate of the equilibrium real exchange rate is subject to a wide margin of error. Moreover, the lack
of reliable CPI data impedes the quality of the calculation of the REER. Nevertheless, the
accumulated appreciation of the REER relative to that in other CEMAC countries reflects the
dominance of oil in the economy, the higher and increasing levels of government spending, and the
corresponding pressure on domestic prices.

12

The CET comprises four rates (5, 10, 20, and 30 percent).

- 10 -

Transparency and accountability
21.
Important progress has been made with regard to transparency and
accountability. The authorities have been receiving assistance from the World Bank
regarding the country’s participation in the EITI. A fiscal transparency ROSC was completed
in early 2005 (Box 2). Moreover, during the Article IV consultation mission, the staff was
able to reconcile data regarding government oil production shares, exports, and revenues,
and, broadly speaking, the fiscal accounts with monetary accounts.
Box 2. Fiscal Transparency ROSC
An FAD fiscal transparency ROSC mission visited Malabo in November 2004 and January 2005. The main
findings and recommendations are summarized below.
•

Equatorial Guinea needs to improve transparency in many areas of the Code of Good Practices on
Fiscal Transparency, but a sound basis is being established to implement key fiscal transparency
practices. An improved legal framework for fiscal management has been put in place, notably
through the 2003 Public Finance Law and the 2005 Tax Code.

•

A balanced approach to improve transparency at all levels of fiscal management was recommended,
with an initial focus on:

•

•

establishing a clear fiscal policy for the management of hydrocarbon wealth and a firm budget
constraint supported by strengthening the budget law;

•

establishing a more formalized budget priority-setting process and introduction of a functional
classification to clearly identify allocations in relation to stated priorities;

•

publishing reconciled data on government oil revenue flows and fiscal and monetary accounts;
and

•

defining the mandate and corporate governance structure of the national oil company
(GEPetrol), with World Bank assistance.

The authorities are initiating actions in some of these areas, but weaknesses in administrative
capacity and inadequately defined responsibilities and oversight mechanisms present formidable
barriers to rapid reform. Technical support will be needed for successful implementation of
reforms.

and other services are expected to drive
non-oil sector growth. Also, with oil
revenue remaining strong, fiscal surpluses should average 15 percent of GDP between 2005
and 2010, and the external current account should turn to a surplus in 2007, owing to a
decline in oil sector imports of capital goods and services, reaching about 20 percent of GDP
13

These prices are consistent with the December 2004 WEO projections less a discount of US$2-5
per barrel due to the lower quality of Equatoguinean oil relative to the benchmark Brent crude oil
price.

in 2009 before declining. As a result of these surpluses, gross official assets (official BEAC
foreign reserves plus offshore government deposits) should be over $8 billion (about
33 months of import of goods and services) by 2010 (Tables 6 and 7).
24.
A key decision for the authorities over the medium term is how much of the oil
revenue it should spend in a given year and how much it should save for the benefit of
future generations. In determining an appropriate fiscal rule for managing oil wealth, the
staff recommended that the authorities consider adopting a permanent income approach
(Box 3). This approach would maintain a constant level of real per capita expenditure over
the long run. The trade-off would be between investing more in education, health, and
infrastructure today and not investing and maintaining the real value of the oil wealth in the
form of financial assets. Strengthened PEM can help insure that this balance is managed
appropriately in order to increase productivity and avoid wasting resources. There may also
be absorptive capacity constraints which limit the level of spending that can be incurred in a
given year. The authorities will therefore need to assess and balance each of these
considerations in deciding how much to spend and save.
25.
Regarding risks and vulnerability, the staff conducted a sensitivity analysis on
the level of sustainable real permanent expenditure. A US$1 per barrel increase/decrease
in price of oil would raise/lower the permanent real per capita expenditure by about
2 percent. Similarly, a decrease/increase in the real interest rate of 1 percent per annum
would reduce/increase permanent real per capita expenditure by about 5 percent. Finally, a
reduction/increase in annual non-oil GDP growth by one percent would reduce/increase
permanent real per capita government expenditure by about 18 percent. This underscores the
importance of preparing a strategy for the management of the country’s oil wealth and for the
development of the non-oil sector.
V. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
26.
The discussions took place against the backdrop of high world oil prices,
increased hydrocarbon production, continued poor social development indicators, and
concerns over transparency and accountability in the management of natural resources
and public finance. While broadly agreeing with the thrust of the staff’s assessment and
recommendations, the authorities underscored the severe institutional capacity constraints
within which they were conducting economic policy and requested assistance to address
these concerns.
A. Poverty Reduction Strategy
27.
The immediate challenge facing the Equatoguinean authorities is to prepare a
comprehensive development strategy to reduce poverty and foster broad-based
economic growth. The authorities agreed with the staff on the urgent need to prepare an
interim paper that could serve as a roadmap for the preparation of the strategy and facilitate
technical assistance from development partners. The World Bank and others are expected to
help the authorities prepare a poverty profile and carry out a PER. The authorities

- 13 -

acknowledged the importance of developing a comprehensive strategy to guide government
policy over the medium term.

Box 3. Long-Run Fiscal Framework
The staff proposed a long-run fiscal framework based on the permanent income approach. In this framework,
respecting intergenerational equity would imply maintaining a constant level of real per capita expenditure over the
long run. Alternatively, if the government considers addressing poverty reduction in the short term as a more urgent
priority, it may decide to increase real per capita expenditure during the near term, even if that translates into a lower
level of public spending thereafter. To calculate the implications of these two alternatives, the staff made the
following assumptions:
• economic growth through 2010 in line with the medium-term outlook presented in Table 5, and a
5 percent rate of growth of the non-oil economy thereafter;
• long-run real oil price equivalent to US$30 a barrel beginning in 2010;
• no new hydrocarbon discoveries;
• a real rate of return on financial assets of 2 percent; and
• a population of 500,000 inhabitants in 2004, with a growth rate of 2.5 percent a year thereafter.
The staff estimates that if intergenerational equity is the main consideration (Case 1), a long-run constant real per
capita government expenditure of CFAF 590,000 per year (measured in constant 2004 CFA francs) could be
maintained. However, if poverty reduction considerations lead the government to spend more during the near term
(Case 2), a lower level of long-run constant real per capita government expenditure could be maintained
(CFAF533,000 a year). With the latter expenditure profile, the government would need to be mindful of absorptive
capacity constraints to avoid jeopardizing macroeconomic stability.1/

1/ This analysis assumes that the authorities would not incur any new debt to finance public expenditure. If, however,
they incurred a sustainable level of debt to finance additional spending, the level of permanent real per capita
expenditure would be higher.

B. Macroeconomic Policies
Fiscal policy
28.
The challenge for fiscal policy over both the short and medium term is to
channel the country’s oil wealth to priority sectors. At the same time, the authorities must
safeguard macroeconomic stability and intergenerational equity, while paving the way for an
eventual shift to a non-oil economy. The staff discussed the long-run fiscal framework
outlined in Section IV. The authorities found the framework to be useful, but underscored the
urgency of directing resources into improving social conditions in the near term. The staff
concurred, but urged the authorities to be mindful of both intergenerational equity
considerations and the economy’s limited absorptive capacity at present.14
29.
The staff recommended a three stage approach to fiscal policy. In the period
immediately preceding the finalization of their strategy, the authorities should limit capital
expenditures until they assessed the needs and absorptive capacity constraints of the priority
sectors. Once they have elaborated their strategy, there should be greater scope for adjusting
both the level and composition of spending. In the long run, the authorities should limit
expenditure in line with the country’s permanent income.
30.
The mission urged the authorities to adopt the primary non-oil fiscal balance as
the key policy target. At present, the authorities follow fiscal policy rules that limit
recurrent expenditure to the amount of non-oil revenues and finance capital expenditure
solely from oil revenues. They maintained that these rules were meant to ensure that the
country’s oil wealth was being directed into productive investment. The mission noted that
the existing rules neither constrained capital spending nor took into consideration the level of
recurrent expenditure needed to sustain the capital stock.
31.
The staff broadly supported the 2005 budget proposal. It urged the authorities to
remain within the budget parameters which aimed at a non-oil primary deficit of 11 percent
of GDP (78 percent of non-oil GDP), allowing savings equivalent to 13 percent of GDP. The
authorities reassured the mission of their intention to keep spending within budget, but the
lack of a formal mechanism to enforce budget limits makes this uncertain. In this regard, the
staff supported the ROSC recommendation that the authorities set a specific expenditure
target in the supplemental budget law, with any increases in aggregate spending during the
year requiring prior approval by parliament.
14

Since the time of the discussions, the staff have revised the WEO price assumptions for crude oil
upward to US$47 per barrel in 2005 (from US$37 per barrel), US$44 per barrel in 2006
(US$36 per barrel), and US$39 per barrel for 2007-2010 (US$34 per barrel). As oil revenues already
significantly exceed public expenditure, it is expected that the authorities will save the resulting oil
price windfalls in the form of higher official reserves. Its impact on the domestic economy would
therefore be limited over the short and medium term. Over the long term, however, these higher oil
revenues would increase the level of permanent real per capita expenditure that could be sustained.

- 15 -

32.
The staff welcomed the new tax law for 2005. It expressed concern, however,
about the short-term revenue impact and the authorities’ ability to implement the new
measures given institutional capacity constraints. The authorities explained that they had
intended to phase in the measures over 6-12 months while the administrative capacity for
VAT tax collection was being strengthened with assistance from the French government, but
that the effective date of the new measures was set by the Tax Law. They concurred that
there would likely be a reduction in tax receipts during the transition period, but believed that
this would be offset over time by a broadening of the tax base. The staff agreed with the
authorities’ assessment, but urged them to take steps to ensure a smooth implementation of
the new law.
Monetary and financial sector policies
33.
The staff expressed concern that the liquidity overhang could jeopardize
macroeconomic stability and financial sector soundness. It noted that the build up in
liquidity arose from balances of government contractors involved in large capital projects
and of households who are willing to hold deposits, even at zero rates of interest, due to
limited alternative investment opportunities. In turn, the excess liquidity occurred on account
of the lack of viable lending opportunities on the part of the commercial banks and, under the
fixed exchange rate regime, capital account restrictions which prevented private agents from
transferring these balances overseas. The authorities indicated that they were not in a
position to address the problem since monetary policy is set at the regional level. They noted
that the instruments available to the regional central bank to mop up this excess liquidity
were ineffective. Given that this excess liquidity remained within the commercial banking
system and was not being injected into the domestic economy, the authorities did not see any
urgent need to mop up it up. The staff cautioned that the banks could inject this liquidity into
the economy at any time and urged fiscal prudence to avoid larger build-ups of liquidity.
34.
The staff expressed concerns about the increasing level of non-performing loans
and noted the difficulties that some of the commercial banks were having in observing
the capital adequacy requirements. It urged the authorities to take the necessary actions to
ensure that banks complied with the prudential regulations. The authorities did not believe
that the increase in the non-performing loans posed a threat to financial sector soundness
because these loans were fully provisioned. They agreed, however, that the problem should
be addressed through more forceful supervision and enforcement, and indicated that the
noncomplying banks would be sanctioned accordingly.
35.
The staff encouraged the authorities to support the implementation of the antimoney-laundering/combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) framework by
setting up a national financial intelligence unit in Malabo. The authorities noted that the

- 16 -

regional body, GABAC,15 was coordinating the establishment of such a unit, which was
expected to be in place later in the year.
External policies
36.
The staff urged the authorities to place priority on establishing an appropriate
policy for the management of the country’s rapidly growing accumulated budget
surpluses, consistent with its obligations as a member of the BEAC. Since early 2004, all
government oil receipts have been deposited in the regional central bank.16 The authorities
expressed concern about the lack of remuneration on the majority of deposits held at the
BEAC. They sought staff assistance in finding a suitable solution. The mission took the view
that a lasting solution would need to be agreed at the regional level, and welcomed the
discussions that had been initiated between the authorities and the BEAC. The staff
subsequently raised this matter at the February 2005 Council of Ministers Meeting of the
CEMAC and in the recent regional surveillance discussions with the BEAC. The regional
authorities have taken note of Equatorial Guinea’s concerns. They propose to remunerate
Equatorial Guinea’s reserves along the lines contained in a draft arrangement with another
oil-exporting member of the zone, which is currently being finalized. In the context of the
negotiations of this arrangement, a revision of the central bank’s reserve management
guidelines would be required. A proposal under consideration by the BEAC would separate a
part of oil-related funds from monetary reserves in the form of a fund for future generations.
This fund could be remunerated based on the returns of longer-term investments in
appropriate assets.
37.
The staff urged the authorities to remove the remaining export tariffs, which
were not needed as a source of government revenue and only served to weaken
competitiveness and/or support inefficient production. The authorities noted that the
export taxes on cocoa and coffee had a long tradition of financing certain domestic
initiatives, but agreed to revisit the issue. Their strategy of maintaining an export tax on logs
but not on processed wood products was intended to provide an incentive for higher valueadded activities. The mission maintained that the tariff should be phased out over time, with
a view to reducing the incentive for inefficient domestic production. Regarding the
implementation of the CET, the authorities noted that experience throughout the region had
been mixed, but reaffirmed their commitment to comply with the regional directives.

Groupe Anti-blanchiment en Afrique Centrale.

In the past, the authorities placed the country’s oil savings in dollar-denominated accounts overseas
at market rates of interest, with the exception of the Fund for Future Generations (0.5 percent of total
oil revenue) which earns a nominal rate of interest of 1.7 percent at the BEAC.

- 17 -

C. Medium-Term Outlook, Growth and Diversification Policies
38.
The authorities concurred with the staff’s medium-term outlook. They agreed
that the oil sector would continue to dominate growth over the medium term, but were
initially less optimistic about the rate of non-oil growth, which they projected at 8 percent a
year versus the staff’s 10 percent. The staff suggested that the non-oil economy should be
able to sustain higher levels of growth given its low base, the projected high levels of
government capital spending, and the proposed measures for improving the investment
climate (see below). The authorities accepted these arguments.
39.
Given that oil is a nonrenewable resource and has a limited impact on domestic
employment, the development of the non-oil economy will be essential for sustainable
employment and poverty reduction. The authorities agreed with the staff’s assessment, and
noted that their diversification policy had been based on three main programs that failed to
meet their objectives on account of financial and institutional capacity constraints.17 The
authorities indicated that in the period ahead they would take steps to ensure sufficient
financing for these programs and put in place the necessary capacity to monitor
implementation.
40.
The mission stressed that the development of an environment conducive to
private sector investment was key to sustainable, broad-based growth. Measures
designed to improve contract enforcement, reduce the time required to obtain new business
licenses, and minimize the clearance period for foreign exchange transactions would be
particularly useful in improving the investment climate. In this regard, the mission expressed
concern about the authorities’ recent decision to require foreign investors to obtain local
(silent) partners as a condition for receiving investment approval. The authorities
underscored the urgent need to foster and nurture local entrepreneurship which, in their view,
could best be achieved by requiring foreign investors to obtain local partners. They also
noted that they had recently adopted the regional investment and commercial law (OHADA)
and had revised the tax code with a view to improving transparency.
41.
The decline in competitiveness on account of the appreciation of the real
exchange rate threatened the development of the non-oil economy. While the present
exchange rate regime helped the country maintain price stability, the staff believed that fiscal
prudence and flexible labor markets were essential to mitigate the effects of Dutch Disease,
and to expand the non-oil tradable sector. The authorities acknowledged the impact that high
levels of inflation had on competitiveness and concurred that public spending was the key
17

These three main programs are: (i) the Special Program of Food Security (PESA); (ii) the Institute
for Agricultural Promotion (INPAGE); and (iii) National Institute for Business Promotion and
Development (INPYDE).

- 18 -

determinant. The challenge was to find the appropriate balance between higher inflation and
higher poverty-reducing spending.
D. Transparency
42.
The most important obstacles to increased transparency are weaknesses in
administrative capacity and poorly defined responsibilities and oversight mechanisms.
While improvements related to oil sector transparency are particularly important, broader
reforms are essential for successful and sustainable progress in fiscal management. Also,
enhancements in the transparency of project planning and implementation are key to a
successful poverty reduction strategy. The establishment of a strong, independent judiciary is
also important. The authorities recognized the lack of institutional capacity in critical areas
of economic decision-making and project implementation. They agreed to implement the
recommendations of fiscal transparency ROSC and intend to participate in the EITI with
assistance from the World Bank.
E. Statistics and Capacity Building
43.
The lack of technical and institutional capacity hinders the authorities’ ability to
formulate and implement macroeconomic policy. The staff urged the authorities to
identify priority areas for institutional capacity building within the context of a
comprehensive technical assistance plan and to seek the support of development partners.18 If
financial support for such assistance is limited because of budgetary constraints on the part of
key development partners (including from the Fund), the authorities should finance these
activities directly. For the immediate period ahead, the authorities should place priority on
building capacity in the areas identified by the fiscal transparency ROSC.
44.
The mission highlighted the urgent need for better PEM given the large
overruns in capital expenditure and the existence of significant extrabudgetary
spending. They urged the authorities to routinely reconcile the fiscal and monetary data and
other key oil revenue data, and to identify and include all expenditures outside the published
budget in the presentation of the executed budget. The authorities acknowledged the severe
deficiencies in PEM and said they were considering acquiring a computerized expenditure
control system with the assistance of the French government to strengthen expenditure
monitoring. They also agreed that all government expenditure should be captured in the
fiscal accounts and requested the Fund’s assistance in putting such capacity in place.
45.
The staff envisages providing assistance in areas within the Fund’s core
competency. It intends to assist the authorities in identifying appropriate macro-fiscal and
tax administration experts and foresees carrying out a multi-sector statistics assessment
18

At present, technical support is provided by the African Development Bank and the World Bank in
the area of national accounts and the government of France in the fiscal area.

- 19 -

mission. In collaboration with the World Bank, the staff will also hold a regional seminar on
sources of growth.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
46.
With its substantial hydrocarbon wealth, Equatorial Guinea should be able to
make rapid progress toward achieving the MDGs. However, there has yet to be
measurable improvements in living conditions. To do so, the authorities will need to develop
a comprehensive poverty reduction strategy, strengthen institutional capacity, improve
transparency and accountability, and diversify the economy.
47.
The 2004 budget outturn would have been considerably better (in terms of the
non-oil balance) had it not been for substantial overruns in capital expenditure. This is
symptomatic of a lack of expenditure control and poor budget planning that continues to
plague the government. The staff urges the authorities to keep within its budget targets and to
seek assistance in improving PEM.
48.
Given that oil is a nonrenewable resource and has a limited impact on
employment, the staff urges the authorities to take actions to develop the non-oil
economy. The authorities should develop an environment conducive to private sector
investment and reverse the decline in the economy’s competitiveness by setting fiscal
expenditure in line with absorptive capacity constraints, thereby keeping inflation in check.
More flexible labor markets would also support these objectives.
49.
The liquidity overhang poses potential risks to macroeconomic stability and
financial sector soundness. The regional monetary authorities lack the instruments to mop
up liquidity. The staff urges the authorities to contribute to a reduction in the excess liquidity
in the system by maintaining a prudent fiscal policy.
50.
The staff broadly supports the 2005 budget. It urges the authorities to keep
spending in line with the budget in order to return to an expenditure path consistent with the
long-term strategy outlined in this report.
51.
The medium-term outlook is expected to be dominated by developments in the
hydrocarbon sector. National savings generated from this sector are expected to remain
high. Although beginning from a low base, the non-oil sector is expected to grow rapidly,
driven by high levels of government capital spending on infrastructure and social sector
projects.
52.
The staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to develop a poverty reduction
strategy. It urges them to draw on lessons learned from the previous National Development
Plan which failed to achieve its objectives. As an initial step, the authorities should develop
an interim document.
53.
In developing their strategy, the authorities will need to balance their desire to
improve social outcomes today, with their concerns for macroeconomic stability and

- 20 -

intergenerational equity. In determining the appropriate level of public savings, the staff
recommends that the authorities consider the non-oil deficit as the key policy variable and be
mindful of the economy’s absorptive capacity constraints when targeting real per capita
expenditure over the long run.
54.
The staff urges the authorities to establish an appropriate policy to manage the
country’s oil wealth. It welcomes the authorities’ decision to deposit all government oil
receipts in the BEAC and encourages them to seek a lasting solution at the regional level for
the remuneration of government deposits.
55.
The authorities need to improve transparency and accountability, particularly in
managing oil revenues and public finance. They have indicated their commitment to these
principles at the highest level, but need to move ahead with concrete actions. The staff
welcomes the authorities’ intention to participate in the EITI and to implement the
recommendations of the fiscal transparency ROSC. It urges the authorities to regularly
reconcile and publish oil revenue data, the government’s foreign asset holdings, and
GEPetrols’ audited accounts.
56.
Equatorial Guinea continues to pursue a relatively open trade policy. As a
member of the CEMAC, it has adopted the CET and has made significant progress toward
eliminating tariff and nontariff protection on goods produced within the sub region.
However, the staff urges the authorities to eliminate the remaining export taxes as soon as
possible.
57.
The lack of timely, accurate, and comprehensive economic and social data
hampers policy formulation, and monitoring. The authorities are aware of these problems,
which are principally due to severe institutional constraints. The staff urges the authorities to
develop a comprehensive framework for strengthening the country’s statistical capacity, with
support from the World Bank. The authorities should also regularly provide the staff with the
basic data it needs to carry out its surveillance responsibilities.
58.
Institutional capacity constraints continue to hinder the authorities ability to
conduct economic policy and to implement their development program. The authorities
should identify priority areas for institutional capacity building within the context of a
comprehensive technical assistance plan and seek out assistance from the country’s
development partners, including the Fund. The staff believes that priority should be placed
on building capacity in the areas identified in the fiscal transparency ROSC and the World
Bank EITI mission, as well as on developing a poverty profile and carrying out a PER.
59.
The staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Equatorial
Guinea be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

APPENDIX I

Exchange Rate Arrangement
The Bank of the Central African States (BEAC) is the regional central bank of the
Central African States, of which Equatorial Guinea is a member. A safeguards
assessment of the BEAC completed on August 30, 2004 found that the BEAC has
implemented a number of measures to strengthen its safeguards framework since an
earlier 2001 safeguards assessment, but further progress needs to be made in key areas.
The main recommendations of the 2004 assessment were reported in IMF Country
Report No. 05/3.
Equatorial Guinea’s currency, the CFA franc, is pegged to the euro at the fixed exchange
rate of CFAF 656.34 per euro.
Local currency equivalent:

SDR 1 = CFAF 764.42 as of March 31, 2005.

Equatorial Guinea maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions.
Article IV Consultations
Equatorial Guinea is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle.
The last Article IV consultation with Equatorial Guinea was concluded by the Executive
Board on November 12, 2003 (IMF Country Report No. 03/385).
Technical Assistance
FAD provided an 18-month technical assistance during 1992-94 to reorganize the tax
department and personnel training.

APPENDIX II

Equatorial Guinea: Relations with the World Bank Group
The World Bank Group has not approved any new lending operations for Equatorial Guinea
since mid-1992. The discovery of large oil reserves caused Equatorial Guinea to graduate to
IBRD status (based on a GNP per capita of $1,170 in 1999), which has meant that
concessional IDA assistance is no longer available. In 1998, the World Bank prepared a
strategy paper on the development of petroleum resources in Equatorial Guinea, which it
discussed with the authorities. The World Bank’s assistance to Equatorial Guinea has
focused since then on initiating a dialogue on the analysis and recommendations outlined in
this report. At the request of the authorities, a World Bank mission to examine Equatorial
Guinea’s participation in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) coincided
with a Fund fiscal ROSC mission in January, 2005.
IMF—World Bank collaboration
Overall, the IMF and World Bank staffs have maintained a close collaborative relationship in
coordinating their operational activities and policy advice to the authorities. In view of the
reengagement of the international financial institutions with the government after years of
absence, the success of the country’s growth path will depend on the proper management of
oil revenues and the strength of public expenditure policies.
World Bank activities
In order to build the country’s informational base, the World Bank is supervising a statistical
capacity-building grant that is designed to provide financial assistance in the drafting and
implementation of a long-term development program of the national statistical system. The
Bank-executed portion was completed in February, 2005. The second phase of the project,
which is counterpart-executed, was initiated in January, 2005 and scheduled for completion
in September, 2005. Meanwhile, the Bank is in discussion with the authorities about
conducting a light household survey of the Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ)
type to construct the poverty profile.
Following a request by the Ministry of Planning and Economic Development, a mission from
FIAS visited Equatorial Guinea in April 2001 in order to survey the investment climate in the
country. The FIAS (a joint facility of the World Bank and International Finance Corporation)
is providing advisory services to help improve the investment climate in Equatorial Guinea.
This technical assistance identifies constraints to private investment, particularly foreign
direct investment, and provide inputs to a governmental program of reforms aimed at
alleviating impediments to private sector development. The mission had the following
recommendations: (i) prepare transparent and explicit rules for the management of oil
revenues; (ii) reinforce the capacity of the Ministry of Mines to manage projects; and
(iii) involve the private sector in local development activities.

- 31 -

APPENDIX II

The Bank provides technical assistance in the petroleum and energy sectors. To this end, a
technical assistance project is being discussed with the Government that includes: (a) a study
of the institutional set up to define the role and responsibilities of the Ministry of Mines,
Industry and Energy and the state oil company, GEPetrol; (b) a review of existing petroleum
sector laws and regulations, including environmental law and regulation; (c) sector capacity
building and design and implementation of training programs; (d) the development of an Oil
Revenue Diagnostic Model that integrates upstream and midstream activities by generating
forecasts of future sector revenues under different assumptions regarding costs, prices and
the pace of development; (e) the formulation of the national hydrocarbon and energy policy
the optimizes the links between the two sectors and (f) the formulation of resource revenue
management policy, including relevant institutional arrangements.
Finally the Bank is providing assistance in the design and implementation of the reporting
framework and institutional arrangements necessary to implement the Extractive Industry
Transparency Initiative and related governance and anti-corruption policies.

APPENDIX II

Past Portfolio
Previous portfolios comprised projects in primary education, agriculture and health sectors,
which were all closed by 1999. In particular, the last project funded by IDA was the Health
Improvement Project (PROMESSA) that closed in August 1999.
Future Areas in which the World Bank analysis could serve as input for the IMF
Starting in 2005 the Bank is in discussion with the authorities on the possibility of
conducting a public expenditure review to analyze the public financial management system
in the country and assess expenditure effectiveness, particularly in the social sectors. The
work could provide a basic analysis of budget preparation and budget execution in the
country and help assess the relationship between voted allocations and PRSP objectives. This
could complement IMF work on macroeconomic monitoring and fiscal policy analysis.

APPENDIX IV

Equatorial Guinea: Statistical Issues
Equatorial Guinea's economic and financial statistics remain very weak. The deficiencies in
quality, timing, and coverage of most macroeconomic data are related to the extremely poor
administrative and technical capacity of the government. Technical assistance efforts have
resulted in some progress, although consolidation of these gains continues to elude the
authorities. Urgent attention needs to be given to making lasting improvements in the quality
and availability of statistics. The Bank of Central African States (BEAC) regularly reports
monetary, interest rates, and exchange rate statistics for publication in the International
Finance Statistics (IFS), but their timeliness needs to be improved.
Real sector and prices
Real sector and price data suffer from significant weaknesses that are compounded by poor
centralization of information from the island and continental regions. National accounts
statistics are supplied at current and constant prices, but often contain significant
inconsistencies. Sectoral deflators and GDP by category of expenditure must be estimated by
missions. The compilation of the official consumer price index (CPI) has benefited from
French technical assistance, but both the weights and composition of the basket of goods and
services are outdated. Lags in its production in large part arise because of delays in receiving
data from the mainland, but these lags are shortening. A detailed breakdown of CPI data is
not available in a timely fashion.
Real sector statistics reported to STA (IFS) are limited to GDP (without breakdown by sector
or expenditure category), and exports and imports. The January 2005 issue of IFS includes
data for GDP through 2003 and exports and imports through 2000. Export and import data are
available to AFR through 2000.
Government finance
The assistance of French technicians has resulted in some improvement in fiscal accounting,
such as the availability of monthly data, but data continue to be provided on a cash basis only.
Improvements still need to be made, particularly in procuring timely and accurate data from
the Debt-Service Unit (Caja Autónoma de la Deuda Pública). Regarding budget coverage and
implementation, the authorities need to (i) eliminate extra budgetary accounts, such as oilrelated revenue held abroad and the operations of the state oil company, GEPETROL;
(ii) incorporate all revenue and expenditure within a single budget; and (iii) record foreignfinanced capital outlays.
Equatorial Guinea does not report fiscal data to STA. However, the authorities have made
available to AFR budget execution data through August-2004.

- 36 -

APPENDIX IV

Monetary accounts
Although the coverage of monetary statistics for Equatorial Guinea is adequate, delays in
production at the BEAC’s National Directorate in Malabo still occur occasionally. The
February March 2005 issue of IFS includes data for the central bank and other depository
corporations through November 2004.
Equatorial Guinea’s monetary statistics are reported directly to STA by BEAC headquarters
for publication in International Financial Statistics (IFS). A monetary and financial statistics
mission visited Malabo in December 2002. This mission (1) reviewed the structure of the
financial system and the procedures used for compiling monetary and financial statistics;
(2) provided technical assistance to the staff of the BEAC National Directorate (DND) in
addressing data collection, compilation, and dissemination problems, and in improving the
analytical usefulness of the monetary statistics; and (3) briefed the authorities on the
methodology in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM) and initiated first step
to facilitate the MFSMF implementation. An action plan has been designed for the
implementation of the recommendations formulated by the mission. A questionnaire
“Progress Report on Technical Assistance” sent in November 2003 to the BEAC-DND in
Malabo has been returned to STA the Fund’s Statistics Department in December 2004, after a
reminder was sent in October 2004 to both BEAC-DND in Malabo and Research Department
at BEAC headquarters. The responses cover the status of implementation of recommendations
falling under the responsibility of the BEAC-DN, but not those under the responsibility of
BEAC headquarters. One important achievement is the completion in 2003 of the proper
sectorization of monetary data, along the lines of the MFSM methodology, and their monthly
updating by the BEAC-DN in cooperation with commercial banks. Application of sound
sectorization should increase the accuracy of reporting by the central bank and commercial
banks, and subsequently improve the reliability of monetary statistics.
Measurement of currency in circulation in Equatorial Guinea is largely impaired by crossborder movements of banknotes amongst member countries in the Central African Economic
and Monetary Community (CEMAC). While 47 percent of banknotes issued in Equatorial
Guinea remains in the country, 39 percent circulates in Cameroon, and 7 percent in Gabon.
About 80 percent of the currency circulating in Equatorial Guinea is issued nationally, almost
12 percent is issued by Gabon, and about 7 percent by Cameroon.
External debt
Data on the outstanding stock of external debt and projections of debt-service payments are
hampered by serious inconsistencies. The debt service paid, reported by the Debt-Service
Unit, is often significantly different from that reported by the budget and the Paris Club, as
the unit usually lacks precise information on payments made. Also, details regarding
scheduled debt-service obligations are not incorporated into the budget in a systematic and
timely manner. Debt-service projections beyond the following year are only provided in a
highly aggregated form. Finally, some debt service takes place outside the Debt-Service Unit.

- 37 -

APPENDIX IV

The authorities have started a major inventory of their debt and are beginning to address the
capacity constraints in the Debt-Service Unit through training and new staffing.
Balance of payments
Customs data have improved since the implementation of the Central African Customs and
Economic Union (UDEAC) reform and the deployment of customs brigades. However, data
analysis is still hampered by the lack of computerization. Although the BEAC produces
balance of payments data for Equatorial Guinea, delays are long and the data suffer from
significant inconsistencies with other sources. While some progress was made in compiling
current and financial account items, the lack of availability of source data is a key concern.
Equatorial Guinea’s balance of payments data are published in the International Financial
Statistics Yearbook through 1996 only.

Summary of Upstream and Downstream Hydrocarbon Production
Upstream oil and gas production
The Zafiro oil field, operated by Exxon-Mobil, is located northwest of Bioko Island and
south of Nigeria. Discovered in 1995, it is the largest oil producing field in the country with
processing capability of 10,000 barrels a day and storage capacity of about two million
barrels. Its production level has already peaked and is projected to decline gradually and be
depleted by 2025.
Ceiba, the second-largest oil field, is located offshore of Rio Muni and operated by Amerada
Hess. Discovered in 1999 and with an estimated 500 million barrels in proven reserves,
Ceiba’s production is expected to reach 100,000 bpd in 2007.
Alba, located offshore of Bioko Island, is a large natural gas field, with reserves of
6.9 trillion cubic feet (1.2 billion boe) operated by Marathon Oil. About 195 million cubic
feet of gas is produced each year, about one-fifth of which is reinvested into the reservoir,
with the remainder being fed into the production of downstream products. Condensates are
also derived as a byproduct.
Downstream operations and byproducts
Methanol, an input into the production of various chemicals, is derived from natural gas.
The methanol plant, a joint venture with Marathon Oil, Samedan, and the government of
Equatorial Guinea, became operational in 2001 and produced 25,600 boe/day in 2004
(3-4 percent of the world market). Its capacity is expected to reach 27,000 boe/day in 2007.
Liquid petroleum gas (LPG) principally butane and propane, is derived from liquefied gas.
Built in the second half of the 1990s, the LPG facility’s production capacity was recently
expanded to 20,000 boe/day. Production capacity is expected to be double in 2008.
Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is natural gas that is condensed at very low temperatures for
shipment to major distribution centers. An initial facility with the capacity of 80,000 boe/day
is being put in place through a joint venture between Marathon Oil and the national oil
company (GEPetrol). Plans are under discussion to build a second LNG facility to pipe
natural gas currently being flared throughout the region to Bioko Island for processing into
LNG and then exported.
Condensates are a heavy oil sludge that is a byproduct of natural gas production. It is
collected as a residue both offshore where the natural gas is lifted, and onshore, where it is
piped for use in downstream operations.

Statement by Damian Ondo Mañe, Executive Director
for the Republic of Equatorial Guinea
April 25, 2005
Introduction
First of all, I would like to thank staff for the comprehensive and well-written set of papers on
the recent macro economic developments in Equatorial Guinea. My authorities welcome these
papers which give a thorough analysis of the country’ economic and financial situation as well
as the challenges facing Equatorial Guinea. My authorities are also appreciative of the staff’s
and management’s commitment to assist them in meeting those challenges especially in the
development of policies to diversify the economy, the management of the national resources
and the building of capacity in order to reduce poverty and meet the MDGs. Indeed, the oil
wealth provides Equatorial Guinea a great opportunity to lay down solid foundations for broad–
based economic growth and poverty alleviation.
My authorities’ commitment to implement policies towards the achievement of these objectives
were confirmed to Mr. Carstens, Deputy Managing Director, during his visit to Malabo at the
end of last January. At the same time, the authorities expressed their wish to have a seminar in
collaboration with the Fund on the alternative sources of growth in the CEMAC region.
The lack of capacity has been the key constraint to the authorities’ efforts to build a strong
foundation for long term economic prosperity. Taking into account this situation, my
authorities would like to benefit from capacity building assistance from the international
community and the Bretton Woods Institutions, in particular. Meanwhile, as part of addressing
capacity constraint, the authorities have undertaken programs to train Equato Guineans at
institutions of higher education abroad. However, this can be a medium term response. To
meet the immediate needs of the country, the authorities are relying on the international
community for capacity building assistance in the different key sectors.
Based on the Board’s recommendations made in 2003 on the need to improve fiscal
management, the authorities have continued to make specific efforts in those areas through,
inter alias strengthening the budgetary process and consolidating tax legislation as well as
improving transparency and accountability.
Transparency and accountability
In their efforts to introduce further transparency and accountability in the management of
petroleum sector revenues and public expenditure, Equatorial Guinea is voluntarily
participating in the Extractive Industries’ Transparency Initiative (EITI) with assistance from
the World Bank. The authorities have requested and received a fiscal report on Observance of
Standards and Codes (ROSC). In this regard, all necessary information were made available to
the Bank and Fund staff during their visits, in November 2004 and January 2005, with a view
to facilitating data compilation and reconciliation as well as helping to design
recommendations and plan of actions. In the same vein, it is worth noting that Equatorial

-2Guinea, in collaboration with the Bank and the Fund, hosted in January 2005 a regional
seminar for CEMAC parliamentarians on the management and accountability of oil resources.
My authorities are fully committed to implement the recommendations made by the World
Bank, EITI and Fiscal transparency ROSC missions. Already, committees comprising of
representatives of all stakeholders namely government, oil companies and the civil society have
been set up and they have started implementing their respective plans of actions. An
interministerial committee was been established in 2004 in order to monitor macroeconomic
developments and coordinate policies. Moreover, my authorities have requested technical
assistance from the World Bank in order to review ways to strengthen the operational
performance of GEPetrol, and the Ministry of Mines, Hydrocarbon and Energy.
In addition it is important to note that in early 2004 all government accounts with Riggs Bank
were closed and the balances transferred to the Banque des Etats de l’Afrique Centrale,
(BEAC), the regional central bank. The accounts held with Riggs Bank were only transitory
accounts meant to deal with local constraints and speed up the payments of oil foreign
companies to the Treasury of Equatorial Guinea.
Economic and Financial Performance in 2004
Equatorial Guinea’s economy is dominated by the oil and gas sector which in 2004 accounted
for about 90 percent of GDP, 98 percent of exports and 86 percent of government revenues.
Due mainly to the expansion in hydrocarbon production, real GDP grew by 34 percent while
the non-oil GDP increased by 13 percent boosted by strong performance in the construction,
infrastructure and services sectors. At 4,2 percent, inflation decreased from 7,3 percent in 2003
but still remains above the CEMAC’s convergence criterion of 3 percent. The real effective
exchange rate appreciated by about 5 percent compared to 15 percent in 2003 and the current
account deficit was reduced significantly compared to 2003. The official international reserves
increased fourfold to cover 18 months of imports of the non-oil sector.
In the fiscal sector, due to higher world oil prices and the surge in production, total revenue
estimated at 37 percent of GDP increased by 44 percent, higher than budgeted though it was
offset by substantial public expenditure. In addition to the oil receipts, the non-oil revenue rose
by 12 percent owing to economic growth and improvements in tax administration. Capital
expenditure grew more than budgeted on account of higher capital spending in the
infrastructure sector, while the current outlays remained within budget. As a result the fiscal
surplus stood at 14 percent of GDP while non-oil fiscal deficit was 17 percent of GDP. In their
efforts to strengthen the fiscal area, my authorities put in place in January 2005 a new tax code
replacing the domestic turnover with a value added tax (VAT) and the tax authority was
reorganized. Moreover the law regarding the 2004 Budget execution ( la ley de la Ejecucion del
Presupuesto General del Estado para el Ejercicio Economico 2004 ) has been presented to the
National Assembly as stipulated in the Constitution.
Regarding monetary developments, broad money grew significantly on account of the large
inflow of oil revenue and transfers from international oil companies. However, the resulting
excess liquidity has not been translated into credit increase to the private sector, due to lack of
bankable projects. Overall, the banking system remains sound and compliance with respect to

-3banking supervision norms is respected. In an effort to broaden the banking sector, a new bank
whose license was approved in 2004 is expected to operate shortly.
As a member of the Communauté Economique et Monétaire de l’Afrique Centrale (CEMAC)
and Banque des Etats de l’Afrique Centrale (BEAC), Equatorial Guinea has deposited the oil
revenues in the BEAC . However, in view of the low rate of return and to maximize the value
of the oil wealth for future generations, the authorities have started discussions with BEAC in
order to find the best scheme and modalities for an appropriate remuneration of funds
deposited with the Regional Central Bank. In this respect, the authorities are seeking advice
from the Fund given the limited capacities of the country in this very specific and sensitive
matter.
On the CEMAC Convergence criteria, Equatorial Guinea has observed three of the four
convergence criteria. Only the criterion on inflation was missed due to the large investments in
infrastructure notably for the construction of schools, hospitals, buildings and roads. The
CEMAC common external tariff (CET) has also been adopted with significant progress in
eliminating import tariffs on goods produced within CEMAC zone.
Macroeconomic policies and Medium Term objectives.
The economy of Equatorial Guinea is expected to grow by 5 percent a year between 2005 and
2010 in the context of an increase in hydrocarbon production.. The non-oil sector will also
grow rapidly over the medium term given the ongoing investment, including in infrastructure.
The fiscal surpluses should average 15 percent of GDP and external current account will be in
surplus due to the decline in oil sector imports of capital and good services. The
macroeconomic framework needed to achieve these objective was agreed with staff and my
authorities are aware that there is a need to move towards further fiscal sustainability, reduce
pressures on prices, develop the non-oil sector and strengthen transparency and accountability
in the management of natural resources as well as public finance.
In the fiscal area, the authorities will keep spending within budget in order to further reduce
inflationary pressures and they agree to adopt the primary non–oil balance as the key policy
target. In this regard, the ROSC recommendations will be implemented in addition to the new
tax law with a view to strengthen the expenditure tracking and control process. The three stage
approach to fiscal policy recommended by staff is appropriate and measures needed for its
execution will be put in place notably in improving the public expenditure management
through an adequate technical assistance and the development of the National Poverty
Reduction Strategy.
For the monetary sector, the containment of inflationary pressures remains an important
objective of policies conducted by the regional central bank. The authorities are cognizant that
there is a need for the regional central bank to strengthen its instruments meant to mop up the
excess of liquidity in order to sustain the macroeconomic stability and financial sector
soundness. The authorities will continue to contribute to the reduction in the excess of liquidity
by maintaining a prudent fiscal policy as outline above. The banking system remains sound and
the authorities will continue to enhance the banking supervision while taking necessary actions

-4to ensure that banks comply with prudential regulations. My authorities, in collaboration, with
the regional body namely Groupe Anti-blanchiment en Afrique Centrale are committed to
implement an anti-money-laundering/combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). In that
regard, a coordinating unit will be established by year-end. In addition, my authorities place a
high priority on establishing an adequate framework for the management of the country’s
growing budget surpluses consistent with its obligations as a member of the BEAC.
The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to comply with the regional directives in
enhancing the intra regional trade and implementing the common external tariff. They also
intend to phase out over time the remaining export tariffs on cocoa, coffee and logs though
their objective is to provide an incentive for higher value-added activities. They fully share the
view of eliminating these taxes in order to enhance the profitability and competitiveness of the
cocoa, coffee and logs considered as traditional sectors.
Poverty reduction
My authorities recognize the need to scale up their efforts to improve the social indicators and
meet the MDGs. To this end they intend to draw on lessons learned from the National
Development Plan and develop a full document on poverty reduction strategy (PRSP), for
which they are requesting assistance from the World Bank. They agree that the PRSP will
provide a framework for adjusting both level and composition of public expenditure with the
objective of meeting the social needs of the population. Moreover the poverty reduction
strategy will enable the authorities to balance their objective to improve social outcomes with
the need for macroeconomic stability and intergenerational equity. The second national
conference scheduled for the end of 2005 will discuss the interim document of poverty
reduction strategy. In the meantime, the authorities have initiated with the assistance of the
U.S. Government, a project to assess social needs in Equatorial Guinea, and develop a
mechanism to improve and speed up the execution of social outlays. Social projects were
identified at the National Conference on the Assessment of the National Development Strategy
held in January 2004.
Capacity building and statistical issues
It is worth stressing that severe institutional capacity constraints have hindered the authorities’
ability to conduct economic policy and to implement their development program over the past
years. Therefore, they are mindful of the need to identify priority areas for capacity building and
seek external assistance from the international community including from the Fund. Macro
statistics, public expenditure management and macro fiscal policy advice front under the
implementation of the fiscal transparency ROSC and World Bank EITI recommendations are the
priority areas identified. My Equato Guinean authorities are determined to work with the Fund
to develop the scheme and financial modalities for this crucial capacity building assistance. In
this regard, a formal request has been already submitted to the management. Furthermore, my
authorities in collaboration with AFRSTAT and other development partners, will undertake all
necessary actions to ensure successful implementation of the national strategy for the
development of statistics (NSDS) and to initiate the reforms of the statistical system.

-5Conclusion
I would like to reiterate the determination of my authorities to closely work with the Fund and
other development partners in implementing needed reforms aimed at enhancing transparency
and accountability in oil resources management, diversifying the economy and enhancing
institutional capacities. They have reiterated their commitment to the EITI Initiative at the last
meeting in London, and intend to participate as a pilot in a G-8 Transparency and
Accountability Compact. My authorities are also determined to continue their efforts to
improve the economic performance of the country, especially through the development of the
non-oil sector, structural reforms, including the development of a strong private sector, which
they view as critical to ensure sustainable growth of the economy over the medium to long
term. My authorities fully recognize the important challenges, notably on capacity building and
the need to enhance social indicators. The biggest challenge facing Equatorial Guinea is to
overcome the capacity constraint in order to be able to use the fast growing oil revenue to meet
the development objectives of the present and future generations. In this regard, my authorities
are hopeful that their development partners will provide them with the needed technical
assistance.

IMF Executive Board
Concludes Article IV Consultation with Equatorial Guinea
On April 25, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Equatorial Guinea.1
Background
Hydrocarbons dominate economic developments in Equatorial Guinea and will continue to
be the engine of growth in the foreseeable future. Since oil production began in 1995,
hydrocarbon production has increased from 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day
(boe/day) to 282,000 boe/day in 2003, supporting an average annual growth of 31 percent.
In 2004, real GDP grew by 34 percent, reflecting a sharp increase in oil production. Non-oil
GDP increased by 13 percent fueled by growth in the infrastructure and construction
sectors, driven by increasing government capital expenditure. However, the primary sector
remained sluggish as labor migration from rural to urban areas continued in search of
higher earnings and the enforcement of sustainable logging program was maintained.
Although inflation has decelerated to 5 percent in 2004, the inflation differential between
Equatorial Guinea and its trading partners and the appreciation of the euro have led to the
appreciation of the real effective exchange rate by 5 percent in 2004, for an accumulated
real appreciation of 32 percent since 2000, further undermining external competitiveness.
Monetary development continues to be dominated by fiscal policy. Broad money increased
by 45 percent owing to large foreign exchange inflows of government oil revenue and
transfers from oil companies that contributed to the buildup of net foreign assets.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2-

Government spending failed to sterilize these inflows. Excess liquidity in the banking system
rose without any significant impact on domestic prices because of limited lending
opportunities that kept credit to the economy in check.
Fiscal outcome was marked by an increase in the fiscal surplus in 2004 compared to 2003
on account of a stronger-than-expected revenue performance due to higher oil prices and
increased in hydrocarbon production that was partly offset by a substantial increase in
capital expenditure. The persistent overruns in capital expenditures over the past years
underscore weak budgetary discipline and a need for a better public expenditure
management.
The overall balance of payments surplus has more than doubled compared to 2003, driven
by oil exports and large inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) in the hydrocarbon sector.
Official international reserves increased to about 18 months of imports of goods and
services not financed by FDI. The overall terms of trade has improved significantly owing to
the increase in the price of oil.
Important progress has been made with regard to transparency and accountability of
oil-related revenues and public finance. At the request of the authorities, the World Bank
has been providing assistance regarding their participation in the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative (EITI). A fiscal transparency Report on the Observance of Standards
and Codes (ROSC) was completed in early 2005. Moreover, the Article IV mission was able
to reconcile the fiscal surplus with movements in government account at the Bank of Central
African States (BEAC) and government oil production share, exports and revenue. The
authorities at the highest level indicated their commitment to implement the
recommendations of the fiscal transparency ROSC and to participate in the EITI. A key
structural fiscal reform has been implemented with the adoption of a new tax code that
consolidates dispersed legislation in one document, thereby enhancing transparency.
Unfortunately, the country’s oil and gas wealth has not yet let to a measurable improvement
in living conditions for the majority of the population. Against that background, the
authorities have assessed their National Development Plan for 1997-2001 and have
recognized that the objectives poverty reduction has not been achieved. They therefore
intends to prepare an Interim poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) that could serve as a
roadmap for the provision of donor’s technical support.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the strong economic performance achieved in 2004, with
continued rapid economic growth, a deceleration in the rate of inflation, better-thanexpected revenue performance, a doubling in the overall balance of payments surplus, and
a further increase in official international reserves. Directors underscored, however, that
with the hydrocarbon sector continuing to dominate macroeconomic developments, the
ensurance of a prudent and transparent use of the oil wealth, and the implementation of
sound macroeconomic policies along with the implementation of structural measures would
be crucial to create an environment conducive to ensuring continued broad-based growth
and reducing poverty by strengthening the climate for private sector investment and
diversifying the economy.

-3-

Directors noted with concern the substantial increase in public spending had more than
offset improved revenue performance in 2004, particularly in the absence of a
comprehensive guiding framework. They observed that the high level of public spending
could place upward pressure on prices and the real effective exchange rate, thereby
undermining the competitiveness of the economy. Against this background, they urged the
authorities to strengthen public expenditure management and control, and welcomed the
intentions of the authorities to move forward in this area, including an undertaking to review
public expenditure with assistance from the World Bank.
In light of the need for fiscal consolidation, Directors were encouraged by the fiscal stance
set out in the 2005 budget. Noting the absence of a formal mechanism for enforcing budget
limits, they urged the authorities to remain within the budget parameters and recommended
that a specific expenditure target be set in the supplemental budget law, with any increases
in aggregate spending during the year requiring prior approval by parliament.
Directors welcomed the adoption of a new tax code that increased the corporate income tax
rate and replaced the domestic turnover tax with a value added tax (VAT) as well as the
recent reorganization of the tax authority and further strengthening of the tax administration,
which will help broaden the tax base and pave the way for increased non-oil revenues.
Directors recommended that export taxes be phased out at an early date, in support of
economic diversification.
Directors expressed concerns over the liquidity overhang, which they observed could
jeopardize price stability and financial sector soundness. Given the limitations of monetary
policy instruments and absorptive capacity constraints, they urged that these factors be
taken into account in setting fiscal policy.
Directors noted that the economic expansion over the past decade had not led to a
measurable improvement in living conditions and that poverty remains widespread in
Equatorial Guinea. They observed, however, that rapid progress toward the achievement of
the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) should be possible, given hydrocarbon
resources and the outlook for oil prices. Directors emphasized that a comprehensive
development strategy would help in guiding the country’s vast oil wealth into priority sectors,
strengthening capacity building, and tackling widespread poverty, in particular by
strengthening the focus on health and education, while safeguarding macroeconomic
stability, with supporting technical assistance. In this regard, Directors encouraged the
authorities to prepare an interim poverty reduction strategy paper that could serve as a
roadmap and facilitate support from the country’s development partners.
Directors commended the authorities’ commitment to regional integration and the progress
toward meeting the Central African Monetary and Economic Union (CEMAC)
macroeconomic convergence criteria. They considered that the regional currency union has
served Equatorial Guinea well in helping to control inflation and foster macroeconomic
stability. Directors called on the authorities to monitor competitiveness closely, noting that
the deliberate implementation of reform initiatives would contribute to improving overall
economic efficiency. They encouraged the authorities to support more actively regional
initiatives in the areas of trade, customs liberalization, and banking supervision. Directors

-4-

also urged Equatorial Guinea to actively participate in setting up the regional institution for
anti-money laundering.
Directors commended the authorities for recent progress in the area of transparency and
accountability in resource management and public finance, noting that the initial steps need
to be backed up with resolute action. They welcomed the authorities’ decision to deposit all
government oil receipts with the regional monetary authority and supported the authorities’
claim for appropriate remuneration of government deposits by the BEAC.
Directors welcomed the completion of a fiscal transparency ROSC and the decision to
publish the report and advised the authorities to implement the recommendations. They
also welcomed the prospective participation in the EITI and as a pilot case for the G-8
corruption and transparency compact and recommended that they take the necessary
actions to participate in the EITI and the G-8 compact as soon as possible. They saw these
as important steps in the direction of increased transparency and accountability and as a
break from past practices. Directors recognized that sustained progress in each of these
areas would require improvements in institutional capacity and urged the country’s
development partners to help build such capacity in areas within their core competencies. In
this context, there were concerns about the recent decision to require foreign investors to
obtain local partners.
Directors urged the authorities to increase the quality of macroeconomic data as this would
improve Fund surveillance and lead to better informed policy discussions. They welcomed
the staff’s plans to help build capacity in this area and the authorities’ plans for a more
frequent sharing of information and policy dialogue with the staff.
