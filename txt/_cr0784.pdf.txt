Executive Summary
•

Sharing in the regional dynamism, economic performance remains strong, driven by
productivity gains and buoyant exports. The near-term outlook is favorable, but
sustaining strong performance over the medium term requires renewed progress on fiscal
consolidation and improving labor market flexibility.

•

The current political uncertainty risks leading to policy drift. Although financial
markets are assured by strong growth and generally sound fundamentals, there is broad
agreement between the staff and the authorities that it is important to guard against
competitive populism and return to the path of fiscal consolidation.

•

The main concerns center on the erosion of fiscal discipline in 2006-7 and the
medium-term fiscal outlook. The expansionary fiscal stance for 2007 is out of place in
view of the expected robust growth. The authorities’ medium-term consolidation plans are
appropriate, but supporting measures should be identified without delay. A cutback in
high mandatory social spending would improve fiscal flexibility and efficiency. The
institutional fiscal framework also needs to be strengthened.

•

The Czech National Bank’s steady hand continues to anchor inflation expectations
close to the target of 3 percent. In view of the projected rise in inflation, CNB should
continue to withdraw monetary stimulus, albeit at a cautious pace, striving to balance the
rising resource pressures with the strengthening koruna and the impact of supply-driven
changes. Rapid credit growth calls for continued supervisory vigilance.

•

On the structural policy front, raising labor market flexibility remains the main
priority. A high tax wedge and generous entitlements discourage job search, and strict
employment protection hampers job creation. The authorities view the recent changes in
the labor code as improving the flexibility of employment contracts. A new bankruptcy
law should help improve the business environment and should be implemented
effectively.

negotiations continued into the new year in an
effort to resolve the electoral deadlock. A coalition headed by the Civic Democratic Party
(ODS) leader Mirek Topolanek won a confidence vote on January 19, 2007, but its narrow
majority suggests a weak mandate for reforms and a possibility of early elections. Financial
markets have taken the political uncertainty in stride, assured by the recent strong economic
performance and favorable outlook.

II. BACKGROUND
4.
Exports, fuelled by the expanding capacity of the automotive sector, have
served as the engine behind the recent acceleration in growth (Table 1 and Figure 1).
The coming on stream of new capacity, aided by foreign investment and coinciding with a

cyclical recovery in the EU markets, sustained a surge in automobile exports.3 Investment,
especially in machinery and transport equipment, has been buoyant, supported by strong
corporate profitability. Private consumption also strengthened on the back of income tax
cuts, increased pre-election spending, and rising employment.

Robust productivity growth and
a strong koruna have kept inflation below
the target of 3 percent. Growing competition
owing to globalization and entry of
international retail chains also helped contain
inflation by narrowing margins. The pickup in
headline inflation in 2006 was largely due to
increases in prices of energy and regulated
utilities. Core inflation has remained broadly
stable around 1 percent, reflecting strong
central bank credibility and the absence of
second-round effects. Although the koruna has

7.
The current account deficit continues to be comfortably financed by foreign
direct investment inflows (Table 2 and Figure 3). The deficit is estimated to have widened
to 4.3 percent of GDP in 2006, in part reflecting higher dividend outflows by foreign-owned
companies. Inflows of direct investment remain strong, albeit declining from their recent
high levels driven by the privatization of Cesky Telecom. While gross official reserves
continued to climb, estimated to have reached about $32 billion by end-2006, equivalent to
more than 3 months of imports, gross external debt is estimated to have remained broadly
stable at 37 percent of GDP.
8.
Monetary policy has been tightened gradually. After raising the policy rate by
25 basis points in October 2005, the Czech National Bank (CNB) paused until early August
2006, when rising food and energy prices and a pickup in domestic demand prompted a rise.
The rate was raised another notch to 2½ percent in late September, against the backdrop of a
worsening fiscal outlook and some weakening of the koruna. Since then, however, with
global monetary tightening, the Czech policy rate is now the lowest in the EU, and
100 basis points below that of the ECB (Figure 4).
9.
Recent fiscal gains were relinquished in 2006, as fiscal policy turned
strongly expansionary (Table 3). Healthy fiscal performance in 2005, with the general
government deficit narrowing sharply to about 2 percent of GDP, was due to buoyant
revenues from strong growth and carryover of unused budget allocations.4 However, in

Staff analysis is based on a cash-based definition of the general government balance, since accrual-based
ESA-95 or GFSM 2001 fiscal data are not yet available with sufficient detail for fiscal analysis. Differences
with the ESA-95 measure and the authorities’ cash-based definition are explained in Appendix II of the staff
supplement. Drawing on a pilot study by the STA, the authorities are preparing to move fully to the GFSM
2001-based fiscal accounting in the near future.

7
2006, the deficit is estimated to have risen sharply to 3¾ percent of GDP, reflecting preelection tax cuts and increases in social transfers for pensions and health care. Fiscal policy
has thus added a strong procyclical impulse to an already booming economy.
III. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
10.
Growth is set to slow but remain robust in 2007 (Tables 1 and 4). Staff’s
growth forecast of 4¾ percent is close to the latest consensus. With the effects of export
capacity expansion unwinding, domestic demand will remain the primary driver of growth.
Private consumption is expected to strengthen, supported by gains in employment and
disposable income and a continued expansionary fiscal stance. Business investment is
projected to remain robust, as integration of global supply chains in the automotive and
electronics sectors continues apace. Public investment is also expected to pick up with
rising utilization of EU funds. Exports will decelerate, but remain strong, in line with
growth in the euro area. Headline inflation is expected to rise, but remain around the target
of 3 percent. The current account deficit is projected to remain at around 4 percent of GDP.

11.
The risks to the outlook for growth appear balanced. Upside risks stem from
stronger recovery in the eurozone and lower oil prices. On the downside, investment could
be weaker if a worsening fiscal outlook under uncertain political prospects begins to take its
toll on investor confidence. A faster-than-expected appreciation of the koruna might also
weigh on exports and investment. Although vulnerability indicators are generally favorable
(Table 5), the correlation of Czech credit default swaps with those for Hungary and Poland
suggests exposure to regional contagion risk (Figure 2).
12.
Longer-term prospects are clouded by population aging and rising global
competition (Table 4). With old-age dependency set to rise sharply after 2010, the Czech
Republic faces one of the more daunting demographic challenges in the EU. Although
investment is likely to remain strong, benefiting further from FDI in manufacturing and

8
outsourcing of business services, aging will begin to weigh heavily on labor supply soon.5
Competitiveness could suffer, if productivity growth or wage moderation cannot be
sustained, or the education system fails to keep pace with the demands of an increasingly
knowledge-based economy. Staff projects a slowdown in potential growth to around
4 percent, assuming the current gradual pace of reforms. The external position is, however,
likely to remain comfortable. With the current account deficit projected to decline to about
3.4 per cent of GDP over the medium term, external debt is set to stabilize below 30 percent
of GDP, and its dynamics seem resilient to significant macroeconomic shocks (Appendix I).
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
13.
With near-term prospects remaining robust despite the political gridlock, the
policy debate is focused on how to preserve the recent economic gains. The authorities
are confident that the economy is likely to remain resilient to any adverse shifts in emerging
market sentiment. Looking forward, there is a broad recognition in the Czech policy
community that sustaining growth in the face of population aging and intensifying global
competition requires strong fiscal consolidation and enhancing the flexibility of labor
markets. These reforms are also seen as crucial for the success of euro adoption.
14.
The main challenge is to guard against policy drift and competitive populism.
Consensus on major fiscal and labor market reforms is likely to be elusive in the current
fractured political environment, especially since the main political parties hold differing
views on the generosity of social protection, healthcare benefits and pensions. To mitigate
the risk of policy drift, staff place emphasis on strategies for reducing public spending while
raising its efficiency and on improving the institutional framework to ensure fiscal
discipline. Czech officials concur with this emphasis. It remains to be seen if adequate
political support can be marshaled behind a minimum program of reform over the coming
year.
A. How to Arrest Fiscal Policy Drift?
15.
The key concern centers on the recent erosion of fiscal discipline and the
medium-term fiscal outlook. The budget for 2007—passed by parliament on largely
bipartisan lines—envisages a rise in the deficit to 4.4 percent of GDP, largely reflecting the
impact of the pre-election social benefits package of about 1 percent of GDP. Moreover,
there is a risk of overruns in mandatory spending. The budget implies a further increase in
the structural deficit and a significant slippage from the 2005 Convergence Program target.

Officials do not contest the staff view that with domestic demand continuing to grow
strongly and GDP growth projected to remain above potential, the fiscal stance should
ideally withdraw stimulus. Such a stance would also help the authorities return to the
medium-term path of a gradual reduction in structural deficits. However, even maintaining a
broadly neutral fiscal stance calls for reducing the deficit by about ¾ percent of GDP in
2007. Building consensus on measures to do so appears difficult at the current political
juncture, given the likelihood of early elections.

17.
With the tax wedge already relatively high, fiscal adjustment would need to
come primarily from spending cuts. Spending reforms should aim to address rising agerelated pressures, while enhancing the efficiency of spending. Expenditure restructuring will
also provide fiscal space for the growing co-financing of EU-funded projects and widen the
discretionary scope for fiscal policy. Drawing on studies of long-term fiscal sustainability
and spending efficiency, staff has identified pensions, healthcare, and social benefits as
priority areas for spending reforms.6 Given the relatively high efficiency of social spending,
the rolling back of the newly approved social benefits package should not compromise
social objectives (Box 1). A proposal for a flat tax rate of 17–19 percent for corporate and
personal incomes has featured prominently in coalition discussions, but offsetting measures
have not been identified.
18.
The political impasse has hindered the formulation of a fiscal reform package.
The provisional 2006 Convergence Program envisages an annual reduction in the deficit of
½ percent of GDP to meet the 3 percent Stability and Growth Pact target by 2009.7
However, measures to achieve the targets remain to be identified. The authorities
highlighted ongoing efforts to stabilize healthcare costs. They also intend to take steps
toward pension reform by raising the statutory retirement age from 63 to 65 years,
encouraging private retirement savings through savings subsidies, and continuing to build
fiscal reserves. Yet consensus on broader pension and healthcare reforms remains elusive.

See Country Report 05/275 and the accompanying Selected Issues Paper.

The Czech Republic has been subject to the EU’s excessive deficit procedure since shortly after its accession
to the EU on May 1, 2004. Using the historical volatility of GDP and budget elasticities, staff estimates that
the structural deficit of 1¼ percent of GDP is consistent with staying within the SGP limit.

11
Staff has argued that, without such reforms, medium-term fiscal targets would need to be
more ambitious, aiming for a structural balance or a surplus by early in the next decade.
Box 1. Raising the Efficiency of Social Spending
The recent erosion of fiscal discipline underscores the need to contain expenditure, including from
higher social benefits and healthcare pressures.
Social protection
Improved targeting could facilitate a decline in spending without jeopardizing social indicators. Existing
social benefits appear relatively efficient in reducing poverty and inequality relative to other EU countries.
However, additional social benefit spending could have a limited impact on outcomes given diminishing
returns to spending. There is also scope to strengthen the targeting of existing social benefits. For instance, the
share of the population receiving social assistance exceeds that in most other new EU member states.
Moreover, the budget covers the health insurance premia of over half the population.
Health care
Greater efficiency could be achieved by addressing demand and cost pressures. Healthcare spending
appears relatively inefficient based on outcome indicators, such as mortality rates and healthy life expectancy.
As a result, enhancing outcome performance will be essential as healthcare budgets come under pressure from
population aging. There is scope to contain healthcare demand by introducing means-tested co-payments, and
narrowing the near universal coverage of public services to provide room for private provision and insurance.
In terms of cost pressures, efforts are needed to contain drug costs, which absorb 25 percent of spending
compared to the OECD average of 15 percent. Alternatives are also needed for the costly “social
hospitalization” of elderly patients, and hospital financing could be better linked to the cost of service
provision.

19.
The fiscal framework needs to be strengthened to help stem eroding
discipline. The upward revision of the nominal expenditure ceilings, initially established in
the three-year rolling budget, in the face of stronger than expected revenues has led to a
procyclical policy stance and undermined the credibility of the fiscal framework. Concerns
about the effectiveness of the framework also arise from the carryover of unspent budget
allocations available for future spending (1⅔ percent of GDP at end-2006). The authorities
expect the recent decision to limit such carryover to strengthen the effectiveness of ceilings.
The planned introduction of the integrated state treasury system is also expected to help
ensure greater fiscal transparency and control. Enforcement of the medium-term
expenditure framework remains the key challenge, calling for political will to adhere to the
original spending ceilings in the annual budgeting process.
B. What is the Appropriate Pace of Monetary Tightening?
20.
Against the backdrop of strong growth, yet subdued inflation and wellanchored expectations, the CNB has pursued a measured pace of monetary tightening.
Upside risks to inflation stemmed from capacity constraints, the fiscal loosening, and
potential second-round effects of energy price increases. However, the CNB has also been

12
mindful of the offsetting impact of a strong koruna and declining labor costs, aided by
strong productivity growth, lingering labor market slack and rising inflows of labor. It has
also given weight to structural influences, such as shrinking margins reflecting growing
global competition and the supply-driven nature of recent growth.
21.
Looking ahead, inflation is expected to rise, although with risks to the
downside. Assuming a stable exchange rate, the CNB and staff project headline inflation to
move slightly above the 3 percent target by mid-2008, largely due to planned increases in
regulated prices and excise taxes. Underlying inflation is also set to creep up gradually,
against the backdrop of a strong domestic demand and negative real interest rates. The main
downside risk is the koruna, which has remained resilient to negative interest rate
differentials. Productivity growth could also be stronger than expected, as technological
upgrading, supported by FDI inflows, continues at a fast pace. On balance, although output
is judged to be close to potential, staff supports the CNB’s cautious approach to tightening.
C. Is Competitiveness Adequate to Sustain Growth?
22.
The authorities and staff view the level of the koruna as broadly consistent
with fundamentals. The real effective exchange rate (REER) based on relative consumer
prices and unit labor costs appreciated by about 5–6 percent in 2006, as the koruna
continued to strengthen against the euro and relative productivity growth slowed. Yet export
market shares in EU-15 continued to rise (Figure 5). Staff’s model-based analysis suggests
that the level of the koruna is broadly in line with fundamentals. A cross-country study of
export structures also confirms that the koruna’s level does not threaten competitiveness
(Box 2). The authorities have not intervened in the foreign exchange market for the purpose
of influencing the level of the koruna since 2002, viewing intervention as an exceptional
policy tool. Increases in gross reserves in recent years have largely reflected off-market
conversion of large privatization receipts and EU transfers. Staff and the authorities view
the current level of reserves as adequate.
23.
The authorities plan to update their euro adoption strategy. They do not see
entry into eurozone on the near-term agenda. With the economy already enjoying the
benefits of nominal convergence, a delay is viewed as unlikely to put the economy at a
disadvantage. Nonetheless, the authorities concur with the staff that euro adoption remains
an important opportunity for reaping further gains from enhanced trade, investment and
economic growth. Staff’s analysis of financial market indicators and discussions with
market participants suggest that policy credibility on fiscal consolidation and structural
reforms would be important not only during the transition to the euro but to maximize the
eventual gains from adopting it (Box 3). The forthcoming strategy update is intended to
clarify the latest political thinking on the key reform issues on the road to euro adoption.

Box 2. Empirical Analyses of Competitiveness
A survey of the literature shows that model-based analyses of the koruna's equilibrium exchange
rate are inconclusive, partly due to the difficulty of measuring equilibrium rates in transition
economies.

Box 3. The Financial Market View: Full and Sustainable Convergence? 1/
Markets seem to perceive the Czech Republic as having achieved nominal convergence with the eurozone. In
the local currency debt market, koruna yields are close to Greek euro-denominated yields at maturities 8 years and
longer. At shorter maturities, Czech debt yields are below those for German bunds, in part reflecting the negative

interest rate differential vis-à-vis the eurozone since October 2005. The

Technical factors support the favorable market indicators. With low liquidity in markets for Czech instruments
limiting investors’ ability to take large positions, the investor base has been dominated by “slow money” convergence
funds, and increasingly “eurozone” funds. Few hedge funds have actively engaged in Czech markets, in contrast to
Polish and Hungarian ones. In addition, low volatility of the koruna—less than half of that of the forint and well
below that of the zloty—allows investors to take currency positions involving the koruna with confidence. The

Market reaction to the authorities’ decision to
delay euro adoption beyond 2010 has been muted,
as this outcome was widely anticipated. Contacts
believe that maintaining an independent, floating
exchange rate at a time of rapid growth and
structural change gives policymakers useful
flexibility, underpinned by the central bank’s strong
policy credibility. Nonetheless, should investor
confidence in the authorities’ commitment to sound
macroeconomic policy weaken, the role of euro
adoption as an anchor for policies might become

more important to investors.
Investors are beginning to grow concerned that the delay in forming a stable government would raise the risk
of further fiscal slippages. The koruna rallied modestly on signs of progress in coalition negotiations, signaling an
underlying concern. Looking ahead, fiscal policy and the sustainability of FDI inflows have been cited as the main
medium-term concerns.

D. How to Maintain Financial Stability in the Face of Rapid Credit Growth?
24.
Financial soundness indicators and stress tests point to a sound financial
sector. Profitability, efficiency and capital adequacy are broadly comparable to those of
regional peers. Banks’ capital ratios have been above the regulatory minimum of 8 percent,
albeit declining in tandem with the expansion in bank balance sheets. The authorities did
not rule out that the introduction of the new capital accord (Basel II) would further reduce
banks’ capital cushions. Yet their recent stress tests indicated that the banking sector should
be able to withstand sizeable market and credit risk shocks.

Sustained rapid growth of credit to households has brought concerns about
credit risks to the fore. Mortgage lending has been growing at annual rates exceeding
30 percent since 2002, and consumer credit growth accelerated to almost 40 percent in the
last two years (Figure 4). Financial indicators suggest that the current level of loan quality is
reasonably high, although the trend is not as positive as one might expect in current
favorable circumstances. In particular, the share of classified loans has been rising gradually
in line with a pickup in household lending. These concerns are mitigated by the fact that
foreign currency lending to households is negligible and house price inflation remains
moderate. The authorities’ and staff’s empirical analyses confirm that credit risks are
contained at present and are concentrated in a few rapidly growing institutions.8
26.
The authorities plan to continue enhancing supervision, to make it more
forward looking and risk based. To encourage strong risk management by banks, they
intend to issue best practice recommendations on stress testing in the coming years.
Continued strengthening of cooperation with foreign counterparts is also a priority, given
significant foreign ownership in the financial system and the introduction of Basel II.
Efforts to further strengthen risk assessment through stress testing, credit risk modeling, and
analyses of disaggregated and nonbank loan data continue. With a view to further
strengthening the efficiency of supervision of large and complex financial institutions, the
authorities unified the financial sector regulation and supervision under the CNB in April
2006, and subsequent streamlining of financial regulations is under way.

Continued efforts to improve labor market
flexibility are essential for sustaining growth. While
the employment rate is comparable to the EU-15
average, a high tax wedge and disincentives to work
embedded in generous welfare programs weaken
incentives to work for young low-wage earners.
Geographical and skill mismatches also contribute to
high and persistent structural unemployment. Recent
policy measures, such as the reduction in income taxes
for low-income groups, aimed at reducing marginal
effective tax rates, go some way in this direction. The
business sector views the new labor code as a missed
opportunity for a substantive improvement in labor
market flexibility, particularly in the area of
employment protection. The authorities, however, note

17
that the scope of contractual employment has been broadened under the new legislation.
They underscore the importance of the recent decision to phase out rent controls for
reducing geographical mismatches.
28.
Legislative changes to improve the business environment are in place. A
recent World Bank assessment suggests that doing business in the Czech Republic is
considerably more onerous than in many EU economies. The bankruptcy resolution process
has been especially lengthy and costly. The authorities hope that new bankruptcy legislation
that became effective at the beginning of 2007 will help ease concerns in this area.
There is scope for further improvements in business environment compared to the best
performing EU countries.

V. STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
Economic performance remains strong, despite political uncertainty. Rising
consumer confidence, high profitability and favorable competitiveness point to robust
growth in 2007, in line with a continued recovery in the EU markets and a strong regional
momentum in central and eastern Europe. However, sustaining this success calls for
continued political commitment to reform.
30.
The new government should place the highest priority on resuming progress on
the reform agenda. Financial markets have taken the recent political uncertainty in stride,
assured by the economy’s recent strong performance, the generally sound fundamentals,
and a record of responsible governance. However, policy drift, if allowed to persist, can be
costly over the medium term. It is therefore important to guard against complacency and
competitive populism.
31.
Fiscal policy is adding a strong procyclical impulse to an already booming
economy. A large pre-election fiscal relaxation has reversed the recent favorable trend in

18
public finances in 2006. Together with the large mandatory social spending in the pipeline,
this trend points to a missed opportunity to advance fiscal consolidation in good times. With
growth projected to remain above potential, at least a neutral policy stance is warranted,
which would require additional measures amounting to about ¾ percent of GDP.
32.
A renewed political commitment to expenditure-based fiscal consolidation is
necessary to address medium-term fiscal pressures. These pressures arise from
population aging, cofinancing of EU-funded projects, high risky guarantees, and increased
social benefits. The authorities’ intention for an annual reduction in the structural deficit by
½ percent of GDP in the forthcoming Convergence Program is welcome. However, this
intention needs to be supported by concrete expenditure measures by the incoming
government. With the tax wedge already high, fiscal adjustment would need to come from
spending cuts. Any tax reform package should, at the minimum, ensure budget neutrality.
Looking ahead, without early and comprehensive pension and healthcare reforms, a
structural balance or a small surplus would be needed by early in the next decade to prepare
for the challenge of aging.
33.
Restructuring of public spending should be guided by its relative efficiency and
the need to enhance its flexibility. The efficiency of social benefits can be improved by
better targeting of transfers to low-income households. As the private share of healthcare
spending is among the lowest in the EU, introducing co-payments on a means-tested basis
would help contain demand pressures. Structural reforms are also needed to address rising
healthcare costs. Pension system reforms such as an early phase-in of a higher retirement
age and strengthening the link between contributions and benefits are desirable irrespective
of the choice of the new pension model.
34.
Institutional measures are needed to enhance public financial management and
transparency. The failure to adhere to the medium-term expenditure ceilings suggests the
need for renewing political commitment to the fiscal framework. Further limits on the
carryover and drawdown of unspent allocations are necessary to prevent a loss of budgetary
control. Transparency can be enhanced by integrating extrabudgetary funds in budget
preparation, reporting and implementation. The authorities’ plans to move fully to GFSM
2001-based fiscal accounts, supported by their participation in the Fund’s pilot project, are
welcome.
35.
A continued cautious pace of monetary tightening would be appropriate.
Headline inflation is expected to rise gradually, driven partly by increases in regulated
prices. Underlying inflation is also set to creep up as domestic demand strengthens against
the backdrop of negative real interest rates. However, policy will need to navigate carefully,
striving to balance these influences with the strengthening koruna and the impact of supplydriven changes.

19
36.
Plans to clarify the strategy for euro adoption are welcome. Euro adoption
remains an important opportunity for reaping the gains from enhanced trade and investment.
A delayed timetable for euro entry was widely anticipated and by itself should not constitute
a significant setback. However, the delay underscores anew the critical role of adhering to
the path of strong fiscal consolidation, strengthening the institutional fiscal framework, and
enhancing the flexibility of labor and product markets. Policy credibility on these fronts will
be all the more crucial not only during the transition to the euro but in order to maximize the
eventual gains from adopting it.
37.
The financial sector appears to be in good health, but faces challenges. Ensuring
that supervision remains proactive, risk-based, and forward-looking remains important in an
environment of continued rapid credit growth. Supervision of rapidly expanding institutions
and cooperation with foreign supervisors need to be strengthened. The recent integration of
banking, insurance, and securities supervision under the CNB can bring welcome efficiency
gains in the supervision of increasingly complex financial institutions.
38.
A more flexible labor market is needed to enhance growth potential and the
economy’s resilience to shocks. The recent decision to phase out rent controls is welcome
as it should help reduce geographical barriers and facilitate greater labor mobility. Reforms
of social benefit entitlement programs would improve incentives to work and encourage
labor participation. Improving labor market flexibility will require, in particular, reforms in
the area of employment protection.
39.
Further steps to improve the business climate would help preserve the
attractiveness of the Czech Republic to investors. Recent legislative initiatives such as
the new law to speed up the bankruptcy resolution process are therefore welcome.
40.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

estimate at this stage, but they are likely to be analogous to those of the Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) plant in 2005–06. These considerations explain the

Appendix I. Czech Republic: Medium-Term Fiscal and External Outlook
Fiscal Sustainability
The Czech authorities plan a gradual fiscal consolidation, reversing the sharp increase
in debt observed in the past. The plan seeks to achieve the 3 percent Maastricht threshold
by 2009 whereby, the general government deficit declines by around ½ percent of GDP
annually, and all of the Czech Consolidation Agency’s (CKA) debt is fully assumed by the
government by 2008. Repayments of risky guarantees by installments is also assumed.

Under the baseline scenario,
assuming the fiscal consolidation
plan is implemented, the medium
term debt outlook is favorable. The
stock of government debt is projected
to stay below 35 percent of GDP.
Lower fiscal deficits and strong
growth have contributed to the stable
outlook. Under the standard adverse
shock scenarios to growth, interest
rate, and exchange rate, public debt
should be sustainable in the medium
term, remaining below the Maastricht
ceiling of 60 percent of GDP (Table
A1 and Figure A1).

Source: Staff calculations.
Notes: Baseline scenario assumes medium term deficits of 3 percent. Staff
alternative scenario incorporates healthcare debt (10 bill. CZK), ecological
guarantees (85 bill. CZK), risky guarantees (97 bill. CZK), and fiscal deficit
3563
3663 to baseline.
3766
3871
higher by 1percent
of GDP compared

Nevertheless, recent evidence of waning commitment to fiscal reform suggests that the
medium term debt dynamics could worsen considerably. The pre-election social benefits
package would cost in excess of 1½ percent of GDP over 2007-08, while consolidation
measures to achieve the medium term deficit target are yet to be identified. In addition,
significant risks are associated with contingent liabilities (government guarantees stood at 14
percent of GDP at end-2005, excluding ecological guarantees associated with environmental
cleanup of privatized companies and CKA guarantees). Aside from a large bank guarantee,
on which an arbitration case is pending, outstanding guarantees of about 3 percent of GDP
are considered high risk. A sizable debt in the health insurance companies also remains.
Incorporating these high risk contingent liabilities and assuming a higher deficit of 1
percentage points relative to the baseline in line with 2007 budget levels, debt would reach
nearly 45 percent of GDP by 2010. Over the longer term, aging pressures are set to
undermine debt sustainability, with debt levels projected to reach 80 percent of GDP by
2020.
External Sustainability
Recent external developments are favorable. Owing to the exceptionally strong export
performance, trade balance recorded a surplus and current account deficit narrowed
significantly. The international investment position shows a modest net liability position
equal to around 30 percent of GDP, reflecting large stock of inward FDI. Robust FDI

31
inflows, exchange rate appreciation, and
real GDP growth continued to provide
enough room to run a current account
deficit without an increase in external
debt.

International investment position
Even under adverse conditions with a
growth slowdown and a decline in FDI, external debt remains below 30 percent of GDP in
2011. Bound tests indicate a largely manageable external debt ratio at around 40 percent of
GDP in the face of combined shocks from higher interest rate, lower growth and a worsened
current account.

1/ The coverage of public sector is the general government using data for gross debt.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
The currency of the Czech Republic is the Czech koruna, created on
February 8, 1993 upon the dissolution of the currency union with the
Slovak Republic, which had used the Czechoslovak koruna as its currency.
From May 3, 1993 to May 27, 1997, the exchange rate was pegged to a
basket of two currencies: the deutsche mark (65 percent) and the
U.S. dollar (35 percent). On February 28, 1996, the Czech National Bank
widened the exchange rate band from ±0.5 percent to ±7.5 percent around
the central rate. On May 27, 1997, managed floating was introduced. In
the 2004 edition of the Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and
Exchange Restrictions, the de facto exchange rate regime of the Czech
Republic was classified as managed floating with no pre-announced path
for the exchange rate. Since 2002, the CNB has not engaged in direct
interventions in the foreign exchange market. International reserves have
been affected by the off-market purchases of large privatization receipts
and EU transfers and the sales of the accumulated interest. On January 10,

3
2007, the exchange rate of the Czech koruna stood at CZK 21.35 per U.S.
dollar.
The Czech Republic has accepted the obligations of Article VIII and
maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions. The Czech
Republic maintains exchange restrictions for security reasons, which have
been notified to the Fund for approval (see most recently, EBD/07/1,
01/08/2007) under the procedures set forth in Executive Board Decision
No. 144-(52/51).

Appendix II. Czech Republic: Statistical Issues
1.
Data provision to the Fund is adequate for surveillance. The Czech Republic is in
observance of the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and meets the SDDS
specifications. Statistical metadata are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards
Bulletin Board. While availability of economic data is timely, reporting to STA is less
current, especially for foreign trade and the national accounts.
2.
While data quality is generally adequate, the authorities are taking measures to
improve data accuracy.
•

National accounts data are subject to certain weaknesses. Value added in the
small-scale private sector is likely to be underestimated, as the mechanisms for data
collection on this sector are not yet fully developed and a significant proportion of
unrecorded activity stems from tax evasion. Discrepancies between GDP estimates
based on the production method and the expenditure method are large and are
subsumed under change in stocks. Quarterly estimates of national accounts are
derived from quarterly reports of enterprises and surveys. The estimates are subject to
bias because of nonresponse (while annual reporting of bookkeeping accounts is
mandatory for enterprises, quarterly reporting is not) and lumping of several
expenditure categories in particular quarters by respondents. Large swings in
individual components of spending and the overall GDP from quarter to quarter also
bring into question the reliability of the quarterly data.

•

Recently, revisions to procedures for processing export data have brought external
trade statistics close to the practice in the EU. However, a continued weakness of
foreign trade statistics is the unavailability of fixed base price indices for exports and
imports; these indices are currently presented on the basis of the same month of the
previous year.

•

Monetary survey data provided to the European Department are generally adequate
for policy purposes. However, large variations in the interbank clearing account float,
especially at the end of the year, require caution in interpreting monetary
developments. The CNB has made a major effort to identify the causes of these
variations and adjust the data. In 2002, to meet EU statistical conventions, the CNB
implemented the European Central Bank’s (ECB) framework for collecting,
compiling, and reporting monetary data. The data published in IFS is based on
monetary accounts derived from the ECB’s framework. The same set of accounts also
forms the basis for monetary statistics published in the CNB’s bulletins and on the
website, which are thereby effectively harmonized with the monetary statistics
published in IFS, although the presentation in IFS differs somewhat from the CNB’s.

•

Annual fiscal data on ESA-95 basis has been prepared by the Czech Statistical Office.
Quarterly data for non-financial accounts have also been compiled and quarterly
financial accounts are being prepared. The Ministry of Finance uses the ESA-95

6
methodology for the Convergence Program targets. The ESA-95 methodology differs
from the national (fiscal targeting methodology) in terms of the coverage of the
institutions (for example, the CKA is included in the central government under ESA
definition) and basis of recording due to the inclusion of accrued financial
transactions and other accrual items (for example, called guarantees). The Ministry of
Finance is participating in the Fund’s pilot project to transition to GFSM 2001.
•

Annual data published in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook cover
operations of the general government, excluding “semibudgetary” organizations,
which operate at both the central and local government levels, and it also excludes a
number of state extrabudgetary institutions and special funds. The most important of
these institutions are the Czech Consolidation Agency and its subsidiaries, the Czech
Collection Company, the Railway Infrastructure administration, the Public-PrivatePartnership Centre, and public universities. Monthly fiscal data published in
International Financial Statistics (IFS) cover state budget accounts.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation
with the Czech Republic
On February 21, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Czech Republic.1
Background
Economic performance strengthened during 2005–06, supported by the expanding capacity of
the export-oriented automotive sector and a cyclical recovery in the European Union. The
momentum of growth has been underpinned by strong productivity gains, leading to a surge in
exports and further investment in the tradable goods sector. The koruna strengthened, helping
keep inflation down, while competitiveness and the external position have remained favorable.
Earlier policy reforms and growing integration with the EU have helped build a solid foundation
for income convergence in the Czech Republic.
Growth is projected to remain robust in 2007–08, although its momentum will slow as the effects
of the recent export capacity expansion unwind. Investment, especially in machinery and
transport equipment, is expected to remain buoyant, supported by strong corporate profitability.
Private consumption will also continue to grow strongly on the back of rising employment and
an expansionary fiscal policy stance. Risks to growth are broadly balanced, with the upside
risks stemming from external factors (lower oil prices and stronger recovery in the eurozone)

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
offsetting the downside risks to confidence, in view of the uncertain political prospects in the
aftermath of a close outcome of the June 2006 national elections.
Increases in regulated prices have pushed headline inflation closer to the 3 percent target in
2006, but the underlying inflationary pressures have remained subdued. Lingering slack in the
labor market and inflows of migrant workers kept wage inflation moderate, which, coupled with
strong productivity gains, helped contain labor costs. There are no apparent signs of the
second-round effects from increases in energy and other regulated prices, which, together with
well anchored expectations, underscores the strong credibility of the Czech National Bank
(CNB).
Although the koruna has continued to strengthen, both in nominal and real effective terms, this
has not hindered the gradual rise in export market shares. The trade account has turned into a
surplus during 2005–06. Profit repatriation has kept the current account in deficit, but at a
moderate level. This external position is expected to continue to be strong over the medium
term.
Monetary policy has been tightened gradually, as the CNB has attempted to strike a balance
between the risk of rising resource pressures, continuing productivity gains, and the
strengthening koruna. The policy rate was raised in steps from a historic low of 1¾ percent in
the summer of 2005 to 2½ percent in January 2007. Inflation is expected to rise over the policy
horizon, in part owing to projected increases in regulated prices and indirect taxes, but is
projected to remain around the target. Credit to the private sector, especially to households,
continues to grow strongly.
Fiscal gains achieved in 2005 were relinquished in 2006. Fiscal policy turned expansionary,
and the general government deficit is estimated to have risen to 3¾ percent of GDP, reflecting
pre-election tax cuts and increases in social transfers for pensions and health care. A large
social spending package in the budget for 2007 is expected to raise mandatory spending in the
coming years.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Czech authorities for the recent strong economic
performance. They noted that buoyant growth, sustained by rapid productivity gains, was in line
with the recent regional dynamism, and had been accompanied by low inflation and a
comfortable competitive position. Against the background of recent fiscal deterioration, Directors
underscored the importance for the new government of establishing clear policy signals, and
emphasized the need to resume progress on the agenda of fiscal and structural reforms.
Directors noted that a large pre-election fiscal relaxation had led to a reversal of the recent
favorable trend in public finances in 2006. The procyclical fiscal stimulus, with the economy set
to register another year of robust growth, was untimely. In particular, Directors considered that

3
the decision to increase mandatory social spending in the 2007 budget had worsened the fiscal
position, representing a missed opportunity to consolidate fiscal gains in good times.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to achieve an annual reduction in the structural
deficit by ½ percent of GDP in their forthcoming Convergence Program. They encouraged the
government to identify expeditiously concrete expenditure measures to achieve such
reductions. Directors emphasized the importance of focusing expenditure reforms on improving
efficiency and budgetary flexibility. In the absence of early and comprehensive pension and
healthcare reforms, Directors judged that a structural balance or a small surplus would be
needed by early in the next decade to prepare for the fiscal costs of aging.
Directors stressed the vital role of institutional reforms to improve public financial management
and transparency. In this context, they welcomed the authorities’ plans to bring fiscal accounts
in line with international best practices. Directors encouraged the authorities to adhere to the
spending ceilings under the medium-term fiscal framework when formulating annual budgets,
and to integrate extrabudgetary funds into the budget.
With inflation expected to rise against a backdrop of stronger demand but remain close to the
target of 3 percent, Directors considered that the cautious pace of monetary tightening pursued
by the CNB was appropriate. They noted that monetary policy would need to strike a careful
balance in the period ahead between the rising pressures on resources on the one hand, and
favorable influences on inflation such as the strength of the koruna and the supply-driven nature
of recent growth, on the other.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ plans to clarify their strategy for euro adoption. The
economy is already enjoying the gains of nominal convergence and the competitive position is
comfortable. Directors underlined, nevertheless, that euro adoption remains an important
opportunity for enhanced trade, investment and growth. Policy credibility on fiscal consolidation
and structural reforms is crucial not only during the transition to the euro but to maximize the
gains from adopting it.
Directors observed that the financial system is generally sound, but faces challenges. They
called for strengthening bank supervision to ensure that it remains proactive and forwardlooking, especially in view of the recent rapid credit expansion. They welcomed the integration
of supervisory functions for banking, insurance and securities under the CNB, which should
bring efficiency gains. The high foreign ownership of banks suggests that closer cooperation
with foreign supervisory authorities would be desirable.
Directors welcomed the recent legislative measures to speed up the bankruptcy resolution
process. The decision to phase out rent controls should help facilitate labor mobility. Directors
welcomed the greater scope for contractual employment afforded by the new labor code, but

4
noted the need for further reforms in the area of employment protection, with the objective of
increasing labor market flexibility.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
