STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 29, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Context: Paraguay remains one of the most dynamic economies in Latin America, with
growth projected around 4 percent in 2014–15. Macroeconomic fundamentals are
sound, and the government is pursuing an ambitious reform program to address
infrastructure bottlenecks and other long-standing structural weaknesses. However,
implementation capacity is limited, and the envisaged improvement in public services
will need to be integrated into a prudent medium-term fiscal plan.
Focus: The consultation focused on policies to consolidate macroeconomic stability,
contain financial sector risks, and support inclusive growth.
Key policy issues:


The recently adopted Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL) prescribes limits on government
spending and the deficit to safeguard Paraguay’s healthy public finances. It is
unfortunate that the approved 2015 budget exceeds these limits. Strict control over
current expenditure and a resolute fight against tax evasion would allow the
authorities to achieve compliance with the fiscal rules ex post and establish the FRL
as a reliable anchor. Over time, it will be important to generate sufficient additional
revenue to accommodate spending priorities and preserve some buffer for adverse
shocks. A stronger budget process is critically needed to underpin fiscal discipline.



Paraguay has made strides in implementing a credible inflation targeting regime. To
further improve its effectiveness, the central bank is rightly focused on refining its
liquidity management and FX intervention modalities.



Credit growth has slowed from recent peaks, but remains fairly rapid. Although
banks continue to report solid buffers, the authorities should continue to closely
monitor risks and consider targeted macroprudential tightening, especially in the
areas of consumer credit and foreign-currency lending. These efforts should be
underpinned by adoption of the revised central bank and banking laws, along with
long-due reforms of the regulatory framework in the cooperative sector.



Sustained improvements in public services, government efficiency, and the business
environment are needed to attract investment, boost productivity, and support
medium-term growth and poverty reduction, even more so in a less favorable
external environment.

Discussions took place in Asunción during December 1–12. The staff
team comprised A. Meier (head), A. Guerson, C. Perez, and X. Xu (all
WHD), M. Vargas (RES), and A. Santos (Resident Representative), with
research assistance from E. Tawfik and editorial support from J. MezaCuadra. Mr. Corvalan (OED) also participated in the meetings. The
team met with BCP President Carlos Fernández, Minister of Finance
Germán Rojas, Minister of Labor, Employment, and Social Security
Guillermo Sosa, Minister of Public Works and Communications Ramón
Jiménez, other senior officials, and representatives from Congress, the
private sector, think tanks, and the donor community. Minister of
Finance Germán Rojas stepped down from his post shortly after the
Article IV discussions, and was replaced in early January 2015 by
Santiago Peña, previously member of the Board of the BCP.

BACKDROP
1.
Paraguay’s economy combines sound
macroeconomic fundamentals with persistent
developmental challenges. Government debt stands at a
moderate 18 percent of GDP, inflation is well contained,
and international reserves are ample. Output growth
picked up significantly over the past decade, amid a
boom in agricultural commodity prices that boosted the
country’s soy, grains, and beef industries. Nonetheless,
Paraguay’s per capita income continues to lag well behind
regional comparators, reflecting deficient infrastructure,
poor educational outcomes, and a business environment
marked by weak law enforcement and high informality
(Figure 1). Inequality and poverty rates have come down
markedly in recent years, but remain elevated.
2.
The government is pursuing an ambitious
reform agenda to address some of these challenges.
Upon assuming office in August 2013, the
administration of President Cartes launched a series of
initiatives, including a Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL) and
a strategy for increasing infrastructure investment. The
authorities remain committed to creating a more
diversified, investor-friendly, and inclusive economy,
though weak institutional capacity has constrained
implementation in certain areas. The government has
also been facing resistance to some of its plans from
Congress, including during the 2015 budget round.
Country-wide municipal elections are scheduled for
November.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Activity has decelerated markedly from the record pace of 2013, but remains buoyant.
In 2013, Paraguay grew a record 14.2 percent, as the agricultural sector rebounded from the
previous year’s drought (Figure 2, Table 1). The economy entered a soft spot in early 2014 but has
since regained momentum, with GDP expanding 3.9 percent (yoy) over the first three quarters of the
year. A weather-related drop in electricity production1 was the main drag on growth, while

The production of two large hydroelectric plants, one operated jointly with Brazil (Itaipu), one with Argentina
(Yacyreta), accounts for 10 percent of Paraguay’s GDP, 17 percent of exports, and 12 percent of fiscal revenue.

agricultural output edged up and the remainder of the
economy expanded at a robust 6.4 percent (yoy).
Construction, manufacturing (notably the fast-growing
maquila industry), and services led the expansion, although
retail and re-export activities suffered from the abundance
of cheap contraband imports from Argentina and weak
growth in Brazil. High-frequency indicators for the fourth
quarter suggest continued dynamism, putting full-year
growth on course to slightly exceed 4 percent. Inflation
spiked in early 2014 on account of higher food and
regulated prices, but subsequently declined to end the year
at 4.2 percent, well within the +/- 2 percent corridor around
the authorities’ 5 percent target. Credit growth has slowed
from earlier peaks but remains in double digits.

4.
Macroeconomic policies have been tightened somewhat since late 2013. Following the
large 2012 stimulus under the previous government, the new administration started reining in
expenditure growth (Figure 3), containing the central government deficit at 2 percent of GDP in
2013. For 2014, tax revenue is estimated to have increased by a brisk 19 percent (yoy), linked to
better enforcement and new taxes. Due to a sharply accelerated execution of spending in the latter
part of the year2 and lower revenue from electricity royalties, the headline deficit eventually edged
up relative to 2013. Still, staff estimates a mildly contractionary fiscal impulse for the full year of
around ½ percent of GDP (Table 2a). Monetary policy has been on hold since the central bank (BCP)
raised the official policy rate by 125 basis points, to 6.75 percent, between December 2013 and
February 2014 (Figure 4). The guaraní strengthened in the first half of 2014, but later pared all of its
gains against the U.S. dollar, although it still appreciated almost 12 percent in real effective terms.

turn, suggest robust competitiveness. Overall, it is difficult to argue that Paraguay’s current account
signals a significant misalignment of the exchange rate—the small surplus estimated for 2014 is
projected to give way to moderate deficits over the period ahead, reflecting weaker terms of trade
and consistent with an economy in catch-up mode (Figure 5).

Meanwhile, reserve coverage is fully adequate. International reserves have risen further—
mostly reflecting a US$1 billion government bond issuance intended to finance future infrastructure
spending—and now somewhat exceed the IMF’s standard adequacy metric for floating exchange
rate regimes.3 However, reserve coverage does not appear excessive in light of Paraguay’s high
openness to trade, especially considering the vulnerability of its still-narrow export base to disease,
weather, and price shocks. High dollarization provides another rationale for relatively large buffers.4
That said, the cost of holding the current level of reserves (estimated at 1.1 percent of GDP p.a.)
argues against significant further accumulation—a view that was shared by the authorities.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
7.
Growth is projected to remain near 4 percent in 2015, amid broadly balanced risks.
Weak trading partner growth and lower export prices cloud the outlook, and agricultural production
is projected to rise only marginally above the high level of 2014. Meanwhile, positive impulses
should come from the expected rebound in electricity generation, the lower oil price, and the launch
of new infrastructure projects. Yet, uncertainty around the outlook is considerable (Risk Assessment
Matrix), as worsening terms of trade could affect domestic spending more than anticipated, while

3

Paraguay’s exchange rate regime was formally reclassified to floating in mid-2013. Under the previous classification
(“other managed arrangement”), the current level of reserves was closely aligned with the relevant adequacy metric.

further ruble depreciation might hurt exports to Russia.5 Exposures to global financial volatility are
limited by the lack of domestic capital markets, though shocks could conceivably be transmitted
through foreign banks operating in Paraguay (Box 1). On the upside, a recent hydrocarbon discovery
might foreshadow the beginning of oil production in Paraguay;6 and looser-than-expected fiscal
policy could lift 2015 growth above staff’s projection of 4 percent. Inflation is expected to hover
around the revised 4.5 percent target in 2015, as recent guaraní depreciation and a small positive
output gap balance the impact of lower commodity prices.7
8.
Looking further ahead, Paraguay’s growth prospects hinge on the successful
implementation of ongoing reforms. Like all of South America, Paraguay is confronting the end of
an extended period of extraordinarily benign external conditions. The more challenging external
environment underscores the importance of strengthening the domestic underpinnings of growth,
notably by addressing infrastructure bottlenecks and improving the business environment to attract
private investment. Under a scenario of measured, but steady implementation of the government’s
reform agenda, medium-term growth around 4 percent is realistic.8 However, failure to achieve the
sustained expansion of public and private investment projected by staff could reduce potential
growth by a full percentage point.

In 2013, total exports to Russia reached nearly US$950 million, the bulk of which accounted for by meat.

Given large technical and commercial uncertainties surrounding the discovery, potential hydrocarbon production is
not included in staff’s projections.

The BCP announced in mid-December 2014 that it had lowered its midpoint target to 4.5 percent for 2015/16.

8

This scenario would entail a gradual rise in public and private investment, though capacity constraints would
impose delays relative to the authorities’ ambitious plans for infrastructure spending; and modest additional steps to
improve the business environment.

banks and companies. High levels of
financial dollarization provide
another potential channel for transmitting external shocks, though Paraguay’s financial system has sizeable buffers to cope with
such shocks.

Recent spillovers from Argentina have mainly been transmitted
through surging contraband imports. Argentina’s export taxes and FX
market controls have created strong incentives for contraband trade.
Since mid-2012, contraband exports to Paraguay appear to have
proliferated, alongside the widening gap between the official and informal
market exchange rates of the peso. For the most part, the contraband
(especially foodstuffs and household goods) displaces legal imports, as
domestic production in Paraguay is limited. However, businesses involved
in the formal distribution and retail chain have been negatively affected,
while consumers have benefited from lower prices. Separately, there is
anecdotal evidence for Argentine capital flows into Paraguay’s property
market.

Developments in Brazil are of particular importance. As Paraguay’s
largest trading partner, Brazil accounts for 30 percent of registered
exports and the bulk of re-exports. Recently, Brazil’s weak growth and
currency depreciation has dampened demand for re-exports, contributing
to slower activity in Ciudad del Este, Paraguay’s main hub for cross-border
trading. However, there have also been positive spillovers, notably
through rising FDI inflows into Paraguay’s maquila industry, which attracts
Brazilian companies with its relatively low cost base and favorable tax and
regulatory regime. Overall, staff estimates suggest that a one percent
decline in Brazilian output reduces Paraguay’s output by 0.5 percent; a
10 percent real depreciation of the bilateral exchange rate is estimated to
have a similar effect.

The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment, but projected slightly faster
growth. For both 2015 and the medium term, the authorities reaffirmed their previous projection of
4.5 percent growth. They emphasized that the industrialization of the agricultural sector is still in the
early stages and holds significant potential for future expansion. Moreover, the build-out of public
infrastructure would proceed at a somewhat faster pace than projected by staff, catalyzing fresh
private investment and helping to keep growth close to the high rates observed over the past
decade. Although the authorities recognized the challenging external environment as a risk, they
argued that Paraguay was very well prepared to weather adverse external shocks, thanks to strong
macroeconomic fundamentals and the resulting room for maneuver in policies.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
10.
Discussions focused on policies to advance the structural reform agenda while
consolidating sound macroeconomic fundamentals and containing financial sector risks. Staff
endorsed the authorities’ plans to address Paraguay’s critical infrastructure needs and improve
public services, especially in transportation, electricity, and water and sanitation.1 Progress in these
areas can and should be achieved without jeopardizing the strong macroeconomic position that
Paraguay has attained. In that light, the mission discussed steps to further improve the
macroeconomic policy framework and buttress its credibility, notably by establishing the FRL as a
reliable fiscal anchor. To contain the risks from continued high credit growth, staff suggested close
monitoring of riskier lending segments and targeted macroprudential measures, along with a further
strengthening of the regulatory and supervisory framework.

A. Fiscal Policy: Anchoring Solid Public Finances
11.
The mission made the case for complying with the FRL. The law has become effective
with the 2015 budget, prescribing new rules for government spending and the deficit. While not
perfect2, these rules are commendably simple and suited to protect fiscal sustainability. Thus, the
mission stressed the importance of respecting the FRL, including the 1.5 percent of GDP deficit
targeted in the government’s budget submission. For 2015, this target implies a moderate fiscal
tightening—a stance that also appears justifiable from a cyclical perspective, especially given the
surge in government spending in late 2014.
Fiscal Responsibility Law: Numerical Constraints
Deficit ceiling

1. The deficit of the central government must not exceed 1.5 percent of GDP.
2. Congress can approve a deficit of up to 3 percent of GDP in cases of national
emergency; international crisis affecting the domestic economy; or negative growth.
3. The budgeted average deficit over three consecutive budget periods must not
exceed 1 percent of GDP. This rule only applies to the ex ante medium-term
budget plan, not to its execution.

In particular, the FRL lacks a back-up rule for public debt and fails to specify correction mechanisms. Being defined
in unadjusted, headline terms, the deficit ceiling might also reinforce procyclicality, unless fiscal policy observes a
margin of safety during normal times that obviates the need for discretionary tightening in a downturn. This
drawback needs to be weighed, however, against the greater simplicity and transparency of the current rule vis-à-vis
hypothetical alternatives defined in cyclically adjusted terms.

13.
The government committed to seek compliance with the original FRL targets but left
the door open to a moderately looser fiscal stance. Consistent with staff advice, the Finance
Ministry underscored its aim to restrain current expenditure execution and extend efforts to improve
tax enforcement. In principle, these efforts could make the original FRL targets achievable ex post.
However, the budget amendments made in Congress have further increased the burden of rigid
current expenditure, notably on wages. Higher public investment, in turn, is a stated priority, and
political pressure for swift progress may mount in the run up to the municipal elections. All things
considered, the authorities indicated that, while achieving an “unadjusted” deficit of 1.5 percent of
GDP was preferable, they were prepared to accept a moderate overrun as long as it was fully
accounted for by bond-financed investment. Staff projects a deficit around 2 percent of GDP,
slightly below the estimated outturn for 2014.3 This projection incorporates the full-year effect of
recent tax increases4 and assumes an execution rate of 64 percent on the authorities’ investment
budget, in line with historical trends.
14.
The mission expressed concern about the likely damage to the credibility of the FRL
and stressed the importance of strengthening budget practices. With public debt starting from a
moderate level, a deficit slightly above 1.5 percent of GDP would not raise any immediate concerns
for fiscal sustainability. Still, the mission noted that the circumvention of the fiscal rules, in the very
first year of their application, was unfortunate. The exemption of bond-financed capital spending
from the authorities’ deficit calculation could bias spending initiatives against financing sources that
impose tighter restrictions (such as loans from IADB and World Bank). More fundamentally, the
unresolved weakness of the budget process leaves in place a system where fiscal discipline hinges
on the close intra-year control of expenditure by the Finance Ministry. Although this strategy has
been effective in the past, it fails to provide the desired strong anchor for medium-term policy. The
government shared staff’s concern but, short of constitutional changes, saw little scope for hardwiring a better budget process, given the prerogative of Congress to write budget laws. Within its
own purview, the Finance Ministry signaled its intention to expeditiously transition toward the 2001
GFSM format for its fiscal accounts, using IMF technical assistance (TA).
15.
Regarding the medium-term path of policy, staff emphasized the need to maintain
prudent debt dynamics, including by ensuring a buffer against adverse shocks. Achieving a
sustained improvement in public services will require additional fiscal resources over the medium
term. Above and beyond the need to match spending goals with revenue, there is a case for
incorporating some safety margin in multi-year fiscal plans. Without such a margin, economic

3

All deficit numbers cited here refer to the authorities’ fiscal template for the central government, which follows the
1986 Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM). A mechanical translation into the 2001 GFSM template points to
a somewhat lower deficit, as financial investments and net lending (to state-owned enterprises) are recorded below
the line (Tables 2a and 2b). However, a full-fledged move to the 2001 GFSM would imply significant further changes
to the fiscal accounts whose net effect on the measured deficit is difficult to foresee. The reclassification of financial
investments and net lending also does not affect the fact that such transactions increase gross government debt.

These include the tax on personal rents and on rents from the export of grains, as well as the increase in the VAT
rate on net interest earned.

downturns could impose a painful trade-off between letting deficits widen beyond prudent limits,
and engineering a procyclical fiscal tightening. The FRL recognizes this point by prescribing that the
average projected deficit over a three-year horizon should remain 0.5 percent of GDP below the
hard deficit ceiling. Staff research suggests that a safety margin of this magnitude—or even a bit
wider—is indeed necessary to let automatic stabilizers operate freely during most downturns and
avert an upward trajectory in debt (see Selected Issues Papers). Targeting a central government
deficit on the order of

16.
There was agreement that improved tax collection remains a top priority. Recent
increases in revenue partly reflect successful steps to improve taxpayer compliance. Within the tax
administration, the creation of a large taxpayer office has underpinned this success, as has the highly
publicized detection of an extensive VAT fraud. Nonetheless, tax evasion remains widespread, amid
entrenched enforcement gaps. The authorities agreed that further efforts to improve compliance
were critical, especially in the customs administration. In staff’s view, such efforts would likely have
to be combined, over time, with some widening of the tax base or a rise in rates. Thus, the mission
suggested exploring higher taxation of the agricultural sector, whose contribution to revenue
remains modest. Overdue tariff increases for water and electricity would also generate resources for
upgrading public services, though any adverse impact on poor households would have to be
mitigated through targeted support. The authorities agreed in principle but for the time being
favored improvements in collecting existing taxes, especially since low nominal tax rates were a
strategic factor in sustaining Paraguay’s attractiveness to investors.6
17.
On the expenditure side, civil service reform is critical to trim Paraguay’s high
government wage bill and boost efficiency. The authorities acknowledged significant structural

Staff projections incorporate all previously announced measures to raise revenue, but assume no further
discretionary effort. Consequently, the implementation of staff recommendations represents upside potential.

18.
The mission also discussed fiscal risks related to ailing public companies, private sector
participation in infrastructure, and the public pension system:


Paraguay’s state-owned enterprises (SOEs) generate a small operating surplus but are
typically unable to cover their investment needs from regular revenue, reflecting low
efficiency and, in some cases, regulated tariffs below cost-recovery levels (Annex III). The
result has been a gradual erosion of their physical capital stock, worsening operational
performance. The mission recommended a thorough review of each entity, along with a
tailored strategy to address financial imbalances. In some cases, notably where SOEs
perform functions readily substitutable by private operators, divestment should be
considered. The authorities ruled out such far-reaching steps but underscored their
commitment to improve the operations of weak SOEs.



Infrastructure finance. The authorities have advanced their plans to use Public-Private
Partnerships (PPPs) and expect to launch the first two road expansion projects
(US$400 million) in 2015.8 Although the PPP Law provides a suitable framework, staff
reiterated the importance of ensuring transparent contracts and prudent assessments of
contingent risks as part of the budget process. In the same vein, the mission cautioned
against the risks associated with “deferred financing” schemes for public investment
under Law 5074/2013, which could obscure the true state of the public finances. More
broadly, sufficient institutional capacity for managing large projects will be crucial to

7

In addition to prescribing an overall limit on the growth of primary current expenditure (4 percent p.a. in real
terms), the FRL allows public salary increases only up to the legislated increase in the minimum wage, and subject to
the financial capacity of the state. The minimum wage, in turn, can only be adjusted when cumulative inflation since
the previous adjustment has reached 10 percent.
8

Moreover, several government-initiated PPP projects were at the stage of pre-feasibility studies, including the
upgrade of the Asuncion airport, expansion of two further roads, and the dredging of the Paraguay River, which
together account for a prospective project volume of nearly US$1 billion. Staff projections incorporate these projects,
albeit on somewhat less ambitious time schedules than envisaged by the authorities.

secure adequate economic returns. The authorities noted that they were successfully
developing such capacity, with assistance from international consultants. They also
agreed with the need to carefully manage fiscal risks but wanted to retain a range of
financing modalities.


Paraguay’s social security system comprises 8 defined-benefit pension funds serving
different professional groups. Although the aggregate system still generates an annual
cash surplus on the order of 1 percent of GDP, some of the weaker funds already require
budget support to cover their obligations. Moreover, the system lacks oversight and
exhibits significant actuarial imbalances that would give rise to large deficits over the
medium to long term. The mission welcomed the authorities’ resolve to tackle these
issues and, as a first step, encouraged swift progress toward creating a pension fund
regulator, as foreseen in draft legislation.

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy: Extending Recent Achievements
19.
Staff and the BCP agreed that monetary policy was well calibrated. Inflation eased back
into the lower part of the target range in mid-2014, while survey expectations were anchored at the
5 percent midpoint, suggesting a credible policy commitment. From a cyclical perspective, the
setting of a low, positive real policy rate, along with a somewhat restrictive fiscal impulse, seemed
appropriate. Thus, the mission endorsed the BCP’s stance and recommended that monetary policy
remain focused on keeping inflation close to the target. In this regard, the BCP announced in midDecember that it was lowering its midpoint target to 4.5 percent—closer to the 4.2 percent average
of actual inflation since end-2010. In staff’s view, this slightly lower target should be achievable
without a distinct policy effort. Consistent with this notion, BCP survey results from January
suggested that inflation expectations had already settled at the new target.
20.
The mission recommended several actions to further enhance the effectiveness of
Paraguay’s inflation targeting regime. The BCP has made strides since 2011 in establishing an
inflation targeting framework backed by very transparent communication. Against that background,
the mission focused on discussing steps to further improve the implementation of policies and
strengthen the monetary transmission mechanism:


Promote a well-functioning interbank market, which would facilitate the distribution of
liquidity. To this end, the mission recommended increasing the frequency of central bank
paper auctions, improving liquidity forecasting, and introducing an averaging scheme for
reserve requirements. Once an active money market is in place, the BCP would also be able to
establish its official policy rate as the true anchor and move away from the current floor
system, where the market rate is determined by the overnight deposit facility in which banks
place their excess liquidity.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

PARAGUAY





Further refine the conduct of BCP transactions in the
foreign exchange (FX) market. The BCP provides timely
data on both its pre-announced sales of government
dollar receipts and discretionary interventions. The latter
became relatively infrequent in 2014 and were focused
on mitigating bouts of guaraní depreciation. However,
there is scope for further regularizing the pre-announced
dollar sales, which were repeatedly adjusted in size (and
temporarily suspended) over the past year. A more rulesbased approach would clearly delink these transactions
from occasional discretionary intervention aimed at
curbing short-term volatility.
Facilitate gradual de-dollarization. Bank deposits
and loans in foreign currency account for nearly half
the total and have outpaced domestic-currency
aggregates over the past year, in the context of strong
export earnings in the agricultural sector. To enhance
the transmission of monetary policy and reduce
financial risks, the mission encouraged the authorities
to consider stronger prudential incentives for dedollarization, such as a rise in FX reserve requirements
(which remain well below comparable rates in other
partially dollarized economies).

Recapitalize the central bank to forestall any

might be compromised by concerns about its financial position.9

21.
The BCP noted that it was planning to take several concrete steps in line with these
recommendations. Specifically, the central bank intended to implement a series of measures
advised in a recent TA report, including the adoption of an averaging regime for reserve
requirements and a rule-based mechanism for its regular FX sales. In this context, the BCP
emphasized that excess liquidity in the banking system, as measured by the use of the overnight
deposit facility, had already declined to more reasonable levels. The BCP was not convinced that
dollarization posed a significant challenge to the effectiveness of monetary policy in keeping
inflation on target. Lastly, the authorities agreed with the case for fully recapitalizing the BCP, but
did not plan further steps as a near-term priority.
9

The BCP had negative equity of US$1.3 billion (4½ percent of GDP) at end-2013 and suffers an annual loss of about
½ percent of GDP at current interest rates, reflecting the costly sterilization of its FX reserves. The government
initiated the recapitalization process in 2012 by injecting perpetual bonds. However, these bonds currently carry a
very low (albeit negotiable) interest rate, significantly limiting their net present value.

C. Financial Sector Policy: Vigilance and Institutional Strengthening
22.
Banks continue to report strong capitalization,
profits, and liquidity. The financial strength of Paraguay’s
banking system compares favorably to its regional peers
(Figure 6). Relatively limited leverage, high returns on
assets, and a large deposit funding base characterize
essentially the entire cross-section of banks.

However, the continued rapid expansion of
credit raises concerns. Credit outstanding is in line with
other countries at a similar income level. Nonetheless, the
mission argued that continued high credit growth may
increase banks’ exposure to riskier borrowers. Credit gap
analysis suggests only moderate overall excesses, though
the underlying growth in FX-denominated credit is
understated by the appreciation of the guaraní over the past
decade. Meanwhile, nonperforming loans have remained
stable at 2 percent, but the mission cautioned that
additional credit quality problems might be masked by
regular sales of NPL portfolios to finance companies, as well
as the significant stock of renegotiated loans on bank
balance sheets.10

The mission recommended vigilance especially in
the areas of household credit and FX lending. The largest
exposures of Paraguay’s banks, and a significant share of
their U.S. dollar loans and deposits, relate to the agricultural
sector. Thanks to its financial buffers, this sector has
withstood recent weather-related shocks very well, though it
remains vulnerable to more extended periods of weak output
or further sharp price declines. Staff’s more immediate
concerns, however, focused on other areas:

A long-standing feature of the banking system, the high stock of such loans was also discussed in the 2011 FSAP
Update. Key recommendations included (i) improving the provisioning treatment of refinanced and restructured
loans; and (ii) ensuring that the renewed loans category not be used to conceal revolving or long-term loan facilities.
More generally, greater transparency on the nature of renegotiated loans is critical for a proper risk assessment.

loans.11 The use of multiple (and expensive) credit products has reportedly led to elevated
payroll deductions for many wage earners, raising concerns from a consumer protection
perspective. Growing financial pressures in the household sector could also come back to hurt
lenders at some point. As a preemptive measure, the mission therefore suggested that lenders
be formally required to demonstrate compliance with prudent limits on their customers’ debt
servicing capacity.


Lending in foreign currency has been another area of strong recent growth. Although the
relevant borrowers typically appear to have some FX revenue, the regulator only had access to
qualitative information provided by banks, precluding an accurate assessment of FX mismatches.
Outside of the export-oriented primary sector, it also appeared that some borrowers recorded
FX revenue from activities ultimately driven by domestic demand, such as corporate real estate.
The mission recommended stepping up the data collection on related balance sheet risks and
considering suitable macroprudential tightening measures, notably higher capital risk weights or
provisioning rates for FX loans. By supporting de-dollarization and reinforcing buffers, such
measures would help to contain any fallout from rising U.S. interest rates or a stronger dollar
over the period ahead.



Corporate real estate. Close monitoring seemed warranted, as rapid recent construction and
fast-rising prices may have squeezed the profitability of new projects. Direct risks to financial
stability were attenuated, however, by reports that funding was typically tilted toward equity
provided by foreign investors, rather than domestic credit.

25.
The mission also discussed ways to refine the regulator’s stress-testing framework. The
BCP’s latest Financial Stability Report presents stress tests analyzing, inter alia, an across-the-board
rise in NPLs by 10 percent and sector-specific NPL increases of 30 percent. Even under combined
stress scenarios, the regulator judged risks of financial instability to be minimal. The mission
welcomed the inclusion of these results in the FSR but suggested that the tests be developed further
to consider more severe shocks and anchor simulations in more detailed macro-financial scenarios.
26.
The authorities agreed with the need for close monitoring of credit markets but
expressed confidence that risks to financial stability were well contained. They argued that
consumer credit had already slowed from the very rapid growth of recent years and was unlikely to
pose risks to banking sector health, given strong margins and generally sound underwriting
practices. They also pointed out that the Credit Bureau Law currently under preparation would
facilitate banks’ efforts to achieve a more comprehensive assessment of potential customers,
reducing credit risk. On NPL portfolio sales and FX lending, they were open to staff
recommendations for improved monitoring, but reiterated that the banking system was
11

Interest rates in the high double digits are common for these lending products. Banks’ consumer loan portfolio
alone has quadrupled since 2009 and exceeded 7 percent of GDP at end-2014. Cooperatives’ portfolio of personal
and consumer loans stood at an estimated 5 percent of GDP, and finance companies accounted for an additional
1 percent of GDP. Data on the stock of commercial installment credit are unavailable.

fundamentally sound and resilient, including to spillovers from U.S. monetary policy. Accordingly,
they saw no immediate need for mandating stricter lending standards. They noted, however, that
the rules for the classification of renegotiated loans had been tightened and were progressively
being enforced. A complete review of banks’ compliance was envisaged by early 2015. The BCP also
expressed interest in receiving TA on stress-testing.

modalities exist: extending the due date without any debtor payment, but continuing to count pastdue days based on the original loan schedule; or paying accrued interest and other charges (with the
debtor’s own resources), and thus interrupting the original past-due period.
Refinanced loans

Loans that are past due by more than 60 days where the debtor pays, out of her own resources, all

0.6

past due interest and other charges, as well as a portion of the past due principal. Only when at least
10 percent of the principal and all past due interest and charges are paid, the loan can be moved to a
better risk category.
Restructured loans

Loans whose terms are partially or totally modified (e.g., longer tenor, lower interest rate, lower

1.1

installments) to provide relief before the debtor falls behind on payments.

There was agreement that proactive prudential oversight would be greatly facilitated
by the approval of the new banking and central bank laws. The BCP’s regulatory powers are
tightly circumscribed by an outdated legal framework. The new draft laws aim to expand the
regulator’s authority and create a transparent basis for risk-based oversight. Thus, the mission
welcomed the government’s intention to submit the laws to Congress in March 2015. To allow an
effective use of these powers, the mission also recommended reinforcing the resources of the
superintendence.
28.
The mission reiterated the case for long-due reforms in the cooperative sector, which
accounts for one-fifth of total financial sector assets and serves many small savers, but is subject to
a prudential regime with serious shortcomings flagged during the FSAP. Elevated NPL ratios
(7.9 percent among the largest institutions at end-September 2014) and the opacity of cooperatives’
accounts underscore the contingent risks that the sector poses to Paraguay’s public finances. The
regulator (INCOOP) noted its intention to set up a liquidity support scheme and deposit insurance
fund headed by a board with greater independence. Staff welcomed the objective of creating a
financial safety net but reaffirmed the view that such steps should be preceded by a substantial
upgrading of the current regulatory and supervisory framework. The mission also welcomed
INCOOP’s intention to work toward creating a system-wide creditor database with the BCP.

D. Structural Reforms for Economic Development and Inclusive Growth
29.
The mission discussed specific structural reforms that would support the government’s
drive to boost medium-term potential growth and alleviate poverty. There was agreement that
improvements in public infrastructure were a critical priority. Supplementary efforts to promote
higher investment, job creation, and better livelihoods could focus on the following areas:


Poverty relief and education. The mission welcomed the government’s plan to expand the
Tekopora conditional cash transfer program to 130,000 households (from currently 100,000).
Notwithstanding Tekopora, the government’s strategy for alleviating poverty remains centered
on fostering higher market incomes, for which improved educational attainment will be crucial.
The authorities noted that they are pursuing several measures in this area, from wider
availability of preschool places to scholarships for study abroad. To measure the success of
these efforts, Paraguay has joined the OECD’s PISA program for the 2015 round.



Improving the business environment, notably by strengthening the rule of law and reducing
corruption. In this context, the mission welcomed the recently adopted freedom-ofinformation law, which can provide a powerful tool to raise government transparency,12 and
the authorities’ commitment to implement an action plan on anti-money laundering and
combating the financing of terrorism. Separately, they noted their intention to gradually ease
onerous licensing and registration requirements, which are viewed as a significant contributor
to economic informality (see Selected Issues Papers).



Financial inclusion. The government’s strategy emphasizes financial education and wider
access to basic financial services for households and SMEs. The mission supported the thrust
of this initiative and welcomed the authorities’ position that financial inclusion should not be
misconstrued as an easing of credit requirements, which could in fact prove counterproductive
(see Selected Issues Papers).

30.
In light of a recent oil discovery, staff offered support in developing a suitable
framework for managing Paraguay’s natural resource wealth. A private UK company recently
reported the discovery of a hydrocarbon resource in the Chaco. Under favorable conditions, the
company saw scope for starting production as early as 2015, though significant uncertainty
remained over the technical and commercial challenges involved. The authorities were in the early
stages of preparing for such an outcome and had sought World Bank advice. The mission stressed
the IMF’s readiness to provide supplementary TA as needed. A prudent policy framework would
need to delink government spending from the volatility of hydrocarbon revenue and channel a large
share of the revenue to savings and high-quality domestic investment.13

STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
The government has started to tackle some of the long-standing structural weaknesses
holding back development. Tax collection has improved significantly, creating space for higher
public investment; preparations are underway to launch several large infrastructure projects; and the
recently adopted “freedom-of-information” law will foster government transparency. These efforts
are commendable, and should be extended to achieve lasting improvements in public services,
institutional quality, and the rule of law. Such improvements, in turn, are critical to attract
investment, boost productivity, and underpin medium-term growth and poverty reduction.
32.
Paraguay’s macroeconomic fundamentals remain sound, though the 2015 budget has
dimmed hopes that the FRL would provide a firm institutional anchor for fiscal prudence.
Paraguay boasts moderate public debt, low inflation, and strong external balances. To consolidate
macroeconomic stability, the authorities have adopted new policy frameworks in recent years,
notably an inflation targeting regime and the FRL. These frameworks provide appropriate anchors
for policy. It is thus unfortunate that the approved 2015 budget envisages spending and a deficit
above the mandated limits. With due restraint in the execution of the budget and continued efforts
to improve tax enforcement, it remains possible to achieve the original FRL targets and thereby
bolster the credibility of the fiscal rules. Over time, a stronger budget process will be essential to
support fiscal discipline.
33.
More broadly, it will be crucial to integrate the planned improvement of public
services into a prudent fiscal plan for the medium term. The authorities’ reform strategy holds
great promise, but should not come at the expense of weakening Paraguay’s solid macroeconomic
position. This puts a premium on generating sufficient revenue to accommodate spending plans and
preserve favorable debt dynamics. To ensure public support, it is important that additional revenue
effectively translates into better public services. Civil service reform would assist this endeavor, by
rationalizing public employment and raising efficiency. A prudent medium-term fiscal plan should
also incorporate some buffer against adverse shocks, given the high volatility of Paraguay’s
economic environment.
34.
In the same vein, it will be important to contain fiscal risks related to infrastructure
projects, SOEs, and public pension funds. Private sector participation in infrastructure is welcome
but must be managed carefully to contain risks to the public finances. Particular caution is warranted
with respect to deferred financing schemes that could create government liabilities without the
scrutiny of the regular budget process. Fiscal risks could also arise from the missing oversight of
Paraguay’s pension funds and their actuarial imbalances. It is encouraging that the authorities plan
to address these risks proactively, starting with the planned creation of a regulator. Similar resolve is
required to address the financial and operational challenges in the SOE sector.
35.
Monetary policy is currently well calibrated, and efforts should focus on further
enhancing the effectiveness of the inflation targeting regime. To strengthen the transmission of
monetary policy, it will be instrumental to develop a more active money market and encourage
gradual de-dollarization. Meanwhile, the central bank’s plan to make its sales of government

foreign-currency receipts more predictable will help to distinguish these transactions clearly from
occasional discretionary intervention within the flexible exchange rate regime.
36.
In light of continued strong credit growth, the authorities should closely monitor
potential risks and consider targeted macroprudential tightening. Paraguay’s banking system
remains sound, but the long-running credit expansion calls for vigilance. To contain the risks from
rising consumer indebtedness, lenders should be formally required to observe prudent limits on
households’ debt servicing capacity. Other areas for stepped-up oversight include foreign-currency
lending; and the proper recognition of credit risk in renegotiated loans. In this context, the proposed
revision of the central bank and banking laws is essential to put risk-based regulation and
supervision on a robust legal basis. Another priority is to strengthen the governance, resources, and
enforcement powers of INCOOP.
37.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12month cycle.

Annex I. Implementation of Past Fund Policy Advice
The authorities have taken on board several of the policy recommendations from the 2013 Article IV
consultation, though in some areas the implementation of specific measures is still at an early stage.


Directors commended the adoption of the FRL and endorsed it as a suitable anchor for fiscal
sustainability. They also called on the authorities to improve the quality of government
spending, strengthen tax and customs administration, and enhance the capacity to deal with
potential risks from public-private partnerships. Civil service and pension reforms were stressed
as additional priorities. The 2015 budget process did not respect all the fiscal rules laid down in
the FRL, though the authorities have expressed their commitment to seek compliance during the
implementation of the budget. Progress has been made in upgrading the capacity of the tax
administration, and revenue collection has improved significantly, though further efforts to rein in
tax evasion are needed. The government’s capacity to implement infrastructure projects has grown,
and work is underway to strengthen it further, with assistance from international consultants. A
comprehensive reform of the civil service and the pension system remain important priorities.



On monetary and exchange rate policy, Directors highlighted the need to develop an active
interbank money market, maintain exchange rate flexibility, and step up efforts to reduce
dollarization. They also called for steps to address the remaining deficiencies in Paraguay’s antimoney laundering regime. The central bank has limited discretionary FX market intervention and
allowed significant exchange rate movements over the course of the past year, with a trough-topeak span of almost 13 percent in the bilateral U.S. dollar/guaraní rate during 2014. Based on
recent TA advice, the central bank is also planning to improve further the functioning of the money
market, including by adopting an averaging scheme for reserve requirements.



On financial sector policy, Directors recommended strengthening risk-based supervision,
including through the adoption of new financial sector legislation. Draft versions of the new
central bank and banking laws, which are critical to strengthening risk-based financial sector
oversight, have been completed and are due to be submitted to Congress in early 2015.

The authorities have also maintained their commitment to transparency in the discussions with staff,
by consenting to the publication of the mission’s concluding statement and arranging a press
conference that typically generates comprehensive media coverage of the mission’s main findings
and policy recommendations.

Annex II. External Stability Assessment

1

1.
Paraguay’s current account is estimated to post a small surplus in 2014, before
switching into a moderate deficit from 2015 onward. Lower world market prices for agricultural
products are set to weigh on export proceeds over the period ahead, although this effect will be
partly offset by continued volume growth, greater industrialization of agricultural exports, and more
favorable price trends for meat, another key export. The significantly lower cost of fuel imports will
also help to curtail the deterioration of the trade balance, even as other imports continue to grow, in
the context of rising public and private investment. The financial account, in turn, is projected to stay
in surplus, reflecting financing for the government and direct investment. Consequently, Paraguay’s
international reserves are expected to stabilize around their end-2014 level, which reflected the
impact of a US$1 billion government bond issuance with a 30-year maturity.

informal market exchange rate of the peso and private sector estimates of Argentine CPI inflation,
instead of official data. The guaraní’s appreciation has occurred against a backdrop of generally
favorable terms of trade developments, especially from commodity prices, strong productivity and
output growth, and improved macroeconomic fundamentals. More than three-quarters of the
cumulative change are accounted for by nominal appreciation, despite significant reserve
accumulation over the same period. Over the course of 2014, the REER rose by almost 12 percent,
reflecting the relative strength of the guaraní vis-à-vis other Latin American currencies, even as the
bilateral guaraní-U.S. dollar exchange rate remained basically unchanged on balance.

Model-based estimates paint a mixed picture of exchange rate valuation. The EBA-lite
model points to significant undervaluation of the guaraní, as Paraguay’s estimated 2014
current account balance (0.1 percent of GDP) was significantly stronger than the estimated
norm (-4.4 percent of GDP).

cumulative rise in prices over the period. Still, Paraguay has maintained and slightly
increased its share of global export markets even at constant 2005 U.S. dollar prices. A closer
analysis of the trade balance confirms that the 2013 trade surplus would not be much
smaller if registered exports and imports were valued at constant 2005 U.S. dollar prices, as
the effect of lower average export prices would be offset by the lower cost of imports.

Other indicators of competitiveness also suggest that Paraguay’s four main export sectors
(hydroelectric power, soy, cereals, and beef) have remained competitive. While the country’s
weak infrastructure complicates the transport of exported goods, efficient, large-scale
production has allowed Paraguay to become the fourth-largest exporter of soy and sixlargest exporter of beef in the world. Meanwhile, domestic and foreign investment in these
sectors has promoted a progressive industrialization that allows Paraguay to reap a higher
value-added from some of its export commodities. Even beyond its traditional economic

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PARAGUAY

base, Paraguay has recently seen a successful development of the maquila industry, which
processes manufactured goods for exports mostly to Brazil. The maquila sector benefits
from cost, tax, and regulatory advantages vis-à-vis Paraguay’s large neighbor and is growing
at high double-digit rates. Under staff’s baseline projections, which include tight
government control over the wage bill (in line with the FRL) and improvements in
infrastructure and the business environment, competitiveness is likely to remain robust. That
said, some business areas, notably the trading and re-export sectors, have recently been
affected by weak demand and depreciating local currencies in Brazil and Argentina.


Intervention behavior. Paraguay’s central bank, as the agent for the government, receives a
steady inflow of dollar proceeds from the royalties paid by the binational power companies.
The BCP maintains a program of dollar sale

of Paraguay's exchange rate regime to "floating".
International reserves are high and, following
the recent reclassification of the exchange rate regime as “floating”, somewhat exceed the
standard adequacy metric. Reserves do not appear excessive, however, in relation to
Paraguay’s high economic openness, at six months of imports, especially when considering
the significant volatility of the country’s export industries and their exposure to disease,
weather, and price shocks. Another important rationale for holding sizeable international
reserves is the dollarization of the domestic financial system—around half of loans and
deposits are denominated in U.S. dollar—which calls for high precautionary balances to
reduce the risk of a destabilizing run on the banking system’s foreign-currency debt. As of
end-November, international reserves covered about 130 percent of banks’ foreign-currency
deposits, and banks FX reserve requirements accounted for one-sixth of the BCP’s total FX
reserves.

5.
Taking all these considerations into account, there is no compelling evidence to
suggest that the guaraní is either over- or undervalued. Although a moderate deviation in either
direction cannot be ruled out, staff’s best judgment is that the exchange rate is broadly in line with
fundamentals at present.

Annex III. Challenges in the State-Owned Enterprise (SOE) Sector
Paraguay’s SOE sector includes 9 entities performing a
wide range of activities, from public utilities to transport
infrastructure (airport, ports, and railroad) and commercial
activities, including fuel import and distribution,
telecommunications, and the production of alcoholic
beverages and cement.

Many SOEs are facing financial sustainability problems,
linked with underinvestment and operational
inefficiencies. The sector has posted a modest operational

problems have several causes:

1.

Government-controlled prices. One example is ANDE, whose electricity tariffs have remained

unchanged for the past 11 years. Similarly, the price of water and sanitation services is below regional
averages and has not been adjusted for several years. The state-owned oil company Petropar has also
suffered losses due to implicit subsidies for domestic users of diesel and producers of biofuel.

2.

Weak payment collection. For instance, some 8 percent of electricity consumption represents

illegal connections to the grid. Other ANDE customers have accumulated unpaid bills—this includes the
central government, which owed some US$100 million at end-2014.

3.

Operational inefficiencies. One quarter of electricity is lost during transmission and distribution.

The water and sanitation network requires recurrent high-cost repair work as a result of poor
maintenance. Overstaffing, poor management practices, and corruption heighten the financial burden in
many companies. The operational underperformance of SOEs is clearly apparent in sectors open to
private competition, such as cement and telecommunications.

4.

Transfer of SOE cash flow to the central government. Mandated contributions to the budget

have reduced the availability of funds for the companies’ reinvestment needs.
The authorities plan to restore financial sustainability in the sector, while expanding the quality
and quantity of services. Their strategy includes specific efficiency and financial objectives for each
company; the settlement of state debt by way of a payment program; and restrictions on expanding
employment. The government has also been tightening controls on the use of transferred resources for
investment. Investment plans in the sector are ambitious, especially in the public utilities. However, the
government has pledged to avoid privatization.

Source: Fund staff estimates and projections.
1/ Public sector is defined as consolidated public sector. It includes the non-financial public sector and the central bank. The stock of public debt excludes central bank bills.
2/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
3/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
4/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 3 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
5/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 3 as ae(1+r).
6/ Includes social security surplus, accumulation of deposits from the sovereign bond issuance in 2014, and financing of the national development bank.
7/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, it includes the impacts of exchange rate changes.
8/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation
(based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period. Interest payments exclude binational companies.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

Exchange Arrangement: The currency of Paraguay is the Paraguayan guaraní. The exchange
arrangement of the guaraní is floating, and the exchange rate is determined by supply and demand.
The objective of the Central Bank of Paraguay (BCP) under Article 3 of Organic Law No. 489/95 is to
preserve and safeguard the stability of the currency and promote the efficiency and stability of the
financial system. Article 50 establishes that foreign currency trading by the BCP aims to smooth
seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand and offset erratic capital flows and speculative
movements that could disrupt the market or the exchange rate. Article 47 establishes that the
exchange rate is determined by market forces. The BCP publishes information on its foreign
exchange interventions on its website. The BCP intervenes occasionally in the market to smooth the
2

PARAGUAY

effects of undue fluctuation. The BCP, as the government’s financial agent, receives U.S. dollars from
the government flowing from the royalties and compensation paid by the binational hydroelectric
entities and exchanges them for guaranís at the request of the government for the purpose of public
expenditures. The BCP implemented, effective July 1, 2013, a program of preannounced sales of the
U.S. dollars it purchases from the government. The new program is more transparent, better
communicated, and more consistent with an inflation-targeting regime. This program indicates in
advance the nature, frequency, and size of the BCP’s foreign exchange transactions to avoid
influencing market expectations of the exchange rate. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate
arrangement was reclassified to floating from other managed arrangement, effective July 1, 2013.
Paraguay has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of
Agreement. Its exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions.
Article IV Consultation: The Executive Board concluded the 2013 Article IV consultation in February
2014.

Safeguards Assessment: Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the BCP was subject to a
full safeguard assessment in respect to the arrangement approved on May 31, 2006. A safeguards
assessment of the BCP was completed in October 2006. The report stated that while the BCP has
made some progress in strengthening the safeguards framework since the 2003 safeguards
assessment, vulnerabilities remain in certain areas such as financial reporting and program data
reporting to the Fund.
Resident Representative: Mr. Alejandro Santos has been the regional resident representative since
December 2014. He is based in Lima, Peru.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK UNDER JMAP
Meeting of teams. The IMF and World Bank Paraguay teams met in November 2014 to exchange
views on economic developments in Paraguay, and discuss ongoing work and work plans for the
year ahead. The IMF mission also met with the World Bank’s representative in Asuncion. This section
summarizes key themes of the discussions.
The Board of the World Bank discussed the new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for
Paraguay in December 2014. The CPS covers Fiscal Years 2015–18, is closely aligned with the
authorities’ first National Development Plan (NDP, 2014–30) and aims to contribute to the NDP’s
overall poverty and equity targets. To this end, the CPS specifies three results areas: (i) strengthening
resilience to risks and volatility; (ii) boosting pro-poor delivery of public goods and services; and (iii)
fostering market integration. The overall World Bank Group financial support is expected to be in the
range of US$900 million to US$1,100 million during the CPS period.
The overriding challenge for Paraguay is to address long-standing structural weaknesses while
consolidating sound macroeconomic fundamentals. Paraguay enjoyed strong growth over the
period 2003–13 and achieved significant progress in poverty reduction. Nonetheless, income per
capita continues to lag well behind regional peers, reflecting persistent developmental obstacles,
including limited public sector capacity, poor service delivery, and deep-rooted governance
problems. The challenge ahead is to overcome these obstacles and advance the structural
transformation of Paraguay’s economy, without jeopardizing the sound macroeconomic position
attained over the past decade. In this context, it will also be important to improve the economy’s
resilience to risks in order to preserve and build on the gains in poverty reduction and shared
prosperity of the last few years.
In this context, the following reform areas have been identified as critical:

Fiscal framework. The FRL provides a suitable anchor for fiscal sustainability. Improvements in
the budget process are critical to underpin the new fiscal framework provided by the FRL. Potential
fiscal risks, including from the public pension fund system and from private sector participation in
infrastructure investment, need to be addressed proactively.

Tax policy and revenue administration. Continued improvement in tax enforcement is
necessary to increase low revenues while enhancing the progressivity of the tax system. This includes
further improving tax and customs administration, reducing exemptions, and exploring the
possibility of raising the tax contribution of the primary sector.

Public services. Improvements in public infrastructure (including transport, electricity, and
water and sanitation) are crucial to support economic development and improve livelihoods.
Boosting the pro-poor delivery of public goods and services, including in education and health, will
contribute to poverty reduction and shared prosperity. Advances in these areas will need to be
underpinned by improved government efficiency.


Financial system. The proposed reform of the banking and central bank laws is needed to
provide a robust legal basis for risk-based regulation and supervision. There is also a need to
significantly strengthen the prudential oversight of the cooperative sector and, on that basis,
establish a safety net for the sector.
The division of labor between the teams would be along the following lines:

Tax policy and revenue administration. The Fund will continue providing technical assistance
(TA) to support the authorities’ efforts to improve the tax system and increase revenue collection.
The Bank will continue to provide TA to support the authorities’ efforts to strengthen the tax
administration (core business areas including the legal function) by modernizing the tax
administration and increasing its effectiveness. In addition, the Bank will continue to analyze the
distributional impacts of fiscal policies to support the authorities’ efforts to improve the progressivity
of the tax and transfer system.

Financial system. The Fund will continue to provide TA on the implementation of risk-based
bank supervision and stands ready to support the authorities’ efforts to develop further their stresstesting toolkit.

Money laundering. The Fund will continue to provide TA on the calibration of a risk
assessment tool for banks and other financial institutions to prevent money laundering and terrorism
financing (ML/TF).

Medium-term debt management. The Bank, with the Fund’s support, will continue providing
technical assistance to develop a medium-term debt strategy so as to reduce domestic debt
servicing costs and promote the development of a domestic government debt market.

State-owned enterprises. The Bank will continue providing TA to support the government’s
efforts to improve corporate governance, eliminate payment arrears, and strengthen technical
oversight of SOEs.

Poverty. The Bank will provide TA on improving the measurement of poverty and income
inequality, with emphasis on understanding why Paraguay’s inequality is so high. Gender issues will
also be considered. It will also provide TA on improving the monitoring and evaluation system of the
National Development Plan and on the targeting of social programs, as well as study the impacts of
food price fluctuations on poverty and potential policies to manage negative effects.

Education and social programs. The Bank will provide technical assistance on education
programs, social assistance, and rural and agricultural development.

Pensions. The Bank will continue providing advisory services to improve the pension system,
including with best practices.


Public expenditure and revenues. The Bank will continue to provide TA on public expenditure
and budget processes, including fiscal rules, fiscal policy in volatile environments, efficiency of public
expenditure, tax revenues, fiscal policy and equity, and commodity prices and fiscal policy.

The Bank and IFC will also jointly provide advice to the government on two potential areas
for PPPs.

Mitigation of agricultural volatility. The Bank will provide advisory services to manage risks
stemming from volatility at the macroeconomic, sector, and microeconomic levels.

Paraguay Job Diagnostic: The Bank will undertake a comprehensive multi-sector job
diagnostic analysis to identify challenges for expanding job opportunities in Paraguay.

RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK
The IMF and IADB Paraguay teams met in November 2014 to exchange views on economic
developments in Paraguay, and discuss ongoing work and work plans for the year ahead. The IMF
mission also met with IADB staff based in Asuncion.
The IADB’s Board of Executive Directors approved in 2014 the Country Strategy with Paraguay
(2014–2018). Sovereign-guaranteed lending under the program is expected to reach approximately
US$1 billion.
Under the Strategy, the national authorities and the Bank identified the following priority
sectors in which the IDB Group would focus both its financial and non-financial products and
services: (i) transportation and connectivity; (ii) water and sanitation; (iii) energy; (iv) productive
development; (v) financial sector; and (vi) public management. Furthermore, the Bank will support the
social sector through two channels: (i) with specific interventions in each of the priority sectors, in
support of the objective of reducing extreme poverty; and (ii) through a crosscutting element in the
form of interventions to support the investment of FONACIDE resources, primarily targeting
education and health.
As of November 30, 2014, the Bank’s portfolio in Paraguay included loans for the financing of
24 projects. The lending portfolio amounts to US$857 million, of which US$477 million are pending
disbursement. Disbursements in 2014 are expected to total US$81 million. The current portfolio
includes lending to support the Government in the following sectors: transportation (51 percent),
energy (14 percent), social sector (11 percent), financial sector (7 percent), and agriculture
(5 percent). The portfolio additionally includes 12 loans to the private sector for US$200million
mostly in agriculture and the financial sector.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of December 2014)

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision to the Fund has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for
surveillance. Paraguay has made significant improvements in the compilation and dissemination of
macroeconomic statistics, but some shortcomings persist. In February 2014, a Data ROSC mission
conducted an assessment of data quality based on the new 2012 DQAF for six datasets (national
accounts, CPI, PPI, GFS, monetary, and balance of payments and IIP statistics). The mission also
assessed Paraguay’s macroeconomic statistics against the GDDS and, at the request of the
authorities, against the SDDS; the authorities’ response to the report and the mission’s
recommendations were published on the Fund’s website on August 18, 2014. The country is a GDDS
participant.
National Accounts. National accounts estimates, broadly consistent with the guidelines of the
1993 SNA, were released in 2005. A program for changing the outdated base year (1994=100) and
implementing relevant 2008 SNA recommendations is under development. The production boundary
is broadly in line with the 1993 SNA and recently included the two binational hydroelectric
enterprises following the 2008 SNA. Nonetheless, there are no independent estimates of the
nonobserved economy after 1997, and mineral exploration and own-account production are mostly
excluded. Source data for nonfinancial services, household consumption, and changes in inventories
are insufficient. Currently, the major deviations from concepts and definitions established in the
1993 SNA involve: investment in in-house development of software; investment in mineral
exploration; investment in military expenses in fixed assets; the estimation of output broken down by
market, nonmarket, and own final use components; the inclusion of work-in-progress in forestry and
livestock production; and the partial inclusion of the nonobserved economy in the national accounts.
Annual GDP meets GDDS recommendations, and QNA meets DSSD timeliness requirements
(90 days). Several STA missions on the compilation of quarterly national accounts (QNA) were fielded
in August 2007, August 2008, November 2009, and March–April 2011. QNA series were published in
December 2010. The STA mission of March–April 2011 assisted the authorities in outlining a work
program for updating the national accounts’ base year.
Labor market. Since the introduction of a regular household survey in 1998, the coverage and
quality of employment and unemployment statistics have improved significantly. Since 2010, data
are released on a quarterly basis, although the latter covers the Asuncion area only. The last available
observation for the quarterly series is the third quarter of 2014, whereas the annual data for
2013 were released in June 2014.
Price statistics. Both the consumer (CPI) and producer price indices (PPI) are reported on a regular
and timely basis. Since January 2008, the Central Bank of Paraguay (BCP) has been using a new CPI
index based on the 2005–06 household budget survey. The geographic coverage of the CPI is limited

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PARAGUAY

to Greater Asunción (the capital and metropolitan area), and expenditure weights are representative
of the consumption patterns of urban households. The PPI has a base weight period of June 2010
and its basket (185 items) is representative of current national output; electricity, water, and gas are
not covered.
The data ROSC mission found that the resources are insufficient for real sector statistics and
constrain further development, particularly the full adoption of the 1993 SNA. The authorities
have been trying to address these resource shortcomings in the context of the recent compilation of
a new CPI and the production of QNA series. A new ROSC mission took place in February 2014.
Government finance statistics. The Government finance statistics (GFS) used for internal purposes
and for reporting to WHD is broadly consistent with the recommendations of the Manual on
Government Finance Statistics 1986 (GFSM 1986). There was a GFS TA mission to the country in July
2014 that assisted the authorities in the process of adopting the GFSM 2014 methodology. Monthly
data are available for the central administration (budgetary central government). The asset position
of the social security system is available on a daily basis. Statistics on the central administration
include data of the Postal Service Directorate (a nonfinancial public corporation) and the statistics of
the nonfinancial public sector include data of financial public corporations—four employer social
insurance schemes. These social insurance schemes are treated as financial corporations in the
monetary and financial accounts. Data on medium- and long-term external debt are reliable and
available on a monthly basis. Domestic debt data are available on request, but need to be fully
integrated with the external debt database. Deficiencies remain in recording short-term supplier and
commercial credit of the public sector. Moreover, there is a discrepancy in the fiscal data reported by
the monetary and fiscal authorities. Measures are being taken to make reporting more transparent
The latest available data for general government and its subsectors in the 2013 GFS Yearbook are for
2012. However, since 1994 no outstanding debt data and no breakdowns for expenditure by function
have been provided for publication in the GFS Yearbook. Monthly and quarterly data are not
reported for publication in IFS.
Balance of payments. The classification of the balance of payments and the international
investment position (IIP) follows the recommendations of the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments
Manual (BPM5). Quarterly data on balance of payments and the IIP are available from 2001 onwards,
and are reported only once a year to STA for publication in the IFS. Improvements have been made
in the quality of the external sector statistics, especially in the coverage of foreign direct investment
and in the recording of external debt transactions but some deficiencies remain.
An STA mission on External Sector Statistics assisted the BCP in September 2014 in implementing
recommendations of the ROSC mission. In particular, the mission focused on: (1) assisting the Central
Bank of Paraguay in the migration to the methodology of the sixth edition of the Balance of
Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6); (2) reviewing and updating the
adjustments in the estimation of data on foreign trade; (3) assisting in improving the coverage of

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

PARAGUAY

direct investment data; and (4) reviewing and preparing a data template for reporting data on
international reserves and foreign currency liquidity.
Monetary and financial statistics. Paraguay reports monetary data for the central bank and other
depository corporations (ODCs) using the standardized report forms (SRFs). An integrated monetary
database meeting the data needs of the BCP, STA, and WHD is in operation Coverage of the ODC
survey is complete, including data on credit cooperatives, which account for around 20 percent of
deposits and loans of the system. The Superintendence of Banks reports 11 of the 12 core and 7 of
the 13 encouraged financial soundness indicators for deposit takers to STA on a monthly basis.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Paraguay
On February 12, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with Paraguay, and considered and endorsed the staff
appraisal without a meeting.2
Economic activity in Paraguay has slowed from the record-high growth in 2013, but remains
buoyant. Construction, manufacturing, and services led the expansion in 2014, whereas
electricity production declined, and re-exports suffered from weak growth in Brazil. Fullyear growth is estimated to have slightly exceeded 4 percent. Inflation spiked in early 2014
on account of higher food and regulated prices, but subsequently eased, ending the year at
4.2 percent, slightly below the authorities’ midpoint target. Credit growth has moderated
from earlier peak rates but still hovers around 20 percent, while banks continue to report
strong capitalization and profitability.
Macroeconomic policies have been tightened somewhat since late 2013. Tax revenue grew at
a brisk pace in 2014, linked to better enforcement and new taxes. Due to lower revenue from
electricity royalties and faster execution of spending in the latter part of the year, the headline
deficit increased slightly relative to 2013. Still, estimates point to a modest contractionary
impulse. Monetary policy has been on hold since the central bank (BCP) raised the official
policy rate by 125 basis points, to 6.75 percent, between December 2013 and February 2014.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.
2

The Executive Board takes decisions under its lapse-of-time procedure when the Board agrees that a proposal
can be considered without convening formal discussions.

2
Real GDP is projected to remain close to 4 percent in 2015. Weak trading partner growth and
lower export prices cloud the outlook, and agricultural production is projected to rise only
marginally above the high level of 2014. However, positive impulses should come from the
projected rebound in electricity generation, the lower oil price, and the launch of new
infrastructure projects. The external current account is projected to switch from a small
surplus in 2014 to a moderate deficit in 2015, reflecting weaker terms of trade.
Risks around the outlook are broadly balanced. On the one hand, worsening terms of trade
could affect domestic spending more than anticipated, while further ruble depreciation might
hurt exports to Russia. On the other hand, looser-than-expected macroeconomic policies and
efforts to exploit a recently discovered hydrocarbon resource could create upside surprises.
Inflation is expected to hover around the 4.5 percent target in 2015, as recent guaraní
depreciation and a small positive output gap offset the impact of lower commodity prices.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2014 Article IV consultation with Paraguay, Executive Directors endorsed
the staff’s appraisal as follows:
The government has started to tackle some of the long-standing structural weaknesses
holding back development. Tax collection has improved significantly, creating space for
higher public investment; preparations are underway to launch several large infrastructure
projects; and the recently adopted “freedom-of-information” law will foster government
transparency. These efforts are commendable, and should be extended to achieve lasting
improvements in public services, institutional quality, and the rule of law. Such
improvements, in turn, are critical to attract investment, boost productivity, and underpin
medium-term growth and poverty reduction.
Paraguay’s macroeconomic fundamentals remain sound, though the 2015 budget has dimmed
hopes that the Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL) would provide a firm institutional anchor for
fiscal prudence. Paraguay boasts moderate public debt, low inflation, and strong external
balances. To consolidate macroeconomic stability, the authorities have adopted new policy
frameworks in recent years, notably an inflation targeting regime and the FRL. These
frameworks provide appropriate anchors for policy. It is thus unfortunate that the approved
2015 budget envisages spending and a deficit above the mandated limits. With due restraint
in the execution of the budget and continued efforts to improve tax enforcement, it remains
possible to achieve the original FRL targets and thereby bolster the credibility of the fiscal
rules. Over time, a stronger budget process will be essential to support fiscal discipline.
More broadly, it will be crucial to integrate the planned improvement of public services into
a prudent fiscal plan for the medium term. The authorities’ reform strategy holds great
promise, but should not come at the expense of weakening Paraguay’s solid macroeconomic

3
position. This puts a premium on generating sufficient revenue to accommodate spending
plans and preserve favorable debt dynamics. To ensure public support, it is important that
additional revenue effectively translates into better public services. Civil service reform
would assist this endeavor, by rationalizing public employment and raising efficiency. A
prudent medium-term fiscal plan should also incorporate some buffer against adverse shocks,
given the high volatility of Paraguay’s economic environment.
In the same vein, it will be important to contain fiscal risks related to infrastructure projects,
State Owned Entreprises (SOEs), and public pension funds. Private sector participation in
infrastructure is welcome but must be managed carefully to contain risks to the public
finances. Particular caution is warranted with respect to deferred financing schemes that
could create government liabilities without the scrutiny of the regular budget process. Fiscal
risks could also arise from the missing oversight of Paraguay’s pension funds and their
actuarial imbalances. It is encouraging that the authorities plan to address these risks
proactively, starting with the planned creation of a regulator. Similar resolve is required to
address the financial and operational challenges in the SOE sector.
Monetary policy is currently well calibrated, and efforts should focus on further enhancing
the effectiveness of the inflation targeting regime. To strengthen the transmission of
monetary policy, it will be instrumental to develop a more active money market and
encourage gradual de-dollarization. Meanwhile, the central bank’s plan to make its sales of
government foreign-currency receipts more predictable will help to distinguish these
transactions clearly from occasional discretionary intervention within the flexible exchange
rate regime.
In light of continued strong credit growth, the authorities should closely monitor potential
risks and consider targeted macroprudential tightening. Paraguay’s banking system remains
sound, but the long-running credit expansion calls for vigilance. To contain the risks from
rising consumer indebtedness, lenders should be formally required to observe prudent limits
on households’ debt servicing capacity. Other areas for stepped-up oversight include foreigncurrency lending; and the proper recognition of credit risk in renegotiated loans. In this
context, the proposed revision of the central bank and banking laws is essential to put riskbased regulation and supervision on a robust legal basis. Another priority is to strengthen the
governance, resources, and enforcement powers of Instituto Nacional de
Cooperativismo (INCOOP).
