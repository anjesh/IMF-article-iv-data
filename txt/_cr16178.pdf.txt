IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Tonga
On June 13, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
2016 Article IV consultation1 with Tonga.
The Tongan economy has been rebounding since a contraction in FY2013.2 Growth
accelerated from 2.1 percent in FY2014 to 3.7 percent in FY2015, supported by construction,
tourism, strong remittances, and strong private credit growth, notwithstanding weatherrelated disruptions to agricultural production. Inflation declined to -0.3 percent at endFebruary 2016, reflecting lower global food and fuel prices. The country’s external position
remains strong, with reserves supported by strong remittances, donor aid, and low global fuel
prices.”
Real GDP is projected to grow at 3.1 percent in FY2015/16, driven by agriculture and
construction sectors, as well as private consumption. Over the medium term, growth would
stay around 2.5–3.0 percent, supported mainly by construction activities related to the
preparation for the South Pacific Games (SPG). Low inflation is projected to continue over
the medium term in line with global commodity prices.”
The balance of risks is tilted toward the downside. A protracted period of slower growth in
advanced and emerging market economies, particularly in Australia and New Zealand, could
lead to lower aid, remittances, and tourism receipts. On the domestic side, a large increase in
current spending and potential cost overruns related to SPG could weaken fiscal
sustainability and raise public debt. Slippages in the reform process could affect donor aid
and create a fiscal financing gap, while natural disasters could take a toll on the economy.”

Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Fiscal year in Tonga runs from July 1 to June 30.

Executive Board Assessment3
The Executive Directors welcomed Tonga’s improved macroeconomic performance and
favorable outlook. However, they noted that given the country’s small size, remoteness, and
exposure to natural shocks, it remains vulnerable to risks. Directors agreed that policy
priorities ahead should focus on building buffers and implementing structural reforms to
strengthen the economy’s resilience, safeguard macroeconomic and financial stability, and
boost potential growth.
Directors emphasized the importance of addressing fiscal risks and gradually building
buffers. They welcomed the authorities’ commitment to rein in the wage bill and avoid cost
overruns. They also encouraged continued reliance on concessional financing for capital
spending, including grant financing for the South Pacific Games. Directors saw a need for
further improvements in debt management as well as broader reforms to increase revenue
and raise the efficiency of public spending to create the fiscal space needed for investment in
infrastructure and human capital.
Directors considered the current accommodative monetary policy stance to be appropriate.
However, they encouraged the authorities to be ready to mop up excess liquidity should signs
of overheating emerge. Directors also encouraged the central bank to improve its monetary
policy framework by introducing a policy interest rate, developing monetary and
macro-prudential policy instruments, and announcing a new lower indicative reference rate
for inflation to help anchor inflation in the medium term. They underscored that maintaining
gross international reserves at the current level would help safeguard external stability.
Directors welcomed the continued progress made by the central bank in upgrading its
supervisory, regulatory, and legal frameworks for the financial sector, and called for further
steps to expand its oversight over nonbanks.
Directors emphasized that structural policies should aim at raising growth potential by
expanding opportunities for private sector development. They supported the efforts to
enhance financial inclusion and to promote private credit, but highlighted the need to
exercise caution in the application of government lending schemes. Directors encouraged the
authorities to develop a broader reform strategy to improve the business climate and to make
further progress in natural disaster preparedness. They also underscored the need to improve
the quality and timeliness of data and encouraged the effective use of technical assistance
from the Fund and development partners.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
May 26, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Outlook and risks. Since FY2013, Tonga has been on a growth path supported by the
reconstruction in the aftermath of the 2014 Cyclone Ian, tourism, and remittances, and
benefiting from low global fuel prices. In the medium term, growth is projected to be
driven by economic activity in preparation to the Sixteenth South Pacific Games (the
SPG) in 2019, while inflation is expected to remain low. International reserves are
expected to remain at a comfortable level, supported by strong donor inflows, high
remittances, and low costs of fuel imports. After weakening in FY2016 as a result of
strong wage growth, the fiscal position is projected to improve gradually in the
medium-term. Main risks to the outlook stem from a protracted period of slower
growth in advanced and emerging economies, natural disasters, and fiscal pressure to
raise government wages or as a result of cost overruns for the SPG and shortfalls in
donor aid.
Challenges. The main challenge for Tonga in the medium term is to improve its growth
potential and to create jobs for the young population, which would require expanding
opportunities for private sector development. Given Tonga’s vulnerabilities stemming
from its small size, remoteness, narrow export base, dependence on fuel imports, and
exposure to natural disasters, ensuring macroeconomic and financial stability will
remain a key challenge.
Key policy advice. Tonga needs to improve resilience to shocks by building buffers
and to undertake structural reforms to support private sector development and
economic diversification. The key policy recommendations are: (i) contain wage growth
and build sound fiscal position by gradually increasing the primary balance to ensure
fiscal sustainability; (ii) maintain gross reserves at the current level to bolster resilience
to shocks; (iii) lower the current inflation reference rate; (iv) strengthen monetary policy
framework, including by introducing a policy interest rate and associated instruments,
and develop macroprudential tools to better manage liquidity and credit cycle; and
(v) enhance business-enabling structural reforms and improve efficiency of the public
sector to raise growth potential.

CONTEXT
1.
Setting. Tonga is a small remote open economy in the South Pacific with a narrow
production base and low connectivity, resulting in high transportation costs, limited economies of
scale, and high fixed costs (Figure 1).1 As a result of the large number of workers abroad, Tonga is
one of the highest-level recipients of remittances as a share of GDP among all developing countries.
Tonga’s high dependence on remittances, foreign aid, tourism, and energy imports pose challenges
to its development, which is also affected by a protracted period of slower growth in advanced and
emerging market countries, particularly in Australia and New Zealand, as well as natural disasters2
and El Niño-related weather events. With limited resources, the government’s recent challenges
have been to support reconstruction in the aftermath of Cyclone Ian in 2014, which caused damages
estimated at 11 percent of GDP, and to secure sufficient funding for the South Pacific Games (SPG)
planned for 2019.3
2.
Political developments. Prime Minister (PM) ‘Akilisi Pohiva4 has been in office since January
2015, following general elections in which his pro-democracy party “Democratic Party of the
Friendly Islands” obtained nine out of 26 seats in the Legislative Assembly.5 Under his leadership, the
government prepared the second Tonga Strategic Development Framework (TSDF II) for 2015–25
with the focus on governance, inclusion, and private sector development. The Minister of Finance
and the Governor of the National Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT) have stayed in their posts. The
head of state in Tonga, a constitutional monarchy, King Tupou VI, was crowned in July 2015
following his accession to the throne in 2012.
3.
Traction. The authorities have made progress on key policy advice outlined in the last
Article IV consultation. In the 2015 staff report, staff emphasized the importance of improving the
primary fiscal balance over the medium term. The authorities have focused on raising revenues and
improving PFM, and followed the policy of zero non-concessional borrowing. They also have been
moving cautiously on the implementation of a levy on foreign exchange (FX) transactions and
raising the departure fee. However, more needs to be done in the fiscal area to tame wage growth
to ensure progress on fiscal consolidation. International reserves have been maintained at a
comfortable level. The authorities are considering lowering the inflation reference rate and express
their interest in further developing their monetary policy framework and macroprudential
operational tools with technical assistance from the IMF. The authorities have made significant
progress in structural reforms especially in the area of utilities and labor market, public enterprise

The population has remained broadly constant at around 100,000, despite a high birthrate, reflecting large-scale

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
4.
Recent developments. Tongan economy has been rebounding since a contraction in
6
FY2013. Growth accelerated from 2.1 percent in FY2014 to 3.7 percent in FY2015, supported by
construction, tourism, strong remittances, and strong private credit, and notwithstanding weatherrelated disruptions to agricultural production. Inflation declined from 0.2 percent (y/y) at end-June
2015 to -0.3 percent at end-February 2016, reflecting declining global food and fuel prices, well
below the NRBT inflation reference range of 6 to 8 percent. The domestic component of inflation,
however, edged up to reflect higher prices of locally produced food (Figure 2). External position
remains strong, supported by strong remittances, donor aid, and low global fuel prices, with
reserves at $142 million at end-February 2016, equivalent to more than 6 months of imports. From
end-FY2014 to February 2016, the NEER for the Tongan Pa’anga, which is pegged to a basket of
currencies,7 depreciated by 3.6 percent, while the REER depreciated by 6.1 percent.
5.
Outlook. The FY2016 real GDP growth is projected to remain relatively strong at 3.1 percent,
driven by a recovery in agriculture and an increase in construction activity in preparation for the
SPG. Domestic demand will be supported by lower fuel prices, remittances, and aid inflows, and
inflation will remain low. In the medium-term, growth is projected to fluctuate between 2.3 and
3 percent, supported by construction, tourism, and trade in the run-up to the SPG, before
converging to its historical average of about 1.8 percent by FY2021. Reflecting the stronger demand
generated by the SPG, inflation is expected to increase to three percent in FY2019. The outlook for
the external sector is positive with projected low global commodity prices, increasing remittances,
and improving tourism receipts. Although the current account is expected to widen in the run up to
the SPG, reserves will be maintained at a comfortable level and external debt will remain stable
provided that expected donor financing for SPG is realized.
6.
Risks. The overall balance of risk is tilted to the downside. Protracted period of slower
growth in advanced and emerging market economies, particularly in Australia and New Zealand,
could weigh on Tonga via aid, remittances, and tourism channels. On the domestic front,
a resurgence of strong credit growth could threaten financial stability, even though the banking
sector remains well capitalized and highly liquid. Large increases in current expenditure, particularly
the wage bill, could lead to higher public debt, jeopardizing debt sustainability. Slippages in
delivery of policy reforms could affect the level of development partners’ budget support, leading to
lower aid. Cost overrun related to the SPG could make it necessary to mobilize additional resources,
potentially resorting to non-concessional borrowing and raising the public debt. Natural disasters
and weather-related events are also a high risk and could take a toll on the economy. On the upside,

Tonga would continue to benefit as a net energy and food importer, if oil and food prices remain
low (Appendix I).
Authorities Views
7.
The authorities concurred with staff assessment of the economic outlook and risks for
Tonga. They projected only marginally higher growth than the staff in the run up to the SPG, noting
a strong impact on growth of construction projects undertaken by local churches and a major
school anniversary celebration later in 2016. Regarding the risks, they viewed a delay in receipt of
budget support, natural disasters, and an increase in public debt, including as a result of excessive
wage growth, as the main risks.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The discussions focused on measures (i) to increase resilience of Tonga’s economy to shocks, including
from climate change and natural disasters, (ii) to preserve macroeconomic and financial stability, and
(iii) to improve Tonga’s long-term growth prospects.

A. Fiscal Policy
8.
The fiscal deficit is projected to widen in FY2016 on the back of a high wage bill
growth and lower grants. The overall balance reverted from a 1.7 percent surplus in FY2014 to
a 1.1 percent deficit in FY2015, and staff

The decline in project grants is linked to under-implementation of projects, and thus, is deficit-neutral. Following
a change in risk rating under Joint Debt Sustainability Analysis by the IMF and the WB in 2014 from high to
moderate, the WB and the ADB changed their financial support to Tonga from 100-percent grants to 50:50 ratio of
grants to loans.

projects constrained by capacity.9 The deficit will be financed by foreign loans, domestic bonds, and
drawdown of government deposits. A larger share of loan-financing in overall donor funding will
contribute to a higher deficit in FY2016. In the medium-term, spending pressures, arising from
wages and preparations for the SPG, will continue. However, provided wages are held in check and
grant-financing is secured to finance the SPG, the deficit is projected to decline.
9.
Discussions were focused on the need to protect fiscal and debt sustainability. The
current public debt of Tonga is around 49 percent of GDP. The authorities have been careful not to
incur new non-concessional debt in line with the new debt management strategy. Debt
sustainability analysis (DSA) conducted by staff suggests that public and external debt are
sustainable under the baseline scenario, but there are significant risks emanating from (i) the high
wage pressure, (ii) shortfalls in donor financing of the SPG and cost overruns, and (iii) natural
disasters. Should these risks materialize, fiscal deficits would widen, potentially necessitating nonconcessional borrowing and raising the debt level. Tonga’s overall risk of debt distress under the
DSA is classified as moderate.10
10.

Staff suggested measures to mitigate the risks. These include:



Restraining the wage growth to the level consistent with inflation in order to lower the share of
wages in current spending and the GDP (14 percent in FY2016). A new formula for COLA, which
is under development, could become a useful annual target starting from FY2017. A broader civil
service reform informed by the results of the recent remuneration review should be undertaken
in parallel to ensure that employment in government is rationalized and pay scales adequately
reflect responsibilities, while the quality of public services is maintained.



Rationalize public spending on the SPG and seek donor grants for capital spending. Estimates of
financing of capital spending on the SPG range from T$78 to T$93 million. The authorities are in
the process of identifying donors for the SPG. Some donors expressed interest (for example
China and PNG), but their commitments are yet to be confirmed. Given the risks to debt
sustainability, staff supports the authorities’ intention to seek grant financing where possible.



Building fiscal buffers to mitigate the effects of natural disasters and to finance the operating
costs of the SPG. Given the uncertainty regarding the potential revenue from the departure fee
and the FX levy, contingency measures are needed to secure sufficient funding. In addition,
maintaining fiscal reserves at three months of current spending is prudent for unexpected
contingencies, such as natural disasters. Fiscal consolidation that would be needed to build
buffers is estimated at about 1.1 percent of GDP per annum in the next three years. Savings

The FX levy was slated to be imposed in FY2016 on financial institutions by taxing financial institutions on the
spread on the purchase and sale of foreign exchange. However, a delay in the implementation of FX levy occurred
amid lack of clarity about its modalities and concerns about possible Fund jurisdictional implications of the FX Levy,
which has resulted in Tonga’s parliament passing amendments to the underlying law. In the end, the levy was
implemented at a rate of ½ seniti per Pa’anga on the Pa’anga value of the spread, where “spread” is the difference
between the actual transaction rate and the midpoint rate quoted by the NRBT, beginning June 1, 2016. Fund staff
will monitor whether the operation of FX levy gives rise to jurisdictional concerns. For departure fee, the plan was to
raise it from T$65 by T$100, but concerns about its impact on tourist arrivals have led to a delay in its
implementation. Together the two measures were expected to raise T$7.5 million per year.

derived from the rationalization of spending in the context of the ongoing expenditure review
should be used for accumulating fiscal buffers.
11.
Moreover, building resilience is contingent on broader structural reform efforts to
increase the revenue and to raise the efficiency of public spending. The government is focused
on collection of remaining tax arrears, reviewing tax exemptions, and broadening the tax base.
Further improvements in tax administration will be contingent on continued efforts at risk-based
supervision, stricter enforcement, improved efficiency as a result of a reorganization of tax
administration along the functional lines, and implementation of Automated System for Customs
Data (ASYCUDA) in customs with the assistance from PFTAC. In the area of PFM, efficiency gains
could be derived from implementation of the reform program for the procurement system, better
accounting and reporting (revising the chart of accounts to improve line ministry reporting), and
improved commitment controls (enhancing the IFMIS) and budget reporting functions, all of which
will support better governance.11 Staff welcomes the recent establishment of an Audit Oversight
Committee of the Cabinet with the goal to improve timeliness and ensure a follow-up on audit
recommendations as well as an on-going initiative to implement e-government. With the assistance
of the ADB, the authorities are conducting a reform of public enterprises to improve their
governance and financial results. Altogether, fiscal structural reforms will help create fiscal space for
much needed growth enhancing investment in infrastructure and human capital.
Authorities Views
12.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff assessment of fiscal outlook and risks. They
saw excessive wage growth and spending on natural disasters as the main risks to fiscal outlook.
They agreed with the need to rein in the wage bill, noting that they started reducing vacancies
already this year. However, they were not ready to commit to a specific target for wage growth,
indicating that this decision should await the completion of the organizational effectiveness review
that is underway. The authorities reiterated their commitment to seek grant-financing for the SPG.
They emphasized their efforts to lower debt burden by refinancing expensive debt to the Retirement
Fund Board by using government bonds and negotiating debt relief with Bank of China. They
agreed with the need to build fiscal buffers, noting existing provisions in place to respond to natural
disasters (see below). In addition, they noted the need to secure resources to service large debt to
China starting in FY2019, and the establishment of a sinking fund for this purpose.

B. External Stability
13.
The staff emphasized the need to maintain adequate level of international reserves.
The current reserve cover, at about 6 months of imports, is adequate according to staff analysis,
which weighs economic costs of external shocks against the costs of holding reserves12 although it is
above the NRBT’s target range of 3–4 months of import cover. Exchange rate is in line with
fundamentals and there are no signs of deteriorating competitiveness (Box 1). However, should
pressure on reserves emerge, the NRBT should be ready to depreciate the Pa’anga against the
11

Progress is being made in these areas with the assistance of PFTAC, the WB and the ADB.

basket of currencies in order to safeguard external stability. More restrained fiscal policy could also
be needed to alleviate potential external pressures.

Authorities Views
14.
The authorities agreed with staff’s exchange rate assessment and on the need to
maintain sufficient reserves, but questioned whether the current level of reserves is excessive.
Given large developmental needs of Tonga, they thought that the opportunity cost of holding
reserves could be higher than estimated by staff. They expected the reserves to come down in the
coming years as investment projects scale up.

C. Monetary Policy
15.
Monetary policy stance remained accommodative with growth of broad money and
private credit accelerating, and no change in monetary policy is warranted at this time. Broad
money (M2) growth increased to 18.2 percent (y/y) in February 2016, from 9 percent (y/y) in June
2015, reflecting accumulation of surplus liquidity in the banking sector and inflows from abroad; and
private credit growth increased to 14.6 percent (y/y) in February 2016 from 8.6 percent in June 2015.
The credit growth was supported mainly by the implementation of the government-managed loansubsidy scheme, lower lending rates, a boom in construction, and an increase in commercial loans,
and has not been a concern so far. The resumption of credit growth needs to be monitored closely
to ensure that risks do not build up. The authorities expressed concerns about the excess reserves of
banks, noting that monetary policy tools have not been effective in addressing them. In staff’s view,
monetary tightening is not needed at this time, and strong credit growth is not yet a concern, since
it started from a low level last year, and there are no signs of overheating. Monetary tightening,
however, will be needed should signs of overheating emerge, particularly if inflation were to spike
up. Raising the reserve requirement or selling government bonds could be used for this purpose.
16.
In the medium-term, the authorities are looking for ways to improve the monetary
policy framework. For this, the NRBT is considering introducing a short-term policy interest rate to
guide lending and deposit rates. Staff encouraged the NRBT to follow best international practices by
setting the neutral policy interest rate above the long run inflation rate and to seek TA from the IMF
on the design and implementation of the framework.
17.
Staff and the authorities agreed on the need to move away from the current reference
range to a lower, more realistic reference rate of inflation. Ever since the reference range of
6-8 percent was introduced in 2011, inflation has fallen well below the range, undermining its
usefulness as a guide for monetary policy. Pursuing an inflation range in the context of a fixed
exchange rate regime, a weak monetary policy transmission mechanism, and sensitivity to external
price shocks has been challenging. Staff advised to set a reference rate at four percent, to be more
consistent with historic inflation and better aligned to the medium-term inflation outlook (while
preserving a margin to accommodate future domestic and external price shocks). Any changes in
reference rate should be publicly explained.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TONGA

Authorities Views
18.
The authorities concurred with staff assessment of monetary policy stance. At present
they viewed raising reserve requirement as a first defense against overheating. In the medium-term
they wished to expand their monetary policy toolkit to improve monetary policy flexibility and
requested technical assistance from the IMF in this area. They have been receptive to the proposal
to move to a new inflation reference rate, however, they were noncommittal to specific action
deadlines.

D. Financial Stability and Macroprudential Policies
19.
Financial sector is highly profitable and stable, but vigilance is needed. Tonga’s banks
have strong capital positions and are highly liquid, although their level of NPLs remains elevated.13
Interest spreads have been declining, perhaps reflecting increasing competition in the banking
sector and better access to credit information. Credit-to-GDP ratio is still under 30 percent, a low
level by international comparisons, and credit growth is consistent with financial deepening. The
authorities, however, monitor banks closely, and are willing to explore macro-prudential tools,
including loan-to-deposit ratio, loan-to-value ratio, caps on credit to specific sectors, and caps on
net interest margin, to prevent a buildup of systemic financial risks. Although the risks from the
government subsidy scheme with Tonga Development Bank (TDB) are minimal at this stage, lax
lending standards could potentially become a problem. The non-banking financial institutions
(NBFIs) sector remains small and is currently effectively unsupervised (although it has been brought
under the supervision of the NRBT recently), which could become a concern in the future.
20.
The authorities are making effort to strengthen financial stability by upgrading the
NRBT supervisory, regulatory, and legal framework. Efforts have focused on strengthening
regulations including amending the NRBT Act, and the Banking Act (formerly Financial Institutions
Act), and improving the legal framework for all types of financial institutions. Work is ongoing to
finalize the Banking Act, as well as other financial sector legislation, which would allow the NRBT to
start supervising NBFIs, strengthen the autonomy and accountability of the NRBT, reform its
governance framework, provide the NRBT with the powers to issue binding regulations, and entrust
the NRBT with clear enforcement actions. Adopting the Banking Act in the near future would
improve banking resolution regime, which is currently based on the Company Act. The NRBT
continues receiving TA on risk-based supervision for the banking sector from the PFTAC, which
would further improve supervising and regulatory capacity of the NRBT.
21.
De-risking of global banks has not yet become an issue for Tonga, but the situation
needs to be monitored. While some money transfer operators have closed down their operations,
World Bank data indicate that remittances inflows have been stable and the transaction costs
decreased between 2014 and 2015. At the same time, all Tongan banks have been able to continue
normal correspondence banking activities with banks abroad.

13

There are five banks operating in Tonga. However, the NRBT prohibited one bank from deposit-taking after its
capital position and liquidity weakened last year.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TONGA

Authorities Views
22.
The authorities concurred with staff assessment of financial sector risks. They are
committed to further improving financial sector supervision and regulation, with TA from PFTAC,
and extending supervision to nonbanks. They are concerned about the potential effect of de-risking
on banking activity and foreign remittances, and are monitoring developments in the region in
order to take actions, if necessary.

E. Financial Deepening, Structural Reforms, and Climate Change
23.
The authorities are promoting access to finance to support inclusive growth. The NRBT
is currently implementing SMEs finance project and conducting Demand Side Survey to study
determinants of credit demand. Mandated credit reporting and extension of credit bureau coverage
to non-bank credit providers, such as utilities, aim to reduce costs of due diligence and thereby
support access to finance. Revision of the Land Act would help improve development of collateral
for personal and business loans and reduce impediments for access to finance. Measures to
promote collateral, credit information databases,14 and deposit insurance, are also expected to
support financial stability.
24.
Government on-lending scheme via TDB has been part of the effort to increase credit
to private sector. The scheme involve lending of government funds to small enterprises in selected
sectors, such as agriculture, fisheries, education, and microfinance for women at low interest rate,
currently 1 to 4 percent per year, and a fixed fee. Although the evaluation of the scheme has yet to
be undertaken, anecdotal evidence suggest that accessing funding via TDB has been difficult for
small businesses with no credit history or collateral. Therefore, staff recommended to simplify this
scheme for small businesses and to consider adopting a comprehensive microfinance approach for
informal sector and unbanked population.
25.
Raising Tonga’s growth potential remains an overarching goal and will require
improving opportunities for private sector development and FDIs. The government has made
significant progress in bringing structural reforms up to date, including in regulated utilities and
labor market (recently becoming a member of the ILO), public enterprise reform, and is developing
legislation to facilitate formalization of the informal sector, including revising the foreign investment
act and work permit rules. The authorities continue efforts to adopt the receivership bill and develop
bankruptcy policy and legislation based on this bill. They also work to develop a new National
Energy Act, which would facilitate competition in the power generation sector, based on a revised
Tonga Energy Road Map 2010-20 and continue promoting exports via regional trade agreements.
Tonga is a member of the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement (PICTA), the South Pacific
Regional Trade and Economic Cooperation Agreement (SPARTECA,) and the World Trade
Organization (WTO). Still, more needs to be done, as the share of private sector in the economy is
low, and FDIs in FY2015 is estimated at a low 2.7 percent of GDP. Staff also recommended to

prepare a comprehensive private sector development strategy to guide reform implementation in
the medium term.
26.
Progress is being made in natural disaster preparedness. Tonga is ranked second on the
risk of natural disaster based on the World
Bank Risk Index. The authorities are
undertaking several initiatives to enhance its
resilience in the context of the TSDF II
programs targeting (i) rural electrification,
(ii) energy efficiency, (iii) Disaster Risk
Management training and improving
communication with districts and communities,
and (iv) completion of specialized hazard maps
and detailed analysis. More broadly, they have
measures in place to improve ex post and ex
ante resilience to shocks within a multi-pillar
framework at the national level.15 They have funding arrangements in place to respond in case
disaster struck, including ex ante cash emergency fund of T$5 million, with an additional
T$1.5 million donor funded emergency financing for rapid response assistance. Ex post
arrangements include flash appeal, bilateral and multilateral donor assistance for relief and
reconstruction, and capital budget realignment. Additional measures that could be considered
include funding through a contingency budget, as well as sovereign catastrophe risk and traditional
disaster insurance. At the same time, comfortable gross international reserves supported by
favorable external environment and moderate public debt should provide Tonga with some selfinsurance in the medium term. A risk scenario in the DSA, integrating projected fiscal costs of future
natural disasters into the macro-framework, demonstrates that external debt will remain sustainable,
albeit at an elevated level.16

The authorities agreed that improving business environment and financial inclusion
are key to raising growth potential. In this context, they noted strong pressure from the
government and legislature to facilitate more bank lending to the private sector, including by
imposing caps on interest rates. Although banks’ interest rate spreads have been declining, average
lending rate at 8 percent remains high. Staff warned against imposing interest controls as those
could undermine banks’ financial position and lead to less, rather than more credit. Moreover,
stimulating more credit growth risks undermining financial stability, at time when credit growth is
already strong. Regarding preparedness for natural disasters, the authorities noted that existing
arrangements with donors (primarily Australia and New Zealand) for emergency assistance and their
support of reconstruction effort in the aftermath of the disasters have been crucial for Tonga’s
economy.

OTHER ISSUES
28.
Data issues. While broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, data quality and timeliness
remain a concern, complicating monitoring of economic conditions and policy formulation (see the
Statistical Issues in the Information Annex).17 Notwithstanding some progress—national accounts
statistics by expenditure have been produced, the balance of payments (BOP) statistics is now in line
with BPM6, and the central government budget migrated to GFSM 2001—improvements are
needed in many areas, including labor market, household survey, population census, government
finance statistics (GFS), compilation of financial soundness indicators (FSIs), and financial access
survey (FAS). In this regard, weak capacity and understaffing at the statistics office is a concern,
which the authorities are planning to address through technical assistance from the IMF and PFTAC.

STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
The performance of Tonga’s economy has improved and the economic outlook is
favorable, but there are downside risks. In FY2015 growth strengthened, inflation declined, gross
reserves remained at comfortable level, and private credit accelerated. Overall competitiveness of
the economy has improved with tourist arrivals increasing and the REER depreciating. Positive
growth outlook is expected to continue in FY2016 and the medium-term, with strong external
inflows and low fuel prices supporting domestic demand. However, as noted above, there are
serious external and domestic policy risks which could cloud the outlook.
30.
Fiscal position is expected to improve in the medium-term, and fiscal policy should be
aimed at addressing fiscal risks and building buffers. Staff welcomes the authorities’
commitments to rein in the wage bill, and recommends setting up a limit on annual wage growth in
line with average inflation. A broader civil service reform is needed in the medium-term to ensure
the efficiency of wage spending. Given the risk to debt sustainability, staff supports the authorities’
intension to seek grant financing to cover the costs of the SPG, although strict control over
expenditure will be required to prevent cost overruns, and to lower the debt burden via debt relief
and refinancing. In addition to fiscal buffers for unexpected contingencies, such as natural disasters,
the authorities should build fiscal buffers to cover the operational costs of the SPG. Contingency
measures may be needed, if revenue from new taxes to finance the SPG (FX levy and departure fee)
falls below projections. Staff encourages the authorities to closely monitor the implementation of
the FX levy to ensure its compliance with Tonga’s obligations under Article VIII.
31.
Continued progress with fiscal structural reforms along with good debt management
will be important to maintain fiscal sustainability and to secure fiscal space for growthenhancing spending in the medium-term. In line with the new debt management strategy, the
government should adhere to the policy of no non-concessional borrowing and seek opportunities
to lighten the debt burden. Structural reforms should aim at broadening the tax base, and
improving tax administration and PFM, leveraging technical assistance from development partners

17

14

TONGA

and the IMF (PFTAC). Fiscal space as a result of these reforms could be used for growth-enhancing
investment in infrastructure and human capital.
32.
The authorities should maintain gross reserve buffers at the current level to safeguard
external stability. Staff estimates that reserves at around 6 months of imports are appropriate for
Tonga given its vulnerability to external shocks and fiscal risks, and the exchange rate is broadly in
line with fundamentals. The authorities, however, should stand ready to depreciate the Pa’anga
against the basket of currencies in order to safeguard external stability should external pressures
emerge. More restrained fiscal policy would also be needed to alleviate potential external pressures.
33.
The current accommodative stance of monetary policy is appropriate in light of low
inflation and strong external position, but vigilance is needed to guard against macrofinancial risks. The recent acceleration in the growth of private credit is not a concern as it is
coming from a low level and is consistent with financial deepening, given the low rate of banking
penetration in Tonga. However the NRBT should stand ready to mop up excess liquidity in the banks
should signs of overheating emerge. The banking sector remains stable and profitable. However, the
NRBT should continue supervising banks closely and adopt macro-prudential tools as needed to
avoid buildup of systemic risks. Global de-risking has not yet affected Tonga in a major way, but
risks associated with it should be monitored. To support financial stability more broadly, staff
encourages the authorities’ ongoing efforts at upgrading Tonga’s supervisory, regulatory, and legal
frameworks. The IMF stands ready to continue providing TA to the NRBT in the area of financial
sector legislation.
34.
Staff supports the NRBT’s plan to strengthen its monetary policy framework. Staff
welcomes the authorities’ intention to move away from the current inflation reference range, which
lost its usefulness as a guide for monetary policy, to a new indicative reference rate of inflation, set
to be consistent with inflation outlook in the medium-term. Staff also sees merit in introducing
a policy interest rate to guide lending and deposit rates and strongly encourages the NRBT to follow
best international practices in setting the policy interest rate and developing the monetary
instruments. In this regard, staff welcomes the NRBT’s TA request to MCM on enhancing monetary
policy framework, improving FX reserve management, and introducing macroprudential policies and
instruments.
35.
Raising Tonga’s growth potential, requires improving opportunities for private sector
development. Staff commends the government’s initiative to improve financial access to support
inclusive growth, however warns against excessive reliance on administrative methods of credit
allocation. While supporting private sector via government lending schemes, such as in TDB, could
be beneficial, caution is needed to ensure that public resources are applied effectively, and
international experience should be studied in this regard. Staff notes progress on reforms to
improve the business climate, including in the areas of regulation of utilities, labor market, and
foreign investment and encourages the authorities to prepare a comprehensive private sector
development strategy to guide reform implementation in the medium term. Such strategy should
encompass the areas of governance, transparency, business climate, access to external markets, as
well as investing in transport, communications, human capital (health and education), and tourism,
building on the TSDF II. Additionally, to ensure sustainability of the growth, a comprehensive

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TONGA

national strategy along the lines presented by staff is needed build Tonga’s resilience to climate
change shocks. Such strategy should encompass measures, including ongoing under TSDF II, to
mitigate the risks and to cope once a disaster strikes. Staff welcomes efforts that are already
underway to address climate change shocks.
36.
Improving economic data remains a high priority. Given the importance of data
timeliness and quality for formulation of sound macroeconomic policies, staff encourages the
authorities to strengthen capacity of the Tonga Department of Statistics, including through
improving staffing, and seek technical assistance from the IMF’s Statistics Department and PFTAC on
(i) the System of National Accounts, including developing quarterly GDP and moving compilation to
SNA 2008, (ii), external sector statistics, (iii) GFS, and (iv) FSIs.

It is recommended that the next Article IV Consultation takes place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Box 1. Tonga: Exchange Rate and Competitiveness 1/
Tonga’s real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals. Other indicators
suggest that the economy remains competitive.
Exchange rate
 Tonga’s real effective exchange rate (REER) is broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals. The
current account approach suggests an overvaluation by around 2.2 percent and current account
gap of -0.2 percent. REER and nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) have been depreciating since
September 2011 suggesting an improvement in external competitiveness.
Other indicators

 Reserves. Gross international reserves remain
adequate at about 6 months of the prospective imports in FY2016, which is marginally above the
target of 5.6 months of imports calculated using the IMF reserve adequacy template.
 Exports. Exports recovered quickly from a slump during the global financial crisis and have grown
moderately in recent years. In the medium term, exports are projected to grow at about two/three
percent, in line with the overall economic growth. Continued lower commodity prices are projected
to negatively affect exports, but higher demand for agricultural products (squash and root crops)
will compensate for this.
 Number of tourists. The number of tourists has increased steadily as Tonga attempts to become
an attractive tourist destination.
 Costs of doing business. Tonga remains
competitive compared with other PICs,
according to the World Bank’s Doing
Business 2016 report. Relative strengths
include getting credit and electricity,
dealing with construction permits, and
starting a business. There is room for
improvement in terms of registering
property and resolving insolvency.

Likelihood

Policy Response to
Minimize Impact

EXTERNAL RISKS
Structurally weak growth in key advanced economies
An economic slowdown in key advanced countries (New
Zealand, Australia, and the U.S.) hosting Tongan overseas
workers could weaken remittance inflows. Tonga's exports
would be also significantly affected.
Significant China slowdown
Tonga would be affected indirectly through China's trade links
with New Zealand/Australia, and directly through a slowdown
in Chinese official development assistance
Persistently lower energy prices
Tonga would on balance benefit from the lower energy prices.
However, persistently lower oil prices would discourage certain
investments, including in seabed mining and renewable
energy.
Reduced financial services by global/regional banks (“derisking”)
Stricter global regulatory requirements could further push
MTO to close down, which could potentially increase the cost
of inward remittances.

Preserve fiscal and external
policy space to cope with
adverse shocks in the short
term. In the longer term,
boost public investment, and
pursue structural reforms to
improve the investment
climate and reduce
dependence on aid and
remittances.

DOMESTIC RISKS
Slippages in the execution of policy reform
Slippages in the reform process could derail critical reforms
agreed with development partners. Such an outcome could
affect grant flows for budget support, resulting in a
significantly larger gross financing gap.
Cost overrun relating to the 2019 South Pacific Games and
wage pressure
Excessive wage growth and/or underestimating the true cost of
construction works could make it necessary to mobilize
additional resources and might necessitate corrective fiscal
consolidation in the long run.
Natural disasters (regional)
Natural disasters similar to the recent cyclone could take
significant toll on Tonga, such as damages to infrastructure
and production base.

Low/medium

High

Take early remedial actions,
including stronger
commitment to ensure fiscal
prudence, renewed reform
efforts, and streamlining the
Games, to redress impaired
confidence and re-energize
support by the donors.

Prepare for future disaster by:
(i) building fiscal space and
maintaining international
reserve buffers, (ii)
participating in catastrophic
insurance schemes; and (iii)
following disasters, using
programs and funds available
through global financial
safety nets.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially after the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff).
The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff's subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline ("low" is meant to indicate a probability below 10
percent, "medium" a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and "high" a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks
and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Appendix II. Frequency and Impact of Natural Disasters in Tonga1
Tonga faces a high risk to natural disasters. Tonga, a small island close to equator, is exposed to
cyclones, floods, earthquake, droughts, and sea-level rise. In the past five years, Tonga was affected
by natural disasters more frequently than previously, with average sustained winds of cyclones
passing through Tonga increasing. In early 2016, cyclone Ula battered northern islands of Tonga
with minimum damage. In February, tropical cyclone Winston double hit Tonga within a week,
leaving some minor damage and power outage. The United Nation University’s World Risk Index
ranked Tonga second of 171 countries in 2015, up one rank from 2014 on account of deteriorating
adaptive capacities.

Average losses from disasters in Tonga have been substantial. Across the Pacific, which is the most
vulnerable region in per capita terms, Tonga is among the most affected by disasters over the past
20 years. According to data on the costs of recent disasters (for example, storms, floods, earthquakes,
volcanic activity, etc.) from the EM-DAT database (see also table above), Tonga suffered damages and
losses to property, crops, and livestock equivalent to about 1.9 percent of annual GDP over the period
from 1996 to 2015. This is second only to Vanuatu, which experienced massive losses in 2014 after
Cyclone Pam.
In addition to human cost and damages, natural disasters also lower long term growth, weaken
fiscal position and the current account.

Exchange Arrangement
The exchange rate arrangement is a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands. Tonga has
accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3 and 4 and maintains an exchange control
system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions. Since February 11, 1991, the value of the pa’anga is determined based on a weighted

basket of currencies comprising the United States, Australian, and New Zealand dollars, with the
U.S. dollar as the intervention currency. In July 2014, the Fijian dollar was added to the basket
replacing the Japanese yen, and, in July 2010, the monthly maximum adjustment limit was raised
to 5 percent from 2 percent that had prevailed since March 1998, when the allowance for
adjustment was introduced.
Last Article IV Consultation
Staff discussions were held during February 2015. On April 24, 2015, the Executive Board of the
IMF concluded the 2015 Article IV consultation with Tonga and endorsed the thrust of the staff
appraisal (IMF Country Report No. 15/107).
Technical Assistance
The Legal Department (LEG) provided assistance on AML/CFT issues for the Pacific islands
countries, including Tonga, from 2002 through 2005. LEG also provided assistance on the National
Reserve Bank of Tonga Act and Financial Institutions Act from 2013 to 2014. PFTAC has, on an ongoing basis, provided assistance on budgetary management; tax administration; banking
legislation and supervision; and balance of payments and national accounts statistics.
Resident Representative
The Regional Resident Representative Office for Pacific Islands, including Tonga, was opened on
September 2010 in Suva, Fiji. Mr. Tubagus Feridhanusetyawan is the resident representative.

PACIFIC FINANCIAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTRE
(PFTAC) COUNTRY STRATEGY 2016–171
Background
Tonga continues to face a difficult macroeconomic environment. The global economic crisis has
led to a sustained period of slow growth, undermining both fiscal and financial stability. Nonperforming loans in the banking system remain high, while fiscal policy options are tightly
constrained by the high level of public external debt.
This has been particularly so in the public financial management (PFM) area where PFTAC and the
Asian Development Bank (AsDB) have worked with the authorities to design and implement
a realistic reform roadmap. The Roadmap was recently endorsed by the Cabinet. Since 2014, TA has
been provided by the IMF in the compilation of National Accounts and in balance of payments (BOP)
and government finance statistics (GFS). Support has also been provided to the National Reserve
Bank of Tonga (NRBT) in off-site and on-site banking supervision.
Strategy 2016–17
PFTAC’s TA strategy is guided by the APD regional strategy and is planned within the results
framework for current PFTAC funding cycle.
PFTAC TA aims to support the authorities sustain progress on fiscal consolidation and to
improve the macroeconomic environment. PFTAC will continue to work closely with the broader
development partner groups to ensure coherence and will aim to support implementation of actions
in the development partners’ budget support reform matrix. Inputs are expected in all sectors,
primarily at the strategic level in the fiscal and statistics sectors with detailed training and capacity
building in bank supervision and macroeconomics.
In the public financial management area, the focus will be primarily to assist the authorities to
implement high priority reforms identified in the Roadmap, including accounting and reporting
improvements (1.7); and planning for upgrading the government’s FMIS (1.7). PFTAC will also support
the Government's efforts to develop an effective medium-term budget framework (1.6) including
producing more accurate macroeconomic analysis; (5.1) and more rigorous cash/debt management
(1.7). In the medium term, PFTAC would look to assist the authorities to implement a follow-up PEFA
assessment, probably in 2018 (1.1).
In the revenue area, assistance was provided to facilitate: (a) the design and implementation of
a compliance improvement strategy that guides operational activities towards mitigating major
compliance risks; and (b) the implementation of a new function based organizational structure
targeted towards streamlining operations and alleviating duplicated processes. Additional technical
assistance to improve core tax functions is scheduled to take place in FY2017. Legal assistance to

review and benchmark the Revenue Services Administration Act against international best practice
has been provided with enactment of proposed amendments scheduled to take place by end-2016.
In statistics, Tonga is relatively well advanced against the overall results framework; based on PFTAC
advice, it produces National Accounts on two independent measures (4.1) with production of a range
of income indicators (4.3). Balance of payments statistics are now being developed according to
BPM6 standards (4.9). However, the quality and range of statistics and source data need to be
strengthened. Engagement with the Tonga Department of Statistics (TDS) has strengthened since
2014, when PFTAC took over the provision of national accounts TA; from 2011 to early 2013 , this was
led by an AusAID (now DFAT) funded resident advisor, with limited PFTAC input. Recent work has
focused on the use of tax returns to estimate GDP by production, which would support a future
rebase and, potentially, quarterly GDP estimation. BOP and GFS support were provided by IMF HQ
until 2015 but are now to be delivered by PFTAC, within its budget envelope.
In financial sector supervision, IMF/PFTAC over the past few years assisted the NRBT with the
deployment of standard prudential returns (3.1) and with establishing enhanced off-site analysis
(3.3). These currently enable the NRBT to prepare regular off-site analysis and monitoring reports
from the sector. Intensive support is being provided in FY2015/16 to develop on-site supervision
techniques by providing technical advisory support with performing actual on-site examinations of
a number of commercial banks (3.4, 3.5) which includes examination preparedness, scoping, planning,
execution, and report writing. PFTAC further reviewed the NRBT’s complete set of Prudential
Statements and drafted additional guidelines to ensure compatibility with the amendments made to
the Financial Institution Act. 2015/16 will also see the introduction of a comprehensive credit union
program aimed at overhauling the oversight of credit unions (3.9). In March 2016 the IMF Legal
Department completed a desk review of the Financial Institutions Act.
In the macroeconomic area, technical assistance (TA) in 2015 was provided jointly by PFTAC and
a secondee from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, who was recruited by PFTAC and funded by the
ADB, to build capacity for macroeconomic forecasting and analysis and link this analysis into budget
processes. The TA focused on developing a forecasting framework for GDP (5.1) and the construction
of a financial programming framework (5.2)—the Tonga Projection (TOP) Model. In October 2015
staff from the Ministry of Finance and National Planning (MFNP), the Tonga Department of Statistics
(TDS) and the Ministry of Revenue and Customs (MORC) participated in a five day workshop on
practical applications of the TOP Model. Subsequent collaboration by MFNP and MORC staff led to
the development of a satellite revenue forecasting tool. The MORC tax tool uses the MFNP’s industrylevel GDP forecasts as well as historical tax collection data and internal information on tax trends,
including the effects of compliance improvement and risk management activities, to forecast tax
revenues at a more disaggregated level than the TOP Model. Staff also participated in a High Level
Dialogue Meeting on Enhancing Resilience to Natural Disasters in Pacific Islands (5.4) and workshops
on Strengthening Fiscal Frameworks in the Pacific Islands, Medium-Term Expenditure Planning for
National Sustainable Development and Forecasting Tax Revenues (5.2).

WORLD BANK-IMF COLLABORATION1
The IMF team led by Ms. Elena Loukoianova (mission chief to Tonga) has a close working relationship
with the Bank team led by Mr. Robert Utz (lead economist, East Asia and the Pacific region). The
teams have an ongoing dialog on a range of macroeconomic and structural issues. The level of
cooperation and coordination is good and includes the following:


Article IV Consultation. The World Bank provided support and analytical inputs to the Article
IV mission, as with previous missions. In addition, Bank and Fund staffs prepared jointly the
Debt Sustainability Analysis appendix to the staff report.



Economic Updates. IMF analysis continues to provide a vital framework to the ongoing
budget support program, with IMF assessments used as the basis for decisions regarding the
appropriateness of the overall macroeconomic policy framework.



Structural Fiscal Reforms. Bank and Fund staffs have worked successfully to provide technical
assistance (TA) in public expenditure management and continue to collaborate on the
ongoing analytical work on public expenditure, the medium-term macro-framework, and
general structural issues.

Based on the above cooperation, the Bank and the Fund staff share a common view about Tonga’s
macroeconomic and structural reform priorities, which mainly aims at mitigating the risks to Tonga’s
external and fiscal sustainability and at promoting long-term growth. These include:


Sustainable fiscal management. Construction costs for the South Pacific Games (SPG) and
pressures for further increases in payroll spending pose challenges to fiscal sustainability if
not carefully managed. A priority for the authorities is to develop a clear policy framework to
guide any new borrowing to ensure that new borrowing supports high priority investments
and remains within sustainable limits. It will also be important to ensure that renewed
borrowing occurs alongside broader progress towards addressing fiscal challenges, including
further improvements in revenue administration and expenditure control, and tighter
prioritization of expenditure, as well as structural reforms. The government’s fiscal efforts will
need to be supplemented by continued provision of grants from donors.



Making use of the flexibility afforded by the current exchange rate arrangement. This remains
critical for safeguarding external stability.



Promoting private drivers of growth. Given fundamental constraints of smallness and
isolation, growth prospects are likely to remain concentrated in areas where premiums can be
generated to cover higher costs of production. Natural resource industries, including tourism,
agriculture, fisheries, and mining hold the greatest potential for private sector development.
To facilitate development in these areas there is a need to: (i) improve the efficiency and
regulation of services such as energy, water, and telecommunications in order to reduce
costs;

___________

TONGA

(ii) strengthen the institutional framework for lending—including the enforcement of creditor
rights to collateral—as a means to increase access to finance and lower the cost of borrowing;
(iii) improve vital tourism infrastructure, including through the commercialization of Tonga
Communication Corporation; and (iv) lower regulatory barriers to foreign investment.
World Bank Group cooperation with Tonga is set out in a Country Assistance Strategy presented to
the Board in October 2010. Given the depth of policy dialogue and the difficult economic and fiscal
position Tonga has been facing, the Bank has significantly scaled up both analytical and financial
support for Tonga. Total IDA and Trust Fund commitments to Tonga over the past six years amount
to nearly US$140 million, compared to US$30 million between 1985–when Tonga became a member–
and FY2010.
A key focus of engagement has been around budget support operations. There have been annual
World Bank budget support operations for each of the six years FY2011 to FY2016 to provide a total
of US$27.8 million to support fiscal, business-environment improving, public financial management,
and energy sector reforms as part of a World Bank-led multi-donor process. A further two budget
support operations are planned for FY2017 and FY2018, to complete the current programmatic
series.
Other World Bank investments support connectivity for sustainable economic development, and
include fiber-optic connectivity, transport sector reform, and aviation sector support, as well as
support to climate change and disaster resilience-building.
The Bank and Fund teams will continue their close cooperation going forward, particularly in
supporting the current program of budget support and to assist the Government in responding to
ongoing economic difficulties. Table 1 details the specific activities planned by the two country teams
over the February 2016–January 2017 period. It was also agreed that further details on collaboration,
as necessary, will be agreed at the technical level as work progresses.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK1
The goal of the Asian Development Bank’s (AsDB) Pacific Approach 2010–14 (extended until 2016) of
a sustained and resilient, improved standard of living aligns with the vision of the Tonga Strategic
Development Framework (TSDF) II, covering the period 2015–25, to create a more progressive Tonga
supporting a higher quality of life for all. AsDB’s Country Operations Business Plan 2016-18 for Tonga
supports the focus of the Pacific Approach and the TSDF II.
The Pacific Approach focuses on the need to mitigate environmental impact and strengthen climate
change resilience through development of renewable energy options; enhancing connectivity via
multimodal networks and new technologies; and supporting urban development. Two key drivers of
change to promote the focus of the Pacific Approach include improved private sector environment
and public sector management. The national outcomes of the TSDF II supported by AsDB are: a more
inclusive, sustainable and dynamic knowledge-based economy; more inclusive, sustainable, and
balanced urban and rural development across island groups; responsive good-governance
strengthening rule of law; sustainable and successful provision and maintenance of infrastructure and
technology; and, effective land and environment management, with resilience to climate change and
risk.
AsDB has approved 15 loans and 14 grants2 totaling US$146.08 million from the Asian Development
Fund (ADF) and other sources to Tonga since it joined AsDB in 1972. Total of 69 technical assistance
(TA) projects (including supplementary financing) with a value of US$22.42 million were also provided
to improve capacity and strengthen institutional development in various sectors. Past AsDB
investments have focused on finance and public sector development, and infrastructure development
in transport, power, information and communication technology, agriculture, and fisheries.
Active projects include five grant-financed projects in the country portfolio. The grant-financed
projects support connectivity through the Tonga-Fiji Submarine Cable project; service delivery
through the Nuku'alofa Urban Sector Development project (with co-financing from Australia) and the
Outer Island Renewable Energy project (with co-financing from Australia, Denmark and the European
Union); and climate resilience through the Climate Resilience Sector project financed by the Strategic
Climate Fund. The Cyclone Ian Recovery project (with co-financing from New Zealand) approved in
2014 has climate-and disaster-proofed education and energy infrastructure on the Ha’apai Island
group damaged by cyclone Ian in January 2014. There are no active country-specific TA projects but
Tonga benefits from a number of regional TA projects in private sector development, economic
management, energy efficiency, information and communication technology, and public financial
management. The AsDB is active in the joint policy reform discourse with the Government of Tonga
and other development partners, which is linked to budget support disbursements through AsDB’s
policy-based lending modality.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
TONGA—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX

As of April 20, 2016

I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: While economic statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance, data deficiencies continue to
complicate the monitoring of economic conditions and policy formulation. The Statistics Department (SD) and
the Ministry of Finance and National Planning (MOFNP) have received, on a regular basis, technical assistance
(TA) on national accounts, government finance, and balance of payments (BOP) statistics from the Fund’s
Statistics department (STA) as well as the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC). Nevertheless,
data provision to the Fund continues with long delays.
National Accounts: The coverage of the national accounts data has widened in the past few years as a result
of enhanced TA, but there is still room for improvement With assistance from the AusAID (now DFAT)-funded
resident advisor (2012-13), the 2009-10 Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) results were partially
incorporated in national accounts statistics. Customs data were supplemented with quarantine office data in
merchandize exports and in-kind donor-funded capital projects as well as loan financed projects. Labor market
statistics are weak: employment statistics have not been compiled since 2003, although population census 2011
and HIES 2009 provide point-in-time data; and average earnings statistics are not available.
Price Statistics: The Consumer Price Index is based on a basket of goods and services from the 2009-10 HIES.
TA was provided in 2008 on the development of an import price index, but trade data was not of sufficient
quality to produce indexes.
Government Finance Statistics: The FY2003 Central Government Budget Statement introduced a
presentation of fiscal data compiled according to the methodology of the 1986 Government Finance Statistics
Manual. The budget presentation was migrated to GFSM 2001 with the FY2015 budget. Improvements are still
needed to ensure accurate and reliable fiscal data. Timeliness and ease and efficiency in reporting remain an
issue. Source data are often available with a significant time lag and in-year sub-annual reporting requires
considerable manual intervention. The financial accounting system has not been upgraded and as a result is not
capable of capturing all transactions with much of the government’s financial business processes and data
collection completed on a manual basis. For example, the budget is compiled manually; debt management is
conducted outside of the financial accounts; aid revenue data is not included in the financial accounts; and
payments and receipts are both processed and recorded on a manual basis.
Reconciliation with monetary and balance of payments data requires enhancement and published data are
often subject to significant revisions. Consolidated financial statistics for the general government are not
published due to lack of source data and capacity and up until now, no data are reported for publication in the
GFS Yearbook (GFSY). Tonga is participating in the three-year GFS-IMF project for the Asia-Pacific region funded
by the government of Japan, and is committed to commence reporting for the GFSY.
Financial Sector Surveillance: Tonga compiles FSIs but has not reported them to the Fund yet.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TONGA

Monetary and Financial Statistics: NRBT reports data for the central bank, other depository corporations, and
monetary aggregates using the standardized report forms (SRFs). These data were published for the first time in
the March 2008 issue of IFS and IFS Supplement on Monetary and Financial Statistics. Beginning with January
2012 data, the NRBT updated the data collection forms for other depository corporations. The new forms are
fully aligned with the recommendations of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual with minor exceptions.
External Sector Statistics: There are several issues with the external sector statistics that need to be improved
(in particular the coverage and timeliness), where the SD could play a more proactive role. The SD compiles
balance of payments (BOP) and international investment position (IIP) statistics on a quarterly basis in BPM6
format. These statistics are reported to the Fund annually. Monthly trade figures, derived from customs data, are
available with a three-month lag. The NRBT compiles monthly foreign exchange transactions statistics based on
the Overseas Exchange Transactions Reporting System (OET) with a six-week lag.
OET have presented shortcomings in its classification. Large net errors and omissions have remained in the
balance of payments due to under-reporting of components such as current and capital transfers and direct
investment. To address those issues, new OET codes consistent with BPM6 have been implemented by the NBRT
since May 2014 and the International Investment Survey (IIS) has been carried out by the SD since 2014.
The challenges to improve external sector statistics faced with the SD and the NRBT are 1) to improve coverage
of items in financial account by enhancing IIS response rate and gathering more accurate banks’ financial
transactions data, 2) to obtain not captured data e.g. compensation of employees, remittances and acquisition
of goods and services by overseas workers to improve the BOP statistics, 3) to capture capital transfers
accompanied by main construction projects and incorporate them into BOP statistics, and 4) to maintain
adequate staff resources for compiling and disseminating balance of payments and IIP in accordance with the
international standards, and 5) provision of sufficient resources for undertaking the IIS regularly.
II. Data Standards and Quality
The country has been participating in the GDDS since
May 30, 2006.

DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

May 26, 2016

Approved By
Hoe Ee Khor and Peter
Allum (IMF) and IDA

Prepared by:
International Monetary Fund and the International
Development Association

Risk of external debt distress

Moderate

This is the second update of the debt sustainability analysis (DSA) conducted jointly by the IMF
and the World Bank since 2014.1 The results for external debt indicate that Tonga remains at a
moderate risk of debt distress, and the highest risk to debt sustainability emanates from a
combination of shocks to GDP, exports, the U.S. dollar deflator and grants. Analysis of public
debt points to risks stemming from strong wage growth.

The last full DSA was prepared in June 2014 (SM/14/173, Sup.2). In line with the Staff Guidance Note on the
Application of the Joint Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries in April 2016, Factsheet
URL: http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/jdsf.htm, a full DSA is expected to be prepared every three years, or
whenever circumstances have changed significantly since the previous DSA, such as a change in the external risk
rating or overall risk assessment. Light updates should be prepared in intervening years. With the latest three-year
average score of 3.47, Tonga is classified as a medium performer according to the World Bank Country Policy and
Institutional Assessment (CPIA).

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
Compared with the DSA update in 2015, the underlying assumptions remain broadly stable (Table 1)
with growth converging to 1.8 percent in the medium-term to factor in downside effects of periodic
shocks from natural disasters. The following highlights the main changes:


With the new global price outlook, the
GDP and exports deflators have been
revised downward, leading to lower
nominal GDP and exports during the
projection period.

wage spending and lower grants from
development partners, and assuming more financing to Tonga in the form of loans.

The current account deficit also worsens, assuming larger non-debt creating inflows (capital grants
cash and in-kind) in the run-up to the South Pacific Games (SPG).

EXTERNAL DSA
Under the baseline scenario, all Tonga’s external debt distress indicators remain below their countryspecific policy-based indicative thresholds (Figure 1). The rise in debt service ratios from 2019 to
2029 reflects mostly repayments of the two external loans from China EXIM Bank. The bound tests
demonstrate that with a combined shock to GDP, exports, the U.S. dollar GDP deflator and non-debt
creating inflows, three debt ratios (PV of debt-to-GDP+remittances, PV of debt-toexports+remittances and debt service-to-revenue) breach their respective thresholds, two of which
significantly and on a more sustained basis, suggesting a moderate risk of debt distress.
Additional risks arise from a potential shortfall of donor grants to finance the SPG and periodic
spending to respond to natural disasters. To illustrate these risks, an alternative scenario has been
prepared assuming about T$100 million being borrowed to finance the capital costs of the games
during FY2016–19, on the terms of China’s EXIM Bank loan (2 percent interest, 20-year maturity, and
5-year grace period).2 It is also assumed that natural disasters once every 4 years, leading to a
decline in GDP by about 2 percentage points and to additional spending on recovery, amounting to
about one percent of GDP in the following years. Although past recovery efforts have been
generously grant-financed by donors, the assumption is that financing will diminish going forward.
Compared to the baseline scenario, debt ratios will increase, narrowing their distance to thresholds

2
The most recent projections of the costs of the SPG range from T$80 million to T$100 million. This is down from
previous estimates to reflect the authorities’ decision to utilize existing facilities rather than construct new
accommodations.

significantly but not breaching them. Hence, the moderate risk rating remains under this alternative
scenario.

PUBLIC SECTION DSA3
Under the baseline scenario, the present value of public debt is projected to remain below the
benchmark throughout the projection period (Figure 2), steadily decreasing to below 20 percent of
nominal GDP. However, in the scenarios in which the primary balance remains at the level of 2016
throughout the projected period, or the public wage bill grows at an average rate of the past three
years (7 percent) during the projection period, public debt becomes unsustainable.

CONCLUSION
Compared to the DSA update of 2015,4 the risks to debt sustainability increased somewhat as
demonstrated by the results of the most extreme shock simulations. Additional risks stem from the
inability of the government to contain wage growth. However, the risk of external and public debt
distress continues to be classified as moderate.
Authorities’ views
The authorities broadly agreed with the staff assessment of debt sustainability risks. They strive to
maintain robust debt policies. To that end, they have recently finalized the Debt Management Policy
and are taking steps to alleviate debt burden, including negotiating debt forgiveness with the Bank
of China (T$8 million) and refinancing debt to the Pension Fund. They are concerned, however, that
a higher share of loan financing by development partners (the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank) following Tonga’s upgrade to a moderate level of risk of debt distress in 2014
could undermine debt sustainability. They agree with the staff that other risks emanate from the
pressure to raise public sector wages and to finance the SPG, and that it is important to maintain
fiscal buffers for contingencies, such as natural disasters.

The public sector comprises the central government and there is no local government in Tonga. The Country Policy
and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) rating for Tonga remains at a medium level with a three-year average score of
3.47. The Tonga fiscal year starts in July.

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Statement by Marzunisham Omar, Executive Director for of Tonga, and Mardini Eddy, Senior
Advisor to the Executive Director of Tonga
June 13, 2016

Mr. Omar and Mr. Eddie submitted the following statement:
On behalf of the Tongan authorities, we would like to express our sincere appreciation to the IMF
mission team for the constructive and candid discussions during the 2016 Article IV Consultation. The
discussions mainly centered on policies to further strengthen the resilience of Tonga’s economy,
preserve macroeconomic and financial stability, and improve long term growth prospects. The
authorities broadly agree with the thrust of the staff assessment of the macroeconomic performance,
the risks to the economic outlook, as well as the proposed reforms and policy recommendations to
enhance Tonga’s long-term growth prospects.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
Tonga’s economic recovery from the devastating effects of Cyclone Ian in January 2014 continues to
gather momentum. The National Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT) estimates economic growth of 3.3
percent for FY2016 (July 2015 to June 2016), from an estimated 3.7 percent in FY2015 and 2.1 percent
in FY2014. The average growth rates over the past three years have been driven by reconstruction
efforts following the cyclone’s aftermath, as well as increased activity associated with the Coronation
in July 2015 and the upcoming 150th Anniversary for Tupou College in June 2016. Growth is forecast
to moderate to 1.9 percent in FY2017. Remittances remain a reliable source of income while the
agriculture sector is expected to record higher export volumes with the production of new crops and
emergence of new export markets.
Inflation picked up 1.4 percent (year-on-year) in March 2016, following seven consecutive months of
deflation. However, the authorities expect that inflationary pressure will be moderate in the remaining
months of FY2016 to record an annual deflation of 0.84 percent by June 2016. On the external front,
foreign reserves have grown to record high of TOP323 million at end-April 2016, equivalent to 9
months of imports, significantly higher than the standard requirement of 3-4 months of import
coverage, reflecting strong remittances and foreign aid. The narrowing of the current account deficit
in FY2015 is attributable to the lower oil and import prices, however, moving forward the trade deficit
is expected to widen further due to the projected increase in imports in preparation for the 2019 Pacific
Games.
The authorities agree with staff’s assessments of a positive outlook of the economy in the medium
term. The hosting of the 2019 Pacific Games will be a boon to the services and tourism industry, as
well as the construction sector, where a number of projects have been earmarked including the airport
refurbishment, hotel renovation, construction of new resorts, as well as the resumption of projects
delayed in 2014/2015. Tonga will also likely to benefit from the promising potential of the seabed
mining industry in the next five years where exploration is under way for oil, and industrial metals such
as gold, silver and copper. In terms of inflation, the authorities expect inflation to gradually pick up in
FY2017, although inflation risks may rise in the near-term if the upturn in oil prices persists.

The authorities are in agreement with staff that the overall balance of risks to the economy is tilted to
the downside. Tonga is vulnerable to a multitude of risks due to its small geographical size and
location. On the external front, weak global growth especially for its main trading partners, may affect
foreign aid, remittances and trade volumes while an upturn in global oil and food prices could lead to
inflationary pressures. In addition, a major risk is natural disasters and volatile weather conditions, as
evidenced by the hurricane and drought already experienced in 2016.
Fiscal Policy
The authorities remain committed to fiscal discipline, lowering the fiscal deficit and building fiscal
buffers. The 2015/2016 budget theme was “Improved Government Delivery and Accountability”, to
support the Tonga Strategic Development Framework 2015-2025 (TSDF II), through promoting
enhanced good governance at all levels of the society. The authorities are guided by four key principles
in their fiscal strategy, namely (i) delivering good governance; (ii) building inclusive and sustainable
growth; (iii) alleviating poverty; and (iv) providing safe and better public infrastructure.
In the pursuit of fiscal prudence, the authorities recognize the need to improve the productivity and
quality of the civil service, with a review of the productivity, efficiency and effectiveness of line
ministries currently underway. The authorities are steadfast in their commitment to reform the civil
service and contain the public sector wage bill, including cost of living adjustments (COLA). Steps have
already been taken to eliminate half of the unfilled vacancies in the first three months of 2016, and the
outstanding vacancies will be gradually abolished. A Remuneration Authority has been established to
advise the government on the suitable level of COLA, and the authorities are also reviewing the
Employment Relations Bill to review the civil and private sector employees’ wages.
The authorities concur with staff on the need for improvements in public financial management and
the collection of government revenues. Measures have been adopted by the relevant departments to
improve the collection of taxes and arrears, and corporate planning and budgeting, where the tax
administration, working closely with PFTAC, is currently undergoing a structural review of its
procedures.
The authorities are implementing a prudent fiscal and borrowing strategy of not incurring new
concessional debt and will work closely with its development partners for budget support. With
Tonga's expected moderate risk level of debt distress rating over the medium term and the present
level of external debt, the authorities are committed to maintain external debt at a sustainable level
and explore ways to mitigate the costs and risks in the debt portfolio. The authorities acknowledge
staff’s views for Tonga to safeguard its fiscal and debt sustainability and accumulate fiscal buffers, and
gradually reduce its reliance on budget support. The Ministry of Finance and National Planning
(MoFNP) recently produced its inaugural Medium Term Debt Strategy (MTDS), outlining alternative
borrowing strategies which could help meet its debt objectives and achieve a more desired balanced
composition of public debt. The authorities will, over the coming years, execute the various identified
strategies.

Tonga will host the Pacific Games for the first time in 2019, and in preparation for the events,
investment in sporting and related infrastructure will be implemented over the next few years. The
authorities are confident in meeting the funding requirements for the Games and are presently
working with its development partners to secure grant financing. Additionally, the Foreign Exchange
Levy (Amendment) Act 2016 was passed on April 28, 2016 and will be effective from June 1, 2016, the
revenue of which will help contribute to finance the Games’ operational costs. A fee for airport
departures is also likely to be levied beginning July 2016, for the same purpose.
Monetary and Financial Stability
The authorities share staff assessment that the current accommodative monetary policy stance is
appropriate, and stand ready to take appropriate measures if there are signs of overheating. The
current inflation reference range of 6-8 percent range is consistent with the previous experience of
high inflation, given Tonga’s exposure to volatilities in global commodity and food prices, as it imports
most of its goods. Nonetheless, the authorities are keen to explore other monetary policy instruments
to enhance its monetary policy framework, including macroprudential tools and liquidity management,
and would welcome technical assistance from the Fund in these areas.
While staff assess that the current reserves cover of 6 months of imports is adequate, the authorities
view the level as high, given the opportunity cost of maintaining the reserves in comparison to the
various investment needs of the country. Nevertheless, the authorities acknowledge the need to
maintain the current level of reserves given the country’s ability to generate foreign currency receipts
is not so robust, as it currently relies heavily on government donor funds and remittances while
structural reforms required to boost the export and tourism sectors will take time to materialize. The
outlook on payments, on the other hand, includes higher imports for the Games and the payment of
principal loan amounts starting in 2019.
On financial stability, banks remain liquid, profitable and well-capitalized with risk-weighted capital
ratio (RWCR) at 37 percent, well above the statutory minimum requirement of 15 percent. NPLs are
currently around 10 percent, significantly lower than the 20 percent level in FY2009, and the authorities
will continue work on lowering NPLs further. Credit growth is strong but as rightly pointed out by staff,
this is based on a lower base and consistent with financial deepening. The authorities expect
construction work and private lending in preparation for the Pacific Games to support credit growth
in the next few years. Banks weighted lending rate stood at 7.94 percent in March 2016 compared to
deposit rates of 2.23 percent, and interest spreads are gradually narrowing, although the authorities
view the annual percentage rates as still being quite high. The authorities acknowledge the rising credit
growth trend and excess liquidity in the banking system. As the loans to deposit ratio for the banking
system of around 76 percent is below the benchmark of 80 percent, there is potentially still room for
growth in prudent lending. Nonetheless, the authorities will continue to be vigilant and diligent in their
surveillance and supervision, and will stand ready to address potential risks to preserve financial
stability.
NRBT is making great advances in strengthening its supervisory, regulatory and legal framework. The
authorities are presently working on the laws for the licensing and supervision of non-bank financial

institutions, including the microfinance institutions, money lenders, credit unions, as well as
amendments to the Foreign Exchange Control Act and the Financial Institutions Act, which will be
renamed as the Banking Act. Initiatives are also underway to improve financial access and financial
inclusion, where Tonga is committed to the Maputo Accord 2015 under the Alliance for Financial
Inclusion (AFI), which include developing and improving access to finance of the small to medium
enterprises (SMEs), women and youth, and developing policies and regulations for SME finance,
consumer protection and financial literacy. The authorities are also keen to highlight that the global
de-risking situation has had some noticeable impact on the local financial players, and will closely
monitor developments in correspondent banking relationships for the local banking and money
transfer operators.
Structural Reforms
Tonga is moving progressively to achieve the goals of the TSDF II and to achieve a long-term vision of
“A more progressive Tonga supporting a higher quality of life for all”. The authorities concur with staff
assessment on the calls to create a conducive and dynamic business environment to stimulate private
enterprises and attract further foreign direct investment. A host of existing and new legislations are
either under review or being considered, a number of which will facilitate the development of the
private sector. The authorities are also cognizant of the need to review the Land Act to address existing
gaps in the legislation and improve the usability of lands, for improving access to credit for example.
Separately, the first National Agriculture Sector Plan was also endorsed by the Cabinet in December
2015. This five-year plan identifies measures to boost and modernize the agriculture industry across
the board, where TOP36 million of government and Public Private Partnership (PPP) funds will be
invested, and will also involve collaborations with the World Bank, International Fund for Agricultural
Development (IFAD) and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
The decline in fuel prices over the past two years have benefitted the economy greatly. But being an
oil importer, Tonga is vulnerable to volatilities in global commodity prices. To address the nation’s
long-term energy requirements, the authorities launched the Energy Roadmap in 2010, establishing
an objective of achieving 50 percent renewable energy (RE) source by 2020. The vision involves the
participation of seven ministries as well as the private sector. Several important steps have been
undertaken, including developing legislations to enable RE projects and PPP schemes to move forward,
restructuring the petroleum sector to be more efficient, and working with development partners. There
is a good potential for greater use of renewable energy in Tonga including wind, ocean and solar
energy, where 5.5 mW of solar energy is required to achieve the 50 percent RE target.
As noted by the World Bank Risk Index, Tonga is one of the world’s most exposed to natural disaster
country. Apart from the provision for an emergency fund allocated in the annual budget, additional
efforts are required to mitigate the risks of natural disasters including climate proofing of
infrastructures and monitoring ocean and weather patterns. The authorities are very much aware of
the need to increase climate resiliency, and to that end, the Cabinet recently approved a climate change
policy which will look at data management, research and information, as well as capacity building in
this area. The authorities also wish to note that the existing arrangements with its close partners for

emergency assistance is a crucial element to address these challenges and is working with various
parties including the European Union and the World Bank on climate resilience projects.
The authorities agree with staff assessment on the need to increase capacity in its data provision, and
the importance of data quality and timeliness. In this respect, the authorities would like to express their
appreciation for the technical assistance received from the Fund and PFTAC, and look forward to
further technical assistance, especially on national accounts, external sectors and banking legislations.
Final Remarks
The Tongan authorities remain resolute in their commitment to implement broad-based structural
reforms, and build buffers to meet potential headwinds with a view to achieve their long-term
economic goals. The authorities will focus on the successful implementation of the policy
recommendations, while maintaining adherence to the principle of good governance.
The authorities wish to acknowledge the support and assistance provided by the Fund including
PFTAC, World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and other development partners, and look forward to
continuing their long-standing cooperation and partnership with the Fund.
