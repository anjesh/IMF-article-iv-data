STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 11, 2011

KEY ISSUES
Growth prospects: The economy is now back onto a strong growth trajectory led by a
rebound in diamond exports and supported by solid growth in the non-mining sector.
Growth is projected at 6.5 percent in 2011 and will ease to 5.5 percent next year.
Downside risks to growth primarily stem from weaker-than-expected global growth.
These risks are balanced by a potentially faster rebound in domestic private investment.
Addressing global food and fuel price shocks: Staff supports the Bank of Botswana’s
(BoB’s) neutral monetary policy stance, since at this stage, there appears to be no firm
evidence of generalized price pressures in the economy. The government’s policy of
providing a stable food basket to the needy shields them from the impact of inflation.
Balancing the budget and buttressing medium-term fiscal consolidation: The
authorities are targeting a balanced budget by FY2012/13 centered on a sharp
reduction in spending (as a share of GDP) and prioritization of government outlays. A
credible reduction of the wage bill would require both a prudent wage policy and
reform of the civil service as a leaner and more effective entity. Broadening the tax base
should be an integral pillar of the medium-term fiscal consolidation process.
Strengthening the public sector institutional framework: Staff urges the authorities
to give greater prominence to the non-mineral primary balance in the formulation of
fiscal policy. Staff supports the ongoing efforts to make fully operational the BoB’s
newly established financial stability unit and welcomes the progress made on
strengthening the regulatory framework for non-bank financial institutions.
Improving the quality of growth: Despite its middle-income status, Botswana faces
significant development challenges including on sustaining growth, diversifying its
sources, reducing unemployment and eradicating poverty. The authorities see potential
in diversifying within the mineral sector, beyond diamonds, and toward the services
sector. The government is taking measures to address the skills mismatch problem in
the labor market to tackle the high unemployment rate. Perhaps of equal importance,
is the government’s focus on inclusive growth policies to eradicate poverty.

balanced by potentially faster recovery in

non-diamond mineral sectors.

Over the medium term, output

by sectors other than diamonds. With
diamond production stabilizing at below pre-

lower imports of energy and machinery and
equipment due to the completion of existing
projects and the planned downsizing of the
government’s public investment program. A
recovery of SACU revenues should also

exchange rate level as broadly in line with
macroeconomic fundamentals (Appendix I).

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
With the recovery gaining strength, staff and the authorities agreed that the priorities are to respond
appropriately to global food and fuel price shocks, achieve a balanced budget, strengthen the public
sector institutional framework and improve the quality of growth. Over the years, the Fund has
commended the authorities for prudent macroeconomic management, supported by strong institutions
and good governance. As noted in the 2010 Article IV consultation report such good policies put
Botswana in a position of considerable strength as it entered the global financial crisis in 2008-09.

A. Policy Theme 1: Addressing Global Food and Fuel Price Shocks

11.

The BoB’s bank rate was lowered by

50 basis points to 9.5 percent in December
2010 and has been kept at that level since
then. Core inflation (excluding energy, food,
and other administered prices), which accounts
for about 60 percent of the CPI basket, has not
shown any rapid increase in recent months
and there is some slack in the non-mining
economy, limiting the feeding of energy and
food price increases into core inflation. Credit
growth also remains subdued and moreover,
there are no discernible pressures on
international reserves. Staff’s analysis shows

response, the government, respecting the
current need for austerity, reached a
preliminary agreement with the public unions
for a 3 percent wage increase effective in
September that would add only
0.2 percentage points to the wage bill.

cost effectiveness (“value-for-money”) and the
need to ensure that only high-quality projects

warranting a thorough assessment of pockets

The government is committed to

balancing the budget in FY2012/13. They
agreed that spending levels were
unsustainably high and indicated that
substantial reductions in expenditures during
the next two years would be the basis for
achieving a balanced budget by FY2012/13.
Specifically, the FY2011/12 budget documents
noted that spending as a share of GDP would
be reduced from its current level of just under
40 percent of GDP to just about 30 percent by
FY2014/15. The public investment program,
which expanded during 2008–10, should revert
to more normal pre-crisis levels as the bigticket infrastructure projects are completed,
with the emphasis on maintenance of existing
infrastructure projects rather than initiating
new projects.

C. Policy Theme 3: Strengthening the Public Sector Institutional Framework
Background
26.

Currently the authorities’ fiscal

policy framework focuses on a balanced
budget rule and a targeted decline in
spending as a share of GDP. Unlike the nonmining fiscal balance, the overall fiscal balance
may not be a reliable indicator of (i) the impact
of fiscal policy on domestic demand, or (ii) the
government’s adjustment effort. The fiscal rule
that limits government expenditures in percent
of GDP tends to give rise to unintended
procyclicality since when the price of
diamonds increases, GDP also increases
allowing an increase in spending.

27.

Maintaining a strong supervisory

framework for the financial sector is a key
priority for the authorities. The banking
sector is sound, with banks remaining vigilant
over asset quality and reserves. Although
banks are heavily exposed to households
whose real incomes have declined in recent
years, banks remained profitable, capital levels
are significantly in excess of regulatory
requirements, and non-performing loans
remain low. The BoB is working towards
making its financial stability unit fully
operational. The mission welcomed the
progress made by the Nonbank Financial
Institutions Regulatory Authority (NBFIRA) in
strengthening the regulatory and supervisory
framework for non-bank financial institutions

from a compliance-based approach to a riskbased system. A new Insurance and Pension
Funds Act, proposing a gradual rebalancing of
the insurance companies’ and pension funds’
portfolios, is tentatively planned for discussion
by parliament in November 2011.
Staff Recommendations
As in previous consultations, staff

recommended the strengthening of the
government’s fiscal framework by giving
greater prominence to the non-mineral
primary balance (NMPB) in the formulation
of fiscal policy. Staff stressed that while the
authorities should continue monitoring their
current fiscal indicators, adding the NMPB to
their fiscal rules would provide a clearer
picture of the underlying fiscal stance and
long-term fiscal sustainability. Indeed, in
countries such as Norway, budget documents
and fiscal policy discussions focus mainly on
the non-oil balance and its impact on the
domestic economy.

they recognize the need for a new fiscal
rule although care needs to be taken in
transitioning from the current fiscal rule
that includes mineral revenues to a more
constrained rule that excludes mineral
revenues. They noted that the new fiscal rule
should take a long-term view of revenues,
especially mineral revenues which are likely to
decline in the decades following NDP10. Also,
the rule should denominate expenditures on
the basis of share of non-mineral GDP to avoid
ramping up expenditure during mineral
revenue booms. Implementation of the exit
policy for this new fiscal rule should be
carefully managed, as indicated by the recent
national public sector union strike. The
sustainable budget index rule in NDP10
reserves mineral revenues for capital spending,
leaving only non-mineral revenues to finance
recurrent spending.
Sectoral Composition of Commercial Bank

Staff highlighted areas requiring

further monitoring on banking system
surveillance. Bank prudential regulation
should keep pace with financial innovation
particularly the introduction of new financial
products through mobile banking. Staff also
noted that close monitoring of banks’
exposure to mortgage loans is essential, as
some banks plan to expand such secured
lending over time.

The authorities emphasized that

Appendix I. Exchange Rate Assessment1
Different measures of exchange rate assessment provide evidence of some degree of overvaluation,
although the misalignment is not in excess of 10 percent. Taking into account the confidence bands
surrounding the various estimates, it is fair to conclude that by and large the real effective exchange
rate (REER) is broadly in line with macroeconomic fundamentals from a medium-term perspective.

SDR and South African rand. The regime is implemented through continuous adjustment of the trade-weighted
nominal effective exchange rate of the pula at a rate of crawl based on the differential between Botswana’s inflation
objective and the forecast inflation of trading partner countries. The rate of crawl is thus determined using a forwardlooking approach and is revised on a regular basis. In this forward-looking scheme, the authorities periodically
determine the rate of crawl for the subsequent period, such as the next 6 or 12 months. Botswana maintains an
exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfer for current international transactions.

government wealth (including mineral wealth)
across generations. This challenge is met by
targeting a fiscal policy that preserves the
government wealth. The standard permanent

difference between actual and the hypothetical
annuitized mineral revenues.

The numerical exercises in the

appendix compare the staff’s medium-term
fiscal projections (which are consistent with
the government’s fiscal framework) against
the fiscal benchmarks derived from the PIH
approach. The staff projections assume the

income hypothesis (PIH) argues that the
preservation of wealth would require that
spending in each period be limited to the
permanent income or the implicit return on
government wealth. To compute this
“permanent” income, the projected stream of
mineral revenues is transformed into a
hypothetical annuity with the same net present
value as the revenues. The annuity reflects the
permanent portion of the country’s mineral
wealth. The benchmark amount of spending



The nominal US dollar price of diamonds is
adjusted annually by the rate of change in
the CPI of the advanced economies, so it
stays constant in real terms. The dollar price
is converted to pula using the period



The real return on mineral wealth is 4.2

The Pula Fund
The Pula Fund was originally established in November 1993 under the Bank of Botswana Act (1975).
It was re-established in its current form under the Bank of Botswana Act (1996) to provide greater
flexibility in the management of international reserves, and greater certainty in the forecasting of
annual “dividend” payments to the government from the BoB. The Act came into operation on
January 1, 1997.
Under the Act, Botswana’s international reserves are split into two portfolios: (i) the Liquidity
Portfolio, to provide the foreign exchange needed for normal day to day international transactions;
and (ii) the Pula Fund, to be invested in long-term assets to achieve higher returns. The Pula Fund,
managed by the BoB, is composed of the Government Investment Account (GIA), which reflects both
savings from accumulated fiscal surpluses and inflows of additional of government debt, together
with the broader accumulation of national savings in excess of the BoB’s target for liquid reserves.
This target is based on six months of import cover, and when import cover deviates from this level
by more than three months in either direction resources are transferred, as appropriate, into or out
of the liquidity portfolio. Pula Fund assets are invested in long-term instruments overseas across a
range of major currencies and in a mixture of long-term fixed income securities and equities. The
Act charges the BoB with managing and determining investment policy of, and the payment of
dividends accruing from, the Pula Fund, in consultation with the Minister of Finance and
Development Planning. Together with the Liquidity Portfolio, the Pula Fund has been held with a
global custodian since 1993.
While the Act provides a legal framework for the establishment, management, and auditing of the
Fund, it does not specify the objective of the Fund in the context of overall fiscal policy and rules on
the operation of the Pula Fund, particularly concerning payments into the Fund, withdrawals from it,
and their uses. However, since its inception it has been broadly understood that as well as serving as
a revenue stabilization fund, the Pula Fund is a fund for future generations that provides a holding
ground for subsequent domestic investment when productive opportunities for such investment are
identified.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: On November 30, 2010, the government of Botswana gazetted the commencement of
the Statistics Act of 2009. Under the Act, the Central Statistics Office (CSO), which had been a
department of the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning, was transformed into Statistics
Botswana (SB), responsible for the country’s statistical system. SB will operate independently of the
Ministry of Finance and Development Planning, with its own board of Directors.
Macroeconomic data are adequate for surveillance, but some shortcomings exist in terms of
accuracy and reliability of the source data and the statistical techniques used in the compilation of
national accounts, government finance, and balance of payments statistics. The timeliness of the
central bank survey and detailed government expenditure data by economic classification needs to
be increased to better support economic analysis and prepare Botswana for an eventual
subscription to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). Further improvements would
include dissemination of readily available information on monthly production of diamonds and
quarterly aggregate financial soundness indicators.
The authorities are working on a number of fronts to improve data quality and dissemination: (i)
source data and methodologies are being reviewed for those data with obvious estimation
problems/gaps, (ii) stronger collaboration is being sought among source data producers to secure
consistency and reconcile discrepancies across data sets; (iii) the production of leading economic
indicators is currently underway; and (iv) staff shortages are being addressed within budget
constraints. A national population census is scheduled to begin the current fiscal year.
National Accounts: National accounts estimation has not kept pace with changes to the structure
of the economy and needs to be rebased (the current base year is 1993/94). The Household
Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) (2002/03) and Labor Force Survey (2005/06) are out of date.
More frequent surveys would support a more robust estimation of private consumption and a
better understanding of poverty and unemployment.
Price Statistics: The official monthly consumer price index (CPI) is available on a timely basis in the
SB’s website. The index is comprehensive and provides breakdowns between urban and rural price
data, and between prices of tradable (domestic and imported) and nontradable goods and
services. Estimates from an outdated HIES are currently used for the weights of market expenditure
for goods and services. Compilation challenges include undertaking a new HIES (ongoing) and the
eventual inclusion of owner-occupied housing price data in the CPI. Compilation of producer or
wholesale prices has been discontinued.
Government Finance Statistics: The concepts and definitions used in compiling government
finance statistics generally follow the guidelines of the IMF’s 1986 Government Finance Statistics
Manual (GFSM 1986) but cover only budgetary central government activities. No fiscal statistics are
compiled for extra budgetary institutions, consolidated central government, or consolidated
general government. No decision has been made by the authorities on adopting a “migration
path” to the GFSM 2001 methodology, although the authorities are working with the Fund
Statistics Department (STA) toward that endeavor. Recurrent and development expenditure data
are published in an aggregate form. Development spending comprises a mixture of current and
capital spending.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 7

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX BOTSWANA

Monetary and Financial Statistics: Compilation practices are consistent with the Fund’s Monetary
and Financial Statistics Manual. The central bank survey is currently available with a lag of usually
about three months, which is well short of the two-week period recommended in the SDDS. STA’s
recommendation is to make preliminary data available with clear identification of data status. The
authorities prefer a more cautious approach to data dissemination to avoid reputation damage if
the data require revisions. The BoB is seeking to expand the coverage of financial statistics to
include the operations of nonbank financial intermediaries (NBFI), such as pension funds, insurance
companies, and other financial corporations, such as unit trusts, finance companies, and financial
auxiliaries. STA’s recommendation is to focus on data collection in a handful of large institutions
within each NBFI category.
Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Statistics: Annual and quarterly
balance of payments data are published in the Botswana Financial Statistics (BF) and the BoB’s
Annual Report. Preliminary data are generally disseminated within two months of the end of the
reporting period, while revised (final) data are available after nine months. The concepts, structure,
and definitions of the balance of payments statistics follow the fifth edition of the Balance of
Payments Statistics Manual (BPM5). Source data are adequate, but the International Transaction
Reporting System (ITRS) data—as opposed to alternative survey data on services and transfer
items in the current account—has become unreliable. Data compilation, estimation, and
adjustments mostly employ sound techniques, but the methods used for estimating missing data
(for example, unrecorded trade), f.o.b. /c.i.f. adjustment factors to import values, and flows from
stock data are inadequate. Discrepancies exist in national accounts data concerning: (i) the
valuation of diamond exports and (ii) imports, exports, and payments related to settlements within
the Southern African Customs Union (SACU). Large errors and omissions in the 2008–2010 balance
of payments statistics have complicated the assessment of external sustainability.
The BoB conducts an annual survey of Botswana’s investment and international investment
position (IIP). A quarterly IIP survey is also produced for internal use with data from the ITRS.
External Debt: Public external debt data are of good quality and but timeliness could be improved
(the latest published data is for March 2009).
II. Data Standards and Quality
Botswana has participated in the GDDS since late 2002. A Data ROSC and its updates were
published in April 2002, March 2004, and April 2007, respectively.
III. Reporting to STA
Monetary data are reported for publication in International Financial Statistics using Standardized
Report Forms and Botswana reports annual balance of payments and IIP data to STA. No
government financial statistics are currently reported for publication in the Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August 2, 2011

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
Botswana
On July 29, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Botswana.1
Background
Botswana’s economy staged an impressive recovery during the past year. Since the second
quarter of 2010, the pace of economic growth has been one of the strongest among middleincome countries. The recovery was led by the diamond sector which was propelled by rapidly
rising prices for rough diamonds in international markets. The non-mining sector growth has
also been solid, notwithstanding the deceleration of public expenditure growth.
Despite the recovery, underlying inflation pressures remain contained. Consumer price inflation
(year-on-year) rose from about 7 percent at end-2010 to 8.3 percent as of May 2011, but driven
almost exclusively by cost-push factors related to food and fuel price shocks and the impact of
increases in administered tariffs and fees on the provision of electricity and health services.
Core inflation (excluding food, fuel and administered prices) has not shown a trend increase in
the last few months.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2

The strong economic recovery has helped stabilize financial market conditions. Credit growth to
households has picked up somewhat but is still well below pre-crisis levels. Arrears on bank
lending, which rose significantly during 2009, stabilized during 2010 and by September 2010
had fallen somewhat due to lower levels of non-performing loans to businesses. Banking sector
profitability should improve over time as banks are now seeking efficiencies in cost-to-income
ratios and net interest margins, rather than in growing assets and liabilities.
The fiscal position has improved. The estimated fiscal outturn in FY2010/11 was better than
expected with a deficit close to 10 percent of GDP, compared to the original budget target of 12
percent of GDP. The non-mineral primary deficit declined from about 31 percent of non-mineral
GDP in 2009/10 to 27 percent in FY2010/11. The adjustment reflects a sharp decline in the
growth of overall government spending which more than compensated for reduced customs
revenues (as net repayments to the Southern Africa Customs Union-SACU Common Revenue
Pool were made in 2010) and slow growth of income taxes from the non-mineral economy.
Spending cuts were centered in central government transfers to other public bodies and in
development spending. The impact of the April 2010 increase in value-added tax (VAT) rates
(from 10 to 12 percent) did not yield significant tax revenues.
The overall external position has also strengthened. Annual export growth (in dollar terms) was
about 35 percent in 2010. Strong export growth led to a considerable narrowing of the trade
deficit in 2010. Beyond diamonds, other minerals such as copper and nickel have benefitted
from a strong surge in international prices. Outside mining, beef exports also rose in 2010, while
the weakest performer continues to be the textile sector. The real effective exchange rate
remained broadly unchanged over the last 12 months.
The medium-term outlook is for a recovery to be sustained, while inflation remains within the
central bank’s target band of 3 to 6 percent in the second half of 2012. Output growth is
projected to average about 5.5 percent with an important contribution by sectors other than
diamonds. The external current account balance is set to improve gradually. This reflects robust
exports receipts from diamonds and other minerals, together with lower imports of energy and
machinery and equipment due to the completion of existing projects and the planned
downsizing of the government’s public investment program. A recovery of SACU revenues
should also support an improved current account balance over the medium-term.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their prudent macroeconomic management
and welcomed Botswana’s strong economic recovery. Looking ahead, the key policy challenges
are to reduce the size of government, strengthen the public sector institutional framework,
diversify the economy and improve the quality of growth.
Directors broadly supported the authorities’ neutral monetary policy stance given that at present
there appears to be no concrete evidence of generalized price pressures in the domestic

3
economy. However, if high global food and commodity prices begin to translate into
economy-wide price pressures, the authorities should tighten the policy stance.
Directors agreed on the need for fiscal consolidation. They encouraged the authorities to move
decisively on their fiscal plan to achieve a balanced budget by FY2012/13, largely centered on
prioritizing and reducing government spending. It will be important to ensure that only high
quality public investment projects are undertaken and that the growth of the wage bill and the
large transfers on tertiary education are appropriately contained. Directors welcomed recent
measures to reform the corporate income tax system, and called for additional efforts to
increase the effective tax rate on the VAT through rationalizing tax exemptions and incentives
and to broaden the tax base.
Directors saw merit in a new fiscal rule which focuses on a greater role of the non-mineral
primary balance as a share of non-mineral GDP in the formulation of fiscal policy. Such a fiscal
rule would help develop a more robust medium-term fiscal sustainability plan.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to make fully operational the newly established
financial stability unit at the Bank of Botswana, and strengthen the regulatory and supervisory
framework for non-bank financial institutions.
Directors noted that Botswana faces the challenge of improving the quality of growth. They
commended the authorities for their increased focus on poverty reduction and policy initiatives
to enhance economic diversification and foster more inclusive growth. In particular, they
supported measures to address skills mismatches in the labor market to tackle the high rate of
unemployment. Directors noted that successful economic diversification will likely demand
sizeable foreign direct investment in the non-mineral sector, which will require sustained efforts
to improve the business environment, without impairing the tax base.

Statement by Mr. Majoro on Botswana
July 29, 2011
Botswana has made significant progress in developing its economy and building the
necessary buffers. Good macroeconomic policy framework and management have aided the
country in achieving its developmental goals. Botswana has been successful in implementing
sound fiscal and monetary policies over the years and as a result, the country was better
positioned to weather the global crisis. In spite of these achievements, challenges remain,
which include high unemployment, poverty and HIV/AIDS. Albeit these challenges, the
authorities have successfully maintained a low inflation environment, high gross official
reserves and low debt ratios.
Economic Developments
The modest resurgence in global demand augured well for growth in 2010 with economic
activity improving in both the mining and non-mining sectors. The economy is estimated to
have grown by 7.2 percent in real terms. The mining sector grew by 7 percent supported by a
recovery in the production of diamonds, nickel and copper. At the same time, construction,
trade and finance and business services accounted to a large extent for the higher growth in
non-mining output. Prospects for growth in the medium term remain positive with economic
growth projection of 6.8 percent in 2011, underpinned by sustained recovery in emerging
markets and a gradual recovery in the advanced economies. On the downside, the lingering
effects of the global economic crisis and rising food and fuel prices will exert downward
pressures on economic activity.
Inflationary pressures remained subdued in 2010 despite a rebounding economy and
resurging global commodity prices. On average, headline inflation eased from the 2009 rate
of 8.2 percent to 6.9 percent in 2010. Accounting for inflation were mostly increases in VAT
from 10 to 12 percent and administered prices including electricity tariffs, fuel prices and
public transport fares. Though inflation was above the medium term objective of 3-6 percent,
it remained in single digits and is projected to remain subdued in 2011.
The balance of payments position improved from the 2009 position boosted by a recovery in
mineral exports. Diamond production is expected to increase further in 2011 and 2012 as the
mines reach full production. Additionally, higher mineral prices will bode well for export
receipts. Botswana successfully accumulated significant reserves over the years; a
consequence of sustained balance of payments surpluses, prudent fiscal management and
investment guidelines. The authorities remain committed to a practical build up of reserves in
order to replenish the buffers that were reduced during the global crisis. Foreign exchange
reserves are still high by international standards at 17 months of import cover.
Fiscal Policy Issues
The global economic crisis dampened government revenues resulting in a wider government
deficit. The authorities however endeavored to realign spending with available revenue by

2
prioritizing expenditures and reducing transfers to other public bodies while protecting
vulnerable groups. This coupled with a robust recovery in the diamond market resulted in a
much improved outturn. The authorities aim to reduce the deficit to achieve a balanced
budget by 2012/13. The reduction of the budget deficit will involve prioritizing and
streamlining spending to ensure optimal use of resources and improving revenue. These will
include outsourcing, merging of some parastatals, and realigning the development budget to
focus on high return projects. Furthermore, the authorities intend to improve revenue
collection, particularly tax revenue, by raising the effective tax rate to statutory level while
improving tax administration. This will be preceded by a thorough analysis of the causes of
the poor tax performance. The authorities have also put in place a Public Finance
Management Reform Program that will improve accountability, transparency and
management of the public spending.
Historically Botswana has implemented prudent macroeconomic policies which have
augured well for economic growth. However the authorities are not oblivious of the existing
and prospective economic and social challenges faced by the country which include high
unemployment and poverty. In addition, the economy remains highly reliant on the mining
sector in general and diamond mining in particular. Therefore the need to diversify the
economy, reduce unemployment and poverty remains a key priority for the authorities. In
this regard, the authorities are in agreement with staff and are determined to ensure that the
fiscal spending is in line with these objectives. The authorities believe that focus on fiscal
sustainability going forward will enhance their ability to implement a budget that is pro poor,
strengthens financial stability and promotes inclusive growth. While staff advised on the
need for a tighter fiscal rule which excludes mining revenues, my authorities recognize that a
new fiscal rule may be necessary but believe that care should be exercised in determining the
rule and in managing the transition. The authorities continue to rely on the sustainable budget
index rule which sets aside mineral revenues for capital spending while non-mineral revenues
finance recurrent spending.
Debt Management
Botswana has successfully maintained relatively low debt levels over the years, mainly a
consequence of high diamond revenues and prudent expenditure policies. In addition,
Botswana has always had legislated debt limits which have assisted in maintaining the debt at
low levels. To facilitate proficiency in debt management, the authorities are putting in place a
debt management strategy that is designed to realize an efficient financing mix without
violating the legislated limits. The internal debt ratio is estimated at 6.4 percent of GDP
while the external debt ratio is estimated at 19.1 percent of GDP.
Monetary and Financial Issues
Monetary policy was broadly accommodative in 2010 in light of the benign external
inflationary pressures, below trend economic performance and subdued demand pressure.
The Bank Rate was maintained at 10 percent for most of 2010 and reduced by 50 basis points
in December 2010. To reduce excess liquidity, the authorities raised the primary reserve
requirement (PRR) for commercial banks from 6.5 percent to 10 percent of total Pula

3
deposits held at commercial banks. However, private sector credit was not affected as this
only mopped up excess funds in the system.
The authorities remain mindful that high inflation erodes purchasing power of income and
financial savings hence monetary policy continued to focus on price stability through
containing inflation using the medium term objective range of 3-6 percent. A forecasting
framework is in place to monitor inflation developments and inform the decision making
with the aim of achieving a low and sustainable level of inflation. The challenge for
monetary policy in the medium term is to ensure low inflation expectations given the external
developments in global food and fuel prices.
The Banking system was cushioned from the first round effects of the financial crisis and
remained adequately capitalized, liquid and profitable. Though non performing loans edged
up slightly in 2010, they remain low. The authorities continue to monitor the developments in
the banking system. The focus for the Bank of Botswana is to enhance supervision and
oversight of the financial system with particular emphasis on the nonbank financial sector.
Growth Policy Issues
The latest plan, the tenth National Development Plan NDP 10 outlines in detail the country’s
development agenda with the overall objective to improve the quality of life for the Batswana
people through reduction of poverty. Diversification of the economy which has been made
urgent by the recent global economic crisis is one of the paramount pillars that will anchor
implementation of the authorities’ agenda. The authorities acknowledge that although
previous plans had emphasized diversification of the economy, limited success has been
achieved. The strategic policy in NDP 10 is therefore to accelerate diversification of the
economy with the aim to reduce vulnerability to shocks, dependency on government and
diamonds and enhance private sector-led growth. In this regard, the authorities are prepared
to take every necessary measure to ensure that the strategy is successful. This will include
acceleration of a more inclusive growth, addressing the skills mismatch in the labor market
and improving the quality of infrastructure development and maintenance. Spending on
education and infrastructure will continue to increase albeit at a lower rate. Accordingly, we
call on the IMF and World Bank to support the authorities in achieving the objectives of the
NDP 10 through providing more concrete ideas on fostering broad based growth and
diversification of the economy.
In conclusion, I wish to reiterate the authorities’ commitment to prudent macroeconomic
management that has supported stability and growth in the past. My authorities are
appreciative of the Fund’s continued support and advice.
