STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
March 10, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Background: Romania has in large part reduced internal and external imbalances
through sound macroeconomic policies. However, income convergence with the EU has
been slow and weak public infrastructure has emerged as a bottleneck for faster
growth. At the same time, Romania remains vulnerable to external shocks and the
repair of balance sheets is not yet complete.
Policy recommendations: Going forward, sustainable macroeconomic policies need to
be combined with measures that boost the efficiency of public spending, reinvigorate
delayed state-owned enterprise (SOE) reforms, and resolve crisis legacies in the financial
sector.


Fiscal policy. Maintain the fiscal adjustment achievements, put public debt on a
firm downward path, ensure provision of higher quality public infrastructure, and
improve revenue administration and public expenditure management including
through higher absorption of EU funds.



Monetary policy. Keep the easing bias as inflation has fallen below the target band
and support a private credit rebound. Improve the policy framework by gradually
moving to full-fledged inflation targeting.



Financial sector. Maintain the intense watch on the banking system focused on
asset quality and non-performing loans reduction, further strengthen non-bank
supervision, develop capital markets, and create effective insolvency frameworks.



Structural reforms. Improve financial performance and generate resources for
investment of SOEs by implementing good governance principles, restructuring and
increased private ownership; further deregulate energy markets.

Outlook and risks: Staff expects sustained growth supported by strong domestic
demand. Better EU funds absorption could boost the growth potential by about
½ percent annually. However, increased volatility in the external environment and
failure to implement a much needed infrastructure upgrade present downside risks.

BACKGROUND
1.
Romania has in large part reduced internal and external imbalances. This has been
achieved through impressive fiscal consolidation and prudent monetary and financial policies,
broadly in line with the 2012 Article IV recommendations (Annex I) and the 2011 and 2013
precautionary Stand-By Arrangements (SBA). However, a negative output gap persists, inflation is
well below target and income convergence with the EU has been slow. Weak infrastructure has
emerged as a bottleneck for a higher growth trajectory, reflecting ineffective public spending and
weak medium-term planning, delayed EU funds absorption and slow SOE reforms. At the same time,
Romania remains vulnerable to global and euro area shocks, given its relatively high level of external
debt. While fiscal and foreign exchange reserves provide a buffer and non-performing loans were
reduced substantially, private balance sheets need to be strengthened further.
2.
The reform momentum, however, has slowed amid elevated political uncertainty.
General elections in December 2012 resulted in a period of political stability that lasted until
February 2014 when the ruling social democratic-liberal alliance broke down. Since then, two new
cabinets were formed with changes in key economic ministries that have complicated policy
continuity. The surprising win by the centre-right President Iohannis in the December presidential
elections has raised near-term political uncertainty as the opposition is striving to form a new
government through changing the parliamentary majority. The political uncertainty has affected the
implementation of structural reforms, in particular as regards SOEs and gas price deregulation,
which has delayed the completion of the third review under the SBA (scheduled originally for
June 2014). Nonetheless, some progress has been made toward tackling corruption as evidenced by
the 2015 Correction and Verification Mechanism for Romania that pointed out progress in a number
of governance areas.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Following robust growth in 2013–14, Romania’s GDP almost returned to its pre-crisis
level; however, a sizable output gap remains. Robust export growth was the initial driver of
economic recovery while domestic demand remained

labor market conditions improved and the unemployment
rate declined to 6.8 percent in 2014. Youth unemployment remained elevated at 23.3 percent in
2014Q3, about 6 percentage points above the pre-crisis level.

Inflation has decelerated substantially over the past two years. Annual headline inflation
entered the central bank’s new target range of 2.5 percent (±1 percent) in September 2013 and has
subsequently fallen below the lower bound of the target band for most of 2014 (Figure 4). Headline
average inflation was at a record low 1.1 percent in 2014, with core inflation at 0.3 percent.1 In
January 2015, inflation dropped to 0.4 percent. The fall in inflation reflects both domestic and
external factors, including a reduction in VAT on flour and bakery products, low food prices, and a
decline in oil prices. Furthermore, a persistent output gap and even slower recovery of domestic
demand to its trend level (absorption gap), have also contributed to low inflation.

5.
Romania has considerably reduced fiscal imbalances. Over the past six years, it relied
primarily on expenditure cuts to bring the fiscal deficit to 1.9 percent of GDP in 2014, a 7 percentage
point reduction in structural terms (Figure 5). However, both revenues and expenditures underperformed relative to the initial 2014 budget, with almost all of the deficit spending occurring in
December. Under-execution of the capital budget and current expenditures (until December)
allowed for accelerated payment of obligations related to court-ordered wage claims and restitution
as well as the clearance of most government arrears.

The current account deficit has narrowed significantly. At ½ percent of GDP, the deficit
was the smallest in ten years, a sharp drop from almost 13½ percent of GDP in 2007 (Figure 2).
While imports of goods and services continued to rise on the back of the domestic demand
recovery, exports grew at an even faster pace supported by continued expansion in sales of
machinery and transport equipment. Staff’s analysis indicates that domestic push factors, particularly
improvement in Romania’s competitiveness, are main contributors to the strong export growth (see
Selected Issues paper “Export Performance and External Competitiveness”). The income balance, on
the other hand, deteriorated on account of increases in profit repatriation and interest payments. On
the financing side, public sector capital inflows remained strong with a continued increase in EU
fund absorptions. In contrast, private sector flows remained anemic as Europe-wide deleveraging
continued to weigh on FDI, and prompted further intensification of capital outflows.

conditions have enabled the central bank to sustain
international reserves at €34.3 billion as of end-January 2015, while making substantial repayments
to the IMF.
8.
Bank credit growth has turned negative in early 2013. The credit–to-GDP ratio, which
rapidly accelerated during the pre-crisis period, is now converging to a trend that is consistent with
lower but likely sustainable credit growth. Banks are gradually changing their funding structure
towards lei as foreign parent banks continue withdrawing funds from the system, though the pace
has slowed. The banking system’s solvency and liquidity position remain appropriate, although
additional provisioning requirements have weighed on banks profitability (Figures 6 and 8).

Romania remains one of the poorest members of the EU. Despite a slight decline since
2008, Romania has the second highest at-risk-of-poverty or social exclusion rate in 2013, at
40.4 percent, almost twice as much as the EU average. However, the Gini coefficient in 2012 was
below its pre-crisis level, signaling a progressivity of fiscal policy, and the effort to protect the lowest
income groups from the fiscal consolidation (IMF, 2014, Fiscal Policy and Income Equality).
Supported by the World Bank, some means-tested benefits programs have become better targeted
but the envisaged merger of three programs has been delayed. Funding remains relatively tight for
means-tested programs when compared to non-means-tested ones.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
10.
Staff’s baseline scenario projects sustained growth and continued rebalancing towards
domestic demand.


Growth is projected at 2.7 percent in 2015 and 2.9 percent in 2016. Private consumption is
expected to be the main driver, supported by improving consumer confidence, low oil prices,
strong real wage growth, and record low interest rates. Investment is set to gradually recover
due to greater absorption of EU funds. Potential growth is estimated to reach about 3 percent
over the medium term, as higher EU funds absorption, a recovery in credit growth, and
improvements in the quality of infrastructure investment through institutional reforms reduce
bottlenecks to growth.



Inflation is projected to remain low in 2015, reaching an annual average of about 1 percent.
Low imported inflation and a persistent negative output gap will likely keep inflation below
target for most of 2015, before returning to the target range toward the end of the year. In the
medium term, inflation is expected to stay broadly within the target range, as expectations
become better anchored.



External position. The current account deficit is projected to widen to around 1 percent of GDP
in 2015, as domestic demand continues to recover. Over the medium term, staff expects the
current account deficit to rise to about 3–3½ percent of GDP, in line with the current account
norm for emerging market economies. Capital inflows are expected to pick up only gradually in
2015. While higher EU fund absorptions will support public sector inflows, net capital flows into
the private sector are likely to remain low amid a subdued outlook in the euro area.

11.
Addressing the infrastructure gap is critical for the medium-term growth outlook.
Despite a history of above EU average capital spending (5 percent of GDP over the past decade),
Romania’s infrastructure density is low and its quality is perceived to be the lowest in the EU,
reflecting inefficiencies and lack of medium-term planning (Box 1; see also Selected Issues paper
“Benefits of Boosting Quality Public Infrastructure Spending in Romania”). The mission estimates
that ratcheting up EU funds absorption substantially (0.7 percent of GDP annually), if it leads to a
greater density and higher quality of infrastructure, could boost the growth potential by about
½ percentage point annually over the medium term.

12.
Risks to the outlook, particularly from the external environment, are tilted to the
downside (Annex II). Renewed volatility in the global financial market or the euro area related to
Greece could adversely impact portfolio flows and lead to deposit outflows. Moreover, a protracted
period of slow growth and low inflation in the euro area could put strains on the Romanian
economy. Direct economic and financial implications from geopolitical risks should be contained as
trade and financial exposures to Ukraine and Russia are moderate and energy dependency is low.
Large fiscal buffers, a flexible exchange rate, and an adequate level of international reserves could
provide insurance in the event of an external shock. Domestically, continued underperformance of
EU funds absorption and absence of structural reforms would delay a much needed infrastructure
upgrade.
13.
Authorities’ views. The authorities broadly shared staff’s assessment for 2015 but see risks
as broadly balanced, given upside potential from agricultural output and EU funds absorption.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Fiscal Policy: Budgeting and Building Institutions for the Future
14.
Sound fiscal policy has lowered vulnerabilities. Public debt, after tripling to 40 percent of
GDP during 2007–14, is projected to decline gradually starting this year under unchanged policies,
supported by solid debt management and falling gross financing needs. This would provide some
room to absorb future shocks, in particular underperformance of real GDP growth or the realization
of banking sector contingent liabilities (Annex III). Liquidity buffers are large, amounting to nearly
5 percent of GDP. They include foreign exchange (FX) holdings equivalent to four months of total
gross financing needs and a year of FX financing needs. Going forward, the authorities plan to
gradually reduce the FX buffer taking into consideration overall global financial market conditions
and further progress in deepening government securities markets.

Box 1. Benefits of Boosting Quality Public Infrastructure Spending in Romania
Romania’s high capital spending has been relatively inefficient in the past. Rail and road infrastructure
is particularly deficient. A key factor for this performance is the lack of a robust framework and capacity for
developing, vetting, prioritizing, and executing public-investment projects.

Staff simulations indicate that increased and more efficient infrastructure spending could boost
growth. An immediate boost to efficiency could come from a reallocation of budget resources toward EUfunded projects, which are subject to a more stringent project management process than those funded
solely from the state budget. Staff econometric analysis and simulations indicate that the GDP growth rate
would be higher by ½ percentage point over the medium term, if available EU-funds were fully utilized.

The simulation results are highly dependent on reforms to improve the quality and management of
national projects and absorption of EU-funded projects. Despite some reforms under the current SBA,
domestic governance and capacity issues continue to undermine absorption of EU-funds. Initial efforts to
improve the prioritization of significant projects should be advanced by better aligning the prioritization
calendar with the budget calendar in order to ensure that the prioritization process informs budget
preparation. In addition, the list of prioritized projects could be published to inform the broader public
about the allocation of resources to national priorities, including those identified in the Transport Master
Plan currently under preparation. Moreover, better use could be made of technical assistance to enhance
Romania’s capacity to absorb EU-funds. In the medium term, Romania should aim to establish one project
management process that encompasses all projects notwithstanding funding sources.

15.
In 2015, fiscal policy remains anchored by the medium-term budgetary objective
(MTO). The 2015 budget targets a deficit of 1.8 percent of GDP (1.5 percent of GDP in ESA terms).
This is consistent with the MTO of 1.0 percent of GDP deficit in structural terms (ESA base) boosted
by a 0.25 percent adjuster in 2015 for a faster absorption of EU funds,2 which is expected to pick up
as the authorities aim to fully use the funds associated with the 2007–13 programming period. Fiscal
policy is thus no longer a significant drag for the economy with just ¼ percent of GDP further
consolidation in ESA terms needed next year.
16.
However, medium-term spending pressures are building. First, the potential for future
restitution and court-ordered payments represents a contingent fiscal liability, potentially
amounting to 6 percent of GDP. Second, the 2015 budget foresees higher capital spending to
address infrastructure needs. This will require faster EU funds absorption and more efficient public
investment. Shifting more projects toward EU funding should ensure more scrutiny and a higher
multiplier. Third, the authorities plan to increase defense spending. Finally, Romania faces agerelated social spending pressures (estimated cost of 1¾ percent of GDP by 2030). To ensure the
financial sustainability of the health care system and improve health outcomes, the authorities are
already implementing a comprehensive reform of the healthcare system. They have introduced a
basic health package in 2014, which contributes to gradually shifting health services away from
hospital-based treatments to more cost-effective ambulatory care, and are revising the
reimbursement policy.
17.
At the same time, the authorities tentatively aim to lower tax rates possibly putting
fiscal discipline at risk. Only about a fifth of the fiscal consolidation since the crisis was revenue
based. It left Romania with a relatively high VAT rate (24 percent), increased excises, a new tax on
non-building constructions, and one of the highest labor tax wedges in the EU. The revenue
measures were later partly offset by a reduction in the VAT rate on bakery and flour products
(September 2013), a tax exemption for reinvested profits (October 2014), and a 5 percentage-points
cut in the employers’ pension contribution rate (October 2014). A new taxation regime for the oil
and gas sector is set to be applied from 2016. Its design should aim at fostering investment while
ensuring a fair government take. The authorities also propose for 2016 to lower the VAT rate,
excises, and taxes on dividends as well as cancel the tax on non-building constructions with an
estimated direct revenue loss of 2.2 percent of GDP. Staff’s baseline scenario does not include the
proposed tax changes since the authorities’ plans have not yet sufficiently taken shape. In staff’s
view, any tax reduction plans should go hand-in-hand with stronger revenue administration, better
compliance—the VAT collection gap is the highest in the EU at 44 percent—and formalizing the
economy, in particular, further efforts to advance a risk-based compliance oversight approach, given
that at 18.7 percent of GDP the tax revenue-to-GDP ratio is still lower than in most EU member
states. Until such reforms deliver results, there is no room to lower tax rates unless fully offset by
other fiscal measures, including possibly lower inefficient capital spending until the absorption

financed by base broadening and would likely create more employment than the recent broadbased cut (see Selected Issues paper “Cutting Labor Taxes in a Constrained Budget Environment”).

subsequent reinstatement of prior pension
benefits for select categories of retirees and increases in the minimum wage pose risks. While an
adjustment to the pay scale may be necessary, further amendments to the Pension and Unified
Wage Laws of 2010 should be considered very carefully.



Public expenditure management and tax administration need to be strengthened. The
creation of a public investment evaluation unit is an important achievement, but the integration
of the project prioritization process into the budget planning and across government levels
remains weak. A commitment control system has been pilot-tested and needs to be extended to
all public institutions as a safeguard against the re-accumulation of arrears. In addition, efforts
to strengthen tax administration, including extension of pilot audits on under-reported labor
and modernization of the information systems with support from the World Bank, should
advance and the large taxpayer unit should retain its key role. Moreover, fiscal decentralization
provides in principle an opportunity to improve service delivery (in social sectors and on public
investments), but capacity and governance at the local level should be improved first and fiscal

Authorities’ views
19.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to sound fiscal policies and stronger
public financial management. They will determine the preferred timing for reaching the MTO
when submitting their Convergence Program to the EC this spring. The authorities propose to
reduce tax rates in 2016 and beyond with a view to stimulating the economy and incentivizing shifts
from the informal to the formal sector. They estimate that the direct revenue loss of 2.2 percent of
GDP in 2016 would be offset by more than half through these dynamic effects (estimated net
revenue loss of 0.9 percent of GDP). In addition, the authorities are determined to improve revenue
collection and view a reorganization of the large tax payer unit as essential.

B. Monetary Policy: Anchoring Expectations in Uncharted Waters
20.
There is room for further monetary easing. The National Bank of Romania (NBR) has
implemented monetary policy in an environment of record low interest rates and inflation. In
August 2014, the NBR resumed the rate cutting cycle lowering the policy rate since July 2013 by a
cumulative 300 basis points to 2.25 percent in February 2015. The rate reductions were
accompanied by a narrowing of the interest rate corridor, in line with the staff advice. Moreover, the
NBR started to lower the still high minimum reserve requirements (MRRs). The latter, coupled with
treasury operations related to growing disbursements of EU funds, has created excess liquidity in the
banking system which is likely to stay in the near term. Monetary policy should maintain an easing
bias, as lower-than-targeted inflation could become entrenched amid a negative output gap,
imported low inflation, and declining inflation expectations.

standard deviation shock on the euro-lei exchange rate.

21.
Staff also recommends a gradual transition of the conduct of monetary policy to a
full-fledged inflation targeting regime. This could be achieved by reducing the role of the
exchange rate in the policy framework and further narrowing the interest rate corridor. The latter
would reduce the gap between the policy rate and interbank rates and help strengthen the clarity of
monetary policy signals and the transmission channel. Staff analysis shows that greater exchange
rate volatility should be a lesser concern as the share of foreign currency-denominated loans is
declining and the exchange rate pass-through has diminished substantially with the adoption of
inflation targeting-light (see Selected Issues paper “Exchange Rate Pass-through and Inflation
Targeting”).
22.
Joining the euro area is the authorities’ medium-term policy objective. Staff views this
objective as an important anchor for economic policies, especially for accelerating structural
reforms. At the same time, staff called for a careful review of the euro adoption timeline, which is
likely to take longer, as joining the euro zone constrains macro-policy options in the face of shocks
and requires reaching a sufficient level of real convergence (see also IMF “Central and Eastern
Europe: New Member States Policy Forum, 2014”). Romania not only lags in its real per capita
income convergence but also in its economic transition when compared to those countries that
recently joined the euro area.

reserve adequacy metrics (Box 2). Going forward, staff recommends limiting interventions in the
foreign exchange market to smoothing excessive volatility and maintaining a prudent stance with
moderate reserve accumulation in light of continued downside external risks.
Authorities’ views
24.
The NBR was cautious on the speed of moving to full-fledged inflation targeting and
agreed with staff’s assessment on external competitiveness and reserve adequacy. Regarding
the gap between the policy and interbank rates, the NBR acknowledged the related risk of
weakening the signaling power of policy decisions. While a gradual shift to full-fledged inflation
targeting is envisaged, the NBR sees a role for the exchange rate as long as euroization in balance
sheets is significant. The authorities also recognized the importance of maintaining adequate
reserves, particularly against heightened uncertainty in international financial markets, but pointed
out that reserve accumulation should also take into account the cost of holding reserves.

C. Financial Sector: Reinvigorating Intermediation
25.
The banking sector continues to maintain adequate capital, liquidity and provisioning
buffers, and asset quality has improved. Following a comprehensive NBR action plan and EU-wide
methodological changes, NPLs declined in 2014 by about 8 percentage points but bank balance
sheet repair is still incomplete (Figures 6 and 8). Measures included NPLs sales, write-offs and higher
provisioning. NBR stress tests indicate that the solvency of the banking system would generally be
resilient to severe scenarios, but require additional capital in a few banks. Instability related to
Greece warrants intense monitoring and timely action by the NBR to mitigate the potential impact
contagion could have on bank funding. Given the high but falling share of FX-denominated loans
(56 percent), indirect FX risk remains the largest risk for the sector. However, pressure from the Swiss
franc appreciation is manageable for the banking system, since the share of Swiss franc loans is
relatively low at about 4.5 percent of total loans across about 75,000 borrowers. Staff encouraged
voluntary bilateral loan restructurings taking into account the repayment capacity of the borrower.
26.
Reinvigorating financial intermediation remains a challenge. Foreign bank deleveraging
has slowed but together with other supply factors have held back a rebound in credit growth. On
the demand side, a scarcity of bankable loans and the relatively high indebtedness of SMEs
contributed to negative credit growth. Enabling long-term bank funding—including by adopting a
covered bond legislation—and strengthening the existing support schemes for SME lending would
benefit intermediation.
27.
Legal risks remain a key concern for the banking system. A wave of recent lawsuits based
on the Civil Code enacted in 2013 regarding abusive clauses in loan contracts has led to lower court
decisions that are being appealed on the grounds that they go counter to market practices. If those
verdicts become the basis of class action lawsuits, they could pose a threat to the system’s stability.
In response, the authorities have put forward a plan to establish a specialized court that would
handle such cases. However, its establishment has been repeatedly delayed for administrative
reasons.

Box 2. External Sector Assessment
Current account. Romania’s current account deficit narrowed significantly over the past two years, largely
driven by strong export growth. Notwithstanding a weak external environment, exports of goods and
services surged to about 40 percent of GDP in 2013–14 from the pre-crisis level of 25 percent of GDP in
2007. Goods exports as a share of the imports of Romania’s main trading partners have been steadily
increasing, with transportation equipment market share in the EU more than doubling from 2008–13. A
decomposition of export growth suggests that domestic push factors played an important role in explaining
the recent improvement.

projected underlying current account deficit is lower than

sustainability approach points to a modest undervaluation of 3.2 percent, given that the current account
norm required to maintain the international investment position at the current level (60 percent of GDP) is
higher than the projected underlying deficit. Finally, taking into account the adjustment in the baseline
projection, the equilibrium real exchange rate approach suggests a marginal overvaluation of 2.1 percent.
Romania’s average wage has increased following the crisis, broadly mirroring economy-wide productivity
gains since end-2008. Caution is needed to ensure that future minimum wage increases do not undermine
competitiveness.

falling short in 2013 and during most of 2014. The improvement largely reflects a major reduction in shortterm external liabilities. Going forward, in light of continued downside external risks, and potential volatility
in capital flows, a prudent stance with moderate reserve accumulation remains appropriate.

28.
Romania is in the process of modernizing its insolvency regime but not all elements
are yet in place to ensure its efficacy. The new Corporate Insolvency Law has only recently been
adopted and experience with its implementation is limited. The authorities are currently drafting a
personal insolvency law. Several design issues need to be carefully considered and before adopting
the law, the authorities should conduct an impact assessment and broad stakeholder consultations,
ensure consistency with the corporate insolvency law, and strengthen the institutional framework to
support effective implementation of the law. This is critical in ensuring that the personal insolvency
law successfully provides those with unsustainable debt a fresh start without endangering the
payment culture.
29.
The authorities plan to opt into the EU banking union but have not yet announced a
timetable. While many operational issues remain to be resolved, the authorities see merit from
opting in before euro adoption as the Romanian banking system comprises mostly subsidiaries of
foreign banks. Staff supports the plan but called for careful preparation (see also IMF “Central and
Eastern Europe: New Member States Policy Forum, 2014”). In line with euro area practices, the NBR
is planning to conduct a third party-led asset quality review of the banking system in late 2015.
30.
The non-bank financial sector and its supervisor face important challenges. Significant
progress has been made on institutional restructuring of the Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA)
since it became the single supervisor of the non-bank financial sector in 2013. A number of barriers
to capital market development were removed, which is to be enshrined in a revised capital market
law. However, the insurance market is troubled by insolvency issues and weak business practices,
which need to be tackled forcefully by the supervisor (Box 3). Legal reforms are urgently needed to
enhance resolution powers of the FSA.
Authorities’ views
31.
The authorities’ views converged to a significant extent with those of staff. They stated
the intention to ensure good asset quality in the banking and insurance sectors through regular
audits and with the support of third party reviews. The authorities aim to swiftly finalize the
legislation for covered bonds and insurance resolution powers.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ROMANIA

Box 3. Need for Reforms in the Insurance Sector
Romania’s insurance sector is non systemic in magnitude but plagued by weaknesses. The sector had a
spurt of growth in the last decade but since then stagnated at the pre-crisis level. Total assets stood at about
3 percent of the GDP at end-2013 and total gross underwritten premiums reached 1.3 percent of GDP. There
are 39 insurers in the industry many of which are foreign subsidiaries. Non-life business represents about
80 percent of total activity. The sector has considerable weaknesses resulting from a history of lax
supervision and enforcement. Intervention and resolution are constrained by shortcomings in the legal
framework. Risks for the overall financial sector derive mostly from reputational risks as direct linkages are
limited.
The failure of the largest insurer has revealed an urgent need for policy action. A price war in the car
and housing insurance lines led to low levels of reserve coverage in some entities. In February 2014, the
largest insurance company (Astra, a domestically owned non-life insurer with about 15 percent of market
share and mostly in the motor vehicle insurance business) was put under special administration by KPMG.
The supervisor needs to move decisively to ensure recapitalization or an orderly resolution. Moreover, the
insurance law and the legislation on the insurance guarantee fund need to be urgently amended to enhance
the resolution procedures and to provide resolution financing. The European Commission is providing
technical support and the FSA will engage in a comprehensive asset quality review with third party
involvement later this year.

D. Structural Reforms: Rekindling Momentum and Focusing on
Infrastructure
32.
Romania needs to advance structural reforms to address its infrastructure gap and
improve its growth prospects (Box 1). The poor infrastructure is due partly to the dominance of
inefficient SOEs in the transportation and energy sectors where quality of public investment is low.
The role of SOEs has shrunk considerably in Romania, but about 1,000 SOEs (of which three quarters
are owned by local governments) still play a notable role in key sectors, such as electricity and gas,
postal and courier services and transport (see Selected Issue paper “Romanian State-Owned
Enterprises: Challenges and Reform Priorities”).

Despite improvements in the financial performance of some SOE, performance of
many others remains weak. Central government-owned SOE arrears have been reduced by
1½ percent of GDP over the past two years, but local government-owned SOE arrears were on the
rise and lingered around one percent of GDP at end-2014. In 2013, the SOE sector became
profitable following several years of aggregate losses. Profits were concentrated in four energy
companies which benefited from electricity and gas market deregulation while the rest continue to
be largely loss-making. Losses and arrears are concentrated in a few SOEs of the transport and
energy sectors (coal-based energy producers). Their financial weakness remains a burden on the
state budget, either directly through transfers or indirectly through foregone revenue. Improving the
operational efficiency of some large SOEs will require aggressive restructuring and, in some cases,
liquidation.

Better SOE corporate governance would enhance SOE performance and infrastructure
service delivery. SOE corporate governance suffered a setback in 2014, reflected in heavy
intervention by line ministries in SOEs decisions. Going forward, strict implementation of good
governance principles, underpinned by a stronger legal framework and an effective enforcement
mechanism, is needed to rebuild the reforms’ credibility. This also implies adopting the SOE
corporate governance law based on recent recommendations from the World Bank.
35.
Initial public offerings (IPOs) have expanded the role of private capital in the energy
sector while the transport sector lags in this respect. Private sector involvement through majority
or minority ownership is a useful tool to bring in expertise and funding as well as to raise
transparency. Successful IPOs in three large energy companies, undertaken during 2013–14, point
the way for a greater role for private capital in the future. The transport sector needs to urgently
catch up to these developments. In the railway sector, the authorities made significant headway in
restructuring the rail freight operator Marfa by downsizing its staff by more than one fourth.
However, Marfa’s privatization process has stalled and a further restructuring may be needed.
Romania’s rail network needs to be rationalized in line with the recently prepared Transport Master
Plan.
36.
Romania has taken welcome steps to participate more fully in the European energy
market. The authorities removed physical and legal obstacles to gas exports and linked Romania’s

electricity grid to those of four neighbors. Moreover, they deregulated the gas and electricity
markets for non-residential consumers, which is a major achievement as it accounts for the bulk of
energy consumption. This should be followed by restarting the gas tariff deregulation for
households, which was interrupted in July 2014, while at the same time strengthening the support
for the most vulnerable consumers. The recent decline in global commodity prices and record low
inflation in Romania provide a conducive environment for such a deregulation.
37.
The authorities are taking steps to reduce youth unemployment and skill mismatches.
The Labor Code has introduced more flexibility in employment relations and supported employment
growth. The share of fixed-term and temporary contracts has increased, but remains lower than in
most EU countries. To reduce the high youth unemployment, the authorities are adopting measures
under the National Job Plan and implementing the secondary legislation for the Apprenticeship Law.
Regarding the Social Dialogue Law, which covers collective bargaining, the government has started
a consultation process on proposed amendments to this legislation. The minimum wage was
increased by about 29 percent in 2013–14. While it is still the second lowest in the EU, it has
significantly compressed the public sector wage scale and would reach nearly 50 percent of the
average wage if the announced increase of 15 percent is implemented in 2016.

Authorities’ views
38.
While broadly agreeing with staff’s view on the importance of structural reforms, the
authorities argued for more gradual measures. In particular, they stressed that the original road
map for the gas tariff deregulation for households was too fast and steep given their fragile incomes
after the crisis. Improving the performance of SOEs would require more time to carefully analyze
their situation, prepare restructuring plans, and align decisions with the national strategies for
energy and transport. The authorities expressed commitment to good SOE governance principles,
though the concept was not always fully embraced. Regarding job creation, the authorities agreed
with the importance of removing barriers to employment and measures to reduce skill mismatches,
especially for the young. They considered broad-based measures to lower the tax wedge further
preferable over targeted ones.

39.
Romania has in large part reduced internal and external imbalances through
impressive fiscal consolidation and prudent monetary and financial sector policies. Growth is
becoming more broad-based and sustained amid improved confidence. However, income
convergence with the EU has been slow and youth unemployment remains elevated.
40.
Reinvigorating structural reforms, including by addressing the large infrastructure
gap, is critical for faster growth. Raising growth prospects over the longer term requires
continuity of sustainable economic policies, underpinned by stronger fiscal and regulatory
institutions, and a more stable and predictable business environment which is crucial for investor
confidence. In addition, maintaining adequate reserve buffers and strengthening further public and
private sector balance sheets would better position to withstand shocks and respond with mitigating
policies if risks materialize. Slippages or failure in implementing these policies and increased
volatility in the external environment present key downside risks to the outlook.
41.
Fiscal discipline needs to be maintained, underpinned by structural fiscal reforms. The
announced tax reduction plans threaten to undermine five years of consolidation gains. Efforts
should instead focus on broadening the tax base and reducing the collection gap to help cover
medium-term spending pressures. Moreover, stronger public expenditure management and
planning as well as better project management are needed to improve spending efficiency and
ensure provision of higher quality public infrastructure. Expenditure quality could be improved
through an extension and enforcement of the investment prioritization initiative; scaling up of EU
funds absorption; and rolling out of the commitment control system to all public institutions.
Meanwhile, the private sector participation in the financing of health services should be supported
and accelerated to address the projected expansion of age-related spending.
42.
Monetary policy should keep the easing bias. Staff sees room for further lowering the
policy rate and the MRRs. Further changes to the MRRs should aim to maintain disincentives for
foreign-currency lending by keeping differentiated MRRs for domestic-versus foreign currencydenominated liabilities. Staff also recommends strengthening the policy framework by gradually
moving to full-fledged inflation targeting as well as the operational framework by implementing
recommendations of the recent IMF technical mission.
43.
Reinvigorating financial intermediation is important for growth. A continued intense
supervision of the banking system should focus on improving its asset quality and resolving NPLs.
Making the existing support schemes for SME lending more efficient, facilitating loan restructuring
processes, and enabling long-term bank funding would benefit intermediation. Strengthening the
non-bank financial sector supervision and providing it with resolution powers for insurance
companies is another priority. Any new personal insolvency law should be designed keeping in mind
cross-country experiences, and be adopted only after a thorough impact assessment, broad
stakeholder consultations, and enhancing the institutional infrastructure.

44.
Strong structural reform efforts will be critical to making growth more sustainable and
increasing Romania’s growth potential. Efforts should focus on reforming SOE governance
practices and legislation; restructuring of SOEs—to improve infrastructure service delivery,
strengthen their financial performance, generate resources for investment, and increase private
ownership in the SOE sector—as well as on further deregulating energy markets.
45.
Boosting medium-term growth prospects also requires continued efforts to encourage
higher labor participation. Focus should be on the young, low-skilled and women, among which
participation in the formal labor market is far below the EU average. Recommended measures
include implementing the new vocational training programs and further lowering the labor tax
wedge for low-income earners through targeted measures.
46.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Romania will be held in
accordance with the Executive Board decision on the consultation cycle for members with
Fund arrangements.

Relative Likelihood and Transmission
Channels
High
● Investors may sell Romanian
financial assets after reassessing
risks in light of rise in volatility.

High

2. Shortfall in accelerating EU
funds absorption

● Weak capacity and complex
bureaucracy continue to hamper EU
funds absorption.

High
● Exports could fall. In the short run,
the substitution effect mitigates
against this risk (i.e., shift in euro
area demand toward cheaper
products produced in Romania).
3. Protracted period of slower
● FDI could drop as investors
growth or low inflation in the
reassess future euro area demand

for Romanian exports.
● Import low inflation from euro
zone, reducing inflation expectations.

Medium

4. Foreign banks rebalance
portfolio exposure.

● Foreign parent banks accelerate
ongoing deleveraging of remaining
stock of funding (stock estimated at
EUR 11.6 billion).
● Reduction in credit supply.

Medium

5. Sustained tensions
surrounding Russia/Ukraine

● Lower investor risk appetite for
emerging Europe assets.
● Disruption of normal trade
relations through sanctions.
● Interruption of Russian gas
supply.

Expected Impact if
Risk is Realized
Medium
● Increase in borrowing costs
which could depress GDP growth.
● Risk of overshooting with
implications for ability to service FX
loans (57 percent of total bank
loans).

Policy Response
● Allow for exchange rate
flexibility while offsetting excessive
market volatility.
● Utilize some of fiscal financing
buffer until markets settle down.

Medium
● Delay in much-needed
infrastructure upgrade would lower
actual and potential economic
growth.
● Weaker quality of public outlays
as budgeted co-financing could be
redirected to current spending.

● Redouble efforts to improve EU
project implementation capacity.
● Strictly adhere to national
procurement rules to reduce
regulatory arbitrage between
spending on EU-funded projects
and other items.

Medium
● Lower actual and potential
growth.
● Potential widening of the current
account deficit, possibly offset in
part through substitution effect of
shift in EU demand toward lower
cost products.

High/Medium
● Exchange rate pressure and
possible deterioration in bank
balance sheets given that FX loans
comprise 57 percent of bank loans.
● Other commercial banks may
seek to grow market share,
offsetting potential reduction in
credit.

● Allow automatic stabilizers to
work.
● Accelerate absorption of EU
funds.
● Allow for exchange rate
flexibility while offsetting excessive
market volatility.

● Reduce minimum reserve
requirements.
● Engage host country
supervisors to develop a
coordinated response to
deleveraging.
● Intensify liquidity monitoring.
● Stand ready to provide liquidity
support.

Low
● Increase in borrowing costs, but
conversely potential for safe haven
inflows in emerging Europe.
● Modest direct financial and
trade linkages limit potential
impact.
● Possible rationing of gas for
some industrial users during winter
months, though stored gas is likely
sufficient to cover a large portion
of domestic demand.

● Communicate clearly limited
economic and financial links with
Russia/Ukraine.
● Ease monetary policy in case
low inflation becomes entrenched.

1/ The RAM shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The
relative likelihood of risks is staff's subjective assessment of risks surrounding the baseline. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and
materialize jointly.

Annex III. Public and External Debt Sustainability Analysis
Romania’s public debt is sustainable. The main vulnerability is a projected gross financing need of
8.2 percent of GDP in 2015. The main risks arise from underperformance of GDP growth and a
banking sector contingent liability, which could push the public debt ratio to nearly 50 percent of GDP
in 2017 in the DSA scenario. Exchange rate volatility and exposure to international capital outflows are
also risks. Risks from contingent liabilities are contained, however, since all outstanding guarantees are
already included in public debt and banks are well capitalized with limited exposure to short-term
external debt. External vulnerabilities persist due to relatively high external debt and rollover needs,
but the projected current account deficits are sustainable.
The macroeconomic and fiscal assumptions underpinning the DSA are those of the mediumterm baseline scenario. The output gap is expected to close by 2020 and real GDP growth to reach
3½ percent, more than 3 percentage points below the pre-crisis boom period average. Analysis of
real GDP forecasts errors indicates that the size of the output slump during the crisis and the slow
recovery were underestimated, an experience shared with many crisis countries. Growth projections
proved optimistic in part because domestic demand growth was lower than anticipated. However,
should the pace of structural reforms and EU funds absorption accelerate substantially, staff sees
upside potential for medium-term growth. Fiscal policy assumes that the authorities reach a cash
deficit target of 1.8 percent of GDP in 2015 (-1.45 percent of GDP in ESA terms), consistent with the
medium-term budgetary objective. This path is in line with the new fiscal rules under the Fiscal
Compact. In addition, the projected primary balances are greater than the debt-stabilizing balance.
Considering the risks of adjustment fatigue, a zero primary balance rather than a small surplus is
included as a possible scenario in assessing the distribution of debt dynamics in the fan chart.
Public debt is low but relatively high gross financing needs are a vulnerability. Public debt,
including guarantees, is projected to peak in 2015 at 40.4 percent of GDP, due in part to a projected
financing of an increase in Treasury deposits of 0.5 percent of GDP. Without the projected increase,
the public debt-to-GDP ratio would have reached its peak in 2014 at 40.2 percent of GDP. Gross
financing needs are projected to continue declining from 9 percent of GDP in 2014 to below
6 percent of GDP by 2020. To manage some of the financing risk, the authorities maintain a foreigncurrency financing buffer (excluding privatization proceeds), which was four months of gross
financing needs in January 2015, though the authorities have signaled a desire to reduce the buffer
gradually to three months, depending on market conditions. Most of longer-term debt is official
financing (about 28 percent of total public debt) while the average maturity of government
securities issued on the domestic market is about 3 years. The authorities have been addressing
rollover risks under their debt management strategy with a view to issuing longer-term securities as
well as lengthening the yield curve. With foreign currency-denominated debt accounting for about
60 percent of public debt, public debt is also exposed to exchange rate risk. Moreover, due to
strong portfolio investment by non-residents over the past 12 months their share in domestic debt
securities holdings is about 20 percent, raising the exposure to shifts in international capital flows.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ROMANIA

Overall, public debt is sustainable. The stress test scenarios indicate that the main risk arises from
weaker GDP growth, which could push the debt ratio to nearly 50 percent of GDP but still below the
60 percent threshold under the Stability and Growth Pact. The scenario assumes that real output
growth rates in 2015–16 are lower by one standard deviation, which leads to worsening of the fiscal
position and debt levels. In the baseline scenario, continued fiscal adjustment would ensure debt
sustainability. Barring unexpected events, potential contingent liabilities of the government would
also be limited. SOE debt is estimated at around 7 percent of GDP (including SOEs under insolvency
procedures or in liquidation). A banking sector contingent liability shock involving a one-time
bailout that increases non-interest expenditure by 10 percent of banking sector assets would
increase debt to 45.4 percent of GDP in 2015, which would also be the peak under this shock.
Despite remaining vulnerabilities of the banking system, including due to a large share of foreign
currency denominated loans and high rollover needs, downside risks are contained as banks are
generally well capitalized and their short-term external liabilities are below 4 percent of GDP.
The external debt sustainability analysis indicates that the projected current account deficits
remain sustainable. Gross external debt was about 66 percent of GDP at end-2013, around onethird of which was public debt. Almost one-fifth of external debt is at short-term maturities, mainly
of the non-bank private sector. The short-term financing risk for non-bank private sector is expected
to be limited, as around half of the short-term debt is intra-company loans with relatively low
rollover risks. The projected medium-term current account deficit of 3.6 percent of GDP is in line
with a declining external debt-to-GDP ratio. Bound tests indicate that 30 percent depreciation would
substantially increase the external debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium term, while other standard
shocks would only lead to a slower decline in the external debt-to-GDP ratio.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in Euro terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
e = nominal appreciation (increase in Euro value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP
deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; Euro deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, Euro deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels

focused in recent years mostly on structural fiscal reforms, in particular modernizing tax
administration, strengthening public financial management, and reviewing tax policy options.
Technical assistance to the National Bank of Romania focused on upgrading contingency planning,
dealing with non-performing loans, and reviewing monetary and exchange rate policy tools.
Article IV Consultations
Romania is on a 24-month consultation cycle during the Stand-By Arrangement. The previous
Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on September 28, 2012.
Safeguards Assessment
The update of the 2011 safeguards assessment, completed on January 10, 2014, found that the
safeguards framework at the National Bank of Romania remains robust. The NBR continues to
publish audited financial statements and maintains strong controls over foreign reserves
management, government banking, and vault operations. The assessment recommended that the
internal audits of foreign reserves data (a measure during both the 2009 and 2011 Stand-By
Arrangements) be continued during the current program.
FSAP and ROSC
A joint IMF-World Bank mission conducted an update assessment of Romania’s financial sector as
part of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) during November 3–14, 2008. The Financial
Sector Assessment Report (FSSA) was discussed at the Board in April 2009.
A recent pilot of the IMF’s new Fiscal Transparency Evaluation took place in February 2014 and the
findings were published in March 2015. It assessed the government’s fiscal reporting, forecasting,
and risks management practices against the IMF’s revised Fiscal Transparency Code.
Resident Representative
The Fund has had a resident representative in Bucharest since 1991. Mr. Guillermo Tolosa assumed
the post of regional resident representative in July 2013.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
The current World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Romania, covering the
period 2014–17, was presented to the Board on May 22, 2014. The strategy aims at reducing poverty
and promoting shared prosperity. The CPS is built on three pillars; (i) Creating a 21st Century
Government, with focus on a well-functioning public administration, effective in its service delivery
and with an improved quality of public expenditure. (ii) Growth and Private Sector Job Creation,
seeking sustainable poverty mitigation and shared prosperity through improvements in the business
environment and SOE governance (especially in energy and transport), promoting innovation, and
furthering the digital agenda and competitiveness, and (iii) Social Inclusion, a key to the EU’s Europe
2020 Agenda, with a special focus on the Roma community.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of February 18, 2015
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance. The quality of the national accounts, price,
fiscal, and balance of payments data is adequate.
National accounts: Quarterly and annual national accounts statistics are produced by the National
Institute for Statistics (INS) using the European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA 2010). Estimates are
methodologically sound and are reported to the Fund on a timely basis for publication in the
International Financial Statistics (IFS). Provisional and semi-final versions are disseminated in the
Statistical Yearbook and other publications, as well as on the web (www.insse.ro).
Inflation: The Consumer Price Index is subject to standard annual re-weighting, and is considered
reliable. In January 2004, the INS changed the coverage of the Producer Price Index to include the
domestic and export sectors.
Labor market: Labor market statistics are broadly adequate. The definition used for employment
is consistent with ESA 2010.
Public finances: Annual GFS data for the general government sector, including public
corporations operating on a non-market basis, are reported on an accrual basis derived from cash
data using various adjustment methods. Tax revenues are adjusted using the time-adjusted cash
method; expense data are adjusted using due-for-payments data; and interest payments are
calculated on an accrual basis. Accrual data are also available on a quarterly basis three months
after the end of each quarter. EUR receives monthly cash budget execution data. Consolidated
data on general government operations are reported for inclusion in the GFS Yearbook.
Monetary and financial data: The National Bank of Romania (NBR) reports monetary and
financial statistics on a regular and timely basis for publication in the IFS. Since December 2004,
the NBR reports monetary data to STA using the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs). The data are
being published in the IFS Supplement, beginning September 2006. Romania’s data and metadata
for financial soundness indicators are posted on the IMF’s website
(http://www.imf.org/external/np/sta/fsi/eng/cce/index.htm).
Balance of payments: The NBR routinely reports quarterly and annual external sector statistics to
the Fund in a timely fashion. Since September 2014 the authorities implemented the sixth edition
of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6), in line with other
European countries. Romania also participates in the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment
Survey (CPIS) and Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS).

Statement by the Staff Representative on Romania
March 25, 2015
1.
This statement provides information that has become available since the
issuance of the Staff Report on March 11, 2015. This information does not alter the thrust
of the staff appraisal.
2.
The cash budget recorded a surplus of 0.3 percent of GDP for the first two
months of 2015 compared to a deficit of 0.5 percent of GDP during the same period of
2014. Based on preliminary data, the surplus reflects strong spending restraint coupled with
solid revenue growth. In the first two months, spending was lower by 0.6 percentage points
of GDP relative to last year, with lower subsidies and spending on goods, services, and
capital accounting for most of the drop. At the same time, total revenues were higher by
0.2 percentage points of GDP, driven mostly by higher VAT and non-tax revenue receipts
and reflecting base effects as well as stronger domestic demand.
3.
The authorities are considering the reduction of tax rates, but their plans are
still evolving, including how to offset the revenue loss. Based on the latest data available,
staff estimates that the net loss in budget revenues in 2016 from the proposed tax changes
could reach 2.2 percent of GDP. This takes into account the projected impact on revenues
from stronger economic activity (0.7–1.0 percent higher nominal GDP in 2016). The revenue
shortfall would widen further from 2017 with proposed additional tax rate reductions. At this
stage, staff does not have information about potential measures that the authorities may take
to offset the proposed tax changes.
4.
In February, inflation remained low. Headline annual inflation was at 0.4 percent,
unchanged from the previous month. Core inflation declined to 1 percent.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Romania
On March 25, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Romania.
Romania’s economic recovery has become more entrenched and broad-based, with private
consumption picking up on the back of rising real disposable income. At the same time, inflation
has decelerated substantially over the past two years and a negative output gap persists. The
banking sector has considerably reduced non-performing loans, though they remain high, and
private sector credit has fallen since 2013.
Growth is projected to remain robust in a low inflation environment. However, income
convergence with the EU has been slow, youth unemployment remains elevated and weak public
infrastructure has emerged as a bottleneck for faster growth. Increased volatility in the external
environment and failure to implement a much needed infrastructure upgrade present downside
risks to the outlook.
Romania has in large part addressed internal and external imbalances thanks to a significant
reduction in the fiscal deficit as well as prudent monetary and financial sector policies. The
structural reform momentum, however, has slowed amid elevated political uncertainty. Going
forward, sound macroeconomic policies need to be combined with measures that boost the
efficiency of public spending, re-invigorate delayed state-owned enterprise reforms, and further
strengthen the financial sector.
Raising growth prospects over the longer term requires continuity of sustainable macroeconomic
policies, underpinned by stronger fiscal and regulatory institutions, and a more stable and
predictable business environment which is crucial for investor confidence. In addition,
maintaining adequate reserve buffers and strengthening further public and private sector balance
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

sheets would better position Romania to withstand shocks and respond with mitigating policies
in case risks materialize.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the economic recovery, and commended the authorities on the
reduction of internal and external imbalances through significant fiscal consolidation and prudent
monetary and financial sector policies. They encouraged the authorities to build on this progress
and continue to rebuild buffers, further strengthen the resilience of the financial sector, and
reinvigorate structural reforms to improve Romania’s growth potential.
Directors urged the authorities to maintain prudent fiscal policies in order to safeguard the fiscal
consolidation gains and put public debt on a firm downward path. They cautioned that planned
tax reductions should be accompanied by offsetting measures. They also recommended
broadening the tax base and stepping up efforts to improve tax administration to help cover
medium-term spending pressures. Directors underscored the importance of stronger public
expenditure management and investment project planning to enhance spending efficiency and
ensure the provision of high-quality infrastructure investments. They recommended better
investment prioritization aligned with the budget cycle and improved EU funds absorption.
Directors agreed that there is room for further monetary easing given below-target inflation.
They recommended strengthening the monetary policy framework with a view to gradually
moving toward a full-fledged inflation targeting regime. Meanwhile, a number of Directors saw
a transitory role for the exchange rate in the policy framework, given the still significant
euroization in balance sheets and associated vulnerability. Directors noted that the objective of
joining the euro area is an important anchor for economic policies, and advised that euro
adoption should follow sufficient institutional and structural preparation and progress with real
convergence.
Directors welcomed the significant efforts undertaken to reduce nonperforming loans and repair
bank balance sheets, while calling for continued close supervision of the banking system to
further improve asset quality. Strengthening nonbank supervision, setting up an effective
resolution framework for insurance companies, and efforts to reinvigorate financial
intermediation will also be important.
Directors underlined the need to revive structural reforms and address infrastructure gaps. Strong
efforts are needed to restructure state-owned enterprises, improve their governance, and increase
2

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summing up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

private ownership with the aim to improve service delivery, further reduce arrears through
stronger financial performance, and generate resources for investment. Efforts to deregulate
energy markets are welcome and should be sustained. Directors also encouraged continued
efforts to increase labor market participation, in particular by the young, low-skilled, and
women, which would also help boost medium-term growth.

Statement by Menno Snel, Executive Director for Romania
and Serban Matei, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
March 25, 2015
General remarks
Over the last decade, Romania improved markedly its macroeconomic fundamentals, with
the support of the International Monetary Fund, the European Union and the World Bank.
After re-entering the positive GDP growth territory in 2011, the economy grew by
2.9 percent in 2014 and CPI inflation dropped from 6.3 percent at end-2008 to 0.41 percent
in January 2015. Following a strong external adjustment, the current account deficit dropped
from double-digit levels before the crisis to 0.5 percent of GDP in 2014. The fiscal
consolidation process led to a reduction in the public deficit from a peak of 9 percent in 2009
to 1.9 percent of GDP in 2014. Romania’s banking system is strong, NPL ratios decreased,
adequate buffers were kept in place and no public funds have been necessary to support the
banking sector during the global financial crisis. The international reserves coverage in
Romania is adequate. The reserve level of EUR 34.3 billion at end-January 2015 was above
the standard rules of three months coverage of prospective imports and is also in line with the
new reserve adequacy metric for emerging markets. The recent rebound in economic activity
helped labor market conditions to improve and the unemployment rate declined to
6.8 percent in 2014.
Despite all these achievements, the economy remains vulnerable to adverse developments in
international markets, regional unrest, and continued bank deleveraging. So it is clear that the
authorities will have to remain vigilant, act proactively, and take the necessary steps to
contain these risks. Therefore, the Romanian authorities expressed their dedication to
continue with firm policy implementation and consider maintaining strong fiscal, external,
and financial sector buffers to safeguard against risks essential.
Macroeconomic performance
Although the environment was challenging, Romania’s economic recovery continues.
Romania significantly reduced its internal and external imbalances through an important
fiscal consolidation and prudent monetary and financial sector policies. Staff rightly notes
that growth is becoming more broad-based and sustained amid improved confidence. GDP is
projected to remain strong in 2015 at 2.7 percent. The main engine of growth was exports,
accompanied by a successful harvest and a robust industrial output.
The inflation rate evolved quickly during the last two years. In the second half of 2013,
the central bank brought the inflation back in its target range. At the end of 2014, the annual
CPI inflation rate went below the ±1 percentage point variation band of the 2.5 percent flat
target, with a value of 0.83 percent. The slowdown in the overall CPI inflation rate was
driven by developments in the CPI components affected mainly by supply-side factors.

2
Specifically, the prevailing impact came from the unanticipated shocks on volatile fuel and
agricultural prices. The latter fell against the background of a new bumper crop across the
region and amid domestic supply supplemented by higher imports from the European states
that were hit by the import ban to Russia as of August 2014. Inflation is projected to remain
low in 2015, reaching an annual average of about 1 percent.
The external position has been consolidated. The current account deficit narrowed to a
historic minimum of 0.5 percent of GDP in 2014. Romania continued and improved its
presence on international capital markets, thus generating significant buffers. In May 2014,
Standard & Poor’s upgraded Romania to the investor grade level and the country continued
to successfully tap into international capital markets. Sovereign and CDS spreads
considerably narrowed during recent years reaching significant low levels. The central bank
sustained international reserves at €34 billion as of end-January, while making substantial
repayments to the Fund.
Fiscal policy
Significant progress has been made with regard to fiscal policy. Since the start of the first
program, Romania considerably improved its fiscal position and reduced fiscal imbalances,
proving a sound fiscal policy. In 2014, the fiscal deficit went below 2 percent of GDP, from
almost 9 percent in 2008. For 2015, the budget framework stays anchored in the Mediumterm Budgetary Objective of 1 percent of GDP (plus an adjustor of ¼ percent of GDP). In an
attempt to stimulate the economic growth and incentivize shifts from the informal to the
formal sector, the Romanian authorities are contemplating potential measures to restore the
fiscal environment to its pre-crisis level. For that reason, they are considering a new Fiscal
Code designed to reduce tax rates from 2016 and beyond, although they are aware that
improved revenue collection must be an important part of this growth enhancing package.
The Romanian authorities are determined to safeguard the fiscal consolidation achievements
and to maintain the commitment under the Stability and Growth Pact.
Monetary and financial policies
The monetary authorities continued to appropriately respond to economic
developments. The National Bank of Romania (NBR) pursued the rate cutting cycle,
lowering the policy rate to 2.25 percent in February 2015. These measures were accompanied
by a narrowing of the interest rate corridor and lowering of the rate of minimum reserve
requirement. The central bank will ensure adequate liquidity conditions in the banking
system, while underpinning the good functioning of money markets. The Romanian
monetary authorities consider that a consistent implementation of an adequate
macroeconomic policy mix and stepping-up structural reforms, along the lines of the external
financing arrangements, together with sustainable financial intermediation and an appropriate
remuneration of bank deposits are pivotal to consolidating the Romanian economy and
enhancing its resilience to external shocks.

The Romanian financial sector is stable. It maintains reassuring capital buffers, enhanced
liquidity and provisioning, but is still confronted with pressures from lowered but continuing
foreign bank deleveraging. As noted by staff, a comprehensive NBR action plan consisting of
NPLs sales, write-offs and higher provisioning helped NPLs to decline in 2014 by about
8 percentage points to 13.9 percent, with an IFRS provisioning ratio increased to
68.9 percent. The capitalization of the banking sector increased above 17 percent. The real
annual growth rate of domestic currency loans gained momentum, thanks to the pass-through
of the successive policy rate cuts onto lending rates on new business to companies and
households, as well as the easing of money market liquidity conditions. The NBR will
continue to closely monitor and supervise the banking system and take any necessary
measures to ensure that banks maintain sufficient capital and liquidity. Moreover, in close
coordination with the IMF and the EC, the NBR will continue to regularly conduct top-down
and bottom-up solvency stress tests as well as liquidity stress tests of the banking industry.
The authorities will focus on further strengthening the non-bank financial sector supervision
and providing it with resolution powers for insurance companies. They are drafting a new
personal insolvency law, taking into account cross-country experiences. They are committed
to adopt this law only after a thorough impact assessment and broad stakeholder
consultations.
Structural reforms
The implementation of the structural reform agenda is progressing, although it
experienced some setbacks. Central government-owned SOE arrears have been reduced by
1.5 percent of GDP over the past two years and local government-owned SOE arrears are still
at around 1 percent of GDP at end-2014, while the SOE sector became profitable following
several years of aggregate losses. In the last years, the authorities have launched a landmark
IPO of the state-owned natural gas producer (Romgaz), sold 10 percent of the shares in the
nuclear energy company (Nuclearelectrica) and the energy regulator made significant steps
towards the liberalization calendars. Moreover, Romania has taken important steps to
participate more fully in the European energy market. The authorities removed physical and
legal obstacles to gas exports and linked Romania’s electricity grid to those of four
neighbors. They deregulated the gas and electricity markets for non-residential consumers,
which is a major achievement as it accounts for the bulk of energy consumption. The
transport sector is lagging behind, especially with regards SOE corporate governance. After a
failed privatization, measures have been taken to restructure the rail freight operator CFR
Marfa by downsizing its staff by more than one fourth. However, Marfa’s privatization
process has stalled and a further restructuring is needed.
The Romanian authorities have reiterated their commitment to pursue the necessary
measures to advance the structural reform agenda. They recognize the importance of
structural reforms, especially in the energy and transportation sectors. Therefore,
international partners have been informed about measures to further improve performance of

4
SOEs, to prepare restructuring plans where necessary and align decisions with the national
strategies. The authorities are committed to further develop the SOE governance principles,
and are currently working together with the World Bank to improve the legislative
framework. Furthermore, they will specifically focus on job creation, by removing barriers to
employment and taking measures to reduce skill mismatches, especially for the young. To
better respond to the need for prioritization and better allocation of resources to national
priorities in the transport sector, including a rail network rationalization, the Romanian
authorities have prepared a Transport Master Plan, which has been sent to the European
Commission for consultation.
