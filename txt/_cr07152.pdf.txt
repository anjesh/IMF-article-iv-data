JAMAICA
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2007 Consultation with Jamaica
Approved by Caroline Atkinson and Anthony Boote
April 11, 2007

Background. Jamaica is a large Caribbean economy with high debt and a complex financial
system. In 2004 the government adopted a medium-term plan to reduce debt through fiscal
consolidation.
Developments. Recent economic performance has been remarkably strong: growth of nearly
3 percent during FY 2006/07 (April to March) was the best in over a decade; annual inflation
fell to 6 percent in January, compared to the target of 9½ percent for FY 2006/07; and external
reserves reached historical highs before declining some in recent months. The overall improved
economic picture notwithstanding, the budget deficit target for FY 2006/07 was likely missed
by a large margin, mostly on account of higher expenditures.
Policy recommendations. The key issue is debt reduction, where progress has not lived up to
expectations laid out in the authorities’ medium-term plan. Discussions focused on the need to
reinvigorate the debt strategy. The staff urged the authorities to seize the opportunity afforded
by today’s still benign external environment to build up resilience to shocks, while initiating
deep structural reforms to anchor the debt strategy.
• Fiscal policy. Measures to increase the central government primary surplus and improve the
resiliency of the debt profile to shocks.
• Monetary and exchange-rate policies. Build on the developing credibility of monetary
policy by introducing greater flexibility to both exchange and interest rates.
• Financial sector. Enhance the supervision of activities exposed to interest rate risk.
Maintain vigilance against pyramid schemes.
• Structural reforms. Make the debt strategy durable through reforms to the tax system,
public wage and employment, public entities, the financial sector, and the business
environment.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Jamaica adopted an ambitious medium-term program of fiscal consolidation in
2004 to reduce public debt from over 140 percent of GDP to 100 percent by 2009. Under
this program, the government aimed to raise the central government primary balance to
13¾ percent of GDP during FY 2004/05 (compared to 7⅓ percent two years earlier) and to
keep it broadly at that level throughout the medium term. Although fiscal targets have not
been fully met each year since (including on account of natural disasters), some progress was
made during 2004–05 in reducing debt, which currently stands at about 132 percent of GDP.1
2.
Exposure to the risk of shocks, nevertheless, remains pronounced—a situation
that the authorities are managing delicately. Jamaica’s public debt is still very high in
international comparison (Figure 1). The debt is sensitive to exchange rate as well as
domestic interest rate changes. And, with the pace of money demand growth lower than that
of reserve accumulation, the outstanding stock of short-term central bank sterilization bills
has increased markedly since 2003. With inflation declining and motivated by debt costs and
the adverse impact on growth, the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ) has steadily lowered interest rates,
while also seeking to keep its sterilization bills sufficiently attractive against increased
U.S. rates. The bulk of Jamaica’s current account deficit is financed by sustainable foreign
direct investment. Nevertheless, private flows and external public borrowing remain
significant. In this regard, the still benign global conditions have been important in helping
maintain this delicate balance.
3.
Elections may be imminent and are expected to be closely fought. In early 2006,
Ms. Simpson-Miller emerged victorious in an internal contest for the leadership of the
governing People’s National Party (PNP) and took over as prime minister. General elections
are constitutionally required by October 2007. While there is a grace period of three months,
the elections may also be called earlier. A recent poll shows both the PNP and the opposition
Jamaica Labor Party enjoying the support of 31–32 percent of registered voters, with most of
the remainder still undecided.2
4.
Fund advice to Jamaica has in recent years reinforced the authorities’ own
home-grown policy framework. Noting the high sensitivity of the debt dynamics to
macroeconomic volatility and market sentiment, past consultations have emphasized the
importance of fiscal consolidation in creating a virtuous cycle of reduced debt and improved
living standards. The authorities have been advised to use monetary policy preemptively to

The BOJ has successfully lowered
inflation without constraining the economic
recovery. Annual inflation has fallen to 6 percent,
compared to the FY 2006/07 target of 9½ percent
and a recent high of over 19 percent in September
2005.
7.
The external current account balance is
improving. The FY 2006/07 current account deficit
is estimated at 10½ percent of GDP—down from
11½ percent the previous year, due to strengthening
exports, as well as robust remittances and tourism.

exchange in the market without putting excessive
pressures on the exchange rate. All in all, the nominal bilateral rate vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar
depreciated by under 4 percent (year-on-year) during 2006. At the same time, with inflation
declining, the BOJ steadily eased monetary policy by removing special deposit requirements
for banks and reducing interest rates in three steps during May–December 2006. Annual base
money growth accelerated to 17.3 percent at end-2006, compared to 9.3 percent a year
earlier. With the local currency yield premium virtually non-existent, however, markets
became unsettled in January 2007 in anticipation of a large redemption of government bonds.
The BOJ issued special bills to mop up liquidity and stepped up sales of foreign exchange
even as it allowed the exchange rate to depreciate at a somewhat quickened pace for some
time. Reserves continued to decline some through February but the exchange rate has
remained broadly stable again in recent weeks.

80

9.
Financial sector soundness indicators remain robust despite a search for high
yields. A worrisome development has been the apparent growth of unregulated foreign
currency trading schemes promising spectacularly high returns. Bank credit to the private
sector has been expanding at double digit rates in real terms annually. Nevertheless,
prudential indicators for both banks and other regulated financial institutions remain sound.
10.
The overall strong economic picture notwithstanding, the budget deficit target
for FY 2006/07 was likely missed by a large margin, mostly on account of higher
expenditures. Revenues increased markedly over last year, but have still been short of the
ambitious targets set out in the budget. More substantively, expenditures for the year as a
whole are likely to have exceeded budgeted amounts by at least 1¾ percentage points of
GDP, and possibly by as much as 2½ percentage points of GDP. As a result, the primary
surplus has fallen to about 8–8¾ percent of GDP and the debt ratio likely declined only
marginally, if at all.
11.
Mid-year expenditure increases occurred in a number of categories. Parliament
recently approved supplementary estimates for higher wages, pensions, and travel allowances
as well as for other current items, including natural disaster insurance premia. A new twoyear wage agreement with

All in all, non-interest current expenditures were increased by 1.5 percentage points of GDP.
Interest payments are also likely to have ended the year about ¾ percentage points of GDP
higher than budgeted. To some extent, the expenditure increases were offset in the
supplementary estimates by lower capital spending but the latter is likely to be a statistical
aberration—the authorities estimate that J$5 billion (0.7 percent of GDP) in capital spending
may be underreported for this year due to teething problems with new reporting procedures,
which resulted in delays in the verification of some donor-funded projects. Including these
amounts as FY 2006/07 expenditures could lead to a deficit as much as 2¾ percent of GDP
higher than originally budgeted.
12.
Exposure of the public debt to changes in exchange rates and interest rates has
increased in recent years. Presently, Jamaica’s public debt is almost evenly split between
domestic and foreign currency denominations while variable rate instruments account for

about 40 percent of the total portfolio.3 About three quarters of the debt stock is owed to
private creditors, including, in particular, the domestic financial system (commercial banks,
merchant banks, security dealers and others). Over the past two years, the share of the debt
that is sensitive to exchange rate movements increased by 1½ percentage points while the
interest-sensitive portion increased by almost 8 percentage points.
III. MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK
13.
The outlook depends critically on the authorities’ commitment to reducing debt.
Given that little, if any, progress was made in reducing debt during FY 2006/07, a
resumption of progress during this fiscal year would ensure continued confidence in the
authorities’ strategy. This, in turn, would help sustain the currently favorable domestic
economic conditions and enable further progress at debt reduction over the medium term. On
the other hand, insufficient progress in tackling the debt problem could, through its potential
impact on confidence, leave open the possibility of a reversal in the dynamics in the wake of
even a small shock. This, in turn, could create a situation where the authorities’ strategy
could quickly unravel.

were higher—say, along the lines envisaged in

the authorities’ original strategy—the debt
2002/03 2004/05 2006/07 2008/09 2010/11
ratio would be commensurately lower. The
debt reduction would remain robust to exogenous shocks of limited magnitude (Figure 3).
For example, a permanent interest rate shock one-half standard deviation of the historical
average would significantly slow the pace of decline, but would still leave debt 10 percentage
points of GDP lower in five years.
15.
The analysis also underscores the critical role of confidence, including in the
context of a financial system that remains exposed to risks. A 30 percent weakening of
the currency, for example, would lead the debt ratio to quickly climb to 170 percent of GDP.
Thereafter, if all other factors remained equal, the debt ratio would resume declining, albeit
to a level still significantly higher than at present. However, a confidence shock of such

magnitude is unlikely to remain an isolated event without other concurrent or second-round
effects placing further upward pressures on debt. In this regard, recent increased exposure of
the public debt to interest rate shocks is of particular concern. Risks also stem from the
financial sector, where security dealers (often part of conglomerates that include banks)
remain dependent on short-term borrowed household funds.
IV. REPORT ON POLICY DISCUSSIONS
16.
Against this background, the overarching theme of the discussions was the
importance of reinvigorating the debt reduction strategy, while also guarding against
short-run vulnerabilities. The challenges are to: (i) seize the opportunity afforded by
today’s still benign external environment to build up resistance to shocks; and, (ii) increase
the durability of the debt strategy by initiating deep structural reforms to strengthen public
finances and foster sustained growth.
A. Fiscal Policy
17.
Discussions revolved around the FY 2006/07 outturn and on policies to
strengthen the fiscal position in FY 2007/08. The authorities expressed their own
disappointment at the budgetary outturn but also emphasized the importance of keeping an
appropriate perspective on the slippage and its implications for the debt dynamics. In
particular, while debt-related vulnerabilities in Jamaica were real, the authorities argued that
risks were exaggerated to some extent, since measured GDP was significantly
underestimated. Nevertheless, looking ahead, they expressed firm commitments to reduce the
deficit and bring the debt ratio down—they saw markets demanding progress in these
respects.
18.
The mission advised raising the primary surplus back to at least 10 percent of
GDP in FY 2007/08, from 8¾ percent currently. The mission commended the authorities
on collecting sizeable tax arrears during FY 2006/07. It noted, however, that the resulting
stock reduction, together with the existence of numerous specific taxes, implied that revenues
could decline by up to 1.2 percent of GDP in FY 2007/08 without additional measures.
Raising the primary surplus by a further 1.2 percent of GDP would thus imply an effort
equivalent to 2.4 percent of GDP. Of this amount, savings of 1.1 percentage points could
accrue on account of the one-off Cricket World Cup related spending in the FY 2006/07
budget. At the same time, part of these savings (up to 0.7 percent of GDP) could be offset by
the need to take into account in the FY 2007/08 budget the as-yet unreported capital spending
(which the authorities are planning to do). Thus, measures amounting to just under 2 percent
of GDP would likely be required.
19.
The mission suggested several options to fill the gap. Fundamental expenditure
reforms are generally more durable over the long term but realizing savings from public
employment reform will take time (see paragraph 29). The mission, therefore, saw scope,

11
over the short-term to rely on revenue measures to: (i) reduce exempted items from the
General Sales Tax; (ii) retire or substantially eliminate discretionary exemptions for imports;
and (iii) raise specific taxes eroded by inflation. On expenditures, the mission recommended
administrative steps to keep temporary workers and overtime in check. It also suggested that
there may be some scope to roll back a larger portion of the FY 2006/07 increase in capital
expenditures.
20.
The authorities explained that they would carefully review the staff’s proposals.
They considered it premature to arrive at a definitive position on the FY 2007/08 deficit but
were confident of an improvement over FY 2006/07. They indicated, however, that trimming
capital spending would be challenging, given, in particular, the continuing need to repair
infrastructure damage. As regards revenues, while agreeing to explore options, the authorities
underscored the need to strike a delicate balance during an election year. However, they were
pleased that recent tax administration reforms being supported by CARTAC and Fund
technical assistance were bearing fruit and were confident on the potential for additional
revenue gains from this source. In this regard, the mission noted the importance of carrying
through the major reforms recommended by the technical assistance mission, including
restructuring the organizational structure of tax administration.
21.
The mission underscored the contributions that public enterprise reform could
play in reducing debt. It noted with concern the deterioration of the financial positions of
key perennial loss-makers even as the balances of some other public entities were turning out
better than expected. In particular, the available data through September 2006 indicated that
the combined deficits of the Jamaica Urban Transit Company (JUTC), the Sugar Company
and Air Jamaica amounted to almost 1 percent of GDP more than had been expected. The
mission saw scope to reduce capital spending by public entities in FY 2007/08 after the large
expansion over the past year. Such consolidation would also enable more of the concessional
PetroCaribe funds currently going to finance off budget entities to replace expensive central
government debt.
22.
The authorities explained that they were taking steps to address the problems of
the large loss-makers. There had recently been a senior management change in the JUTC
and an initiative was underway to divest the Sugar Company. As regards Air Jamaica, they
explained that they had recently endorsed a comprehensive restructuring plan to rehabilitate
the airline over three years.
23.
Effective debt management will remain important in improving resilience to
shocks. The mission noted that a shift toward issuing variable rate instruments significantly
increased the risks to the budget of interest rate shocks, especially given a prospective
tightening of global liquidity. The mission suggested that interest savings from variable debt
appeared modest and that it would be worth exploring again whether fixed rate debt of longer
maturity could be issued at limited additional cost (Box 1).

12

Box 1. Jamaica: Debt Management
The optimal sovereign debt portfolio is the result of a complicated decision-making process, which no single
model can capture entirely. Nevertheless, a simple partial equilibrium framework can still provide some useful
insights. Using such an approach, this box examines the relative costs and benefits to the Jamaican government
of issuing variable versus fixed rate domestic debt.
Background. The market premium for fixed rate debt
increased in 2003 when interest rates were raised sharply
to defend the currency. Thereafter, even as prices
declined, the authorities have favored issuing variable
rate instruments. Variable rate debt now accounts for
70 percent of total outstanding domestic currency debt
(compared to 50 percent in 2005) and it amounts to about
48 percent of GDP currently (an increase of
13 percentage points of GDP since 2005).

Analysis. Increasing variable rate debt enabled the authorities to reduce roll-over risk (by extending maturities)
and also lower the interest bill but at the cost of increased exposure to interest rate risk. With the narrowing of
interest margins between the two types of debt and the increased maturity at which fixed rate debt can now be
placed (see table below), the benefits have mostly dissipated while the costs remain large:
•

Aggregate data suggests that the interest savings from currently shifting an additional 13 percent of
GDP in debt from fixed to variable rate would amount to under 0.1 percent of GDP annually.
Looking more closely at individual issuances that isolate differences in timing and maturity suggests
that the savings could be less than half that amount.

•

The risks and potential costs of an interest shock are, however, significant. The current 12-month
standard deviation of 37 basis points for domestic interest rates suggests that there is approximately
a one in six chance that even the meager savings could be undone entirely. If interest rates increased
suddenly by 18 percentage points as they did in 2003, the costs of having shifted 13 percentage
points of GDP in debt to variable rate instruments

would initially amount to 2½ percent of GDP
Weighted interest rate (percent)
annually.

•

At the same time, the costs of extending the
maturity of fixed rate debt are limited. Regression
estimates of the slope of the yield curve suggests
that between 2005 and now, the increase in
maturity of fixed rate debt by one year cost, on
average, between 20 to 30 basis points.

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
24.
The primary aim of monetary policy remains price stability. The authorities
explained that their policy framework targeted inflation above all other objectives. At the
same time, they emphasized the need to remain mindful of the fiscal costs of high interest
rates and to maintain competitiveness. With inflation declining rapidly, the authorities had
seized what they saw as opportunities to reduce interest rates in FY 2006/07 and
accommodate a larger expansion in base money than had been envisaged. The mission
agreed that inflation should remain the main objective of monetary policy. At the same time,
if exchange rate movements become too predictable (thus creating incentives for the market
to make one-way bets) and the interest differential vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar fell too far, there
was a risk of large destabilizing portfolio shifts.
25.
The mission suggested that flexible use of all its instruments would allow the
BOJ a greater degree of independence in pursuing inflation objectives. The mission
argued that in practice, this would imply
accommodating pressures for the exchange rate

interest rates—indeed, given the recently

rates. More generally, flexibility would avoid

creating incentives for the market to make oneway bets and would build on the developing
credibility of monetary policy. Greater flexibility would also allow for smaller and less
wrenching adjustments over time.
26.
While agreeing that flexibility eased the tasks of the BOJ in pursuing its
objectives, the authorities also emphasized the realities on the ground. They noted that
the BOJ did not seek to target any particular exchange rate path but rather found itself in
positions of having to intervene in the foreign exchange market to meet demand for domestic
liquidity. Limitations in market structure and behavior after years of financial volatility often
led banks to seek out the BOJ to sell foreign exchange. The authorities also noted that
frequent and sharp movements in the key financial variables had significant costs to
businesses and the population in a small open island economy subject to shocks.
27.
There was agreement that the current level of the exchange rate appeared
broadly appropriate from competitiveness considerations. The trade-weighted real

14
effective exchange rate as well as tourism-competitor based measures of the real exchange
rate were in line with historical levels (recent unit labor cost data are not available).
Furthermore, exports and tourism earnings were performing robustly and the current account
deficit was projected to improve further over time as the large infrastructure and tourism
projects underway bore fruit.

C. Financial Sector
28.
Progress being made now in strengthening the financial sector will help prepare
for changed circumstances in future. A draft Omnibus Banking Bill incorporates a number
of key FSAP recommendations, and the BOJ has taken steps to prepare for the early
introduction of Basel II standards while also strengthening risk monitoring capacity.
Similarly, insurance supervisory capacity has been enhanced considerably by new hiring;
progress is being made on the regulation of private pension schemes; and, work is underway
to develop a set of coherent regulations governing collective investment schemes. Other
notable achievements this past year have included parliamentary passage of the Proceeds of
Crime Act, which will, inter alia, strengthen the legal regime to combat money laundering.
29.
The mission welcomed efforts to enforce regulations and encouraged continued
enhanced supervision of activities vulnerable to interest rate risk. The authorities have
vigorously pursued unregulated trading schemes for breaches of the securities act. Continued
vigilance against pyramid schemes and more high level warnings about the dangers of
speculative investment schemes are, however, warranted and there may be need to strengthen
the technical capacity to conduct forensic investigations and prosecute, if and when, evidence
of fraud does emerge. The authorities are making progress on refining repo margins for
security dealers and, consistent with the 2005 FSAP recommendations, the mission advised
setting new requirements, on average, above current levels. Introducing more risk-sensitive
capital requirements on security dealers would also enhance their resilience (Box 2).

15

Box 2. The Rewards and Risks of the Repo Business
The securities sector in Jamaica has had a great run, taking advantage of the high yield on government
paper. Prompted by a confluence of factors, including regulatory and temporary tax advantages, the sector has
grown to play a large role in the financial system, with
18

exceeding bank deposits. The impressive growth has

largely come from the repo business—short-term

generated from the difference between short- and

profits.

13

The repo business has recently lost some of its
luster. With the flattening and downward shift of the
domestic yield curve, average annual returns on assets
fell to 1.8 percent in the year to September 2006,
compared to 2.4 percent the previous year.

rate and roll-over risk. A rise in long-term interest
rates reduces the value of fixed rate assets and a sharp
rise in short-term rates squeezes profitability, given the need to continuously roll over repo agreements with
households. Legal ambiguities on the control rights over the underlying securities could exacerbate risks.
The potential spillovers could be important, given the extent of financial conglomeration in Jamaica and
the linkages among Caribbean countries. Within Jamaica, 65 percent of the securities market is accounted for
by securities firms that belong to the eleven financial conglomerates that dominate the domestic financial
system. Within the conglomerates, the importance of the securities arm varies, ranging from 2 percent of the
total group assets to 91 percent. Moreover, many of these conglomerates are active regionally. Broadly, while
financial markets in the Caribbean remain segmented as measured by price convergence, they remain closely
linked through ownership channels, with for example, the same six banks accounting for more than 50 percent
of assets in nine countries.

16
Finally, the mission urged the authorities to prioritize developing and testing crisis
management systems.
D. Structural Reforms
30.
Deep structural reforms would reinforce the debt strategy. The mission noted
that, with room for maneuver limited, a variety of circumstances had derailed the fiscal plan
each year over the past few years. With debt still high, there was, however, little room for
slippage, going forward. The mission indicated that this suggested the need to step back and
reinvigorate the overall strategy to make it robust to the pressure points that appeared to
emerge every year. Toward that end, the mission recommended beginning preparations now
to implement deep reform in a number of areas (Figure 4):
• The tax system. There exists significant consensus in Jamaica on the need to reform
and simplify the tax system by unifying rates, reducing the number of taxes and
streamlining allowances and exemptions. The mission suggested that the issue of tax
incentives was, in particular, critical, given their fiscal costs.
• Public sector wage and employment policies. During 1995–2003, the public sector
headcount rose by over 40 percent. As part of the austerity program adopted in 2004,
the wage bill temporarily decreased as nominal wages were frozen in agreement with
unions without addressing the issue of employment. The pick-up in the wage bill
again, however, suggests that this approach is not sustainable and requires a multiyear plan of fundamental reform.
• Public entities. Jamaica has a multitude of off-budget public entities, some of which
are vehicles for public policy while others are commercial ventures. Although the
entities’ expenditures are monitored, their operations, overall balances, and debt
obligations are not consolidated into a unified framework amenable to formulating
and assessing the overall direction of fiscal policy. As initial steps, the mission
recommended preparation of a fiscal ROSC and offered Fund assistance on assessing
major fiscal risks from public enterprises. It also suggested that additional Fund
technical assistance could be helpful for putting in place a consolidated public sector
accounting framework.
• Financial sector. Legislation to clarify the legal framework for repos and to
empower the Financial Services Commission to obtain information for consolidated
supervision and to impose penalties would be helpful. There is also scope to continue
to strengthen inter-agency collaboration for supervision and regulation of
conglomerates, including by developing a protocol for joint on-site inspection. The
authorities are also encouraged to explore with their counterparts in other Caribbean
countries the options for strengthening regional supervision.

17

18

• Business environment. The authorities are encouraged to review the scope for
reducing red tape and streamline government, including by consolidating and
eliminating duplicate requirements, institutions and functions.
31.
The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to undertake structural reforms.
They explained that they were working with the Inter-American Development Bank to
strengthen the business climate. They agreed that the system of tax incentives merited review
and reiterated their ongoing efforts to strengthen public enterprises.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
The Jamaican authorities have secured some notable policy successes during the
past year. Economic growth is at its best in a long time and the current account deficit is on
an improving trend. The authorities have also succeeded in sharply reducing inflation and in
bringing about a recovery in revenue collections after the decline recorded last year. A
number of important financial sector reforms are proceeding apace.
33.
Against this background, the substantial breach of the deficit target in
FY 2006/07 and resulting lack of progress at reducing debt are unfortunate. The
authorities have tended to rely on stop gap measures, such as a wage freeze, to help achieve
their fiscal and debt objectives. Developments this past year have shown that policies to
anchor ambitious medium-term programs should look beyond just short run exigencies to
deep and long-lasting reforms.
34.
The authorities are, therefore, advised to initiate, while conditions still remain
benign, deep reforms that can deliver sustained and durable debt reduction. The
medium-term program adopted in 2004 is now in need of a fundamental reinvigoration.
Toward that end, the upcoming elections provide an opportunity to create the broad political
consensus necessary to carry through with long standing reforms. The authorities are
encouraged to set in place a renewed strategy to reform the tax system; address public
employment; and, undertake a comprehensive reassessment of the size and appropriate role
in the economy of the public sector. The latter, in conjunction with other steps to improve the
business environment, will foster private sector led growth, which remains indispensable for
bringing down the burden of indebtedness.
35.
The authorities will also need to remain vigilant against vicissitudes in market
conditions and sentiments, and in this regard, their commitment to reduce the deficit in
FY 2007/08 is welcome. The authorities are urged to aim for a primary surplus of at least
10 percent of GDP and take the measures necessary to credibly deliver on such a target. They
will also need to continue to pursue public enterprise reform. They could consider Fund
technical assistance in creating a framework to identify risk from off-budget entities,

19
preparing a Fiscal ROSC, and putting in place a consolidated public sector accounting
framework.
36.
The limited room for fiscal policy maneuverability in Jamaica reinforces the
need for flexible monetary and exchange rate policies and for further strengthening the
financial sector. The authorities’ readiness to increase interest rates, if and when necessary,
is important in this respect. This, in turn, underscores the benefits of improving the resiliency
of the debt profile and the financial sector to interest rate shocks. At the same time, vigilance
against the dangers of unregulated speculative investment schemes, strengthening
consolidated supervision, and prioritizing the development and testing of crisis management
systems remain critical.
37.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place within the
standard 12-month cycle.

expenditure in FY 2006/07 are carried over to FY 2007/08.
2/ Accrued interest on previous year's BoJ Special Issue bonds is contractually paid to the BoJ through debt
issuance the following year. Beginning in 2008/09 the central government pays this interest concurrently, which results in two
payments in FY 2008/09.

Debt-stabilizing
primary
balance 9/

1/ Central government and government guaranteed debt on gross basis. From FY 2002/03, includes debt issued to the BoJ to cover its cash losses and related capitalized interest.
FY 2006/07 debt includes US$350 million in prefinancing. The primary balance includes budgetary primary balance and Bank of Jamaica losses.
Debt dynamics only drive Central Government debt, not Government Guaranteed debt.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP. Includes Government Guaranteed debt.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Real GDP growth (in percent)
Average nominal interest rate on public debt (in percent) 8/
Average real interest rate (nominal rate minus change in GDP deflator, in percent)
Nominal appreciation (increase in US dollar value of local currency, in percent)
Inflation rate (GDP deflator, in percent)
Growth of real primary spending (deflated by GDP deflator, in percent)

APPENDIX I. BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF APPENDICES
Discussions. The 2007 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Kingston during
February 5–16, 2007. The mission met with Finance Minister Omar Davies, Governor Derick
Latibeaudiere, Financial Secretary Colin Bullock, other senior officials, representatives of the
private sector, and the opposition. The staff team comprised Sanjaya Panth (Head),
Jinqqing Chai, Chris Faircloth and Rafael Romeu (all WHD); and, Piyabha Kongsamut
(PDR). Ms. Atkinson (WHD) joined the team for the final discussions, as did Mr. Fried
(Executive Director) and Ms. Morgan (OED).
Exchange arrangement. Jamaica has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and
4, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current
transactions. Beginning September 17, 1990, the external value of the Jamaican dollar has
been determined in an interbank market operated by commercial banks. Jamaica’s exchange
regime is classified by the Fund as a managed float with no pre-determined path.

Fund Relations. Jamaica has no outstanding purchases or loans. The last financial
arrangement was an Extended Fund Arrangement for the period 12/11/92 to 03/16/96 totaling
SDR$109 million (of which SDR$77.8 million was drawn). The post of the resident
representative in Jamaica was closed in August 1997.
Technical Assistance. In 2006, a CARTAC/FAD mission evaluated tax and customs
administration performance and prepared a set of recommendations to strengthen the
operations of the Jamaica Tax Administration. The Fund has also provided TA on banking
supervision and national accounts methodology in recent years.
Statistical Issues. Data provision to the Fund is adequate for surveillance purposes despite
weaknesses in national accounts and the lack of producer price and international investment
position (IIP) data. Efforts are being made to improve the national accounts, including
through updating the base year. The authorities are also in the process of revising their CPI
weightings and preparatory work is underway to begin compiling IIP data. This latter effort
has been supported by the Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance Center (CARTAC) and
the European Union.
Relations with the World Bank Group. At March 30, 2007, the active portfolio of the Bank
stood at US$139 million, of which US$53 million remains undisbursed. The Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Jamaica was approved by the WB Executive Board on
May 10, 2005. The CAS proposes financial assistance of up to US$150 million between 2006
and 2009 in support of: (i) accelerating inclusive economic growth, (ii) improving human
development and opportunity, and (iii) preventing and reducing crime.
Relations with the Inter-American Development Bank. As of February 2007, Jamaica’s
outstanding debt to the IDB stood at US$637 million, of which US$607 million were public
sector loans and US$30 million were loans to the private sector. In August 2006, the IDB
approved a new country strategy for the 2006–09 period. The principal areas of focus are:
(i) private sector development; (ii) value for money; and (iii) reducing vulnerability to natural
disasters.

VII. Implementation of HIPC Initiative: Not Applicable
VIII. Implementation of Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI): Not Applicable
IX. Exchange Rate Arrangements:
The external value of the Jamaican dollar has been determined in an interbank market
operated by commercial banks beginning September 17, 1990. The Jamaican dollar has
depreciated significantly since then, though not in a uniform trend. At January 31, it was
trading at around J$67 to the U.S. dollar. At the conclusion of the 2004 Article IV

33
consultation for Jamaica, it was found that a multiple currency practice arose from the
implementation of the surrender requirement where authorized foreign exchange dealers and
cambios are required to surrender at least 5 percent—but not more than 10 percent—of their
purchases of U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars and pound sterling to the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ).
This surrender requirement is effected based on the previous day’s average selling rate for
the U.S. dollar, the Canadian dollar and the pound sterling, respectively, against the Jamaican
dollar (referred below as “surrender rates”). In 2004, the surrender rates had resulted in the
cross rates between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar and between the U.S. dollar and
the pound sterling to differ periodically (for more than five days) by more than 1 percent
from the midpoint spot exchange rates for those two currency pairs in their principal markets.
While such differences were observed in 2004 leading to a finding that a multiple currency
practice arose, the previously identified broken cross rate arising from the currency surrender
requirement is no longer apparent since this time. Therefore, there is no evidence that a
multiple currency practice arises from the surrender requirement.
X.

Last Article IV Consultation and Program Relations:

Jamaica is under intensified surveillance whereby staff monitor the implementation of the
economic strategy formulated by the authorities without reaching prior understandings with
the Fund. The last Article IV consultation was completed by the Executive Board on
March 24, 2006 (IMF Country Report Nos. 06/158 and 06/157). Interim staff reports are
prepared for information of the Executive Board in-between Article IV consultations (IMF
Country Report Nos. 06/324, 05/219, and 05/61).

Appendix II. Jamaica—Relations with the World Bank
(As of March 30, 2007)
The new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Jamaica was discussed by the WB Board of
Executive Directors on May 10, 2005. The document proposes financial assistance of up to
US$150 million between 2006 and 2009, as well as technical and advisory services. The
CAS will support the Government’s own Medium Term Socioeconomic Policy Framework
for 2004-2009 with lending, analytical, and technical assistance to accelerate inclusive
economic growth, improve human development and opportunity, and help prevent and
reduce crime. It was prepared in collaboration with the government and was widely consulted
and discussed with other donors, representatives of the private sector, CBOs, Chambers of
Commerce, trade unions, and academic institutions. As part of the assistance program, the
Bank will undertake analytical work including a Poverty Assessment, a Financial Sector
Assessment Program (jointly with the International Monetary Fund), a Country Fiduciary
Assessment (jointly with the Inter-American Development Bank), and a Diagnostic of the
Investment Climate. The Bank Group assistance program will include support from the
International Finance Corporation (IFC), focused on investment in infrastructure, the
financial sector, services and other sectors, and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee
Facility (MIGA), focused on development of the financial sector and key infrastructure.
A. Projects
The Jamaica Reform of Secondary Education Project II was approved in March 2003 for
US$39.8 million. In support of Jamaica's fifteen-year program to reform secondary
education, the Project will improve the quality, and equity of secondary education, and
expand access to upper secondary education, as well as strengthen the capacity of the central
ministry, and regional offices to manage, and monitor the reform. The components of the
Second Reform of Secondary Education Project will: 1) finance grants to selected secondary
schools, on the basis of annual work programs, and budgets for activities designed to
improve student outcomes, as well as direct costs associated with preparing, and
implementing school improvement plans. Technical assistance will support the preparation of
a school improvement plan manual, and training materials, while training assistance in school
development, and management will be provided; 2) finance centrally coordinated activities
that complement the bottom up approach, and support all-age schools not eligible for school
improvement grants (SIGs), to rally national literacy programs, and mathematics, by
providing tools for teachers to diagnose the specific learning problems, enriching libraries
and media centers, and supporting counseling for at-risk youths; 3) provide access to upper
secondary school, by securing excess capacity in independent secondary schools, through
construction of new schools, and extension of existing selected schools; and, 4) support the
Ministry of Education, and regional offices in the implementation of the above components,
as their role shifts from centralized, to one responsive to school-based demands for technical
assistance, and continuous support on monitoring outcomes.
The Jamaica HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project was approved in August 2002 for
US$15 million. The HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project for Jamaica is part of the
Second Phase Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Adaptable Program Lending
(APL) for the Caribbean Region, which provides loans and/or credits to governments in the

36
Region to finance their HIV/AIDS programs. Jamaica has met the five eligibility criteria for
country participation. This project aims to support selected activities of Jamaica’s HIV/AIDS
National Strategic Plan (NSP). Using a multi-sectoral approach, it assists the Government of
Jamaica in curbing the spread of the HIV epidemic through 1) the expansion of preventive
programs targeted to high-risk groups as well as the general population; 2) the strengthening
of treatment, care, and support for persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA); and 3) the
strengthening of Jamaica's multisectoral capacity to respond to the epidemic
The Jamaica Social Safety Net Project was approved in February 2002 for US$40 million.
The Social Safety Net Project is supporting the Government's efforts to transform the social
safety net into a fiscally sound, and efficient system of social assistance for the poor, and
vulnerable groups. The components will: 1) finance conditional grants for poor children (up
to age 17), eligible under the program. Direct costs regarding schooling, and health care
delivery will be financed by those grants, conditioned on regular health clinic visits for
children up to the age of six not enrolled in school, and for children on school attendance up
to the age of seventeen; 2) finance conditional grants to poor pregnant/lactating mothers,
elderly poor over the age of sixty-five, and poor disabled, and destitute adults under the age
of sixty-five, eligible under the program. Benefits will be conditional on regular health clinic
visits for adult beneficiaries; and, 3) strengthen the institutional capacity of the Ministry of
Labor and Social Security, and institutions involved in the operation, and streamlining of the
social safety net in Jamaica. Support will be provided for enrollment mechanisms of
temporary employees, hired for data processing, including as well the financing of the
necessary technology information equipment, and software. Technical assistance, will
support implementation of the scoring formula, based on data from the Survey of Living
Conditions, namely at the early stages, when the scoring formula will require periodic
review, and refinement. Also included are training, and promotion assistance, project
management costs, and, monitoring, and evaluation systems.
The Jamaica National Community Development Project was approved in April 2003 for
US$15 million. The National Community Development Project aims at providing basic
services and creating temporary employment opportunities for the poorest groups in Jamaica.
To this end, several subprojects have been identified as priority by these communities for
funding by the Jamaica Social Investment Fund (JSIF). The project components include:
1) financing of demand-driven, and community-implemented socioeconomic infrastructure
works, and activities, through subprojects that include construction, and rehabilitation of
basic infrastructure, and social super-structure facilities. Community assessments will be
implemented, to ensure appropriate skills (or ability to acquire skills), and resources
availability to manage the proposed community-contracted works; 2) financing for technical
assistance, training, and strengthening programs to JSIF, and the various entities to be
involved in the project, particularly to support the Community Based Contracting (CBC)
system. Financing will also be provided for additional consultants to support implementation
of community contracting; and, 3) funding for goods required to facilitate subproject
supervision, monitoring, and community training.
The Jamaica Inner City Basic Services for the Poor Project was approved in March 2006
for US$29.3 million. The project development objective is to improve quality of life in 12
Jamaican inner-city areas and poor urban informal settlements through improved access to
basic urban infrastructure, financial services, land tenure regularization, enhanced

37
community capacity and improvements in public safety. Specifically, the project will:
(a) increase access and improve the quality of water, sanitation, solid waste collection
systems, electricity, roads, drainage and related community infrastructure for over 60,000
residents of poor urban informal settlements through capital investments and innovative
arrangements for operations and maintenance; (b) facilitate access to microfinance for
enterprise development and incremental home improvement for entrepreneurs and residents
in project areas; (c) increase security of tenure for eligible households in project areas; and
(d) enhance public safety through mediation services, community capacity building, skills
training and related social services.
B. Economic and Sector Work
During 2003 and 2004, the Bank prepared a Country Economic Memorandum focused on
issues related to accelerating inclusive economic growth and, during 2004 and 2005, a Public
Expenditure Review examining public expenditure allocation priorities and public sector
reform issues in Jamaica’s tight fiscal environment. In addition, a study on growth and
competitiveness issues in the Caribbean recently completed by the Bank provides the
Government with insights and policy recommendations for improving the competitiveness of
the economy. The dissemination of these reports represented a key instrument for policy
discussion with the Government on the country’s development priorities and the Bank’s
assistance strategy.
A Poverty Assessment currently under preparation will provide an updated assessment of
poverty levels and will focus on poverty and the labor market, and the link between crime
and violence and poverty. Work on a Country Fiduciary Assessment (CFA), in collaboration
with the Inter-American Development Bank, is underway to help strengthen public financial
management and procurement. It will also help to provide a sound basis for the
harmonization and alignment with the country’s procurement and financial management
systems. To help create a positive enabling environment for private sector driven growth, the
Bank is also undertaking a Diagnostic of Investment Climate which will provide policy
recommendations complementary to the recently completed study on growth and
competitiveness issues in the Caribbean.
The Bank will continue the informal monitoring of macroeconomic developments given the
vulnerability of the economy. This will be done within the context of the results based
monitoring framework agreed between the Government and the donors. In addition, the Bank
will undertake just-in-time policy notes to follow-up on specific findings and
recommendations of the studies undertaken during the CAS period and other issues jointly
identified with the authorities.
In addition to the country specific analytical work, Jamaica will benefit from ongoing and
planned regional studies. A Caribbean regional study on Crime, Violence and Social
Exclusion would focus on the impact of crime on tourism, investment, poverty, and social
cohesion. This would be a multi-sectoral endeavor aimed at developing recommendations
that would draw on experience from successful interventions in Brazil and elsewhere. The
Bank has completed a Social Protection Strategy Review paper for the Caribbean, including a
focus on Jamaica. The objective of the strategy is to strengthen the Bank’s ability to support
clients on social protection through: (i) better understanding the key socio-economic risks,
existing country-level social protection programs, coverage and implementation gaps, and
outstanding country-level needs; (ii) stronger coordination with country counterparts and

38
donors; and (iii) more strategic emphasis on the Bank's comparative advantage in the region.
A Caribbean regional study on Migration, Remittances and the Diaspora will examine the
impact of migration and its implications for public policy decisions surrounding the financing
of higher education and skills development; the impact, facilitation, and potential leverage of
remittance flows; and the potential for the growth of niche markets among the diaspora. This
work will be undertaken in close collaboration with other donors, most notably the IDB.
Additional planned regional studies cover issues related to pension reform, health financing,
and the infrastructure and financial sectors

Appendix III. JAMAICA—Relations with the Inter-American Development Bank
Jamaica joined the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) in 1969. Since then, the
IDB has approved 95 loans (78 projects) to Jamaica amounting to US$1.8 billion and 179
technical cooperation operations totaling US$59.6 million. IDB financial assistance has
supported a wide range of infrastructural, environmental and social sector projects with a
view to enhancing Jamaica’s human resource and absorptive capacity and strengthening the
foundation for private sector-led growth. In addition, the IDB has supported reforms aimed at
strengthening the institutional and regulatory environment.
The IDB is the leading lender to Jamaica among multilateral development partners. As of
February 2007, Jamaica’s outstanding debt to the IDB stood at US$637 million, of which
US$607 million were public sector loans and US$30 million were loans to the private sector.
The total represents 11 percent of public external debt and half of multilateral debt.
Nevertheless, the IDB’s share of total public external debt—like that of most other
multilateral and bilateral agencies—has declined since 2003.

As of February 2007, the Bank’s portfolio consisted of 10 investment loans valued at
US$217.8 million, and 28 non-reimbursable technical cooperations (TC) valued at
US$13.0 million. Forty-three percent of the IDB project funds and fifty-two percent of the
TC funds have been disbursed, leaving some US$130.5 million available for disbursement.

Over time, growing government current expenditures—particularly on interest payments and
wages and salaries—have crowded out capital expenditures. The reduction in the
government’s investment program caused budgetary allocations to IDB-supported projects to
fall far short of that needed for a normal pace of implementation, particularly in the period
from 2002/03 to 2004/05. This slowed project execution and extended project lifetimes,
delayed or prevented the achievement of development objectives, and increased the ratio of
project administration and financial costs to disbursements (Table 3).

In recognition of this, and in order to make the IDB portfolio of projects more consistent with
available fiscal space, the government and IDB have collaborated to rationalize the portfolio
through partial cancellation of loans while trying to minimize the impact of cancellations on
the likely achievement of the portfolio’s development objectives. In October 2004, the
government and IDB agreed to cancel US$49.8 million in loan resources from nine out of the
13 projects. In 2006, the government and IDB made further partial cancellations of
US$10 million. In FY2006/07, government capital expenditures have increased and IDBsupported projects have received better budget allocations, resulting in an improved pace of
project implementation.
In August 2006, the IDB approved a new country strategy for the 2006–09 period. In view of
the aforementioned fiscal space issue, the new strategy de-emphasizes public sector
investment lending and instead focuses on policy-based lending, grant modalities, and
lending to the private sector. The principal areas of focus are: (i) private sector development;
(ii) value for money; and (iii) reducing vulnerability to natural disasters.
Growing repayments from lending in the late 1990s and the constraints on disbursements on
investment projects caused by the lack of fiscal space have resulted in negative net loan
flows since 2005 (Table 4).

Appendix IV. Jamaica—Statistical Issues
Data provision to the Fund is adequate for surveillance purposes despite weaknesses in
national accounts and the lack of producer price and international investment position data.
In early 2003, Jamaica started participating in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS), which provides participants with a framework for the development of the
statistical system. Jamaica should now focus its efforts on improving its data and
dissemination practices by moving towards the goal of subscribing to the Special Data
Dissemination Standards (SDDS) over the medium term.

National accounts
There are significant weaknesses in the national accounts and other real sector data. In regard
to GDP estimates, concerns relate both to its level and growth rate. Addressing these
shortcomings has been hindered, inter alia, by insufficient legal authority granted to the
Statistical Institute of Jamaica (STATIN) to collect source data, as well as by institutional
weaknesses, and a lack of resources. However, efforts are being made to improve the
national accounts, including through updating the base year. Assistance on national accounts
methodology has been provided by Statistics Canada and by a STA technical assistance
mission in June 2001. The first publication of quarterly national accounts was issued in
August 2002.
Prices
Expenditure weights of the consumer price index (CPI) are derived from a household
expenditure survey carried out in 1984, with the base for the index being January 1988,
resulting in an apparent inconsistency. STATIN is in the process of updating weights based
on a household survey conducted in 2004–05 and the revamped CPI is expected to be
released in 2007.
Production
No data on industrial production, wholesale or producer prices, import volumes, or export
and import prices have been reported for publication in the International Financial Statistics
(IFS) in recent years.

43
Government finance statistics
These data are available at:
Debt: http://www.mof.gov.jm/dmu/
Budget: http://www.mof.gov.jm/programmes/em/fpmu/default.shtml
Fiscal data is not currently reported for publication in the IFS. In 2005, the authorities
reported data for 2003, in GFSM 2001 format, for publication in the 2005 GFS Yearbook.
Monetary and financial statistics
Monetary statistics published by the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ) are sectorized, classified, and
valued in accordance with international standards, and are provided to the Fund in a timely
manner. Currently, information on deposit money banks and monetary authorities is being
reported on a regular basis. The BOJ initiated the submission of monetary and financial
statistics based on standardized report forms in March 2007.
Balance of payments
The BOJ compiles and disseminates balance of payments statistics on a monthly and annual
basis. Detailed annual balance of payments data are reported by the BOJ for publication in
the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook (BOPSY) and the IFS. At present, the BOJ does
not compile International Investment Position (IIP) statistics although it has begun
preparatory work with assistance from the Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance Center
(CARTAC) and the European Union.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
JAMAICA
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2007 Consultation with Jamaica
Approved by Caroline Atkinson and Anthony Boote
April 20, 2007
1.
This supplement provides an update on the fiscal outturn for FY 2006/07 and the
authorities’ budget proposal for FY 2007/08. The new information reinforces the thrust of
the staff appraisal contained in the staff report (4/11/07).
2.
Recent data releases suggest that the growth momentum may be slowing but
inflation remains on target. Real manufacturing activity appears to have weakened toward
the end of 2006. Tourist arrivals for the first three months of 2007 have also been lower than
anticipated. Real economic growth for FY 2006/07 may, therefore, be somewhat lower than
the 3 percent expected earlier. Annual consumer price inflation, meanwhile, ended the fiscal
year at 6½ percent, down from 11½ percent the previous year. International reserves
recovered in March to reach US$2.3 billion, just shy of the all time high reached at end-2006.
3.
As anticipated in the staff report (4/11/07), the budgetary outturn for
FY 2006/07 was weaker than indicated by data available earlier. The authorities now
estimate that J$5.5 billion (0.8 percent of GDP) in capital spending occurred in FY 2006/07
on central government projects funded by donors and PetroCaribe that were not picked up by
the normal reporting process for spending. Preliminary information also suggests that
revenues are likely to have ended the year somewhat lower than expected earlier. All in all,
the overall budget deficit for FY 2006/07 is now estimated at 5.7 percent of GDP, compared
to 4.7 percent of GDP indicated by earlier data (see tables 1 & 2). The primary balance is
also now correspondingly lower. The earlier debt data had, however, already picked up the
obligations associated with the higher capital spending and, therefore, debt estimates remain
broadly unchanged from the staff report (4/11/07).
4.
The draft FY 2007/08 budget submitted to parliament recently envisages an
improvement in the primary balance by about 2 percent of GDP, to 10¼ percent of
GDP under staff definitions. Parliamentary debate on the government’s budget proposal
commenced on April 12. In their presentation of the FY 2007/08 budget, the authorities are

2
recognizing under capital spending J$12.5 billion associated with previous years.1 Staff
presentations in the attached tables have allocated these amounts to the appropriate earlier
years and, therefore, capital spending as well as the overall balance differ from the
authorities’ official budget presentations.
5.
The FY 2007/08 budget sets a high bar for tax administration and envisages new
capital expenditures to replace one-off spending in FY 2006/07. The budget includes two
tax measures (cigarette tax and environmental levy on imports) expected to yield 0.2 percent
of GDP. At the same time, a new exemption to the existing Customs User Fee will lead to
some loss in revenue. Nevertheless, the authorities are hoping to increase total tax revenues
by 1½ percentage points of GDP, to 28½ percent in FY 2007/08 by strengthening tax
administration, including improving procedures to verify refunds. The budget envisages the
expenditure-to-GDP ratio at 34¼ percent in FY 2007/08, down by about 1¼ percentage
points from FY 2006/07. Budgeted amounts, however, still allow for an increase in capital
spending if the one-off nature of the FY 2006/07 Cricket World Cup spending (estimated at
around 1.1 percent of GDP) is taken into account. The new capital spending is broad-based
but with some concentration in the areas of transportation, public works, and education.
6.
The staff welcomes the planned improvement in the primary balance but
considers that achieving it will require additional tax policy or expenditure measures.
Such measures (see staff report of 4/11/07, paragraph 19) will need to be implemented earlier
rather than later in FY 2007/08 to secure the planned adjustment within the fiscal year. While
strengthened tax administration has already delivered measurable successes in FY 2006/07,
generating sufficient additional resources from this source alone will likely become
increasingly difficult.
7.
The authorities’ efforts to regularize the budget recording and reporting
procedures are welcome and should continue. The provision made in the FY 2007/08
budget for past expenditures undertaken through special financing schemes exemplifies the
authorities’ existing commitment to fiscal transparency. At the same time, it also highlights
the potential benefits of carrying out a thorough review of fiscal standards and codes,
creating a framework to identify risk from off-budget entities, and putting in place a stronger
consolidated public sector accounting framework.

1

This figure includes the J$5.5 billion referred to in paragraph 3 and J$0.4 billion in
FY 2005/06, as well as other amounts for deferred financing (see footnote 3 in table 2) and
the take-over of public entity debt.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 4, 2007

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with
Jamaica
On April 30, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the 2007 Article IV consultation with Jamaica.1
Background
Jamaica’s economy is estimated to have achieved its best growth performance in over a
decade during FY 2006/07, which ended on March 31, 2007. Notwithstanding some
recent moderation of momentum, the economy is estimated to have expanded by just
under 3 percent in real terms, up from 2 percent the previous year and 0.4 percent the
year before. While tourist arrivals have recently weakened, they were robust through
December 2006 and agricultural activity has rebounded sharply after the weatherrelated shocks encountered during 2004–05.
Inflation has fallen significantly. Annual consumer price growth fell to 6½ percent at endFY 2006/07, compared to a target of 9½ percent and a recent high of 19 percent in
September 2005. The rebound in agriculture, which weighs heavily in the consumer
price basket, has contributed to the decline in headline inflation.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
On the external front, the current account deficit is estimated to have strengthened by
1 percent of GDP in FY 2006/07 to 10½ percent of GDP, largely on account of
increased exports alongside robust tourism receipts and remittances. Capital inflows
enabled a sharp build up in net international reserves (NIR) through 2006 and they
currently remain broadly at historical highs.
However, fiscal targets for FY 2006/07 were missed by a wide margin notwithstanding
the overall strong economic context. The fiscal slippage is primarily attributable to higher
expenditures, although revenues also fell short of the ambitious target set out in the
budget. A variety of mid-year expenditure increases were approved in a supplementary
budget, mainly relating to agreed public sector wage increases and higher interest
costs. As a result, budgetary expenditures for the 2006/07 fiscal year as a whole are
estimated to have exceeded fiscal targets by 2½ percent of GDP. Little progress was
made in reducing public debt—which stands at about 132 percent of GDP (excluding a
recent bond to pre-finance FY 2007/08 obligations).
Monetary policy remains focused on containing inflation while also seeking to engender
a sustainable reduction in interest rates. With inflation declining, the Bank of Jamaica
eased monetary policy during FY 2006/07 by removing special deposit requirements on
banks and reducing interest rates in three steps during May–December, to 12 percent
on six-month instruments currently.
Financial sector soundness indicators for regulated entities remain robust despite a
search for high yields. With (ex post) real rates of return on treasury bills declining
sharply, financial institutions have sought out profitable lending opportunities and bank
credit to the private sector has increased markedly. Nevertheless, prudential indicators
for both banks and other regulated financial institutions remain sound. However,
anecdotal evidence suggests that there has also been an apparent rise in unregulated
investment schemes promising very high returns.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for recent policy successes and noted
the strong economic growth in 2006/07, and the declining trend in the current account
deficit. The authorities have also succeeded in sharply reducing inflation and bringing
about a recovery in revenue collections after their decline in FY 2005/06.
Nevertheless, Directors expressed concern regarding the substantial breach of the
deficit target in FY 2006/07, which related in part to one-off expenditures, and the limited
progress in reducing the very high debt burden. They considered the medium-term
macroeconomic program adopted in 2004 now in need of a fundamental reinvigoration.
In this context, Directors saw the need for a broad political consensus to carry through
the reforms necessary to secure sustained debt reduction.
Directors viewed fostering private sector led growth as critical to reducing the debt
burden. Toward that end, they encouraged the authorities to reform the tax system, and
to move ahead with reforms of the civil service aimed at improving efficiency. They also
considered that steps to improve the business environment would raise the growth and
employment impact of private sector investment.

3
Directors welcomed the planned improvement in the FY 2007/08 primary budget target
as a promising start and an important signal of the authorities’ continuing commitment to
debt reduction. However, while welcoming progress at strengthening tax administration,
Directors noted that it would be challenging to achieve the authorities’ revenue
objectives through such means alone. Most Directors recommended additional tax and
expenditure actions to secure the budgetary objectives. To improve fiscal control and
transparency, several Directors encouraged the authorities to continue the process of
consolidating the operations of off-budget entities into a single unified framework.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to pursue public enterprise reform and
strengthen the framework to formulate and assess the overall direction of fiscal policy.
They recommended preparation of a fiscal Report on the Observance of Standards and
Codes, Fund technical assistance to help improve public financial management, and to
put in place a consolidated public sector accounting framework.
Directors pointed to the improving credibility of monetary policy in Jamaica and
underscored the benefits of increased monetary and exchange rate flexibility. Given
fiscal dominance in Jamaica, Directors considered exchange and interest rate flexibility
crucial to allowing the Bank of Jamaica greater independence in pursuing inflation
objectives.
Directors welcomed progress in financial sector reforms as an important element to
guard against swings in market conditions and sentiments. Looking forward, they
underscored the benefits of the authorities’ efforts to improve the resilience of the debt
profile to interest rate shocks. Directors also called for increased vigilance over
speculative investment schemes, and recommended continued efforts to strengthen
consolidated supervision, and prioritizing the development and testing of crisis
management systems.

Statement by Jonathan Fried, Executive Director for Jamaica
and Murna Morgan, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
April 30, 2007
My authorities wish to express their appreciation to the staff for the frank, open and
constructive discussions that have characterized the Article IV consultations in recent years.
The staff’s assessment of the overarching challenge facing Jamaica - fiscal and debt
sustainability - coincides with that of the authorities. There is broad agreement not only on
what is desirable but what is feasible, which reflects greater understanding by the staff of
some of the constraints faced. My authorities place tremendous value on the Fund’s role in
monitoring and assessing Jamaica’s home-grown medium-term macroeconomic policy
framework and look forward to continued cordial dialogue, collaboration and support.
Recent Economic Developments
Economic performance in 2006/07 was somewhat mixed. Notwithstanding higher oil prices,
Jamaica’s inflation rate dropped sharply to 6.6 percent (compared with a projected
9 percent), significantly lower than the 11.4 percent recorded in 2005/06 and 13.2 percent for
2004/05. This outcome mainly reflected lower prices for agricultural products following
recovery in the agriculture sector. Following an average growth of 1.3 percent for the period
2000-05, economic activity expanded by 2.5 percent in 2006, and though moderate, was the
highest in 11 years. The catalysts for this expansion were a higher level of investment by the
public sector in much needed infrastructure and activities related to the Cricket World Cup,
as well as private investment mainly in the tourism sector; the recovery in agriculture which
benefited from favorable weather conditions and implementation of measures to increase
production and productivity; continued strong growth in the tourism industry; and a generally
favorable external environment. In keeping with this increase in economic activity,
unemployment declined in 2006. The foreign exchange market remained relatively stable,
the external accounts improved marginally, and augmented by significant capital inflows,
international reserves grew. Notwithstanding these positive developments, Jamaica’s
budgeted fiscal target was not met.
Fiscal Policy and Debt
Jamaica’s 2006/07 central government operations realized a fiscal deficit of 5.7 percent,
significantly higher than budgeted. Although revenue performance was better than in
2005/06, it underperformed relative to budget projections. Expenditure was above budget
due to higher than programmed public sector wage increases, interest payments and
increased capital expenditure on Cricket World Cup related activities and on-going road
works. Jamaica’s allocation for participation in the new World Bank sponsored Caribbean
Catastrophic Risk Insurance Facility was not contemplated in the budget.
My authorities appreciate the staff’s concern about the increase in the public sector wage bill
and wish to assure the Board that due cognizance has been given to fiscal prudence.
However, after a two-year wage freeze in the context of higher than projected inflation
during the period, an acceptable compromise had to be reached with public sector workers,
and this was signaled by the authorities. Jamaica has been losing skilled workers, in
particular nurses and teachers, to recruitment by offshore employers. Faced with the reality

2
of the international marketability of these professionals, my authorities were not prepared to
risk domestic deterioration of basic services and the consequent social instability. As a
consequence, the government opted to front-load the agreed two-year wage adjustment under
the second memorandum of understanding (MOU II) between the government, public sector
workers and the represented trade unions. This accommodation resulted in a much larger
than programmed wage bill, a necessary trade-off to enable the government to retain
qualified, skilled professionals to provide necessary public services at acceptable levels. As
a result, in 2007/08 there will be a reduction in the rate of growth in wages.
The Jamaican authorities acknowledge that the large debt burden poses serious challenges to
the country’s long-term growth and development. Accordingly, the major thrust of the
medium-term macroeconomic program has been fiscal consolidation and improved
management of the debt dynamics. The generation of double digit primary surpluses has
been an integral part of the fiscal consolidation effort for many years. Despite widespread
doubts, Jamaica has generated and maintained high primary surpluses, averaging 10 percent
over the past five years. This is a clear demonstration of the authorities’ commitment to
fiscal discipline and preparedness to tackle the debt problem. This has not been without
costs. One of the policy challenges constantly faced, therefore, is finding the right balance
between reasonable levels of capital expenditure, long advocated by the staff, and the
generation of double digit primary surpluses.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
The central bank – the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ) – and the staff are in full accord regarding the
need for flexibility in the use of all monetary policy instruments and for increased
independence, to facilitate the bank’s pursuit of its inflation objective. The BOJ fully intends
to maintain flexibility in the conduct of exchange rate policy. The BOJ’s intervention in the
foreign exchange market is limited to smoothing exchange rate fluctuations while providing
sufficient liquidity to the market to meet demands. The BOJ does not target a particular
exchange rate path, nor does it predetermine rates and makes no judgment as to what the rate
should be. Accordingly, interventions take place using current market-determined exchange
rates.
Regarding the issue of interest rates, the BOJ has demonstrated its willingness to increase as
well as decrease interest rates when necessary. The central bank does not share the staff’s
view that the recent market volatility presents a case for a preemptive increase in interest
rates. Variable rate debt accounts for 60 percent of the domestic debt and the staff has
rightly noted that this presents increased risks and increased potential costs if there is an
interest rate shock. With that in mind, rate increases by the central bank must be based on a
need to correct genuine disequilibria in the market.
From the BOJ’s perspective, the instability in the foreign exchange market in January 2007
arose from transitory demand pressures and portfolio switching in the context of limited
domestic assets, and that it created no major disequilibrium in the financial market.
Moreover, with continued lower inflation in the first three months of 2007 and increased
investor confidence, the BOJ’s assessment is that the situation does not justify a pre-emptive
increase in rates.

3
The current monetary policy stance is consistent with achieving the programmed core
inflation. The authorities’ position has been vindicated by the results of the treasury bill
auctions in March 2007, which saw further declines in these market-determined rates. In
addition, in March 2007, Jamaica successfully tapped the international capital markets and
pre-financed its 2007/08 external borrowing program with a new 32-year bond with a yield
of 8.125 percent.
Notwithstanding these developments, the BOJ stands ready to increase the interest rates, if
conditions in the market dictate.
Financial Sector
The staff noted that by all indicators, the health of the financial sector remains strong and that
Jamaica has made progress in strengthening regulations. Mindful of its costly experience
with the sector and its severe and long-term impact on the debt and fiscal performance, the
Jamaican authorities, in consultation with stakeholders, will continue their efforts to ensure
effective regulation of the financial sector. Work is ongoing to improve the legislative
framework and strengthen the institutional structure of the sector.
In 2006, the BOJ advanced work to reform the payments system. Following extensive
consultations with stakeholders, legislation is being drafted to provide for (a) the regulation
and operation of a national payments system for which the BOJ will have regulatory
oversight; and (b) the establishment of a central securities depository for fixed income
securities to allow for the immobilization, electronic trading and settlement of these
securities. The depository will be operated by the BOJ.
Structural Reforms
Successful implementation of structural reforms is necessary to achieve the medium-term
macroeconomic objectives and for reinforcing the fiscal consolidation and debt reduction
strategy. It is within this context that my authorities remain committed and have been
advancing a comprehensive structural reform program, including reforms in the areas of
financial sector, tax administration, public administration, labor market and the business
environment. The authorities agree with the staff that the time is opportune to re-evaluate the
overall strategy and welcome the staff’s advice, and the recommended technical assistance.
Tax reform: In addition to ongoing reform measures to improve tax administration, the
2007/08 budget outlined the authorities’ commitment to an additional tax reform effort.
Jamaica plans to consolidate payroll deductions during the current fiscal year. In addition to
the benefits of simplification and increased efficiency to be derived, consolidation will allow
for resource allocation to areas of greatest need in the context of changing priorities. Given
the developmental role of education, the sector will receive an increased share of
consolidated collections.
Public Enterprises Reform: The Jamaican authorities agree that a number of public sector
entities – Air Jamaica, the Jamaica Urban Transit Company and the Sugar Company of
Jamaica – have been a drain on the public purse. The authorities have taken steps
to restructure their operations in order to improve their financial performance in the short- to
medium-term. Air Jamaica and the Jamaica Urban Transit Company are currently

4
implementing business plans approved by Cabinet and are aimed at a gradual reduction in the
existing levels of losses. In the case of the sugar company, the assets are in the process of
being divested, and a change in ownership is anticipated during the current fiscal year.
Business Environment: In recent years, Jamaica has benefited from an unprecedented level of
FDI. However, it appears that the text-book trickle down effect of these investments has not
been fully realized. Jamaica is taking steps to assist small- and medium-size domestic
enterprises to maximize the benefits of these investments and to expand their participation in
the economy. A comprehensive program of financial and technical assistance will be
implemented during this fiscal year. Resources from the highly concessional Petrocaribe
funds will be made available through the development banks to the productive sector –
manufacturing, tourism and related services, as well as agriculture/agri-business and agroprocessing. This will be supported by the provision of technical assistance in business
planning and product development.
With the support of development partners, Jamaica has made progress in creating an enabling
environment for private sector-led growth. Despite this progress, my authorities recognize
that work remains to further improve the business climate through increased efficiency and
effectiveness of regulations. As a result, legislative and administrative steps will continue to
be taken to streamline the work of the various agencies and government departments
involved, including a delegation of appropriate authority from the Ministerial level to the
authorities involved. With assistance from the USAID in collaboration with the local private
sector, a Development and Investment Manual has been prepared to guide developers,
professionals, the private sector, civil society and government officials.
Conclusion
Jamaica’s medium-term growth prospects are positive but there are many challenges. These
are daunting, but they are not insurmountable. My authorities have demonstrated their
willingness and preparedness to make significant and sometimes painful decisions. They
remain steadfast in their commitment to fiscal sustainability, particularly through
improvements to the debt dynamics, to place Jamaica on a path to long-term sustained
economic development. Hence, the 2007/08 budget and the medium-term programs are
designed to return the fiscal balance and debt to a downward path. Jamaica places a high
value on its hard-earned credibility, and the confidence of the local and international markets
and investment community in general. Accordingly, the authorities will continue to pursue
policies and programs aimed at enhancing macroeconomic stability, infrastructure
development and improved global competitiveness, as a basis for expanding growth and
raising the standard of living of Jamaicans.
