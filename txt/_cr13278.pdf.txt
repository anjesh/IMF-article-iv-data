STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
February 1, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Uzbekistan’s growth has been strong, but macroeconomic challenges remain.
Despite setbacks in global recovery, growth momentum remains strong, supported by
sustained public investment and elevated prices for Uzbekistan’s commodity exports.
Substantial external and fiscal buffers continue to grow, but demand-boosting policies
have resulted in high inflation. The uncertain external environment poses downside risks
to export demand. Against this background, discussions focused on policies to bring
down inflation and on fostering strong and sustained growth by providing an enabling
environment for private-sector development to raise productivity and ensure adequate
employment.
Bringing inflation down will require coordinated policies. Although monetary policy
was tightened since mid-2011, more needs to be done by limiting reserve accumulation
and raising interest rates, while maintaining macro-fiscal stability. Fiscal loosening
should be avoided to prevent additional inflationary pressures. It will be important to
design the fiscal policy within a medium-term framework, while managing the natural
resource revenue in line with best international practices, including transparency and
good governance.
Structural reforms need to be stepped up to ensure high and sustained growth.
Implementing effectively the recent decisions to improve the business environment will
help foster productive investment and promote private-sector participation, while
creating jobs for the fast-growing population. A key priority is to ease the restrictiveness
of the foreign exchange (FX) and trade regimes, as it impedes the development of the
financial and private sectors and distorts resource allocation.
Improving economic data quality and transparency should be a priority. Bringing
statistics standards in line with international practice would help improve the quality of
macroeconomic analysis. Public availability and transparency of data would facilitate
business planning and investment.

INTRODUCTION
1.
Despite uncertainties in the global environment, Uzbekistan’s resource-rich economy
has recorded solid growth in recent years. The country is rich in natural resources (gold, natural
gas, copper, and uranium), ranks sixth among world cotton producers, and comprises 40 percent of
Central Asia’s population. Supported by high commodity prices for Uzbekistan’s exports, demandboosting policies, and remittances, GDP growth averaged 8¾ percent in the past five years.
Cautious management of the windfall mineral revenues has led to sizeable savings in the budget
and in the Fund for Reconstruction and Development (FRD) created in 2006. Considerable external
and fiscal buffers, low debt, and low exposure to global financial markets have shielded Uzbekistan
from the effects of the global crisis and facilitated the counter-cyclical measures that were taken
during the global financial crisis, allowing higher investment through FRD lending under
government projects.
2.
The authorities pursue a gradualist approach to reforms anchored in industrialization
and a strong role for the state in the economy. Policies have aimed at gradually increasing the
share of the private sector by developing small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), while keeping
state ownership in mining, energy, banks, and cotton. To this end, the share of SMEs in GDP reached
53 percent by 2012 and the share of agriculture has declined to 18 percent of GDP in 2011 from
about a third of GDP in the early 1990s.
3.
The Uzbek authorities are developing a strategy for achieving upper-middle-income
country status by 2030. Despite the officially reported decline in poverty, from 26 percent in 2004
to 18 percent in 2010, per capita income remains low, especially if compared with other resourcerich countries in the region. Achieving the authorities’ ambitious objective would imply an almost
ten-fold increase in per capita income, which in turn would require maintaining the current high
growth rates over the next two decades.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
The economy of Uzbekistan continued to grow rapidly. GDP grew by 8.3 percent
in 2011 and by 8.2 percent through September 2012, boosted by high prices for export
commodities, and by state-led investment. Growth was registered in all sectors, with the most
dynamic ones being: services, facilitated by the increase in real income; transportation, benefiting
from higher gas transit revenues from a new pipeline to China; agriculture, boosted by exceptional
weather conditions; and industry, supported by government-led investment.

Box 1. Authorities’ Response to IMF Policy Recommendations
Relations between Uzbekistan and the IMF have centered on surveillance. Since the last Article IV
consultation, the authorities followed IMF advice in several areas. They: (i) took measures to tighten
monetary policy by raising some interest rates on their monetary operations and increasing sterilization of
FX purchases; (ii) continued treasury and fiscal accounting reforms; (ii) engaged in technical assistance to
strengthen banking supervision; (iii) requested assistance with joining the IMF General Data Dissemination
System; and (iv) adopted a package of regulations to ease the regulatory environment for private-sector
development. Key recommendations on further liberalization of the FX market and trade, freeing banks from
noncore functions, and disseminating macroeconomic data remain under the authorities’ consideration.

5.
The external position continues to be strong, but the current account surplus has
narrowed. In 2011, export growth was constrained by declining demand for natural gas exports
while import rebounded strongly, supported by high remittances and FDI. This led to a narrowing in
the current account surplus to 5.8 percent of GDP in 2011 from 6.2 percent in 2010. In 2012, the
merchandise trade balance surplus has narrowed sharply, leading to a further decline in the current
account surplus to an estimated 2.7 percent of GDP. A sharp reduction in gold exports (volume and
value) and lower cotton and food exports (on account of lower prices) were not offset by higher
exports of processed goods and recovered gas export volumes facilitated by the launch of a newly
built gas pipeline to China. The drop in gold exports reflects the authorities’ preference to keep a
much larger part of produced gold in official reserves, which reached 16 months of import cover
(including FRD assets abroad) in October 2012.

Inflation remained in double digits, but receded somewhat. After peaking at
13.8 percent in November 2011, annual inflation, based on alternative CPI measurement by Fund
staff, has declined to 10.7 percent in October 2012.1 The headline inflation reflects increases in the

administrative prices of petrol, natural gas, utilities, and bread (these increases were aimed at
ensuring cost recovery), as well as faster currency depreciation and demand pressures stemming
from pension and wage increases. Stripped from seasonal and administrative prices, the estimated
core inflation declined to 5½ percent year-on-year in October 2012 after picking up to 8½ percent
in March 2012.
7.
Monetary policy has been tightened since mid-2011. An increase in net foreign assets
was sterilized through the continued accumulation of government deposits, including FRD, and
intensified liquidity-mopping operations by the Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU). The CBU
increased the interest rates on its certificates of deposit from 5 to 7 percent in September 2012,
facilitating liquidity sterilization. Efforts to promote noncash payments in the economy reduced the
currency-to-deposit ratio to 33 percent through October 2012 from 45 percent in early 2011.
Reflecting tighter monetary conditions, reserve and broad money growth decelerated considerably
from 27 and 52 percent at end-2010 to 16 and 30 percent, respectively, through October 2012.
Credit growth also decelerated from 42 percent to 32 percent over the same period, but remained
high in real terms, supported by directed lending. At the same time, the refinance rate (which guides
bank lending rates) and reserve requirements have remained unchanged.

8.
Fiscal policy was prudent in 2011–12. The budget outcome suggests a modestly tight
fiscal stance in 2011 as the estimated structural surplus, adjusted for the economic cycle and the
effects of the high mineral revenue, increased marginally by 0.2 percent of GDP. Fueled by strong
commodity revenue, the augmented surplus increased to 8.8 percent of GDP from 5 percent
in 2010.2 Despite tax cuts aimed at improving households’ disposable income and supporting SMEs,
income and profit tax revenue remained strong. Overall expenditures were lower on account of
better targeting of social welfare, but wages continued to grow strongly. Preliminary estimates of
the 2012 data point to a better-than-projected budget outcome (possibly by ½ percent of GDP)
reflecting continued measures to broaden the tax base and strengthen tax administration. However,
absent below-the-line financing annual data, it is difficult to assess the fiscal stance for 2012 based
on the available statistics. FRD has continued to play a stabilizing role by shielding the state budget
from the effects of volatile commodity prices. Three quarters of all mineral revenue was channeled
to FRD in 2011–12 (Box 2).

REPUBLIC OF UZBEKISTAN

Box 2. Uzbekistan: Fund for Reconstruction and Development
The authorities have been managing the mineral resource revenue through the state FRD, created in
mid-2006. Its main objectives are to: (i) accumulate revenue in excess of the established cut-off prices on
mineral resources, mainly gold and copper; and (ii) stimulate investment and economic development by
extending long-term loans to banks for cofinancing of strategic government-selected projects. Since its
creation, the FRD has accumulated $11 billion in assets, of which $9½ billion (as of October 2012) are
managed abroad by the CBU as part of the international reserves. The remainder is used for domestic
lending in FX under government projects and is earmarked for imports, in particular of capital and
intermediary goods.
The FRD has played a useful macro-stabilizing role, but there is scope to bring its activities in line with best
international practices. The authorities have followed a conservative approach in establishing the annual cutoff prices (not publicly available) and have managed to shield the state budget from commodity price
volatility by channeling two-thirds of commodity revenue to FRD since its creation. A comprehensive and
transparent strategy for managing the FRD, and the resource wealth, more broadly, should be adopted. It
should take into consideration the average mineral reserves-to-production ratios (estimated at 20–30 years,
less than the indicative threshold of 30–35 years) and the revenue dependency ratio approaching the
threshold of 20–25 percent of total fiscal revenue. Based on these, transparent rules regarding the externally
and domestically invested shares of funds consistent with the overall macroeconomic policies should be
adopted. Best practices regarding sovereign wealth funds management should be followed to avoid
behaviors that could conflict with monetary and fiscal policy objectives. In addition, the success of meeting
the development needs objectives will critically depend on the quality of investment projects; these require
an adequate framework that includes appraisal, selection, and procurement rules. This framework should
ensure high returns on domestic investments and enhanced productivity of the economy in the future
(Annex I). Finally, a transparent relationship with the government, high corporate governance standards, and
accountability should be also established.

9.
The functioning of the foreign exchange market has not changed in 2011–12. 3 Aiming
at maintaining the competitiveness of the export sector, the authorities have accelerated the annual
rate of nominal depreciation of the sum to 10½ percent in 2012 from 8–9 percent in previous years.
The rules regarding current account transactions and surrender requirements, which influence the
availability of FX, have remained unchanged. Surrender requirements were kept at 100 percent for
cotton and gold and 50 percent for other exports and the availability of FX for imports has been
restricted. The margin that emerged in 2009 between the official exchange rate and the parallel rate
in the unofficial cash FX market has narrowed recently to 38 percent from 55 percent in early 2012,
reportedly reflecting the effects of the more limited availability of sum in circulation.
10.
The banking system of Uzbekistan continues to perform well. Banks’ capital adequacy
ratio, at about 24¼ percent, remains high by international standards and the level of
non-performing loans is low relative to peers, even by alternative measures of the rating agencies
which are assessing the banking system as stable. Also, tighter monetary policy measures have
eased the excessively high credit growth. The share of bank lending linked to FRD financing has
increased to about a quarter of all new loans, reflecting the government’s preference to channel part
of public savings to strategic projects via state-owned banks.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS
11.
The outlook for growth is favorable, but, under unchanged policies, inflation is
projected to remain in double digits.


Under current policies, GDP would grow by 7 percent in 2013 and by 6 percent on average
thereafter. GDP growth will be driven by strong domestic demand, predicated on continued
implementation of the authorities’ investment program ($47 billion in 2011–15), and by
favorable terms of trade as prices for Uzbekistan’s main exports are expected to stay elevated
compared to their historical averages. Growth is estimated to continue to exceed potential with
output gap expected to close in 2014.



On high commodity revenue, the external and fiscal buffers are projected to increase further.
Debt indicators will continue to be low. Moreover, different shock scenarios under standard debt
sustainability analysis result in debt levels that are low and manageable (Figures 5 and 6).



Under current policies, inflation is expected to stay in double digits throughout 2013 and will be
elevated over the medium term. Continued high wage and pension increases, accompanied by
directed lending and steady nominal exchange rate depreciation, will fuel inflationary pressure.



The state budget for 2013 aims at a deficit of 1 percent of GDP, as it envisages a further
reduction in the tax burden (by about ½ percent of GDP) with continued focus on social

REPUBLIC OF UZBEKISTAN

spending and investment. The augmented government surplus, including FRD, is expected to
shrink to 1.8 percent of GDP in 2013, but would increase thereafter on a projected increase in
gold revenue.
12.
While the medium-term baseline scenario is favorable, uncertainties stemming from
the global environment are high and risks are tilted to the downside (see Risk Assessment
Matrix). With limited direct financial exposure to the euro zone and the United States, the effects of
a one percentage point negative shock to euro area and Russia GDP growth are estimated to be
limited for Uzbekistan.4 Nonetheless, the uncertain external environment poses some risks. A sharp
deceleration in global growth that would likely accompany an escalation of the euro zone crisis
would affect the economy via lower remittances inflows and weaker demand for Uzbek exports.
Lower commodity prices could result from weaker activity in Europe, but also from a slowdown in
emerging markets, including main trading partners. Although the share of mineral production in
GDP is estimated to be below 20 percent and minerals contribute about 20 percent of total public
sector revenue, minerals account for 55 percent of total exports of goods. An eventual 10 percent
drop in the international prices for gold, copper, and oil would result in a deterioration of the
current account by about 1 percent of GDP and of the fiscal balance by about 0.7 percent of GDP. In
addition, Uzbekistan is susceptible to potential risks emanating from changes in the security and
political situation in the region. In case the economic risks materialize, the authorities should use the
available ample fiscal space to counter the negative effects of global spillovers. Monetary tightening
should be put off if output is affected and inflation is clearly on a downward path.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
13.
Discussions focused on the main economic policy challenges in the years ahead. In the
short term, there is a need to rein in inflation through coordinated measures to increase the
effectiveness of monetary and exchange rate policies and through prudent fiscal policy. In the
medium term, the objective is to raise real income per capita by increasing total productivity of
capital and labor in the economy (Annex I) and by ensuring employment for the country’s young
and growing population (Box 3). In addition, discussions focused on data quality and dissemination.
Box 3. Uzbekistan: Employment and Growth
Creating jobs for the young and fast growing population is high on the authorities’ agenda. The
estimated relatively weak response of employment to growth implies that Uzbekistan will need to grow at
an average rate of 8.7 percent in the next five years to absorb new entrants into the labor market and keep
the unemployment rate constant. Maintaining such high real GDP growth over a long period of time is a
challenge. Decisive measures to deliver on structural reforms would help increase employment
responsiveness to growth, and thus increase the flexibility of labor and product markets and create an
environment where the private sector is large enough to absorb new labor force entrants. With the resulting
higher elasticity, even lower GDP growth rates would deliver the desired unemployment outcome.

14.
The authorities broadly concurred with the assessment of the macroeconomic outlook.
While staff underscored that strong economic growth would materialize only with successful
implementation of the ambitious investment program, the authorities consider that staff’s
projections are on the conservative side. They acknowledged the risks from the uncertain global
environment, but stressed the broad self-sufficiency of the Uzbek economy, prudent external
borrowing, and economic diversification that is shifting output and exports away from commodities
and toward high value added goods. The most pressing concerns, according to the authorities, are
related to the need to safeguard the value of the official reserves against the growing uncertainties
in the global economy.

A.

Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies

15.
The CBU is committed to further monetary tightening. The positive output gap and
double-digit inflation warrant further action. Strong credit growth is boosted by keeping the CBU
refinance rate negative in real terms and by preferential directed lending, including lending by FRD.
In addition, the entrenched expectations about future steady exchange rate depreciation and official
reserves accumulation add to inflationary pressures. While the CBU considers that monetary policy is
not fueling inflation, it intends to continue monetary tightening by mopping up the excess liquidity
and further promoting noncash payments to contain second-round effects from administrative price
increases.
16.
The CBU continues to accumulate official reserves. Although the reserves are
comfortable by any measure, the authorities prefer to have even higher international reserves going
forward. Staff advised the authorities to slow down reserves accumulation, because it leads to the
need to sterilize the resulting excess liquidity. Staff argued that the CBU should focus only on
inflation and move away from the policy of a heavily managed depreciation of the sum by allowing
truly market-based setting of the exchange rate. The first step in this direction could be easing of
surrender requirements and the restrictive rules on current account transactions. Further on, the CBU
should intervene in the FX market only to avoid excessive exchange rate volatility. These measures
will help remove the distortions in the FX market without putting undue pressure on the exchange
rate or on international reserves. The authorities agree that depreciation affects inflation through the
import component of the consumption basket (which is low compared to other countries) and also
through expectations. The authorities do not plan to change their policy of nominal depreciation of
the sum, which is primarily aimed at supporting the competitiveness of exports.

Real exchange rate assessment is complicated by the existence of a parallel exchange
rate in the unofficial foreign exchange market. The authorities consider that the parallel
exchange rate is not representative, and claim that the unofficial FX market is illegal, small, and
related to unlawful activities and tax evasion. The CGER-based analysis suggests that, over the
medium term, the projected current account surplus is close to the estimated norm (Box 4). An
alternative macroeconomic balance approach (MBA) suggests that the projected current account
surplus is lower than the estimated norm, implying a real exchange rate overvaluation. Data
deficiencies add to the uncertainties surrounding these assessments.

Box 4. Uzbekistan: Exchange Rate Assessment and Competitiveness
The existence of an official exchange rate and a much more depreciated parallel market rate make exchange
rate assessment difficult.
The CPI-based real effective exchange rate (REER), calculated using the official exchange rate, does
not point to considerable competitiveness issues. In 2011, the REER and the nominal effective exchange
rate (NEER) depreciated by, respectively, 3 percent and 10 percent. In 2012, the REER appreciated by
3 percent through October, while the NEER depreciated by 5 percent. Since the onset of the global crisis, the
cumulative nominal effective depreciation has outpaced the high inflation differential between Uzbekistan
and its trading partners.

CGER-based assessment and an alternative MBA estimate suggest that the current account surplus is
on average not far from the norm. Standard CGER approaches (excluding the ERER as not applicable given
data quality) show that the projected medium-term current account balance (2.4 percent of GDP in 2017) is
close to the current account norm. An alternative MBA calculation, however, shows that the projected
current account surplus is lower than the norm. These results should be treated with caution given: (i) the
parallel foreign exchange rate; (ii) the role that current account liberalization may play in adjustment towards
the norm; and (iii) the assumption that exchange rate adjustment alone can facilitate current account
rebalancing.
Alternative non-price indicators raise some concerns about competitiveness. In contrast to other CIS
countries, the export market share of Uzbekistan continued to

Fiscal Policy and Reforms

18.
There was an agreement that prudent fiscal policy is warranted. In the current cyclical
position, with the economic activity above potential, the envisaged fiscal loosening in 2013 would
require additional tightening of monetary policy to avoid overheating risks. The authorities
underscored that, as in the past, they will aim at a better-than-budgeted outcome because they are
committed to prudent spending, and will save the eventual revenue overperformance. The latter will
be achieved by strengthening tax collections facilitated by a broader tax base as further tax cuts are
enforced in 2013. In addition, the authorities plan to revise the numerous existing tax exemptions
and privileges that reportedly amount to 30 percent of GDP. An action plan outlining concrete
measures will be guided by the forthcoming technical assistance in revenue administration.
19.
Promoting fiscal policy within a medium-term fiscal framework is a priority. The
authorities intend to maintain the public debt at the current level as a share of GDP, and stressed
that external borrowing is undertaken to support the industrial modernization and infrastructure
development program. Designing the fiscal policy within a medium-term fiscal framework (currently
elaborated by the ministry of finance on an experimental basis) would allow strategic planning and
prioritizing of expenditure, and would promote efficiency in government spending. The mediumterm framework designed around a structural primary balance that excludes natural resource
revenues, would help delink fiscal policy design from the volatility of resource revenue and avoid
fiscal procyclicality. Taking into account natural resource exhaustibility, public debt dynamics, and
FRD returns would help ensure a sustainable fiscal path over the longer term. 5
20.
Prudently managing the exhaustible and volatile mineral resource revenue will
support sustainable growth. Policies should focus on maintaining a smooth expenditure path that
would help avoid the need for sharp consolidation in the future. The authorities agreed with the
need to use exhaustible resources efficiently, but mentioned that the resource horizon is likely to
increase as recent exploration activities point to new discoveries (e.g., in the natural gas sector). At
the same time, low returns on externally managed FRD assets and development needs make
domestic investments more attractive. The focus shifts to establishing a consistent macroeconomic
framework (including producing and analyzing macroeconomic data by resource and nonresource
sectors) and ensuring effective management and use of the volatile commodity revenue.

C.

Financial Sector

21.
Financial intermediation is low. State-owned banks dominate the system, with their assets
share reaching about 80 percent of total bank assets. Continued capital injections by the
government ensure that the banking system remains well capitalized while extending loans under
the large government projects. Through end-September 2012, banks’ balance sheet capital
increased by 24 percent year-on-year, and their capital adequacy ratio exceeded 24 percent. Banks’
credit policy is influenced by state-directed lending, often below market rates, which impedes the
5

“Macroeconomic Policy Frameworks for Resource-Rich Developing Countries”, IMF Policy Papers: August 24, 2012.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF UZBEKISTAN

development of sound risk management and increases segmentation. The noncore functions (e.g.
tax administration or cash monitoring of their clients) undermine trust in banks, hamper access to
credit, and inhibit financial intermediation. The recent measures to strengthen banking supervision
methodology, prudential standards, and risk assessment practices are welcome. To bear fruit, these
measures should be accompanied by scaling back of directed lending and reduction of the noncore
activities for banks.
22.
The authorities agreed that strengthening banking sector governance and supervision
should help foster financial intermediation. The authorities are committed to strengthening
banking supervision, the regulatory environment, and enforcement of prudential standards.
However, there are no coordinated plans to efficiently relieve banks of their noncore functions or to
phase out directed lending.

D.

Structural Reforms

23.
Structural reforms are key to achieving the authorities’ objective of becoming an
upper-middle-income country over the next two decades. Conventional growth analysis
suggests that capital has been the biggest driver of GDP growth in recent years, while contribution
of total factor productivity fell considerably (Annex I). Against this backdrop, recent efforts aim at
modernizing and diversifying the economy by increasing the role of the private sector. A set of
measures to reduce controls, simplify licensing, and streamline permission requirements was
adopted in July 2012. The success of these measures will depend on the de facto implementation of
the adopted regulations. Future growth will have to rely on sizable total factor productivity increases
(Annex I). One area where decisive measures are overdue is the energy sector. The fivefold
difference between domestic and export prices for gas gives rise to a considerable implicit subsidy
(Box 5). The recent disruptions in gas and electricity supply to final consumers reflect the distortions
caused by price controls, as well as outdated technology and equipment. The authorities agree that
addressing inefficiency in the energy sector is critical for ensuring the success of the industrialization
strategy and social policy; they are engaging with international donors to reform the sector.
24.
Trade policies are restrictive and remain an impediment to private-sector development
and regional trade (Box 6). With simple average tariff exceeding 14 percent, Uzbekistan’s tariff
barriers are the highest in the region. Many nontariff barriers are impeding trading across borders,
including transit, and have negative spillovers in the region in the form of higher costs and delays at
customs. Although WTO accession is not high among the authorities’ priorities, they continued to
adjust the national legislation to the WTO requirements, and started bilateral consultations with
WTO members. The authorities agree that foreign trade regulations and practices are cumbersome.
Recent trade policy measures are focused on streamlining regulations and simplification of customs
procedures. The measures include a considerable reduction and simplification of customs
documents, creation of a shared interagency electronic database for foreign trade, and abolition of
import contracts registration at customs.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

REPUBLIC OF UZBEKISTAN

25.
To succeed on the structural front, the authorities should address the following
immediate priorities:


Anchor the modernization and industrialization strategy around consistent macroeconomic
policies to ensure financial viability of projects and high returns on investments, conducive to
productivity growth, and an enabling environment that would support non-mineral privatesector growth;



Eliminate tariff and nontariff barriers to trade. While the primary focus should be on eliminating
exchange restrictions—commonly perceived as the main nontariff impediment to trade—other
nontariff barriers, related to customs procedures, rules, and regulations, should be swiftly
repealed. Import tariffs need to be brought down;



Implement decisively in practice the recent measures to improve the trade and business
environment and enhance the economy’s flexibility. These would be critical to launching private
sector–led growth, increasing productivity, and creating jobs;



Continue with adjusting administrative prices to achieve cost recovery and eliminate crosssubsidies. When liberalizing prices, in particular on energy and food, protect the poor by
strengthening the social safety nets, including targeted cash transfers, rather than providing
equal benefits through across-the-board price controls. International experience shows that
reforms based on cash transfers to households and businesses create a system of incentives to
reduce the waste of resources, contributing to a rapid increase in efficiency.

E.

Statistical Issues

26.
Data quality continues to significantly hamper surveillance. Bringing statistics standards
in line with international practices would help improve the quality of macroeconomic analysis. Policy
makers and investors would benefit from good quality, comparable data that are consistent across
different sectors and would facilitate business planning and investment decisions. The authorities’
decision to join the IMF General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and the appointment of a
national coordinator are welcome. Further steps in this area should include: (i) addressing the
outstanding issues regarding the methodology of CPI statistics; (ii) opening an International
Financial Statistics country page; (iii) repealing confidentiality restrictions that impede dissemination
of economic data; (iv) adopting a GFSM 2001-compliant fiscal data template; (v) producing
macroeconomic data for natural resource and nonresource sectors; (vi) upgrading external sector
statistics to the requirements of the BP6 Manual; and (vii) producing the international investment
position statistics.

STAFF APPRAISAL
27.
Uzbekistan’s growth has remained strong, but risks are tilted to the downside. Prudent
macroeconomic policies—low debt, comfortable fiscal and external buffers—combined with positive
terms of trade and low level of international economic integration, have largely shielded the
economy from the impact of the global financial crisis. Demand-boosting policies and sustained
public investment have helped growth, but have also spurred inflation that remains in double digits.
The uncertainties related to the global environment pose downside risks through possible weaker
demand for Uzbek exports and a possible slowdown in remittance inflows. However, the impact of
these uncertainties is deemed to be limited. The government has sufficient buffers to ensure
economic stability in the near term.
28.
The positive economic outlook is conditional upon future total factor productivity
increases. In the near and medium term, high economic growth is projected to continue to be
facilitated by favorable terms of trade and public investment. The projected high growth depends
on a successful implementation of the authorities’ medium-term investment policy, which envisages
launching a large number of modern enterprises as well as modernization of the existing ones in the
energy, petrochemical, and textiles sectors, and a revamping of infrastructure. The authorities should
anchor the modernization and industrialization strategy around consistent macroeconomic policies
to ensure financial viability and high returns on investments, conducive to enhanced productivity
growth and an enabling environment to support nonmineral sector growth.
29.
Lowering inflation sustainably to single digits will require coordinated use of
monetary, exchange rate, and fiscal policies. Monetary tightening should continue by reducing
official reserves accumulation, increasing sterilization, and making interest rates positive in real
terms to better manage demand pressures stemming from public spending. Fiscal policy should
support the anti-inflationary efforts by avoiding the budgeted fiscal loosening. Market forces should
be allowed to fully guide the exchange rate, while the CBU should intervene only to smooth the
sharp exchange rate fluctuations. Achieving low inflation should clearly dominate the
macroeconomic policy objectives. The authorities should stand ready to adjust their policies and
stop tightening, if growth slows down considerably and inflation is set clearly on a downward path.
30.
Priority should be given to FX market liberalization. Eliminating the distortions in the FX
market by adhering to the obligations of Article VIII, sections 2(a) and 3 of the IMF Articles of
Agreement should be pursued without delay. In addition, the authorities should ease surrender
requirements and facilitate banks’ free transactions in the FX market. These measures would allow
consolidation of the recent improvements in cash management, facilitate FX market development,
and unleash the potential gains from trade. Work on the WTO agenda should continue as it helps in
addressing other nontariff barriers related to customs procedures, rules, and regulations.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

REPUBLIC OF UZBEKISTAN

31.
Fiscal policy needs to be set within a transparent and consistent medium-term
framework. While the overall fiscal position is strong and public debt low, a comprehensive
medium-term fiscal framework would allow strategic planning and prioritizing of expenditure, and
will promote efficiency in government spending, while allocating adequate resources to
better-targeted social support. Fiscal policy decisions should be anchored around the structural
primary balance, and should be supported by prudent and transparent management of mineral
resource revenues, including the FRD.
32.
A modernized financial sector is needed to foster growth. The stability of the highly
capitalized banking sector is commendable. However, enhancing trust in banks by further
strengthening banking supervision and prudential regulations, as well as their enforcement, will be
critical to financial stability. The CBU should be vigilant to vulnerabilities that arise from high credit
growth and a recent increase in the share of FX lending, mainly through FRD. Improving cash
management and freeing banks from noncore functions (e.g., tax administration and cash
monitoring of their clients) will be steps in the right direction.
33.
Recent measures to improve the business environment are encouraging. Some progress
has already been achieved by simplification of the regulatory environment, which is acknowledged
in the World Bank’s 2013 Doing Business report. Staff fully supports the ongoing efforts to further
streamline the regulatory environment, including cutting the number of controls, introducing
electronic tax reporting, and creating an even playing field for all businesses, as these will help fight
corruption and reduce inefficiencies. Moreover, for these efforts to bear fruit, the key is to effectively
implement the newly adopted regulations.
34.
Strengthening data quality and dissemination of macroeconomic statistics should be a
priority. The recent decision to adhere to the IMF GDDS is welcome, and will help progress in the
area of statistics. Ensuring data quality and availability, including the publication of country reports,
would enhance policy-makers and investors’ perceptions of the underlying economic developments
and policies.
35.

Box 5. Uzbekistan: Subsidies
The system of subsidies in Uzbekistan is dominated by implicit subsidies. While available data indicate that
direct subsidies are low, there is evidence of the existence of substantial indirect subsidies.
Direct cash transfers amount to 2 percent of GDP (or 6 percent of budget expenditure), mostly consisting
of cash transfers targeted to the most vulnerable households. The share of these subsidies in GDP has been
declining. In addition, in-kind assistance at the local (mahalla) level is wide spread and is targeted at most
poor families and implemented through the local communities. The World Bank considers the local social
support to be relatively well organized and effective. Also, certain direct support to the economy is included
in the budget. This includes subsidies to agriculture (for irrigation, fertilizers, electricity, etc.) and some other
sectors. This type of support is not reported as subsidy and is difficult to quantify.
A major part of indirect subsidies originates from price controls on food and energy, including electricity
and natural gas. Subsidies appear as a result of a
difference between the domestic price and the
price at the border for some essential goods. For
example, the current domestic gas price for
households is only one-fifth of Uzbekistan’s gas
export price. The International Energy Agency
(IEA) ranked Uzbekistan the first in the world in

subsidies in 2010 amounted to $11.9 billion

(30 percent of GDP). The authorities recognize the existence of high indirect subsidies, and plan to address
this issue with gradual increase in administrative prices. Price increases should be accompanied by measures
to protect the poor through strengthening social safety nets. However, over the longer term, more needs to
be done to raise the efficiency of energy sector, and the initial efforts to reform the sector with help from
donors are welcome.
In addition, numerous programs established by government are believed to be financed by state-owned
banks through directed lending at preferential conditions. Some of these programs include credits to
certain sectors and industries, preferential mortgage loans to young families, and also tax preferences
related to mortgage loans for construction, reconstruction, and purchase of houses and flats, particularly in
rural area.

Box 6. Uzbekistan: Trade Policies
Trade policies in Uzbekistan are among the most restrictive in the region. A range of tariff and nontariff
barriers to discourage imports is utilized. Uzbekistan has the highest tariffs in the region, and it is one of two
CIS countries which maintain exchange
restrictions constraining imports. Uzbekistan
also maintains export surrender requirements
amounting, on average, to 50 percent of
export revenues. At the same time, selected
state-sponsored importers and exporters
enjoy privileges.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a
= share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and nondebt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and nondebt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels of the last projection year.

Annex I. Uzbekistan: Sources of Growth
During the second decade of transition to market, growth in Uzbekistan was largely driven by
capital, with the contribution of total factor productivity (TFP) falling considerably since the
global crisis. Conventional growth accounting analysis suggests that capital input was the biggest
driver of GDP growth, explaining about 4.4 percent out of the average 7.4 percent outcome in
2002–11. Consistent with a massive government-led industrial modernization program, capital
accumulation became even more important over the past three years. The accumulation of capital
was the fastest in construction, communications, transport, and trade and industry. Overall
employment in the economy was gradually expanding adding 1.3–1.4 percent to the growth
outcome. Yet, the contribution from TFP slowed down considerably from 2 percent in the pre-crisis
years to 0.7 percent recently.

Uzbekistan: Fixed Capital Accumulation
(By sector)

Sources: Uzbek authorities, and IMF staff calculations.

If labor quality, proxied by educational attainment of Uzbek labor force, is introduced, the
TFP contribution to GDP growth virtually disappears. This implies that the quality-adjusted labor
plus physical capital accumulation suffice to account for observed growth performance, and that the
productivity gains resulting from industrial modernization are not yet clearly visible.

Growth With Labor Quality

Sources: Uzbek authorities, and IMF staff calculations.

Inadequate TFP gains may adversely affect the competitiveness of the economy. Over the past
decade, Uzbekistan’s growth was indeed strongly supported by improving average labor
productivity that bottomed out in 1995 and greatly accelerated in 2004, in part reflecting higher
quality of labor, more productive capital, and some reallocation of resources to more efficient
sectors like communications, transport, and industry. However, the growth of labor compensation,
proxied by real wages, has consistently outpaced the growth of labor productivity. The resulting
steep increase in unit labor costs will undermine the economy’s competitiveness, unless sizable TFP
gains materialize soon.

Uzbekistan would be able to achieve enhanced TFP growth6 by:


Making sure that capital and labor flow to the sectors in which they are used most efficiently.
Enhancing labor market flexibility to allow for labor reallocation from less productive to more
productive sectors will be key. Relieving capital markets in the nonpriority areas from heavy
government footprint should also help;



Ensuring that all prices, including the exchange rate, interest rates, and wage rates reflect true
market incentives;



Diversifying away from commodity sectors would help boost potential growth and TFP in the
long run;



Improving the de facto business environment and strengthening property rights to encourage
FDI and private-sector development;



Reducing the energy intensity of GDP through comprehensive modernization of the energy
sector and promotion of energy-efficient manufacturing and services; and



Advancing technological innovation as a key part of Uzbekistan’s state-led industrial
modernization policy.

Exchange Rate Arrangements
The de jure and de facto exchange rate regimes are managed float and crawling peg respectively.
The exchange rate of the dollar is determined on the basis of interbank trading sessions (ITS).
Effective March 13, 2008, ITS also include euro operations. The sum has gradually depreciated
against the dollar. The official exchange rate of the Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) is determined
once a week as the average ITS rate for the previous week, and it remains in effect for one week. The
official exchange rate of the CBU is used for accounting purposes, statistical and other reporting on
foreign exchange operations, and for the calculation of customs and other mandatory payments in
the territory of Uzbekistan.
Although Uzbekistan accepted the obligations of Article VIII Sections 2(a), 3, and 4 of the Fund’s
Articles of Agreement with effect on October 15, 2003, it maintains at least two exchange
restrictions and one MCP subject to Fund jurisdiction. First, undue delays (of up to and exceeding
12 months) in the availability of foreign exchange for payments and transfers for current
international transactions gives rise to an exchange restriction. Second, the CBU’s practice of
providing only limited foreign exchange for payments and transfers for current international
transactions is considered direct rationing and gives rise to an exchange restriction. Third, the
practice that no interest is paid on “blocked accounts” for conversion of sum to foreign exchange
and that these transactions are delayed beyond the normal 5–7 business days, gives rise to an MCP,
since the lack of interest payments directly increases the cost of the exchange transaction. The
Executive Board did not approve the above exchange restrictions and multiple currency practice.
Article IV Consultation
Uzbekistan is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. The 2011 Article IV consultation was
completed by the Executive Board on a lapse of time basis on January 9, 2011.

Uzbekistan became a member of the EBRD in 1992. The last Country Strategy was approved by the
Board in July 2005.
Current Bank’s operating assets stand at EUR 53 million with majority in the form of debt. Overall,
EBRD’s portfolio is performing with public sector projects, but several private sector clients
experiencing severe delays on conversion.
The Bank’s current operational priorities were an active portfolio management including loan
restructuring, exit from equity projects, securing timely repayments, and strengthening monitoring.
Annual business volume stood at EUR 1.8 million in 2011 and EUR 2.1 million at the end of
November 2012 as a result of restructuring of private sector projects.

Strategy (CPS), 2012–16 for Uzbekistan in September 2012. The CPS aligns with the updated Welfare
Improvement Strategy for 2012–15 (WIS II), which is under preparation. The WIS II seeks to support
inclusive economic growth by fostering a modernized and diversified economy and creating
equitable economic opportunities. Consistent with the WIS II, the main areas of support in the CPS
are (i) infrastructure development focused on transport and communications, energy, water
resources, water supply, and other municipal infrastructure and services; and (ii) access to financial
services. Private sector development and operations, regional cooperation, governance and reforms,
knowledge management, gender equity, climate change, and environment are the key thematic
drivers of change in the CPS.
ADB approved its Country Operations and Business Plan (COBP), 2012–14 in November 2012. The
new COBP 2012–14 is consistent and aligned with the priorities of the new CPS. The COBP includes
operational support for transport, energy, municipal services, water, and access to finance, as guided
by the development priorities of the government. These focus on industrial modernization and
diversification of economy. The planned investment will increase efficiency and competitiveness, and
boost connectivity within the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation region and beyond.
The COBP envisages about $1.3 billion during 2012–14 for public sector assistance. Of this,
$226 million is expected to be sourced annually from the Asian Development Fund (subject to the
fund availability). In addition, ADB is considering direct investments in private sector undertakings.
Technical assistance grants for project preparatory, policy advisory, and knowledge sharing are
estimated at $12.3 million, supporting (i) preparation of an energy efficiency project, (ii) second solar
power development (iii) third small and microfinance development, (iv) improving financial sector
access, and (v) capacity building, and improving efficiency of public management.

In 2012, ADB provided Uzbekistan with $595 million in loans, $275 million in guarantee, and up to
$6 million in equity participation to support electricity transmission, regional highway corridor
development, natural gas chemical production, and commercial banking.
The $150 million loan for Namangan 500 KV Power Transmission Project will increase energy
security through the diversification and expansion of energy supply routes. The two loans, totaling
$320 million, for the CAREC Corridor 2 Road Investment Programs will reconstruct 115 km of CAREC
Corridor 2 and help improve road safety and asset management. The Surgil Natural Gas Chemicals
Project, with a $125 million direct loan and $275 million guarantee, is the second direct private
sector investment project in Uzbekistan for ADB, and aims catalytic effects to expand the gas
subsector by encouraging foreign operators to develop similar undertakings.
ADB’s regional cooperation program complements country-level operation. ADB provides targeted
regional assistance in trade facilitation, as well as in the energy and transport and communication
sectors.
ADB has extended 46 loans to Uzbekistan (including two private sector loans) totaling $3.518 billion,
and $50.8 million in technical assistance. The current loan portfolio comprises 33 percent for
transport; 23 percent for energy; 11 percent for water supply, sanitation, and municipal services;
10 percent for agriculture and natural resources; 8 percent for education; 6 percent each for
multisector and private sector development; and 2 percent for financial sector.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General
Data have serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance. Shortcomings are most
serious in the national accounts, external sector, and government finance statistics.
National Accounts
The methodology for compiling the annual GDP estimates should be improved. Appropriate
procedures need to be developed for reconciling production and expenditure-based estimates of
GDP. Discrete quarterly GDP estimates are not compiled. The collection of primary source data for
compiling national accounts statistics relies predominantly on the old Soviet-type system (including
complete enumeration of legal entities, collection of cumulative data, use of numerous fragmented
survey questionnaires, and classification of economic activities according to the old material product
system). The restructuring of the data collection system should start as soon as possible. A
long-term resident advisor in real sector statistics was posted in the State Statistics Committee (SSC)
during 2008–10 to implement the work program. The currently applied system for data
confidentiality slows down the implementation process.
Price Statistics
The official CPI is based on inappropriate techniques that lead to a systematic underestimation of
inflationary pressures. In 2005, technical assistance was provided for implementing international
standards for treatment of seasonal goods in the CPI; however, implementation is still pending for
computing a price index for fruits and vegetables. While continuing reporting the official CPI index,
the authorities started reporting a CPI index in November 2011 calculated using Rothwell formula as
per earlier Fund advice, and provided historical data from 2004. The authorities’ new estimates have
been submitted to the Fund for STA assessment.
Government Finance Statistics
Detailed data on revenue and expenditure of the consolidated government budget are compiled by
the ministry of finance on a monthly basis and are available after a processing time of about four
weeks. Data for extrabudgetary funds are available quarterly with a longer delay, and include only
broad categories of revenue and expenditure of the four largest funds. The authorities occasionally
provide fiscal tables that include net lending, foreign-financed investment, and details on the
financing of the deficit. A persisting statistical discrepancy between the financing of the budget
based on the above-the-line and below-the-line data points to possible coverage and classification
issues. The authorities do not reconcile the monetary and fiscal financing data on a regular basis.
Budget expenditure data are organized according to a largely functional classification. An economic
classification is available only occasionally, but the quality of these data is inadequate. The ministry
of finance occasionally provides data on tax arrears. Information on total proceeds from

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF UZBEKISTAN

privatization operations and treasury bills are provided on a quarterly basis, and data on issues and
repayments of treasury bills are available monthly on request.
Even though the authorities have started reporting GFSM 2001, compliant format to the Fund,
significant deficiencies exist, including absent disaggregated data. Staff Report for the 2012
Article IV Consultation includes an estimated fiscal presentation based on GFSM 2001.
Monetary Statistics
Following the introduction of new charts of accounts for the CBU and for the commercial banks
in 1997, several missions have assisted the CBU in compiling monetary statistics using data from the
new charts of accounts and in accordance with the IMF recommended methodology. With the
implementation of major recommendations of these missions, a prototype IFS page for Uzbekistan
was prepared by STA. The introduction of the IFS page will be pending on the agreement by the
authorities and establishing a track record of regular reporting to STA. Action by the authorities is
still pending.
Balance of Payments
Legal and institutional issues were found to hamper the compilation and dissemination of external
sector statistics, as well as the delivery of technical assistance. These include: (i) the balance of
payments statistics together with relevant source data are treated as classified data, which impedes
not only the pace of statistical development but also interagency data sharing; (ii) the restricted
access to data strongly affects the efficiency of technical assistance work; (iii) there is no legal
framework clearly defining the responsibility to compile the international investment position (IIP)
and gross external debt statistics; and (iv) the institutional capacity to compile the external sector
statistics is insufficient. No clear commitment was received from authorities with regard to statistics
disclosure. The authorities have not progressed regarding the compilation of the IIP, with human
capacity constraints being one of the important reasons behind this deficiency.
Key factors for the persistent errors and omissions include the understatement of debit entries such
as imports of goods and services, income payments (including for FDI), and shuttle trade. In
addition, undercoverage of outflows (FDI, including disinvestments for the product-sharing
agreements, and nonbank assets abroad) was identified. Detailed time series data were not available
to the mission to quantify the impact of each of the items identified.
In external trade statistics, exports of cotton, and other bulk exports are valued on a c.i.f. basis rather
than f.o.b. Some adjustments are made to capture informal cross-border trade and shuttle trade.
Two parallel systems are used for compiling trade data—one based on customs declarations and the
other based on enterprise surveys. STA has recommended that the customs data be used for
compiling merchandise trade statistics and the enterprise reports to collect data on trade in services
only.
Data provision on external debt is broadly satisfactory. Data on external government and
government-guaranteed debt, including projections of future debt service obligations, are

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

REPUBLIC OF UZBEKISTAN

submitted with quarterly frequency, though often with considerable delay. The authorities do not
separately indicate the amount of concessional debt, the amount of private debt owed or debt,
intermediated by banks.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Uzbekistan does not participate in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). The authorities
have conveyed their decision to participate in GDDS, they appointed a national coordinator, and a
STA mission is planned for Q1 2013 to prepare the necessary metadata.
No data ROSC is available.
III. Reporting to STA
Uzbekistan has yet to approve publication of a country page in the International Financial Statistics.
Uzbekistan does not report statistics to STA for publication in the Government Finance Statistics and
the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbooks.

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with
the Republic of Uzbekistan
On February, 22, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Uzbekistan.1
2

Background
Despite setbacks in global recovery, Uzbekistan’s resource-rich economy has recorded a solid
growth in recent years. Following a strong performance in 2011, high economic growth
continued in 2012. GDP grew by 8.3 percent in 2011 and by 8.2 percent through
September 2012, boosted by high prices for export commodities, and state-led investment. After
peaking at 13.8 percent in November 2011, annual inflation has declined to 10.7 percent in
October 2012. The double-digit inflation rate reflects increases in administrative prices, as well
as currency depreciation and demand pressures stemming from pension and wage increases.
The external position continues to be strong, but the current account surplus has narrowed, on
account of recent drop of gold exports, and lower cotton and food prices. At the same time,
import was strong, supported by remittances and FDI. As a result, the current account surplus
narrowed to 5.8 percent of GDP in 2011 and further to an estimated 2.7 percent of GDP
in 2012. The drop in gold exports reflects the authorities’ preference to monetize gold in official
reserves which reached 16 months of import cover (including the assets of the Fund for
Reconstruction and Development (FRD) abroad) in October 2012.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

Monetary policy has been tightened since mid-2011, with continued accumulation of
government deposits, including FRD, and intensified liquidity-mopping operations by the Central
Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU). Reserve and broad money growth decelerated considerably from 27
and 52 percent at end-2010 to 16 and 30 percent, respectively, through October 2012. Credit
growth has also decelerated, but remained high in real terms, supported by directed lending. At
the same time, the refinance rate (that guides bank lending rates) and reserve requirements
have remained unchanged. Aiming at improving competitiveness of the export sector, the
authorities have continued their policy of a nominal depreciation of the sum.
Fiscal policy was prudent in 2011, and preliminary data for 2012 point to a better-than-projected
budget outcome, reflecting continued measures to broaden the tax base and strengthen tax
administration. Overall expenditures benefited from better targeting of social welfare, while
wages continued to grow strongly. Fueled by strong commodity revenue, the FRD has
continued to play a stabilizing role by shielding the state budget from the effects of volatile
commodity prices as three quarters of all mineral revenue was channeled to it in 2011−12.
Growth prospects remain favorable, but risks are tilted to the downside as a result of global
uncertainties. Cushioned against external shocks by high external and fiscal buffers, GDP
growth will be strong, predicated by continued implementation of the authorities’ investment
program, and by favorable terms of trade as prices for Uzbekistan’s main exports are expected
to stay elevated compared to their historical averages. Under current policies, inflation is
expected to stay in double digits throughout 2013 and is projected to be elevated over the
medium term.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors welcomed Uzbekistan’s strong economic performance and accumulation of large
policy buffers in recent years. Looking ahead, Directors agreed that the main policy priorities
should be to bring down inflation, broaden the base of economic growth, and expand
employment. Continued implementation of prudent policies and structural reforms will be critical
to achieve these goals.
Directors supported a further tightening of monetary policy to head off overheating risks, as part
of a well coordinated policy mix. A less accommodative stance should be supported by a
slowdown in the accumulation of already ample reserves and a shift toward a
market-determined exchange rate.
Directors commended the authorities’ commitment to fiscal prudence. They welcomed plans to
improve revenue administration, curtail tax exemptions, and reduce energy subsidies while
strengthening social assistance. Directors stressed the importance of adopting a medium-term
budget framework and upgrading the management of the mineral revenue fund in line with
international best practice.

Directors noted that the banking system remains stable and well capitalized. Nonetheless, they
encouraged the authorities to strengthen prudential oversight, relieve banks of their noncore
functions, and phase out directed lending.
Directors encouraged the authorities to accelerate structural reforms in a variety of areas to
raise productivity and unlock new growth engines. They noted with satisfaction recent steps to
improve the business environment and promote small- and medium-sized enterprises. Against
this background, Directors considered it especially important to further liberalize the foreign
exchange and trade regimes.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ decision to join the IMF’s General Data Dissemination
System and called for further improvements in the quality and transparency of economic data.
