STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 23, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Outlook and risks: Amidst a fragile global economic environment, Namibia‘s real GDP
growth is projected to moderate to 4 percent in 2012 from about 5 percent in 2011. The
uncertain external environment poses downside risks to export demand and therefore the
underlying fiscal position.
Reestablishing fiscal policy buffers: The government launched a major three-year fiscal
initiative in FY2011/12 to ease infrastructure bottlenecks and enhance job creation. The
authorities should unwind the current fiscal expansion as planned in order to preserve fiscal
and external sustainability and create room to smooth shocks.
Managing inward global spillovers: Current global spillovers might lead to a decline in
mineral exports and thus a significant loss in fiscal revenues. In the event of further adverse
global shocks, staff advised the authorities to allow automatic stabilizers to work on the
revenue side, as long as the public debt is not above the 35 percent of GDP target.
Reinforcing financial stability: Commercial banks, mostly subsidiaries of South African
banks, are well capitalized and profitable, with little direct exposure to the financial turmoil
in Europe. Increased vigilance is however needed to monitor potential vulnerabilities
stemming from a sizeable concentration of banks‘ lending to mortgages, residential
property price buildup and growing household indebtedness.
Promoting inclusive growth and addressing unemployment: Namibia‘s income
inequality and persistently high structural unemployment are key policy challenges. Tackling
these social challenges requires reforms in the public sector employment and wage policies,
and alignment of the curricula for university education, tertiary education, and vocational
training to meet the demand for skilled labor in the broader economy. Strengthening public
expenditure management, procurement, and financial accountability will enhance
institutional capacity that is also crucial to support long-term growth.

Inflation has resumed an upward
trend. Inflation rose significantly to 7¼ percent
(year–on-year) at end-December 2011, but
declined to 6 percent at end July 2012 with an
uptick in September 2012 to 6¾ percent. The
increasing trend initially reflects the impact of
high oil prices, while lately it was driven by a
substantial depreciation of the South African
rand.

3.
Conditions in the banking sector remain favorable. Private sector credit extension
remained robust at 9¾ percent year-on-year at end-December 2011, although slightly below
10¾ percent reached at end-December 2010. Credit was driven by mortgage credit and rapid
expansion of installment credit and overdraft facilities to consumers, which could potentially crowd out
bank funding for productive economic sectors. Nonperforming loans fell to 1½ percent of total loans
at end-December 2011, down from 2 percent at end-December 2010. With overdue loans also
declining, the asset quality of the banking sector has remained satisfactory.
4.
Fiscal policy continues to be fairly expansionary. The overall fiscal deficit in FY2011/12
increased to about 8½ percent of GDP from about 5¾ percent of GDP in FY2010/11 driven largely by
the government‘s temporary Targeted Intervention Program for Employment and Economic Growth
(TIPEEG)1 and the increase in public sector wages.2 The fiscal deficit (excluding the cyclical component

sectors including agriculture, tourism, transport and housing and sanitation.

of SACU revenues) deteriorated significantly from about 2½ percent in FY2010/11 to about 6¼
percent in FY2011/12. Overall public debt increased significantly from 16¼ percent in FY2010/11 to
26½ percent in FY2011/12, including through Namibia‘s debut Eurobond issuance of US$500 million.3
More recently, the Namibia government issued R850 million (US$95 million)
10-year bond in South Africa with a yield of 8.26 percent.
5.
The external position weakened in 2011. Annual export (in US dollar terms) grew by about 9
percent in 2011 compared to about 29 percent in 2010. The moderate export growth in 2011 was
supported mainly by diamond exports (benefiting from stronger prices). Nonmineral exports, notably
manufactured products, and food and live animals also held up. Imports grew faster at 14 percent,
driven by expansionary fiscal policy and eased monetary conditions, which increased private
consumption. As a result, the current account recorded deficit of about 1¾ percent of GDP in 2011
from a surplus of ¼ percent of GDP in 2010.

B. Outlook and Risks
6.

Outlook

Output: Overall output growth is likely to moderate to 4 percent in 2012, reflecting subdued mineral
exports. Staff projects that the real GDP growth will increase slightly to 4¼ percent in 2013 followed
by a moderation to 4 percent in 2014 due to significant fiscal consolidation. Thereafter, GDP growth
is forecast to average about 4 percent over the medium term.
Inflation: Inflation is projected to remain at about 6 percent for the remainder in 2012 mainly due to
exogenous factors coming from higher international fuel and food prices. Inflation is expected to
converge to about 4½ percent in the medium term as international food prices stabilize.
External position: The current account deficit is projected to worsen to 2½ percent of GDP by 2013
reflecting lower SACU revenue. Over the medium-term, prospects for diamond exports are generally
favorable based on supportive prices. Full production of about 3,000 tones/year of uranium is now
expected by 2015 at the new Trekkopje uranium mine, which would raise uranium exports by about
50 percent. The planned fiscal consolidation from 2014 onwards should help to bring the current
account to balance by 2015 with modest surpluses expected thereafter (Table 3). Staff‘s analysis,
using CGER methods, shows that the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) is mildly overvalued,
although these estimates have large confidence bands, suggesting a significant degree of
uncertainty regarding the long-run equilibrium REER, (Appendix IV).
7.

Risks

There are downside risks, both from external and domestic developments. As shown in the staff‘s
risk assessment matrix (RAM) (Table 2), the main near term risk relates to the highly uncertain
external environment. Further deterioration of the euro-area economies may generate significant
negative spillovers to the Namibian economy through trade linkages as a large share of Namibia‘s
total exports—mainly uranium ore, diamonds, beef, unrefined copper and fish—are destined for
Europe. Spillovers could also be transmitted through Namibia‘s linkages with South Africa
(Appendix III). Labor unrests in South Africa, if continued, could potentially affect Namibia, even
though spillovers have been very limited to date. Namibia‘s growth prospects are further clouded by
socioeconomic challenges of high unemployment, poverty and inequality. These challenges require
the need to create stronger engines of more inclusive growth. Another medium-term risk is that, like
other countries in SACU, Namibia faces a possible decline in SACU revenue (which represents about
30 percent of total revenues) in the long-run, either owing to low global growth or changes in the
SACU revenue-sharing formula currently under negotiation.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The authorities largely agreed with the staff’s assessment of recent economic developments, outlook,
and prospects but emphasized that Namibia’s growth remains above world average despite the global
slowdown. Consistent with the initiative of sharpening the Fund’s surveillance of small middle-income
countries (MICs) in sub-Saharan Africa, this year’s consultation with Namibia used an issues-oriented
surveillance framework with policy discussions focusing on five main themes: (i) Rebuilding fiscal policy
buffers and ensuring external sustainability; (ii) managing inward global spillovers ; (iii) reinforcing
financial stability; (iv) promoting inclusive growth and reducing unemployment; and (v) fostering
institutional and capacity development in support of stronger growth.

Staff stressed the need to minimize the fiscal risks associated with the TIPEEG
program. After an increase in development spending in the last year driven largely by the
government‘s temporary TIPEEG, keeping public debt sustainable would require strict adherence to
the government‘s medium-term fiscal plan aimed at delivering a balanced budget by 2015/16.
Spending under TIPPEG would need to be unwound at the end of this initiative as planned by the
authorities in order to safeguard medium term debt and external sustainability.4 Staff‘s analysis
shows that achieving a broadly balanced fiscal position (excluding the cyclical component of SACU
revenues) by 2015/16, consistent with the authorities‘ medium-term fiscal plan, will bring the debtto-GDP ratio to a broadly stable level. However, given the fixed exchange rate regime and the fact
4

Despite the recent increase in the debt level due to the temporary fiscal expansion under the TIPPEG program, the
debt ratio is expected to decline over the medium term under all plausible scenarios as this one-off program
unwinds. Namibia has always been a low debt upper middle-income MIC and staff do not envisage the debt path to
be explosive given the potential of the economy and its diversified nature compared to other predominantly mineral
based MIC economies. Namibia‘s sovereign credit rating also continues to be investment grade quality.

that, like other small MICs, Namibia remains susceptible to global shocks and outward spillovers
amplified by an open capital account and lower buffers, beyond stabilizing the debt level, Namibia
needs to rebuild its reserves buffer. In this context, staff analysis, which includes other small MICs,
show that the current level of reserves is below what would be considered adequate based on
various methods (Appendix I). The gap between Namibia‘s reserves holdings and its adequate level
is expected to widen in the future, with unchanged policies. The exchange rate peg to the rand
could come under pressure if fiscal consolidation to rebuild reserve does not take place. Therefore, a
more ambitious fiscal effort beyond the authorities‘ medium-term expenditure framework would be
advisable (Appendix I).

There is room for improving the quality of spending. The government‘s expenditure
envelope (above 40 percent of GDP), including the wage bill, is high by international standards, thus
necessitating an assessment of pockets of

and reduce any associated distortions
arising from wage settlement practices in the government into the broader labor market
(see Section D). In addition, staff stressed the need to rein in nonwage spending most notably
subsidies and transfers to state-owned enterprises.
11.
Staff underscored the need to address the state of finances of state-owned enterprises
(SOEs) and propel them to contributing to broader national development objectives. Low
productivity in SOEs remains a concern, and continuously large transfers to them place constraints
on the public finances, compromise spending on more productive areas, and pose fiscal risks. In this
context, staff urged speedy implementation of individual performance agreements with SOEs, which
are aimed at ensuring efficient delivery of results and value for money for the public.
12.
Staff also urged the authorities to expedite the implementation of tax reforms in a
manner that ensures predictability and simplicity of the tax system. These include improving
tax compliance, streamlining tax expenditures, and balancing revenue collection with incentives to

invest in the context of authorities‘ intention to tax exports of natural resources. A differentiated tax
rate on export of natural resources is under consideration as part of the government‘s objectives to
broaden the revenue base and encourage domestic value-addition to natural resources. This would
be a turnover tax of 0-2 percent (differentiated across sectors depending on value additional of each
mineral product). Staff supports the government‘s objective to broaden the tax base and encourage
value addition but advised that the selected instrument may not be efficient to achieve these twin
objectives simultaneously. Beyond that, in its current form (close to about 20 rates), the
differentiated export levy does not bode well for the simplicity of the tax system. Thus, some
consideration could be given to using the existing royalty regime or resource rent tax approach.
13.
Caution is warranted in granting preferential tax regimes for businesses, particularly
for the export processing zones (EPZs). Companies with EPZ status enjoy exemptions on
corporate income tax, VAT, stamp and transfer duties and are entitled to a 75 percent refund on
expenditures incurred for training Namibians. The staff‘s judgment is that the effective tax rates of
the VAT and corporate taxes are significantly lower than the statutory rates due to a number of tax
exemptions. Since Namibia‘s VAT rate of 15 percent is about the average for comparator countries,
there is no strong basis for granting VAT exemptions. Staff recommended a review of incentives on
VAT, particularly for EPZs and conducting a full-fledged study on tax expenditures (tax revenues
forgone due to tax incentives). The ongoing work by AFRITAC South on assessing tax gap for
selected countries in the region including Namibia should help.
14.
There is a need to delink the fiscal stance from volatile SACU revenues. The volatility in
diamond and uranium revenues and SACU receipts exposes fiscal revenues to wide swings,
especially during global economic cycles. In these circumstances, and consistent with IMF advice in
other natural resource-rich countries, staff recommended that the government adopts either a fiscal
balance that excludes the cyclical component of SACU receipts and mining revenues or the
structural fiscal balance (a la Chile), which will reinforce the past policy of paying down debt when
there are SACU windfalls.6
Authorities’ views
15.
The authorities broadly concurred with staff on the need to rein in current
expenditures and address unproductive spending, when assessed. They emphasized that while
the government‘s expenditure envelope (as a share of GDP) remains very large, public investment
remained low by international standards. They acknowledged the large government wage bill (at
14 percent of GDP), although they noted that this was a regularity for Southern Africa, thus meriting
a thorough assessment of the underlying reasons for the elevated wage bill in these countries. The
authorities noted that government transfers to SOEs include funding for infrastructure projects
which should be viewed favorably from a broader national development objective. They reiterated

their commitment to keep public debt at a sustainable level, while prioritizing expenditures,
increasing government savings, and financing needed infrastructure projects. The peg to the rand
has served Namibia well and merits continued support through a further buildup of reserve buffers.
16.
They stressed that expenditure restraint will be supported by efforts to broaden the
domestic revenue base and strengthen domestic revenue collection and administration. In that
regard, they noted that significant progress has been made towards establishing a large taxpayer
unit in the Inland Revenue Department and migrating to the integrated tax administration system
(ITAS). They emphasized that they were pragmatic in negotiating the differentiated tax rates on
exports of natural resources with the private sector. They also recognized the need to ensure
simplicity of the tax system. The authorities see the need to conduct a full-fledged study on tax
expenditures so as to streamline tax incentives and minimize revenue losses.

B. Policy Theme 2: Managing Inward Global Spillovers
Issues and staff recommendations
17.
Further deterioration in the global economy may generate significant negative
spillovers for the Namibian economy. Staff analysis shows that the direct immediate impact of
financial stress in Europe on Namibia‘s banking system, will likely be small as banks‘ funding base is
largely domestic. Instead, the ―real economy‖ channel through a collapse of commodity exports will
be the main transmission channel (Appendix II).
18.
Near the border, recent labor disputes in South Africa, most notably the transport
workers’ strike has had some spillover effects on Namibia. One key channel of the spillover
impact is through the exchange rate given Namibia‘s peg to the rand. Another relates to its close
financial linkages with South Africa, including the fact that nonbank financial institutions invest a
significant share of their external assets in the South African market. On the real sector side, so far
there has not been significant demonstration effect on Namibia‘s mining sector. However, this
warrants close monitoring in an economy already experiencing some wage pressures.
19.
Staff stressed that Namibia’s current level of reserves is not sufficiently strong to
respond to large global shocks. If adverse shifts in global economic developments lead to a
decline in mineral prices and thus a significant loss of revenues compared to the budget target (see
the risk assessment matrix (RAM) in Table 2), staff advised the government to allow the automatic
stabilizers to work on the revenue side as long as the public debt is not above the 35 percent of
GDP target. This implies that the government should not increase tax rates to compensate for the
associated cyclical loss in mineral revenues or reduce expenditures to meet the government‘s
budget deficit target. More generally, staff advised that such spillovers and the associated risk spelt
out in the RAM would generally call for policy response to be measured, carefully calibrated, and
proportional to risks and pressures coming from the global economic environment.

Authorities’ views
20.
The authorities agreed that the direct impact of financial stress in Europe on Namibia’s
banking system is limited and that Namibia is affected through the trade channel given its
heavy reliance on mineral exports. That said, the authorities noted that 2012 was evolving better
than expected with resilience in diamond exports (possibly surpassing 1.5 million carats) and a
limited unwinding of the diamond price hikes observed in 2011. Going forward, the authorities
noted the importance of evaluating the effectiveness of Namibia‘s efforts to diversify the economy
away from the mining sector given the continued dominance of mineral exports and the associated
vulnerability to commodity prices shocks. The authorities also concurred that developments in South
Africa warrant close monitoring.

C. Policy Theme 3: Reinforcing Financial Stability
Issues and staff recommendations
21.
Aggregate financial indicators are broadly sound but potential sources of
vulnerabilities to financial stability are emerging. The combination of the property price buildup,
commercial banks‘ large exposure to the property market, the growing household indebtedness,
and the concentration of large institutional investors in bank funding, pose potential vulnerabilities
to financial stability. Mortgage loans represent the largest portion of loans and advances,
accounting for 55.1 percent of the total loan book in 2011.7
22.
A continued build up in property prices could undermine homeowner affordability for
low and middle-income Namibians, as well as, pose potential risk for financial stability. Since
2000, the Namibia residential property prices have increased significantly, with more moderate
increases in 2012. Price buildup is driven by the interplay between supply and demand
(Appendix III). At a time when government policies should aim to enhance inclusive growth and
spread the benefits of growth among society, rapidly rising property prices will make home
ownership beyond the reach of a vast majority of ordinary Namibians. Indicators of housing
affordability and the profiles and income streams of the borrowers do not provide much comfort in
terms of potential risks. Furthermore, NonBank Financial Institutions‘ (NBFIs) are also exposed to the
property market indirectly mainly through their funding of banks‘ wholesale deposits (80 percent of
bank‘s funding comes from NBFIs).
23.
Staff recommended a close monitoring of the financial system’s exposure to mortgage
loans to minimize risks, through a combination of policy options. In particular, staff
recommended that some consideration be given to the possible use of more stringent loan-to-value
ratios than the current local industry norm of 100 percent financing for first time buyers that the
majority of banks use. This should be done in a manner that does not unduly hamper homeowner

In addition, lending to households and corporations may be backed by real estate assets, thus adding to the
exposure of lending portfolios of banks and nonbanks to risks of the real estate market.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NAMIBIA

affordability for low-income Namibians. Staff also urged the BoN to expedite—with ongoing
technical assistance from the Fund—the adoption of bank stress testing techniques that allow
adequate analysis of macro-financial sector linkages and associated risks.
24.
NBFIs require close monitoring. It is critical for the authorities to continue strengthening
supervision of NBFIs and monitor their exposure to the property market (both direct and indirect).
Thus, staff commended the ongoing efforts by the regulatory authorities, Namibia Financial
Institutions Supervisory Authority (NAMFISA), in preparing regulations, guidelines and standards to
accompany new NBFIs sector legislation (Financial Institutions and Markets Bill) and to support
capacity building for staff in the regulatory agency, all in line with the Fund‘s advice (Table 2).
25.
Beyond these, the central government also has a role in minimizing risks to the
property market. Clearly households‘ affordability of property is an important variable and the
government is already contemplating taking policies to increase access to housing as part of its
agenda to enhance more inclusive growth. At the same time, existing restrictions on land supply are
yet to be eased. Such a combination of measures would likely increase price pressures in the
property market. The Government‘s Institutions Pension Fund (GIPF) is considering developing a
housing scheme for fund members to use a portion of their pensions to guarantee mortgage loans.
This could entail some risk without necessarily improving housing affordability. Nevertheless, if the
government proceeds with this plan, staff recommended the tightening of eligibility requirements
for the scheme. Policies to increase demand for housing ought to be carefully calibrated in close
tandem with plans to gradually ease restrictions on land supply.
Authorities’ views
26.
The authorities underscored that there are no signs of property price bubble and
pointed to the moderation in property prices in recent months. They stressed that, like staff,
they are concerned about the impact of the property price buildup on housing affordability for
low-income Namibians. Moreover, while the large concentration of commercial banks assets in
mortgage loans, the elevated level of household indebtedness and the concentration of large
institutional investors (pension funds and insurance companies) in wholesale bank funding are a
concern, the risks to financial stability have been reduced with several policy measures being put in
place by the BoN. Further, given the limited development of local financial markets, there was no
evidence of volatile wholesale bank deposits. Notable macroprudential policies in place include the
requirement by the BoN for commercial banks to apply risks weights on mortgage loans above
Basel II norms. They stressed that nonperforming loans continue to be low by international
standards. With regards to the NBFIs exposure to the property market, they stressed that this was
limited to 5 percent. They also noted that the memorandum of understanding between the BoN and
NAMFISA for continuous information sharing will enable pre-emptive policy actions.

D. Policy Theme 4: Promoting Inclusive Growth and Reducing
Unemployment
Issues and staff recommendations
27.
There is an urgent need to address the phenomenon of jobless growth, as
unemployment and poverty levels remain high. The country‘s Gini coefficient, at 0.59 in 2009/10,
is one of the highest in the world. The official unemployment rate is now estimated at 34 percent
according to the most recent household income and expenditure survey (HIES). High unemployment
rate reflects skills mismatch in the labor market and possibly public sector wage policies
(Appendix V).
28.
Staff emphasized that public works program through TIPEEG may not necessarily
succeed in putting a sustainable dent on long-term or structural unemployment due to their
temporary nature. The authorities‘ TIPEEG aims to support job creation by easing infrastructure
bottlenecks in targeted sectors of the economy. While TIPEEG‘s goal of easing infrastructure
bottlenecks in labor intensive sectors is appropriate, broader industrial policies to protect certain
industries may not necessarily deliver the intended outcomes and could in fact create unintended
distortions. In addition, implementation difficulties, due to capacity constraints, could however
reduce the program‘s possible impact on domestic job creation. TIPEEG should also have a skill
development component in order to maximize its job creation potential on a sustainable basis.
Tackling the high level of structural unemployment would also require changing the public sector
employment and wage policies, and to align tertiary education and training to meet the demand for
skilled labor in the broader economy. Further progress in developing downstream primary sectors
and raising the effective cost of capital through rationalization of generous tax incentives to limit the
current bias toward capital-intensive sectors, could also help support job creation.
29.
Given the negative impact of income inequalities on the duration of growth, staff
recommended policies to target inequality at the sources. These include fostering targeted
investment in health and education as well as supporting financial inclusion. The latter could draw
upon measures outlined in the authorities‘ 2011–2021 Financial Sector Strategy plan on encouraging
financial access to a broader part of the population, while limiting the associated regulatory risks,
including money laundering. This would complement current redistributive aspects of fiscal policy
including targeting a direct redistribution of income. Staff‘s analysis of household survey data for
Namibia and other MIC countries suggest that despite the expansion of social programs and their
beneficiaries, they have been relatively less effective in targeting the very poor when compared with
other upper MIC countries (Appendix V). Thus, in staff‘s view, while Namibia is an upper middle
income on the basis of per capita GDP, some consideration could be given in treating it as a ―special
case‖ for donor funding given the enormous social challenges it faces.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NAMIBIA

Authorities’ views
30.
The authorities reiterated that enhancing job creation and more inclusive growth are
the key pillars of their tightly focused fourth National Development Plan (NDP4). The
FY2012/13 Budget is unrelenting in its resource allocation to priority economic and infrastructure
sectors, with the objective of placing the economy on a high and inclusive growth trajectory.
31.
They concurred that TIPEEG should have a skill development component to help make
workers more competitive for private sector jobs. In this context, they noted the recent creation
of a Human Resource Development Council and Productivity Centre, which aim at addressing the
skills mismatch in the labor market. The Ministry of Labor is also working on a jobs search program
to create a platform for linking the availability of job vacancies to relevant skills to reduce frictional
unemployment. Despite these efforts, the authorities maintained that there are no easy fixes to
these daunting socio-economic challenges and therefore there is a need to respond with several
policy initiatives to enhance faster job creation.

E. Policy Theme 5: Fostering Institutional and Capacity Development in
Support of Stronger Growth and Data Issues
Issues and staff recommendations
32.
Despite its upper middle income status, Namibia like other small middle-income
countries in sub-Saharan Africa has capacity that is unevenly distributed across the
government. According to the World Bank‘s government effectiveness indices, for Namibia, the
private sector‘s perception of the quality of public services and civil service bureaucracy are less
positive than in Botswana, Mauritius, South Africa and Seychelles.
33.
The Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) report of 2008 provides
some practical sequence of reforms to Namibia’s public expenditure, procurement, and
financial accountability systems. Staff commended the government for announcing plans to take
action across the board, including the public financial management (PFM) framework, given the
low-ranking areas identified in the PEFA report, especially when compared with ratings assigned to
other middle-income countries.
34.
Data quality is broadly adequate for surveillance, although there is room for
improvement. In this regard, staff urged the authorities to take further steps to improve the quality
of its key macroeconomic statistics as recognized in the FY2012/13 Budget. Staff welcomed the
authorities‘ decision to conduct a labor force survey on an annual basis, so that the government can
monitor progress toward its employment goals and more generally labor market conditions. The
2009/10 HIES should also provide a good basis for updating the weights in the national consumer
price index, which dates back to the early 1990s. In this respect, staff welcomed recent technical
assistance visit by IMF experts in the area of consumer price statistics. There is also room for
improvement in the compilation of the balance of payments statistics, most notably on the large

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NAMIBIA

errors and omissions. These efforts should be accelerated to help propel Namibia towards
subscribing to the IMF‘s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS).
Authorities’ views

35.
The authorities acknowledged the need for fostering institutional and capacity
development and strengthening the quality of statistics. The government noted that they are
pursuing a PFM reform agenda assisted by IMF and the European Union. After a somewhat
successful pilot, the government plans to roll-out program budgeting to all ministries and
government agencies in the coming years. To enhance government‘s capacity to collect and compile
high quality statistics, Namibia Statistics Agency (NSA) has been transformed to a fully autonomous
agency. The publication of the recently completed 2009/10 Household Income and Expenditure
Survey in a fully transparent manner on the NSA‘s website, as well as details of the national accounts
and price statistics, are significant milestones.

STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
The current fragile external environment poses risks to Namibia’s export demand.
Against this backdrop and Namibia‘s limited policy buffers, a delicate balancing act in the
implementation of macroeconomic policies is needed in the near term. In a more adverse global
scenario than currently anticipated, the authorities should allow the automatic stabilizers to work on
the revenue side as long as the public debt is not above the 35 percent of GDP target.
37.
Return to fiscal prudence is required to rebuild policy buffers. Staff strongly
recommends the unwinding of TIPEEG at the end of the initiative, as envisaged in the authorities‘
medium-term expenditure framework, to safeguard debt and external sustainability. Fiscal restraint is
also needed to help preserve a sound external position and the sustainability of the peg to the South
African rand, which has served the country well and merits continued support.
38.
To improve competitiveness and fiscal sustainability, the authorities should articulate
bold measures to achieve wage restraint. In the short term, consideration could also be given to
tightening the eligibility requirements for various allowances for the civil servants and imposing a
hiring freeze. Medium-term measures could include (i) formalizing a wage rule in which nominal
wage adjustments in Namibia should take into account both expected inflation and productivity
growth; (ii) rationalizing the size and structure of government; and (iii) tightening the link between
pay and performance.
39.
Staff commends the sense of urgency recognized by the government to address the
state of finances of the State-owned enterprises (SOEs). There is a need for a speedy SOE reform
most notably the implementation of their individual performance agreements.
40.
Reforms to broaden tax base should be done in a manner that enhances the
predictability and simplicity of the tax system. These include improving tax compliance,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

NAMIBIA

streamlining tax expenditures, and balancing revenue collection goals with incentives to invest
particularly in the context of the authorities‘ intention to introduce individual export levy
differentiated across mineral exports.
41.
The government should consider adopting either a fiscal rule that excludes the cyclical
component of SACU receipts and mining revenues or the structural fiscal balance (a la Chile).
This will reinforce the authorities‘ past policy of paying down debt when there are SACU windfalls as
well as prepare the authorities for possible future decline in SACU revenues.
42.
Financial sector indicators are broadly sound and commercial banks are well capitalized
and profitable. Increased vigilance is, however, needed to monitor potential vulnerabilities
stemming from a sizeable concentration of lending to mortgages, property price buildup, growing
household indebtedness, and the concentration of large institutional investors in bank funding.
43.
Staff supports the authorities’ tightly focused development objectives that are laid out
in the recent National Development Plan (NDP4) given high inequality and unemployment.
Current redistributive aspects of fiscal policy should be complemented with policies that tackle
inequality through fostering effective investment in education and health and enhancing financial
inclusion. Staff supports recent government policy initiatives including the Human Resource
Development Council to address the skill mismatch in the labor market.
44.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Namibia take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

-Tighten fiscal stance over the medium term
-Keep public debt below the announced target
-Set a target on non-SACU fiscal balance to
isolate fiscal policy from volatile SACU revenues.

Partially consistent
The FY2012/13 budget is fairly
expansionary although the current
MTEF envisages fiscal consolidation in
the medium term after the TIPEEG
initiative. Public debt has been kept
below the announced target although it
is rising rapidly. The fiscal stance is not
formally delinked from SACU revenue
but past policy of using SACU windfall
revenues to reduce to public debt is
consistent with Fund advice.
Inconsistent
Authorities have not articulated
measures to contain the wage bill which
continues to grow.
Partially consistent
Implementation of performance
agreements with SOEs is sluggish
although the SOEs policy framework
was approved by Parliament in 2010.
Broadly consistent
Exchange rate peg to South Africa has
been maintained. The BoN has
consistently kept its policy rate 50 basis
points above the SARB repo rate.
Partially consistent
Reserves have fluctuated around
3-3.5 months of imports.
Broadly consistent
NAMFISA is preparing regulations and
guidelines to accompany new NBFIs
sector legislation. Risks weights on
mortgage loans are above Basel II
norms and BoN has plans to require
more exposed banks to argument
capital buffers.

Impact if Realized
Medium to high
Such intensification would have global effects,
including lower world growth, falling
commodity prices and higher risk aversion. This
would directly affect almost 50 percent of
Namibia‘s exports especially mineral exports.
The resultant slower activity in South Africa
would have indirect impact on Namibia‘s fiscal
position through the risk of lower SACU
transfers.
Medium to High
A hard landing in emerging countries would
primarily affect commodity prices, which would
have a particularly strong impact on Namibia
export earnings. Direct and indirect impact (via
South Africa) could have more severe effects
now, as fiscal buffers have been drawn down.
Medium
Oil prices could increase beyond the cyclical
levels for geopolitical considerations. As
Namibia imports all fuel requirements, terms of
trade shocks from the fuel price hike would
adversely affect domestic demand. Oil prices
could also affect inflation in Namibia.
Low
Key channels of impact could arise from
Namibia‘s peg to the rand and from the close
financial linkages-many banks in Namibia are
subsidiaries of parent banks from South Africa.
On the real sector side, so far demonstration
effects on wage demands in Namibia‘s mining
sector have been limited.
Medium to High
A delay in the authorities‘ planned fiscal
consolidation could lead to unsustainable fiscal
and external positions yielding pressure on the
exchange rate peg with the South Africa rand.
Medium to High
A reversal of the acceleration in Namibia‘s
residential property prices could have a
negative impact on financial sector stability
given banks high exposure .The problem could
be accentuated by cross linkages between
banks and inadequately supervised nonbanks
and the high household debt burden.

Appendix I. Reserves Adequacy and Fiscal Policy in Middle Income
Countries of SSA: Implications for Namibia1
1.
In the last decade, reserves of middle-income countries (MIC) of SSA increased five
times in dollar terms. The desire by countries to hold more reserves is driven by the important role
of reserves in both preventing crises and mitigating their impact. However, holding reserves is costly
and the utility of reserves have diminishing returns. It is important to strike a balance between the
reserves‘ crises prevention and mitigation feature and their cost.
2.
This appendix has applied a new method, developed by the IMF, to determining the
adequacy of reserves for MICs in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).2 The method uses a metric-based
approach which focuses on potential balance of payments pressures. In general, this approach
suggests that coverage in the region of 100–150 percent of the metric might be adequate. The table
below shows that Botswana, Lesotho, and Mauritius have comfortable amount of reserves, while the
level of reserves of Cape Verde, Namibia, and Swaziland are well below the 100 percent of the level
suggested by the metrics.3

The analysis here has also calculated
how much reserves would be required to
satisfy simple rules of thumb that have
been widely used for measuring reserves
adequacy. The comparison of the results from
traditional rules of thumbs and the new
metrics against the actual holdings of reserves

There have been considerable developments in the theoretical literature on the
determinants of reserves. The literature states two motives for reserves demand: precautionary and
mercantile and uses different type of variables to measure the size of these motives. Below we have
grouped the determinants of international reserves into two broad categories: (i) describing
country‘s external position, and (ii) describing country‘s macroeconomic policy.
5.
A long-run relationship between
reserves and its determinants is identified for
MICs of SSA. For this purpose, we have used
annual data from 1990 till 2011 and employed
panel cointegration techniques. We used seven
statistics to identify cointegration relationship
between gross reserves and its determinants.
The table below presents the results of our
cointegration analysis between reserves, exports
plus current transfers, and government
expenditure adjusted for external budgetary
grants.

Three statistics out of seven reject the hypothesis of no cointegration with 95 percent
confidence interval and one statistics rejects with 90 percent confidence interval. Importantly,
group mean ADF tests, which has the best performance in short panels rejects no cointegration
hypothesis with 95 percent confidence interval.
7.
Fully modified ordinary least square method is used to estimate the coefficients of the
cointegrating vector. This method deals with both serial correlation and endogeneity issues.411

The reason why we added current transfers to the export is that the series for current transfers has negative
numbers, which does not allow us to logarithm the series.

The results show that while county’s reserves holdings increase with exports and
current transfers, it decreases in response to the expansion of government spending. These
results could be used by policymakers in MICs to guide their macroeconomic policies to ensure the
adequacy of reserves and the sustainability of these policies.
9.
To take a medium-term prospective on reserves adequacy for Namibia, we extended
the calculations through 2015 based on the new metrics of reserves adequacy. The results
suggest that on average during 2012–15 the projected gross reserves will be 70 percent of average
level of reserves generated by the metric. Also, we applied the framework developed by DablaNorris et al (2011) to measuring the optimal level of reserves for Namibia. The results based on the
average data for 2007–11 suggests that optimal level of reserves for Namibia was 4.8 month of
imports, while actual for that period was 3.6 months. We also used the current projections until 2015
to see whether in the medium-term the level of reserves is expected to approach to the optimal
level.

10.
The results confirmed the outcome obtained using the new metrics and suggest that
the current gap between optimal and actual reserves will widen in the future. This could
become a possible source of vulnerability in the country and could potentially undermine the
sustainability of macroeconomic policies.
11.
Macroeconomic policy mix needs to be recalibrated to rebuild policy buffers for
preventing and mitigating possible impacts of external shocks. Given the fixed exchange rate
regime in Namibia, the role of monetary policy is constrained. The only active policy tool left
therefore is fiscal policy. Our analysis suggests that fiscal policy consolidation could possibly help to
accumulate reserves faster.
12.
Our calculations suggest that to ensure the adequacy of reserves in the medium-term,
fiscal consolidation should be accelerated through reducing the expenditure to GDP ratio by
32

NAMIBIA

6 percentage points by 2015 compared with the baseline projections. In order to achieve the
adequate level of reserves the annual growth rate of reserves should increase by six percentage
points on average until 2015 compared with current projections. Given the estimated elasticity of
-1.22 percent between government expenditure and gross reserves, to achieve accelerated reserves
accumulation, the average annual growth rate of government expenditure should be reduced about
five percentage points, which implies six percentage points reduction in expenditure to GDP ratio by
2015 compared with current projections.

Appendix II. Spillovers from the Global Slowdown1
1.
This appendix assesses the potential spillovers on Namibia that could come from both
South Africa and further deterioration in the global economic outlook. As a mineral-based and
highly open economy, Namibia is potentially vulnerable to the global slowdown through different
channels, primarily through trade channels via world commodity price decline. As a result, fiscal
revenues from mining sectors will decline, which could undermine the underlying fiscal position.
2.
Both as members of the Southern Africa Customs Union (SACU), outward spillover
from South Africa to Namibia could be particularly strong. First, customs revenue in Namibia,
which accounts for a substantial amount of fiscal revenue heavily depends on South Africa‘s trade.
Second, South Africa is Namibia‘s largest trading partner. About 30 percent of Namibia‘s exports go
to South Africa, while 70 percent of the country‘s imports are from South Africa. Third, Namibia pegs
its currency to the South African rand, in practice, adopting monetary policy decisions from the
South African Reserve Bank. Fourth, South African financial groups are the dominant player in the
financial markets of the region, spanning banking, pension, insurance, and wealth management
services, whose treasury and risk management decisions tend to be centralized in Johannesburg.
Fifth, a significant share of Namibian nonbank financial institutions‘ assets is placed in South Africa.
3.
Namibia’s economy is also likely to be affected
directly through the trade channel by sluggish world’s
growth and increasing world food and fuel prices.
Other than South Africa, the largest export destinations
with Namibia include the Euro area, United Kingdom,
United States, and China (see Figure).2 Minerals, diamond
and fish accounts for about 50 percent of Namibia‘s
export. As Namibia is a small open economy, the export
volume for these commodities is unlikely to be affected,
but the total export value is subject to the world
commodity price fluctuations.
4.
To explore the impact of global economic slowdown on the SACU region via South
Africa, staff uses three different econometric methodologies.3 First, dynamic panel regressions
for the BLNS countries are estimated using the generalized method of moments. The panel results
suggest that, once global developments and domestic fiscal policies are taken into account, the
evolution of South African GDP growth has not contributed to the systematic growth development
of the region as a whole. Second, country-specific vector-autoregressive (VAR) models are used to

explore relationship between growth in BNLS countries and selected developments in South Africa,
after controlling for world growth. The results suggest that events that affect world growth tend to
impact negatively on the GDP growth for Namibia, Botswana, and Swaziland but not Lesotho. South
Africa‘s real GDP growth does not seem to contribute much to GDP growth in these countries, after
controlling for world growth, except in Lesotho.4 South Africa‘s domestic demand, however, does
matter in Namibia, Lesotho, and Swaziland even after controlling for world economic growth. Lastly,
the IMF‘s GIMF model calibrated for South Africa shows that shocks that affect credit in the euro
area, or global risk aversion, would have global implications that will affect commodity prices and
external demand with a non-negligible impact on South Africa. It would also affect countries like
Namibia that depend on commodity prices and external demand. The model also shows that policy
reactions are crucial in determining the outcome.
5.
Additional results from VAR model using quarterly data indicate that Namibia’
economic growth could be

and positive impact on
Namibia‘s export growth. The results are not surprising given that these are the three largest export
destinations for Namibia. However, only economic growth in South Africa and the United Kingdom
also has positive impact on Namibia‘s real GDP growth. This result might due to the fact that both
UK and South Africa have other strong linkages with Namibia other than trade, such as foreign
direct investment. Economic growth in the euro area, in addition, has a significant impact on world
diamond and base metal prices, which could further justify its impact on Namibia‘s export.
6.
In sum, natural-resource based and highly open economies like Namibia are
vulnerable to global economic spillovers. The analysis in this appendix, which explores spillover
from South Africa as well as other global economies, shows that potential slowdown in South Africa
tends to be correlated with the economic slowdown in Namibia, while the slowdown in other
advanced economies could also affect the growth in Namibia, both directly and indirectly. The
estimated impact on base metal and diamond prices from world economy is significant, which could
lead to a loss in fiscal revenues and weaken the underlying fiscal position.

4

However, when using quarterly data, South Africa‘s real GDP growth has a significant positive impact on Namibia‘s
growth.

Appendix III. Determinants of Property Prices in Namibia1
1.
Over the past few years, the Namibian residential property market prices have
increased significantly. The Namibian authorities
have questioned whether the price buildup in the
property market could pose potential risks to
financial sector stability.2 A correction of the past
increase could potentially have negative
implications for financial sector stability given the
high concentration of banks‘ credit in mortgage
loans and the growing household sector
indebtedness.

higher than fundamentals-based prices. In this regard, constraints on land supply, growth in
mortgage lending, and historically low interest rates may support further price acceleration creating
potential for asset-price bubbles going forward. This warrants the authorities to continue monitoring
property market developments closely well as enforcing banks‘ adherence to prudential lending
regulations, while requiring the more exposed banks to argument their capital buffers.

All the variables are in natural logs and, thus, are elasticities that can be directly
compared except for the real interest rate. The results imply that (i) a one percent rise in GDP per
capita raises the average residential property prices by 3.3 percent, (ii) a one percentage point hike in
real interest rates reduces the residential property prices by 0.03 percent, (iii) a one percent increase
in real private sector mortgage loans raises the residential property prices by 0.27 percent, and (iv) a
one percent increase in land supply will reduce prices by 0.28 percent.
6.
Since Namibia imports South Africa’s interest to support the peg to the South African
rand, there is limited scope to influence the property market through interest rates. Thus, the
close monitoring of the financial system‘s exposure to mortgage loans and loan guarantees is
essential, given the high level of concentration of bank funding to the real estate market. The
financial sector regulator should ensure that banks adhere to prudential lending regulations, while
encouraging the more exposed banks to argument their capital buffers. The authorities should also
contribute to restraint in price buildup in the property market in the long term by increasing the
availability of serviced land including through land reform.

Appendix IV. Exchange Rate Assessment1
1.
This appendix provides an assessment of Namibia’s real effective exchange rate (REER)
based on CGER methodologies for calculating the equilibrium REER and country-specific
economic information. The Namibian dollar, issued by the Bank of Namibia, has been pegged at
par to the rand since its introduction in 1993, and is legal tender only in Namibia. Thus, monetary
policy plays a passive role in Namibia given the peg to the rand, following closely the policy rate in
South Africa.
2.
The analysis suggests that the Namibian
dollar is slightly overvalued. Table 1 presents the
results of analysis of exchange rate misalignments
in Namibia in 2012 based on four different
methodologies. The estimates obtained indicate
some degree of overvaluation ranging from
0.4-6 percent based on four measures

The macroeconomic balance approach calculates the difference between the current
account balance projected over the medium term at prevailing exchange rates, and an estimated
equilibrium current account balance. According to the macro balance approach, the Namibian dollar

is 2.4 percent above its equilibrium level in 2012 (see first chart). However, this overvaluation is
projected to diminish from 2015 onwards.

The external sustainability approach also estimates exchange rate misalignments as the
exchange rate adjustment required to close the external gap. The target path of NFA (of
21.1 percent of GDP by 2017) was based on the fiscal sustainability analysis for Namibia undertaken
by IMF staff in 2012. Using the same elasticities as in the macroeconomic balance approach would
suggest an overvaluation of about 6.1 percent in 2012. However, the REER is expected to mean
revert to its equilibrium level by 2017 when the current account is expected to stabilize the net
foreign asset position.
6.
The purchasing power parity
approach estimate panel regression of the
ratio of the PPP exchange rate to the market
exchange rate as a function of GDP per
capita at ―PPP dollars‖ and subsequently
evaluate the residuals of the regressions to
determine the degree of exchange rate
misalignment. The PPP approach indicates
that exchange rate is overvalued by
1.7 percent in 2012.

Nonprice competitiveness indicators suggest that Namibia performs well relative to its
peers, but important challenges persist. Namibia performs better than other middle-income
countries in terms of strength of institutions, financial market development and labor market
efficiency. However, the country lags behind peer countries in health and primary education. These
indicators suggest that Namibia need to prioritize investment in health and primary education to
improve the investment.

Appendix V. Promoting Inclusive Growth and Employment in Namibia1
1.
Since Independence Namibia has managed to significantly reduce poverty and income
inequality. Nevertheless, despite the progress achieved, inequality in Namibia remains among the
highest in the world, and the rate at which inequality has declined has slowed down: whereas the
Gini coefficient declined from 0.70 in 1993/94 to 0.60 in 2003/04, it declined only to 0.59 in 2009/10.

Given that labor income (which includes wages and salaries and most earnings for the
self employed) is the main sources of household income, the issue of income inequality is
related to the other main challenge in Namibia, namely, the high and persistent rate of
unemployment. According to the latest National Income and Expenditure Survey (NIES)
corresponding to the years 2009/10, the unemployment rate remains high at 34 percent.
3.
Thus, one of the key challenges for the Namibian economy is how to sustain high
growth while decreasing inequality and unemployment. This appendix analyzes the related
issues of income inequality, unemployment, and inclusive growth. In particular, it draws upon
previous studies to answer the following four questions in the context of Namibia: (i) What has been
the incidence in Namibia of growth over the period 1993/94–2009/10 and how inclusive the grown
was over the same period? (ii) What would be the impact of reducing inequality in Namibia in terms
of lengthening growth spells? (iii) What explains the high level of unemployment in Namibia? and
(iv) Has growth in Namibia over the period 1995–2010 been accompanied by structural

transformation, defined as the shift of workers from low to high average productivity activities and
sectors?
4.
In terms of the inclusive growth, we apply the methodology used in Chapter 2 of the
African Department’s Fall 2011 SSA Regional Economic Outlook (REO) to the cases of Namibia
and its close comparator, Mauritius. In particular, we estimate growth incidence curves for real
consumption per capita and compare them with those of the previous survey (i.e., between
1993/94–2009/10 for Namibia and 1996/1997–2006/2007 for Mauritius). Using this analysis, we
make an assessment of the incidence of growth and the extent to which growth over the period has
been inclusive.
5.
The results suggest that, compared to other sub-Saharan African countries analyzed in
IMF (2011), Mauritius and Namibia have performed well. As shown in Figure 1, Namibia,
registered positive growth in real consumption per capita for all segments of the population over
the 11 years from 1993 to 2010. Growth was also highly inclusive during the initial period
(1993/04–2003/04), since households in the lower per capita income deciles registered higher
growth rates than households in the middle and upper deciles. This is consistent with the significant
decline in the Gini coefficient experienced over this period. The result probably reflects the impact of
post-independence social policies that favored segments of the population that were typically
excluded under the previous regime.

Despite Namibia’s favorable growth pattern earlier, from 2003/04 to 2009/10 growth
became much more neutral in terms of its incidence across per capita income deciles. As can
be seen in Figure 1, the growth incidence curve lost much of its slope, so growth became less
inclusive. This is consistent with the fact that inequality in Namibia declined only marginally. It
should be noticed, though, that the Gini coefficient corresponds to income, while the growth
incidence curve corresponds to consumption per capita, Gini coefficient shows a slight decrease in

For Mauritius, as depicted in Figure 3, all groups have experienced positive growth in

real expenditure consumption per capita when comparing the different waves of the survey.
When one considers data from the 1996/1997 survey8.4compared with the 2006/2007 survey, it seems
that both the poorest percentiles and the richest percentiles have experienced growth well above
7.6
the mean (both in terms of the growth rate in mean and
mean growth rates). Nevertheless, when
comparing the 2001/2002 survey with the latest survey, richer groups have experienced higher

growth in expenditures, pointing to a more unequal distribution of the benefits of growth in recent
years.

This change in the incidence of growth has possibly been the result of weaker
targeting or leakage of social programs, or the expansion of expenditure not targeted to the
poor, which has resulted in government expenditure become less progressive. While testing
this hypothesis requires using disaggregated data on income by source (labor earnings, rental
income, pensions, social transfers, etc.), the fact that further reductions in inequality are proving
more difficult should be a source of concern as the level of inequality in Namibia is still among the
highest in the world.
9.
In order for Namibia to return to the inclusive growth pattern registered over the first
decade after Independence, a reallocation of government expenditures (including tax
expenditures) should be undertaken to increase its progressiveness. Namibia‘s public
expenditures as a share of GDP are among the highest in upper-middle income countries. It is
possible to reallocate public expenditures in a way that keeps total spending constant while
increasing its progressiveness: based on a thorough analysis of the incidence of public expenditures,
programs and transfers that do not reach or benefit their intended beneficiaries should be corrected
or eliminated. Potential pockets of inefficiencies should also be identified and eliminated.
10.
Reducing income inequality, in addition to being an objective in and of itself, as
recognized in the NDP4 by including it as one of the key objectives, may also be instrumental
in sustaining economic growth. In analyzing the impact of reducing inequality in Namibia on
lengthening the duration of growth spells, we apply the results of the empirical model of correlates
of duration of growth spells

On the determinants of unemployment in Namibia, we draw upon the results of the
recent work by Leigh and Flores (2012), which shows that the high level of unemployment in
the SACU region is attributable to structural rather than cyclical factors. In particular, their work
shows that structural factors, including rapid wage growth above productivity increases, the existing
skills mismatch, and the wage policies in the public sector can account for most of the high level of
unemployment in the region. Namibia‘s Targeted Intervention Initiative for Employment and
Economic Growth needs to be complemented with policies to address these structural factors.
12.
Finally, the chapter on Structural Transformation in the Fall 2012 issue of the Regional
Economic Outlook (REO) has important results for Namibia. This chapter shows that growth in
Namibia has been accompanied by some structural transformation, since over the period workers
have continued to migrate from low average productivity sectors (such as agriculture) to higher
average productivity ones (such as manufacturing and services). Nevertheless, the analysis also
shows that productivity growth in the agricultural sector has remained stagnant at best, and might
have even declined, which is detrimental to inclusive growth given the high share of low-income
households who derive a significant share of their income from agricultural activities. This contrasts
sharply with the case of South Africa, which over the same period has managed to significantly
increase labor productivity in the agricultural sector.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. The
authorities provide core monthly data to the Fund with a lag of one to two months, except for the
national accounts and international trade data, which are reported quarterly and annually with
longer lags. The authorities completed the 2009/10 National Household Income and Expenditure
Survey (HIES) which allowed the re-estimated of the Gini coefficients. The Namibia Statistics
Agency (NSA) was recently transformed into a fully autonomous agency in order to enhance the
government’s capacity to collect and compile high quality statistics.
National Accounts: National accounts estimation has not kept pace with changes to the structure
of the economy. The authorities are, however, rebasing the outdated national accounts base year,
(currently 2004) and are expecting to complete the process by August 2013. Seasonally adjusted
quarterly national accounts (QNA) estimates, at 2004 constant prices are disseminated on the
NSA’s website, though there is a need to improve existing source data. Plans by the NSA to
produce current price QNA are progressing well.
Price Statistics: In February 2005, the government introduced a nation-wide consumer price index
to replace the previous index that only covered the capital city of Windhoek; the new index is
available from January 2002. However, the weights for the index are estimated from the 1993–94
HIES and seasonal items and new products are excluded. The authorities are now updating the CPI
consumer basket and weights using the 2009/10 HIES. Data on the labor market, including labor
force, employment, and wages are not regularly collected, which impedes the analysis of labor
market developments. Going forward, the authorities will now carry out regular annual labor force
surveys.
Government Finance Statistics: Annual budgetary central government data by fiscal year, which
are reported on a cash basis in the GFSM 2001 format, are reasonably complete, despite some
gaps in terms of details. No fiscal statistics are compiled for extra budgetary institutions,
consolidated central government, or consolidated general government.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Monthly monetary statistics for the Bank of Namibia (BoN)
and the other depository corporations (ODCs) are reported on a regular basis, although there is
room to improve the timeliness of reporting, particularly with regard to BoN data. Beginning in
April 2002, data are based on standardized report forms, which accord with the concepts and
definitions of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual.
Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Statistics: External Debt: Since
2001, the BoN has been reporting the balance of payments data on a quarterly basis with a lag of
one quarter. Those data are subject to substantial revisions. The methodology underlying the
balance of payments is consistent with the fifth edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual.
There is room to improve the compilation of the BOP statistics most notably on the large errors
and omissions. The international investment position (IIP) data are compiled quarterly with a lag of
one quarter. The Bank of Namibia has focused its work to improve the compilation of capital and
financial transactions and IIP statistics. They have expanded their data collection capabilities
through survey data collection. However, further work is needed to expand the coverage of the IIP
and restate the IIP in a format that will allow for comparison with the balance of payments
statistics.

II. Data Standards and Quality
Namibia has participated in the GDDS since late 2002. A ROSC (Data Module) was published in
2002 and updated in 2005.
III. Reporting to STA
The MOF reports, on a regular basis, annual data for publication in the Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook. Work on establishing monthly reporting of high frequency data is still in
progress.
The BoN reports monetary and financial statistics to STA regularly. Balance of payments and
international investment position data are published in International Financial Statistics (IFS) and in
the Balance of Payments Yearbook.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 20, 2013

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation
with Namibia
On February 8, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Namibia. 1
Background
The Namibian economy bounced back strongly from the 2008–09 financial crises but
growth slowed to about 5 percent in 2011 (just below the average for its peer Middle
Income Countries group) compared with 6½ percent in 2010 due to contraction in the
mining sector. The strong performance of the primary sector led to a rebound in growth
in the second quarter of 2012. Mineral exports are, however, expected to decelerate in
the last half of 2012 due to the weak external economic environment and Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) growth will likely moderate to 4 percent in 2012. Inflation rose
significantly to 7¼ percent (year–on-year) at end-December 2011, but declined to 6
percent at end July 2012 with an uptick in September 2012 to 6¾ percent. The
increasing trend reflects the impact of high oil prices and a substantial depreciation of
the South African rand caused by the on-going industrial strikes in South Africa.
Conditions in the banking sector remain favorable. Private sector credit extension
remained robust at 9¾ percent (year on year) at end-December 2011, although slightly
below 10¾ percent reached at end-December 2010. Credit was driven by mortgage
credit and rapid expansion of installment credit and overdraft facilities to consumers,
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings
up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
which could potentially crowd out bank funding for productive economic sectors.
Nonperforming loans fell to 1½ percent of total loans at end-December 2011, down from
2 percent at end-December 2010. With overdue loans also declining, the asset quality of
the banking sector has remained satisfactory. While the aggregate financial indicators
are broadly sound, potential sources of vulnerabilities to financial stability are emerging
from the combination of property price buildup, commercial banks’ large exposure to the
property market, the growing household indebtedness and the concentration of large
institutional investors in bank funding.
Fiscal policy continues to be fairly expansionary. The overall fiscal deficit in FY2011/12
increased to about 8½ percent of GDP from about 5¾ percent of GDP in FY2010/11
driven largely by the government’s temporary Targeted Intervention Program for
Employment and Economic Growth (TIPEEG) and the public sector wage increase. The
fiscal deficit (excluding the cyclical component of Southern Africa Customs Union
revenues) deteriorated significantly from about 2½ percent in FY2010/11 to about 6¼
percent in FY2011/12. Overall public debt increased significantly from 16¼ percent in
FY2010/11 to 26½ percent in FY2011/12, including through Namibia’s debut Eurobond
issuance of US$500 million in November 2011. More recently, the Namibia government
issued an R850 million (US$95 million) 10-year bond in South Africa with a yield of 8.26
percent.
The external position weakened in 2011. Annual exports (in US dollar terms) grew by
about 9 percent in 2011 compared to about 29 percent in 2010. The moderate export
growth in 2011 was supported mainly by diamond exports (benefiting from stronger
prices). Nonmineral exports, notably manufactured products, and food and live animals
also held up. Imports grew faster at 14 percent, driven by expansionary fiscal policy
which supported growth in both public consumption and public capital expenditure and
eased monetary conditions in the domestic economy which boosted private
consumption. As a result, the current account recorded deficit of about 1¾ percent of
GDP in 2011 from a surplus of ¼ percent of GDP in 2010.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Namibia’s strong macroeconomic performance
following the crisis. Medium-term prospects remain favorable although subject to
downside risks from external and internal developments. Directors called for continued
commitment to sound policies and structural reforms to build adequate policy buffers,
preserve financial stability, foster stronger and inclusive growth, and reduce
unemployment.
Directors agreed on the need for a tighter fiscal stance in order to rebuild policy buffers,
including reserves, and support the peg to the South African rand. They encouraged the
authorities to strengthen their fiscal framework by delinking the fiscal stance from volatile

3
Southern African Customs Union (SACU) and mining revenues. This would reinforce the
past policy of paying down debt when there are SACU windfalls.
Directors emphasized that improving the quality of spending will be key to maintaining
fiscal sustainability and more broadly support economy-wide competitiveness. This will
require implementing a prudent public sector wage policy, strengthening the financial
viability of the state-owned enterprises, and minimizing the fiscal risks associated with
the TIPEEG. Directors took positive note of the authorities’ plans to unwind the program
and to focus on skills development going forward. To enhance revenues, they
highlighted the need for broadening the tax base, improving tax administration, and
streamlining tax expenditures. These reforms should be implemented in a manner that
improves the predictability and simplicity of the tax system.
Directors welcomed that Namibia’s financial system is generally sound. Nevertheless,
they underscored the need for increased vigilance to monitor potential vulnerabilities
stemming from a sizeable concentration of lending to mortgages, property price buildup,
growing household indebtedness, and the concentration of large institutional investors in
bank funding. In this respect, Directors commended the Bank of Namibia for the recent
macro-prudential measures that have been put in place to strengthen financial stability
and called for expeditious adoption of stress testing techniques.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ development objectives, laid out in the recent
National Development Plan. Given high income inequality and unemployment, they
strongly supported the focus on fostering effective investment in education and health
and enhancing financial inclusion. Directors also commended the recent launch of the
Human Resource Development Council to address the skills mismatch in the labor
market.

Statement by Mr. Saho on Namibia
February 8, 2013
Despite the Namibian authorities’ demonstrated track record of sound macroeconomic policy
implementation, which generated a strong rebound from the 2008-09 economic crises, the
fragile global environment continues to pose downside risks to economic growth. The
authorities agree with staff that the economy is expected to moderate this year, although the
rate of growth will still be above the global average. The Namibian authorities recognize the
challenges ahead, including those posed by income inequality and persistently high structural
unemployment. In this regard they will continue with inclusive-growth enhancing policy
interventions, including a major three-year fiscal initiative to ease infrastructure bottlenecks
and enhance job creation.
Additionally the authorities are looking at introducing reforms in public sector employment
and wage policies, and pressing ahead with the alignment of education and training curricula
to meet the demand for skilled labor in the broader economy, strengthening public
expenditure management, procurement, and financial accountability. At the same time, the
authorities will continue with efforts to rebuild fiscal policy buffers and reinforce financial
stability.
Recent economic developments and outlook
Namibia has been resilient despite the sizeable external shocks confronted by the economy.
The economic rebound has been strong following the 2008 financial crisis. The authorities’
estimated growth rate of about 4.5 percent for 2012 is in line with Namibia’s long-term
growth rate. The main policy challenge is how to increase potential output. The fourth
National Development Plan (NDP4) is the government’s blue print for action to transform
the Namibian economy into one that is more robust, and is able to generate essential
employment opportunities. The Plan has been crafted in the context of fiscal prudence,
including innovative ways to raise funds for infrastructure programs. With respect to
inflation, pressures have been rising as is the case in many countries, mainly due to the
deterioration in international terms of trade and elevated energy and food prices.
Both fiscal and monetary policies remained expansionary. The overall fiscal deficit for
2011/12 is estimated at 7 percent of GDP. Although the authorities anticipate an acceleration
of public spending going forward, the resulting fiscal deficit is expected to be below the
budget target of 4.5 percent of GDP for 2012/13. Fiscal deficit developments together with
Namibia‘s debut Eurobond issuance of US$500 million generated a public debt to GDP ratio
of about 25 percent with the stock of debt remaining unchanged in nominal terms during the
last 12 months.
The current account deficit as a percent of GDP recorded 1.7 percent in 2011 on the back of
moderating exports and faster growing imports, driven by expansionary fiscal policy and
eased monetary conditions. The current account deficit is expected to register 0.7 percent in
2012, before slightly edging up to 1.0 percent in 2013. Import reserve coverage is projected
to decline to 3.0 months of imports of goods and services in 2012, with an improvement to

2
3.4 months in 2013 envisaged, provided the downside risks do not materialize.
Rebuilding Fiscal Policy Buffers and Ensuring External Sustainability
The Namibian authorities remain committed to implementing policies that promote fiscal
sustainability. The government’s MTEF targets a small overall surplus by 2014/15. Also, the
government intends to respect its total debt ceiling of 35 percent of GDP.
The authorities agree that financially-strong SOEs should be a key fiscal objective, while
noting that important policies are already underway to address the situation. In this regard,
the authorities have compiled a draft directive aimed at establishing generally accepted
common principles of corporate governance and good practice governing SOEs, developing
common policy frameworks for their operations, determining criteria for the performance
measurement and evaluation, developing appropriate means for monitoring their
performance, and laying down directives in relation to amongst other things the remuneration
levels of board members, chief executive officers and other senior management staff of
SOEs. That said it is also important to note that the stock of government guarantees
(domestic and external) on SOEs has been about 2 percent of GDP during the last five years.
The authorities will continue with efforts to broaden the domestic revenue base and
strengthen domestic revenue collection and administration. In this regard, discussions of new
mineral taxes are still ongoing. Several countries in the region and around the world have
introduced mining taxes, including windfall revenue taxes, in recent years, with the
support/endorsement of the international community and thus it is imperative for the
Namibian authorities to explore and implement new revenue sources in anticipation of
reduced SACU revenue when the current revenue sharing arrangement is renegotiated.
The authorities concur with the staff on the need to revisit public expenditure levels, which
are high by international levels. Regarding the wage bill, the analysis should go beyond
simple ratios and attempt to capture the social and political dynamics of countries. Further, it
is the authorities’ view that wage increases for civil servants have not been exorbitant by any
means during the last five years. Rather, the number of civil servants—including teachers,
nurses, and doctors, as well as office personnel—has been the main force pressing the wage
bill. One also has to take into account the geographical vastness of the country and the
dispersed settlement of people to explain the size of Namibia’s civil service.
Reinforcing Financial Stability and Reforms
Aggregate financial indicators in Namibia remain generally sound, although staff sees
potential sources of vulnerabilities to financial stability starting to emerge. The authorities,
like staff are concerned about the financial stability risks posed by large concentration of
commercial banks assets in mortgage loans and the elevated level of household indebtedness.
However, they see these risks to financial stability as being mitigated by several policy
measures being put in place by the BoN. Notable macro-prudential policies in place include,
the requirement by the BoN for commercial banks to apply risks weights on mortgage loans
above Basel II norms. No plans are currently being considered to augment banks’ capital

3
buffers, which are currently above international thresholds.
The authorities are also concerned about the impact of the property price buildup on housing
affordability for low-income Namibians, but are not convinced of the existence of signs of a
property price bubble, citing the moderation in property prices in recent months. Further, the
average annual price increase for properties during the last ten years has been about 10
percent, significantly below any international experience on property price bubbles.
The Namibian financial sector compares well with the best in the world with the Global
Competitiveness Report rank of 36 out of 142 countries assessed for 2011. The legislative
and regulatory environment for both the bank and non-bank financial industries have been
modernized to allow regulatory authorities to exercise risk-based supervision and macroprudential surveillance to strengthen financial stability and guard against possible emergence
of financial crises. The authorities welcome the staff’s acknowledgement of the ongoing
efforts by NAMFISA to align regulations with best international practices, but would
underscore that the situation on the ground remains carefully monitored by the authorities.
Fostering Institutional and Capacity Development
The authorities are of the view that the quality and capacity of institutions as well as quality
of data are important ingredients of prudent macroeconomic policy. In this regard, they are
pursuing a public finance management (PFM) reform agenda assisted by the IMF and the
European Union, to strengthen PFM and improve the quality of expenditure. Full deployment
of program-budgeting, a complete reformulation of Namibia’s PFM legislation, as well as
public expenditure review and tracking will be rolled out to all budget votes during the
MTEF to enhance targeting of resources and public accountability. To enhance government‘s
capacity to collect and compile high quality statistics, Namibia Statistics Agency has been
transformed to a fully autonomous agency and has recently published the 2009/10 Household
Income and Expenditure Survey in a fully transparent manner.
Promoting Inclusive Growth and Regional Integration
The authorities are committed to promote inclusive growth. It is not surprising therefore that
faster and sustainable and inclusive economic growth, the creation of employment
opportunities, and enhanced income equality are the key pillars of NDP4. The authorities will
continue with the prudent implementation of TIPEEG program whose resource prioritization
approach will be carried out through the MTEF and will be integrated into the NDP4.
The authorities further agree with staff that TIPEEG can be enhanced by including a skills
development component to help make workers more competitive. However, since TIPEEG
will come to an end in 2013/14, the authorities have in their NDP4 identified education as a
distinct basic enabler to improve quality and address the mismatch between the demand for
and supply of skills. In this context, they have created a Human Resource Development
Council and Productivity Centre which along with the proposed jobs search program would
help address the skills mismatch in the labor market.

4
Exports promotion remains an important avenue for promoting growth in Namibia. In this
regard, the authorities continued with the outward-trade policy to facilitate diversification of
export commodities’ destinations, while enhancing value addition. This includes finding
ways to promote Namibia’s increased trade in SADC and SACU markets as well as
establishing new markets in emerging economies. Against this background, the Namibian
authorities are participating pro-actively in the process of formulating a regional Industrial
Development Policy for SACU.
In addition, the implementation of the SADC Finance and Investment Protocol should lead to
a more conducive investment environment and transparent processes that can help in
promoting intra-SADC trade and investment. The authorities are also taking part in the
Tripartite Free Trade Area negotiations that were launched in December 2011 for the
envisaged Free Trade Area among SADC, East African Community and COMESA.
Conclusion
The Namibian authorities appreciate the constructive engagement and policy dialogue with
the Fund. As noted in the government’s MTEF, fiscal consolidation and prudent debt
management are key intermediate policy goals for the coming years. In this regard, the
following four ultimate policy objectives: Increase government savings to cover public
investment needs that could accelerate economic growth and private investment; rebalance
the composition of fiscal spending in favor of capital outlays; take stock of possible
bottlenecks that reduce the quality of public goods delivery; and adopt a pro-active stance to
promote foreign direct investment—will anchor policy intervention in the long term. Against
this backdrop, my Namibian authorities look forward to the Fund’s continued engagement
and policy advice to achieve sustainable, broad based and inclusive growth.
