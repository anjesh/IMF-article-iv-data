EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
• Macroeconomic performance was strong in 2004 and early 2005, with real GDP growth of
3.7 percent in 2004 and 3.5 percent in the first quarter of 2005, and inflation within the 3–6 percent
target band. International reserves continued to grow, and the fiscal deficit fell to 1½ percent of GDP
in FY2004/05. In 2004, strong domestic demand and a strong rand led to a widening of the current
account deficit to 3.2 percent of GDP. The rand has weakened so far in 2005.
• The short-term outlook is broadly favorable, with the main risks arising from a possible
worsening of the external environment. South Africa faces important challenges in the form of high
unemployment and widespread poverty, and high prevalence of HIV/AIDS.
Policy Discussions
• Staff generally supported the authorities’ broad-based strategy to raise economic growth, reduce
poverty, and improve social conditions, while maintaining macroeconomic stability.
• On fiscal policy, staff supported the plans for moderate and targeted increases in social and
infrastructure spending over the next few years, which together with continued strong revenue
performance would be consistent with a stable government debt to GDP ratio.
• The authorities stressed that inflation remains the sole objective of monetary policy. On the policy
stance, staff noted some upside risk to the inflation outlook which may require a raise in the repo rate
over the next year to stabilize inflation close to the mid-point of the band.
• The authorities plan to maintain a flexible exchange rate, and to intervene in the foreign exchange
market only to accumulate international reserves when market conditions are favorable. Staff agreed
with this policy, while noting that the point may be approaching when the marginal costs of further
reserve buildup starts to outweigh the marginal benefits. Staff welcomed the further easing of
exchange controls over the past year and the possible move from exchange controls to prudential
regulations for institutional investors, and favored also easing restrictions on non-financial firms.
• The banking system is sound and short-term vulnerabilities appear limited. Some pressures could
arise from banks’ large mortgage portfolio carrying variable interest rates. Various initiatives are
underway to facilitate access to banking services by the poor; there are already some positive results.
• On structural reforms, staff supported current initiatives to generate jobs, but considered that
easing labor legislation—including by relaxing centralized collective bargaining and streamlining
dismissal procedures—was critical to have a significant impact on unemployment. Staff also favored
further liberalization and simplification of the trade regime as a way of enhancing competition and
raising productivity. The authorities are focusing on restructuring state-owned enterprises to increase
efficiency; staff supported these efforts, while suggesting that privatization be kept as an option.
• Staff supported the Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment and land reform programs, as
they would help reduce social and wealth disparities and strengthen social cohesion. The government
has reinforced its efforts against HIV/AIDS, but progress remains difficult.
• South Africa is one of the few Fund members to have completed reviews of the full range of
standards and codes. Economic data are generally of good quality and are provided on a timely basis.

I. RECENT ECONOMIC AND POLICY DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Macroeconomic performance was strong in 2004 and early 2005. Growth was
supported by a continuation of sound policies and a favorable external environment. Strong
global growth pushed up commodity prices, and ample global liquidity fostered capital flows
to emerging economies, both of which contributed to the continued appreciation of the rand
through end-2004. The strengthening of the currency eased inflationary pressures, allowing
for a reduction in domestic interest rates that helped support rapid expansion of domestic
demand and output, while leading to a widening of the external current account deficit.
2.
Real GDP grew by 3.7 percent in 2004, and 3.5 percent in the first quarter of
2005, driven by strong final domestic

marginally to 26.5 percent by March 2005.

Growth in broad money and bank credit to the private sector remain robust. In
June 2005, broad money growth was 17 percent (12-month rate), while growth of bank credit
to the private sector reached 22 percent, reflecting rapid expansion of mortgage lending.

7.
After strengthening for three years through 2004, the rand weakened somewhat
in the first half of 2005. Since the episode of market stress in late 2001, the rand appreciated
by over 50 percent through late 2004 (almost one-fourth of which took place in 2004). This

-8-

appreciation—as that of other commodity-currencies, such as the Australian dollar—was
associated with a rise in commodity prices. Also, large capital inflows resulting from strong
global appetite for emerging assets, helped support the rand. During 2005 this pattern was
reversed, with the rand depreciating by about 5 percent in real effective terms over the first
four months of the year.

The external current account deficit widened to 3.2 percent of GDP in 2004,
from 1.5 percent of GDP in 2003, owing to the rapid growth in domestic demand and
the strength of the rand. Import volumes grew strongly, exceeding the growth in export
volumes, while the terms of trade remained broadly unchanged. The current account deficit
was easily financed by foreign portfolio inflows and “net errors and omissions.”2 As in
previous years, gross FDI inflows in 2004 were weak. In July 2005, however, Barclays
(U.K.) purchased a controlling interest in one of South Africa’s largest banks (ABSA), for
the equivalent of 1.9 percent of GDP. As of end-2004, external debt was equivalent of
20 percent of GDP, with about one-third of the total

The fiscal deficit fell to 1.5 percent of

to buoyant domestic demand and greater efficiency
in tax collection. An increase in social spending,
mainly in the form of targeted grants, was partially
offset by the impact of lower domestic interest rates
on debt-service payments. At end-2004, national

II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Overview
11.
South Africa has made significant macroeconomic gains over the past decade,
but important challenges remain. Growth has increased, inflation has been brought under
control, the public finances have been strengthened, and net international reserves have risen
(Box 1). All this has been achieved while undertaking a major political and social
transformation. Important challenges remain, however, as growth still lags behind that in
comparator countries, unemployment and poverty remain high, wealth and income
inequalities persist, and the HIV/AIDS epidemic has lowered life expectancy and is exacting
a heavy toll on society.
12.
In recent Article IV consultations, staff has emphasized the benefits of
macroeconomic consolidation and further structural reforms. Staff has tended to agree
with the focus of key macroeconomic policies, particularly fiscal policy, inflation-targeting,
and international reserves management. Implementation of structural reforms has proven
more difficult. Important advances were made in trade liberalization and privatization, but
progress in these areas has slowed recently. Some progress has also been made on labor
market reforms, but decision-making and policy action in this area have at times been
constrained by differences within the governing coalition.4

3

The nonfinancial public sector debt is estimated at 47½ percent of GDP at end-2004. In addition to
debt of the national government, this includes debt of local governments (1.5 percent of GDP) and of
state-owned enterprises (10 percent of GDP). Information on provincial debt is not available but it is
considered to be negligible.

4

The coalition includes the African National Congress (ANC), the Congress of South African Trade
Unions (COSATU), and the South African Communist Party (SACP).

Box 1: South Africa’s Development in an International Perspective
Macroeconomic stabilization and structural reforms since democratization in 1994 have started to pay off.
Average annual real GDP growth in South Africa has picked up to 3.4 percent during 2000-2004 from an
average of 2.6 percent during 1994-99 and only 1 percent during 1980-93. Inflation has fallen appreciably,
fiscal discipline has been achieved, and external vulnerability has been reduced.
While South Africa has performed better post-1994 than during apartheid, how does it compare with other
countries? The table below compares economic developments in South Africa with those in 25 emerging
markets that are broadly comparable in terms of GDP per capita, population and sovereign risk rating.1/
•

During the past 5 years South Africa performed better than the average comparator country in terms
of fiscal discipline, government debt, and external debt. The reduction in inflation was somewhat
lower than in comparator countries for the five-year period as a whole.

•

South Africa’s real GDP per capita growth remains lower than in its comparator countries.
However, the gap has narrowed somewhat.

•

South Africa still lags behind its comparator countries in terms of unemployment, foreign direct
investment, and holdings of international reserves.

- 11 -

13.
The authorities’ main objectives in the period ahead are to accelerate growth,
lower unemployment, improve social conditions, and address wealth disparities, within
a low inflation environment. Their approach includes: (i) maintaining macroeconomic
stability and a sound financial system; (ii) increasing saving through facilitating access to
financial services; (iii) fostering growth by improving the regulatory environment for private
sector development (particularly of SMEs), reforming state-owned enterprises and increasing
their investment in infrastructure (including through public-private partnerships); and
(iv) reducing unemployment through accelerated economic growth, skills-development and
public works programs, and possibly some amendments to labor legislation. Priorities also
include improving social conditions by ensuring appropriate budget allocations for social
needs, dealing with the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and moving ahead with their programs for
Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) and land reform.
B. Short-Term Outlook
14.
There was agreement that near-term economic prospects remain broadly
favorable. The external environment is expected to stay generally positive, and business and
consumer confidence indicators point to continued robust near-term growth, supported by
somewhat expansionary macroeconomic policies. Staff projects real GDP growth of
4 percent in 2005 and 3.6 percent in 2006. Inflation is expected to increase from current
levels, but to remain within the target band. The external current account deficit would widen
to 3.8 percent of GDP in 2005, before narrowing moderately in 2006.
15.
The authorities and staff considered that the main short-term risks arise from
the possibility of a deterioration in the external environment. A pronounced slowdown in
global growth––for instance due to a sharp increase in oil prices–– would reduce demand for
South African exports, erode consumer and business confidence and dampen growth. Also, a
weakening of global appetite for emerging market assets could put downward pressure on the
rand and require an increase in domestic interest rates to keep inflation within the target
band, with a potential adverse impact on growth. On the domestic front, staff saw some
possibility of a correction in real estate prices, particularly if interest rates rise, which could
dampen domestic demand and growth.
C. Macroeconomic Policies and Financial Sector Issues
Inflation targeting and interest rate policy
16.
The SARB has been enhancing its inflation targeting framework, which is now
broadly in line with that in other successful inflation targeting countries. The SARB has
moved from a yearly target on average annual inflation to a continuous target on 12-month
inflation, increased the frequency of Monetary Policy Committee meetings, and removed the
“escape clause,” which set conditions under which inflation could deviate from the target
band. These changes and the SARB’s success in keeping inflation within the target band
have strengthened monetary policy credibility, as evidenced in inflation expectations falling
within the target band.

- 12 -

17.
On the monetary policy stance, some upside risks to the inflation outlook may be
emerging. The authorities indicated that their baseline scenario—under a constant interest
rate—envisaged a period of increasing inflation with the CPIX inflation rate rising above
5 percent in early 2006 before slowing down gradually.5 They saw the risks to the outlook as
evenly balanced and signaled no bias in either direction regarding future changes in interest
rates. Staff agreed that inflation was on an upward trend, owing to the pickup in unit labor
costs in 2004, increasing oil prices, the weakening of the rand in 2005, and the continued
strength of domestic demand. It also considered that monetary policy was expansionary, as
suggested by the rapid money and credit growth, and thus thought that the repo rate may
need to be raised somewhat over the next year in order to stabilize inflation around the midpoint of the band.
18.
The authorities restated that the overriding objective of monetary policy is to
keep inflation within the target band. Staff noted that the April 2005 Monetary Policy
Committee’s statement had generated some market uncertainty about the objectives of
monetary policy, as it mentioned concerns about the impact of the level and volatility of the
exchange rate on some sectors of the economy as a factor in the decision to lower interest
rates. The authorities emphasized that the evolution of the exchange rate plays a role in their
decisions on interest rates only to the extent that such evolution has implications for inflation.
There was agreement on the importance of having a clear message about the basis for
monetary policy decisions.
19.
Staff suggested that the SARB—within its target band system—target inflation
at the mid-point of the band over the medium term. At present, monetary policy focuses
just on keeping inflation within the band. In the staff’s view, targeting inflation at the midpoint over the medium term would help anchor expectations and increase the likelihood that
inflation stays within the band. The authorities saw some merit in this suggestion.
Fiscal policy
20.
South Africa’s sustained fiscal adjustment and reforms over the last decade have
enhanced fiscal management, reduced the size of the government sector, and lowered
public indebtedness. The structure of tax revenues is sound and taxpayer compliance
continues to improve. Expenditure control is generally effective, and improvements are
underway at the provincial and municipal levels.
21.
Fiscal consolidation has created room for higher spending on social needs and
infrastructure, a cornerstone of the authorities’ pro-poor growth strategy. The national
government budget for FY2005/06 includes additional resources for social grants
(0.4 percent of GDP), health and education (0.2 percent of GDP), and land restitution, the

police and the judiciary (close to 0.2 percent of GDP).6 On the revenue side, it includes
personal and corporate (especially small business) income tax relief equivalent to 0.7 percent
of GDP, together with a raise in indirect taxes (mainly excise duties) by 0.2 percent of GDP.
22.
The fiscal stance in FY2005/06 is moderately expansionary. Staff projects the
fiscal deficit to increase by 0.8 percent of GDP to 2.3 percent of GDP. This assumes: (i) that
the revenue overrun in the second half of FY2004/05 (which became known in April 2005) is
to a large extent the result of permanent factors, a view shared by the authorities and staff;
and (ii) that expenditure plans (announced in February) would remain essentially unchanged
despite the possible revenue overperformance in FY2005/06, a position maintained by the
authorities and supported by staff. In staff’s view, therefore, even after taking into account
the modest expansion built into the budget, the fiscal position remains sound and consistent
with the authorities’ medium-term fiscal framework.
23.
Staff supported the authorities’ strategy of targeted increases in social spending
and public sector investment over the next few years. Additional expenditure appears
justified in view of the country’s social needs and supply bottlenecks, and the medium-term
expenditure framework appears consistent with a sustainable government debt path. Under a
baseline scenario with medium-term expenditure broadly in line with plans announced in
February 2005, and assuming that the recent revenue gains are permanent, the fiscal deficits
would remain at around 2½ percent of GDP, and government debt would converge to about
35 percent of GDP (see Appendix IV). Also, government debt dynamics would remain
manageable under a variety of shocks.7 Staff considers it advisable to maintain the mediumterm expenditure plans broadly unchanged despite possible revenue gains in view of capacity
constraints at the subnational level that limit the efficient absorption of additional resources.
To the extent that recent revenue gains were to prove transitory, deficits would be higher. At
the limit, if those gains were fully transitory, government deficits would be around 3 percent
of GDP and government debt would rise gradually and stabilize at around 40 percent of
GDP. Staff indicated that sustained deficits above 3 percent of GDP would be undesirable as
they would result in a marked increase in government debt and would likely lead to pressures
on long-term interest rates.
24.
The quality and coverage of budget documents is high by international
standards and has increased further in recent years. Among other information, the budget
now includes data on contingent liabilities and a detailed discussion of tax expenditures. In
light of the key role played by state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in the authorities’ strategy,
staff felt that the assessment of the fiscal stance and debt sustainability would benefit from
widening the focus of regular budget documents and reports beyond the accounts of the
national government. Staff suggested to provide information on the consolidated nonfinancial
6

Key infrastructure bottlenecks in energy and transport would be addressed through higher
investment by state-owned enterprises (by about ½ percent of GDP).

this relatively benign outlook, is presented in Chapter II of the Selected Issues Paper.

public sector, including an analysis of the fiscal risks implied by SOEs and the expanding
Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs).
International reserves, exchange rate policy and capital controls
25.
Despite concerns in some quarters over the appreciation of the rand last year,
the authorities and staff agreed that South Africa’s flexible exchange rate has continued
to serve the country well. The authorities plan to continue with their policy of building up
international reserves when market conditions are favorable but otherwise not intervening in
the foreign exchange market. Staff agreed with this policy and saw scope for further
accumulation, as South Africa’s reserves are lower than in comparator countries when
measured in relation to imports or broad money. At the same time, however, South Africa’s
reserves are higher than in comparator countries when measured in relation to short-term
external debt, which usually outperforms other reserve indicators as a predictor of external
crisis. Also, the benefits of additional reserves in terms of reducing exchange rate volatility
seems to decline as the ratio of reserves to short-term debt increases.8 On this basis, and
considering the rapid rate at which gross reserves have been increasing (by about 67 percent
in the 12-months through June 2005), staff considered that the point could be approaching
where the sterilization costs of further reserve accumulation may start to outweigh its
benefits in terms of reduced currency volatility, lower bond spreads, and protection against
external shocks.

Staff considered the value of the rand
to be broadly in line with its long-run
equilibrium level.9 In its view, the rand
appreciation of 2002 reflected a recovery from
a significant undervalued levels of late 2001,
while its subsequent appreciation reflected
moves toward a higher equilibrium level that
resulted from stronger commodity prices and
rising net foreign assets.

A broader assessment of the

competitiveness of the South African
economy paints a mixed picture (Box 2). South Africa’s share of world export markets has
remained broadly constant since the mid-to late 1990s, but in volume terms it has declined.
Export performance has varied across sectors, with commodities and metals benefiting from
higher world prices, manufacturing performing more modestly, and some sectors (such as
textiles) performing relatively poorly. Indicators of competitiveness that incorporate surveybased assessments of costs of investing and doing business point to some areas for
improvement, such as education standards, availability of skilled labor, and infrastructure
quality.

28.
Looking forward, there was agreement that competitiveness would best be
enhanced by measures to raise productivity and reduce costs. Therefore, staff supported
the authorities’ intention to strengthen the transportation and energy infrastructure, increase
competition in the telecommunication sector, and reduce regulatory costs for SMEs. Easing
restrictive labor market regulations would also be highly beneficial in this regard.
29.
The authorities have continued with their gradual approach to relaxing capital
controls. Staff welcomed the easing that took place over the past year, including the removal
of limits on outward foreign direct investment. The main remaining restrictions comprise
limits on overseas investments by institutional investors and the prohibition of portfolio
investment abroad by non-financial firms. The authorities indicated that they were
considering moving from exchange controls to a system of prudential regulations for
institutional investors. Staff supported this initiative and favored a further easing of
restrictions on non-financial firms. In its view, all these measures would increase market
liquidity and allow greater risk diversification, and could reduce currency volatility.

This observation and the associated figure are based on an empirical estimation of the long-run
equilibrium relationship between the real effective exchange rate and macroeconomic fundamentals
that include commodity prices, the fiscal balance, net foreign assets, the degree of openness, and the
productivity and real interest rate differentials with respect to South Africa’s main trading partners.

Box 2: Competitiveness of the South African Economy
South Africa’s share of world export markets has remained broadly constant since the mid-to-late 1990s. In
recent years, however, South Africa’s market share has been boosted by rising commodity prices. Exports of coal,
metals and diamonds have accounted for about two thirds of export growth since 2002. In volume terms, South
Africa’s market share has declined quite markedly; exports have increased at an annual average rate of about
2¾ percent since 1996, compared with growth of a little over 6 percent in South Africa’s export markets.

Business Efficiency

An analysis of the manufactured exports suggests that South Africa is not well-positioned in dynamic markets,
with the important exception of its two largest products. The figure top right plots the changing world market
share of South Africa’s 15 largest products (at the SITC 3 digit level) against the changing share of those products in
world trade. The size of the bubble represents the value of South Africa’s exports in 2003. For example, South
Africa’s world market share of cars—its largest manufacturing export product—more than quadrupled from 19982003.1 Moreover this market was moderately dynamic, rising about 7 percentage points faster than total world trade
over 1998-2003. Most other products, however, are either in markets that represent a declining share of world trade,
or in growing markets but where South Africa’s market share is declining.
Survey-based indicators provide an alternative means of measuring ‘structural’ competitiveness. According to
two of the better known surveys (table), South Africa typically ranks above the larger Latin American emerging
markets, but below the more dynamic Asian emerging markets and Chile, and well below Australia. A more detailed
breakdown of the International Institute for Management Development (IMD) results suggests that South Africa
scores quite well in terms of ‘government efficiency’ (which includes factors related to the strength of the public
finances and business legislation). However, its overall competitiveness ranking tends to be undermined by poor
scores for business efficiency (e.g., availability of skilled labor, labor regulations) and infrastructure (e.g.,
telecommunication costs, education system, health issues).

Series on South Africa No. 2005/2003) find similar results from a broader analysis of all exports.

Financial sector
30.
South Africa’s financial system is generally sound and well regulated. As of
March 2005, the average capital adequacy ratio was 12.9 percent (compared with a
regulatory minimum of 10 percent), non-performing loans accounted for 1.8 percent of total
loans, and non-performing loans net of provisioning were equivalent to 6.1 percent of capital.
Also, profitability remained healthy, with an average return on equity of 16.9 percent. The
insurance sector also appears to be well-capitalized and corporate risks seem to be limited.10
31.
There was broad agreement that short-term vulnerabilities in the banking sector
remained limited, but staff felt that banks could face some risk from their mortgage
portfolio. Mortgage advances account for about 37 percent of total bank loans and typically
carry variable interest rates. Thus, a marked rise in interest rates could reduce household
debt-servicing capacity, affecting bank asset quality, and also prompt a drop in property
prices, lowering collateral value. The authorities noted that household indebtedness remained
below historical highs and that the boom in residential property prices has been supported by
fundamental factors, and also considered that a marked increase in interest rates was highly
unlikely. It was agreed nevertheless that developments in this area needed to be closely
monitored.
32.
The authorities are undertaking important initiatives to facilitate access to
banking services for the poor and increase competition in the banking sector. It is
estimated that one third to one half of the adult population has no access to banking services
and competition in retail and SME banking appears to be low. These problems are being
addressed by the Financial Sector Charter (which provides incentives for banks to offer basic
services at low cost) and the planned introduction of a regulatory framework for second and
third tier banks, specialized in basic banking services.11 Substantial progress has been made,
with reportedly about one million basic bank accounts (so called “Mzansi” accounts) opened
between October 2004 and May 2005. The purchase of ABSA bank by Barclays (U.K.)
should further increase competition.
33.
The authorities have been implementing most of the FSAP recommendations
and have continued to enhance the regulatory and supervisory framework (Box 3).
Current initiatives include, among others, implementing AML/CFT legislation, helping banks
move to Basel II, and the planned introduction of a deposit insurance scheme.

10

Chapter III of the Selected Issues Paper analyzes financial and corporate sector vulnerabilities in
greater detail.

11

These new types of banks are not expected to increase financial vulnerability as their assets will be
restricted to high quality and liquid investments.

- 18 -

Box 3: South Africa: Financial Sector Reforms
Most FSAP recommendations are being implemented:
Enhancements to the financial safety net. These include the planned introduction of a deposit insurance
scheme, the refinement of the legal and regulatory framework for bank insolvency (in collaboration with
the World Bank), and closer monitoring of banks’ corporate governance.
Review of the regulatory architecture regarding consolidated supervision and cooperation between
regulators. As there are important cross-shareholdings between large banks and insurance companies, the
Banking Supervision Department (BSD) of the SARB, which supervises banks, has stepped up its efforts
in the area of consolidated supervision and has signed MOUs with the Financial Services Board (FSB),
which supervises non-bank financial institutions. Both agencies are increasing staffing of skilled
personnel.
AML/CFT. Initiatives include the implementation of the Financial Intelligence Centre Act, 2001 (FICA),
which requires the verification of all banks’ clients by September 2006. The Financial Action Task Force
(FATF) has issued recently an action plan to improve compliance with its recommendations.
Reliance on collateral. Banks’ overall reliance on collateral has decreased over time, from 55 percent of
NPLs in 2001 to 35 percent in March 2005. The valuation of collateral by banks is closely monitored by
the BSD.
Suggestions to vest a number of responsibilities of the Ministry of Finance to the supervisory authorities
have not been addressed.
Other key reform areas include:
Consumer protection. A new national credit regulator and a new consumer tribunal will be created, and
financial advisory intermediaries are required to register with the FSB and comply with fit and proper
criteria and market conduct regulations.
Black Economic Empowerment. Banks are implementing the Financial Sector Charter (FSC).
Regional cooperation. The Eastern and Southern African Supervisors (ESAF) group, was dissolved
towards the end of 2004 and replaced with the SADC sub-committee of bank supervisors (SBBS), the
regional forum for supervisors. Revitalized projects include implementation of core principles for
effective banking supervision for members, harmonization of supervisory legislation, and the
establishment of a minimum standard of on-site supervision.
International standards. Preparatory work for implementing Basel II requirements is underway and
banks have until January 1, 2008 to comply. Firms listed at the JSE Limited must comply with
international financial reporting standards starting January 2005. Local auditing standards for banks are
being harmonized with international standards.
Broader access to financial services. This is to be achieved mainly through implementation of the FSC,
increased disclosure on lending practices, and the introduction of second and third tier banks specialized
in basic banking services.
Foreign entry. In July 2005, Barclays Bank Plc (UK) acquired 54 percent share in ABSA Group Limited.

D. Structural Policies and Medium-Term Outlook
Labor market
34.
Several factors appear to be constraining employment growth in South Africa.
These include low skills and limited entrepreneurial experience in a large part of the
population, mainly a legacy of the apartheid regime, as well as labor market regulations that
increase the cost of labor.12 Moreover, high transport costs may raise reservation wages and
deter workers, particularly from township and rural areas, from seeking urban jobs. Also, the
informal sector seems to be relatively small in South Africa, a phenomenon that is not fully
understood. A Fund technical assistance mission found that informal employment may be
underestimated, but the underestimation was difficult to quantify, and could be small.
35.
The authorities are using several instruments to reduce unemployment, an
approach supported by staff. First, the government is implementing a National Skills
Development Strategy (NSDS) aimed at enhancing skills through training initiatives and
learnership programs, which seems to be relatively successful in providing the skills needed
to obtain employment. On the other hand, the program is funded by a tax on labor, which
tends to reduce employment.13 Second, the government is creating temporary jobs in
infrastructure and other projects through its expanded public works program (EPWP), which
may also be useful in training workers to obtain subsequent employment. Third, the 2005
budget introduced measures to support small business development, which should also
stimulate job creation.
36.
Staff considered however that easing labor legislation would be critical to make
a significant dent in unemployment (Box 4). On the basis of international evidence
showing that flexible labor markets are conducive to job creation, staff urged: (i) relaxing the
“extension principle” in collective bargaining to allow small firms to negotiate agreements
that reflect their own economic circumstances; (ii) simplifying the minimum-wage structure
and moderating periodic minimum-wage adjustments to reduce labor costs and facilitate
mobility across sectors; and (iii) further streamlining dismissal procedures, as well as
educating stakeholders on the legal requirements for dismissal as reportedly some of the
costs arise from misinterpretation of the law. The Department of Labor announced in July the
launch of a study on whether labor legislation impedes job growth, SME development, and
foreign direct investment in South Africa.

12

These regulations include centralized collective bargaining in some sectors, with agreements
between large firms and unions being “extended” to smaller firms; sector-specific minimum wages in
other sectors; and complex dismissal procedures.
13

The 2005 budget includes a proposal to widen the range of small businesses that would be exempt
from this tax.

Box 4: South Africa: Labor Market Flexibility
At 26 percent, the unemployment rate in South
Africa is significantly higher than in most
industrial and emerging market countries.
Whereas there are several reasons why this may
be case, including the low level of skills and
possible underestimation of informal
employment, the most extensive public debate
has emerged on whether labor market rigidities
may be constraining employment creation.

75 industrial and emerging market countries.1/
The study derives an aggregate index of labor
market rigidity on the basis of several standard indicators of labor market flexibility, including (i) the
existence of minimum wages, (ii) the level of employment protection and benefits, and (iii) trade union
density. Overly generous minimum wages or generous social security benefits may increase the cost of
labor and reduce incentives to hire. Strong unions coupled with wide-reaching collective bargaining
arrangements limit the ability of individual firms to negotiate wage agreements that reflect firm-specific
circumstances.

The results of this cross-country study indicate that labor market rigidities lead to higher unemployment.
Thus, South Africa’s unemployment could be reduced by easing some restrictive labor regulations. The
results also show, however, that (when measured with the variables mentioned above) South Africa’s
labor market is not more rigid than the average for industrial and emerging market countries. This
suggests that other factors, not captured in this study, may also be playing an important role in keeping
unemployment high in South Africa.
A separate international comparison shows that South Africa scores particularly high in difficulty of hiring
and dismissal procedures, variables that were not included in the study mentioned above due to the lack of
time series data. This suggests that clarifying and streamlining dismissal procedures could be an effective
tool for reducing the cost of labor and thus increasing employment.

Trade policy and regional impact
37.
South Africa’s trade regime has been liberalized substantially over the last
decade. The simple average MFN tariff rate has been reduced from over 20 percent in the
early 1990s to 11 percent in 2004 and virtually all quantitative restrictions have been
eliminated.14
38.
However, some sectors are still highly protected and the tariff structure remains
complex. While average tariff rates are similar to the average in other emerging markets, the
number of tariff peaks (i.e., tariff lines carrying tariff rates in excess of 15 percent) and the
share of non ad valorem duties tend to be somewhat higher than in those other countries.
Staff noted that lowering the overall level of protection and harmonizing protection across
sectors, reducing the number of tariff bands, and applying ad valorem duties for most items,
would enhance competition, increase productivity, and support growth. Staff also reiterated
its call for an independent assessment of the Motor Industry Development Programme
(MIDP), a complicated incentive scheme designed to make the local motor industry
internationally competitive, which costs are unclear.15 The authorities explained that reviews
of the tariff regime and the MIDP were ongoing. However, any reform of the tariff structure
would need to be taken in concert with the partners in the Southern African Customs Union
(SACU) and would likely also be linked to progress on multilateral trade negotiations.16
39.
South Africa is playing an active role in multilateral trade negotiations, while at
the same time pursuing regional and bilateral preferential trade arrangements. The
authorities support the multilateral trade liberalization process through the WTO and have
played a leadership role in the current Doha Round of negotiations. However, motivated in
part by lack of progress with multilateral negotiations, South Africa and its SACU partners
have been actively negotiating preferential trade arrangements.17 Staff noted that
liberalization under these agreements should be broad-based and non-discriminatory, with
simple and non-restrictive rules of origin, as this would limit the potential for trade diversion
14

Chapter V of the Selected Issues Paper discusses South Africa’s trade policy issues.

15

Experience in other countries suggests that local content programs in the motor industry tend to
raise costs and prices, reduce competition, and generate few, if any, benefits for employment.
Moreover, once established, such programs are difficult to remove. An independent review of the
MIDP, which could take into account the consumer and general national interest in lower vehicle
prices and a more efficient motor industry, would be a useful counterweight to strong vested interests
in the continuation of the program. On the MIDP, see also the Box in Chapter V of the Selected
Issues Paper.
16

SACU (Southern African Customs Union) also includes Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, and
Swaziland.

17

An agreement was recently concluded with Mercosur, negotiations are under way with the United
States and EFTA, and envisaged with, among others, China and India. South Africa also has a
bilateral trade agreement with the EU, which aims to establish a free trade area by 2012.

- 22 -

and complement multilateral liberalization efforts. It also indicated that the broad array of
overlapping regional and bilateral arrangements in Southern Africa further complicates the
trade system, and encouraged the authorities to explore ways in which such overlapping
arrangements might be streamlined.
40.
South Africa is the major economic driving force within the region, accounting
for a substantial share of exports from its neighboring SACU partners.18 The stock of
South Africa’s FDI in the rest of Africa has increased from 5 percent of total South Africa’s
outward stock in 2000 to 9 percent in 2003. The peg of the currencies of Lesotho, Namibia
and Swaziland to the rand within the Common Monetary Area (CMA) Agreement with South
Africa has contributed to the maintenance of low inflation across the region, but, as in South
Africa, the strength of the rand has put some pressure on their export sectors. Fiscal policies
are also linked to some extent through the SACU agreement, as shared customs and excise
duties constitute a major part of tax revenues in Lesotho, Namibia, and Swaziland. Further
trade liberalization, including through South Africa’s bilateral agreement with the EU, may
therefore lead to some region-wide pressure on government finances. The authorities
explained that they viewed the rest of the region and Africa as a potentially important market.
They therefore attach a high priority to participating in region-wide efforts to promote
growth and macroeconomic convergence.
State-owned enterprises
41.
State-owned enterprises continue to play a significant role in the economy, and
the authorities see them as a key vehicle for strengthening infrastructure and public
service delivery. The SOEs under the Department of Public Enterprises account for
1.2 percent of total employment, with combined assets equivalent of 12.8 percent of GDP
and a turnover of 6.1 percent of GDP. This group includes, among others, the major SOE’s in
the country, Eskom (energy), Transnet (transportation), and Denel (defense). Over the next
few years, infrastructure investment by SOEs will focus mainly on electricity, ports, rails,
roads and water resources.
42.
The authorities have recently de-emphasized the role of privatization as a way of
enhancing efficiency. A framework for SOE reform, announced in 2000, envisaged
privatization and enterprise restructuring together with a strengthening of the regulatory
framework, in order to improve service quality, promote competitiveness, and mobilize
investment. This program gained momentum in 2003 with a sale of 28 percent of Telkom
(telecommunications), which brought the company under majority private ownership.
However, the strategy was subsequently reoriented, partly due to lower than anticipated
privatization receipts in the aftermath of the downturn in the global telecoms market.

18

Assessing the level of trade flows within SACU is difficult, but South Africa may account for
38 percent of exports from Lesotho, 31 percent of exports from Namibia, and 50 percent of exports
from Swaziland. Recent work by the staff (Arora, V. and Vamvakidis, A., 2005, “The Implications of
South African Economic Growth for the Rest of Africa,” IMF/WP/05/58) suggests that South African
economic growth has significant positive implications for the region.

- 23 -

43.
The current approach focuses on the operational restructuring of large
enterprises, together with the sale of their non-core assets. The staff supported these
efforts to enhance efficiency. It also encouraged the authorities to explore the possibility of
privatizing assets not involved in infrastructure, and to keep open the possibility of further
privatization in the future—depending on the success of the restructuring program—within
an effective regulatory framework.
Medium-term outlook
44.
There was broad agreement that potential output growth had increased as a
result of sound policies over the last decade. There were some differences, however, on the
estimated magnitude of the improvement. The authorities considered that potential growth
could be 4 percent or higher owing to efficiency gains that had not yet been reflected in the
data. On the other hand, staff calculated current potential output growth at 3¼-3½ percent, on
the basis of a filtering approach and a production function approach (taking into account the
impact of structural changes) estimated over the last two decades.
45.
The staff’s baseline scenario envisages average annual real GDP growth of
3½ percent over 2005-10. Reducing unemployment under the baseline would be difficult.
Implementation of comprehensive reforms in the areas of labor markets, trade liberalization,
and public enterprises, along the lines discussed in this report, would be conducive to higher
growth and employment. Appendix IV presents a scenario in which real GDP growth is
projected to increase to around 5½ percent over the medium term.
E. Social and Other Issues
Social issues
46.
South Africa has made advances towards the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs), but significant challenges remain. Substantial progress has been made on the
provision of basic amenities and literacy, but other social indicators—such as child mortality
and life expectancy—have been adversely affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
47.
The government has reinforced its efforts to fight the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
Around 17-25 percent of adult South Africans are officially estimated to be HIV-positive. In
recent years, the government has increased sharply its spending to combat the disease, and in
2003 it launched a major program to provide anti-retroviral drug (ARVs) to the public
through the national health system. The rollout of ARVs has been running behind schedule—
with some 50,000 patients receiving treatment through public health facilities compared with
500,000-800,000 in need—partly due to the complexity of an initiative of this magnitude.
The recent conclusion of an important procurement tender for ARV drugs is expected to
ensure a sustainable supply of drugs. A challenge will be to administer efficiently the
delivery of these drugs through the public health system.
48.
The impact of HIV/AIDS on economic growth is highly uncertain. Estimates of
the adverse impact on annual growth rates range from ½ to 2½ percentage points. The major

- 24 -

effects result from factors such as lower labor productivity, the loss of labor, higher
production costs (including health costs), and reduced incentives to invest.
49.
Staff expressed strong support for the government’s initiatives to reduce social
and wealth disparities. These initiatives help foster social cohesion and consolidate an
environment favorable to sustained economic and social progress. The increasingly broadbased nature of BEE, and the foundation of land reform on well-defined legal principles are
important characteristics to maintain wide support for these policies.
50.
Significant progress has been made with Broad Based Black Economic
Empowerment. This initiative uses several tools to achieve empowerment of the black
population, including voluntary sector-specific “charters” that set targets for a range of
empowerment indicators, including percentage of black ownership, black participation in
management, and skills development. Several sectors have made significant progress with
their charters. Staff supported the authorities’ broad-based approach, which emphasizes
several empowerment indicators and also aims at bringing new participants from the black
population into ownership. It was agreed that tax incentives specifically aimed at BEE deals
should be avoided as they are distortionary.
51.
Progress on land reform remains mixed. In 1994, the market-based land reform set
a target of 30 percent of agricultural land under black ownership by 2015. The program
includes land restitution (return of land lost due to racially discriminatory laws) and land
redistribution (purchase of land by black individuals facilitated by government grants and
loans). To date only 4 percent of agricultural land is under black ownership. Staff welcomed
the progress made with land restitution. Obstacles to faster progress with land redistribution
seem to include (i) administrative capacity constraints coupled with the inherently difficult
nature of the process; (ii) regressive taxation of land, which makes subdivided land less
profitable; and (iii) legal obstacles to land subdivision.
Other issues
52.
The authorities have completed reviews of the full range of standards and codes.
As of end April 2005, South Africa was one of only two Fund members to have completed
Reports on the Observation of Standards and Codes (ROSCs) in each area endorsed by the
IMF and World Bank as important for their work.19 Five of these ROSCs have been
published, covering data transparency, anti-money laundering and combating the financing of
terrorism, corporate governance, accountancy, and auditing.
53.
Economic data for South Africa are generally of good quality and are provided
to the Fund and the public in a timely manner. South Africa subscribes to the SDDS and
publishes all data on the reserves template. Progress in improving the quality of labor market
and real sector data, and narrowing the scope of unidentified transactions in balance of

- 25 -

payments statistics, would facilitate economic analysis and support policy design and
implementation. The authorities have indicated that they plan to address weaknesses in labor
markets statistics but also need to overcome capacity constraints.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
54.
Economic progress since democratization has been remarkable. Sound
macroeconomic management and structural reforms have led to faster economic growth,
lower and more predictable inflation, stronger public finances, and a markedly improved
external position. Furthermore, South Africa has emerged as a major driving force in the
region and its stronger economic performance has benefited the rest of Africa.
55.
Recent economic performance has been strong and the near-term outlook is
broadly favorable. Economic activity has been supported by a continuation of sound
policies and a positive external environment. Looking forward, growth is expected to remain
robust, owing to low interest rates, a moderately expansionary fiscal policy, and healthy
growth in the world economy. The main risks to this outlook arise from a possible worsening
of external conditions, including a slowdown in global growth and a sharp fall in capital
flows to emerging markets. On the domestic front, though less likely, a large correction in
property prices could also dampen economic activity.
56.
Serious economic challenges remain. Unemployment remains stubbornly high,
poverty is widespread, large wealth disparities persist, and the high incidence of HIV/AIDS
is causing untold human suffering and uncertain economic costs.
57.
The authorities’ strategy focuses on raising economic growth within a stable
macroeconomic environment, combined with initiatives to reduce unemployment and
improve social conditions. Perseverance with these policies, together with ambitious labor
market reforms, further trade liberalization, and a substantial improvement in state-owned
enterprises’ efficiency, could put the country firmly on a higher growth path and raise the
well-being of all South Africans.
58.
Sound monetary policy management has successfully kept inflation within the
target band and has enhanced the credibility of the inflation targeting regime. As a
result, inflation expectations have declined to within the target band. The monetary
authorities are aware that a clear communication of their decisions, emphasizing inflation as
the overriding objective of monetary policy, would be important to continue strengthening
credibility. Also, targeting inflation at the mid-point of the band over the medium-term
would help anchor inflation expectations and increase monetary policy effectiveness.
59.
Possible upside risks to the inflation outlook deserve close monitoring. Inflation is
on an upward trend, and monetary policy remains expansionary, as suggested by the rapid
money and credit growth. Thus, the repo rate may need to be raised somewhat above present
levels over the next year to stabilize inflation around the mid-point of the target band.
60.
The flexible exchange rate system, together with interventions to accumulate
reserves when market conditions are favorable, has benefited the country. The flexible

- 26 -

exchange rate is an integral part of the inflation targeting regime, and facilitates the
adjustment of the economy to external shocks. While the strength of the rand has adversely
affected some export-oriented activities, the exchange rate seems to be broadly in line with
its long-run equilibrium level. The authorities are properly focusing on increasing
competitiveness through measures that raise productivity and reduce costs. Reserves
accumulation has contributed to lowering currency volatility and bonds spreads. There is
some room for this process to continue, but reserves are approaching levels at which the case
for further accumulation would be less compelling.
61.
The authorities have continued relaxing capital controls, and further progress in
this direction would be beneficial. Importantly, limits on outward foreign direct investment
were lifted last year. The possible move from exchange controls to prudential regulations for
institutional investors would be a positive step, which could be complemented by easing
restrictions on non-financial firms.
62.
The planned moderate increase in social and infrastructure spending over the
next few years seems appropriate. Fiscal consolidation over the last several years has
created space for some additional spending, and well-targeted expenditure in these areas will
help address pressing social needs and enhance the productive capacity of the economy.
Given limits to the capacity to absorb additional resources efficiently, it would be advisable
to maintain medium-term expenditure plans broadly unchanged despite possible revenue
gains. It will be important in any event to keep the fiscal deficit below levels that would lead
to an undesirable increase in the debt to GDP ratio, as this is likely to put upward pressure on
interest rates.
63.
The banking system is sound, and the authorities are taking important initiatives
in the financial sector, including to facilitate access to banking services for the poor.
Indicators of bank financial health are favorable, and the authorities continue to monitor risks
closely, including those that could arise from banks’ large mortgage portfolio. Most of the
FSAP’s recommendations are being implemented, which together with other initiatives to
enhance the regulatory and supervisory framework would further strengthen financial sector
soundness. Progress so far in facilitating access of previously disadvantaged groups to
banking services is welcome. Further advances in implementing the Financial Sector Charter
and the introduction of a regulatory framework for institutions specialized in basic banking
services should help speed up this process.
64.
Measurable success in reducing unemployment in the near-term is critical for
maintaining support for sound economic policies and ongoing reform initiatives.
Lowering unemployment continues to be a top official priority. The government’s approach
includes programs to enhance skills and to provide temporary jobs in infrastructure and other
projects, as well as measures to foster small business development. This strategy could
benefit substantially from a relaxation of restrictive labor market regulations. International
evidence indicates that labor market reforms that reduce the cost of labor could have an
important impact on unemployment. Reforms could include reducing the scope of centralized
collective bargaining, simplifying the minimum-wage structure and moderating minimumwage adjustments, and further streamlining dismissal procedures.

- 27 -

65.
Further trade liberalization and simplification of the tariff regime would
increase productivity and support growth. Efforts could focus on lowering the overall
level of protection, harmonizing protection across sectors, reducing the number of tariff
bands, and applying ad valorem duties for most items. It would also be important that
preferential trade agreements being negotiated by the country be broad-based and nondiscriminatory so as to complement multilateral liberalization and limit the potential for trade
diversion. The Motor Industry Development Programme (MIDP) entails a complex scheme
of incentives with uncertain benefits and costs that merit an independent evaluation.
66.
The government’s emphasis on improving the efficiency of state-owned
enterprises is well placed. Success in this effort would raise productivity and reduce the cost
of doing business in South Africa. While the official approach focuses on operational
restructuring accompanied by the sale of non-core assets, it would be useful to keep open the
possibility of future privatization, depending on the success of the restructuring program and
provided that an effective regulatory framework is in place.
67.
Reducing social and wealth disparities is crucial for enhancing the well-being of
the population at large, and ensuring an environment in which further social and
economic progress is possible. The government is advancing with its Broad Based Black
Economic Empowerment strategy. Progress with the land reform program has been more
limited; it will be important to address the difficulties that prevent faster progress, while
keeping the program grounded on well-defined legal principles. Continued and firm action
against the HIV/AIDS epidemic will help contain the serious social impact of the disease.
68.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation will be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

VII. Exchange Rate Arrangement:
The South African rand floats against other currencies. South Africa formally accepted the
obligations of Article VIII, Section 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, as from
September 15, 1973. On July 6, 2005 the exchange rate of the rand was US$0.1497=R1.
South Africa has followed a strategy of progressively easing exchange controls on capital
transactions since 1994, reflecting the government’s commitment to the eventual abolition
of these controls, and has made considerable progress in this regard in recent years. With
the abolition of the financial rand in 1995, all exchange controls on nonresidents were
eliminated. They are free to purchase shares, bonds, and other assets without restriction and
to repatriate dividends, interest receipts, and current and capital profits, as well as the original
investment capital. As announced in the 2004 Budget, foreign companies, governments and
institutions may list on South Africa’s bond and securities exchanges.
Since 1995, exchange controls on capital transaction by residents have also been relaxed.
Rather than allowing complete liberalization of a particular type of current or capital
transaction, the authorities have pursued a strategy of allowing an increasing array of
transactions, with each subject to a quantitative cap that has been progressively raised
over time. Liberalization was continued in 2004, when exchange controls on outward foreign
direct investments by South African corporates were abolished. Application to the South

- 44 -

APPENDIX I

African Reserve Bank’s Exchange Control Department is still required for monitoring
purposes and approval in terms of existing foreign direct investment criteria, including
demonstrated benefit to South Africa. The South African Reserve Bank reserves the right to
stagger capital outflows relating to very large foreign investments so as to manage any
potential impact on the foreign exchange market.
Most of the remaining restrictions are on portfolio outflows. In particular, institutional
investors are permitted to invest in foreign securities, subject to an overall limit of 15 percent
of their total retail assets for retirement funds, long term insurers and investment managers
registered as institutional investors and 20 percent for collective investment scheme
management companies. Corporates may, upon application, be permitted to establish primary
listings offshore under certain conditions. Private individuals are allowed to invest up to
R750,000 offshore. In addition to the above, there are restrictions on, inter alia, the travel
allowances (R160,000 for private individuals), the transfer of funds abroad by emigrants
(“blocked funds), and the investment of currency proceeds from exports (which must be
repatriated within 180 days from accrual). The transfer of blocked funds in excess of
R750,000 for individuals and R1.5 million for families is allowed, provided a 10 percent exit
levy is paid. Larger amounts may be staggered to manage any impact on the foreign
exchange market. Dividends and interest payments on the blocked funds are freely
transferable abroad and travel allowances can be augmented if bona fide need is documented.

Article IV Consultations

The 2004 Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on
September 3, 2004. South Africa is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation
cycle.

Technical Assistance

A FAD mission took place in 2003 to discuss with the National Treasury their draft royalty
bill (published in March 2003).
A monetary and financial statistics mission in 2003 (i) reviewed the SARB collection and
compilation procedures of monetary statistics, (ii) helped develop a work program to
implement the methodology recommended in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual
(MFSM), (iii) introduced standardized report forms for reporting central bank data to STA,
and (iv) initiated work on an integrated database for monetary statistics that will meet the
Fund’s publication requirements. A follow-up mission took place during May–June 2004.
A STA mission, supported by a labor statistics consultant funded by the World Bank,
undertook a review of South Africa Labor Force Statistics in March 2005. The mission
recommended steps to produce statistics that are more reliable, better quality, and more
closely aligned with International Labor Organization (ILO) standards.

APPENDIX II

South Africa: Relations with the World Bank Group
Between 1951 and 1966, the Bank made 11 loans to South Africa, totaling US$241.8 million.
Lending operations ceased in 1966 with all loans from that earlier period fully repaid.
Between 1990 and 1994, the Bank resumed activities in South Africa through economic
analysis and capacity building resulting in papers and reports on the macroeconomy,
education, health, agriculture, fiscal decentralization, labor markets, trade policy, and
microfinance. During 1994-2004, the emphasis has shifted towards policy advice and
dialogue on municipal and welfare services, macroeconomic strategy, poverty, job-creation,
medium-term expenditure framework, HIV/AIDS, and business environment. Lending has
been limited to the Industrial Competitiveness and Job Creation Project (approved for
US$46 million and subsequently reduced to US$24.5 million at the government’s request),
which closed in September 2004; and a Technical Assistance Loan for the Municipal
Financial Management Technical Assistance Project (MFMTAP) approved in 2002 for an
amount of US$15 million. There is a large GEF-funded program for nature conservation and
development: the C.A.P.E. Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Development Project
(US$9 million); the Cape Peninsula Biodiversity Conservation Project (US$12.3 million); the
Maloti-Drakensberg Transfrontier Conservation and Development Project (US$7.9 million),
the Greater Addo Elephant National Park Project (US$5.5 million); and four medium-size
projects for a total of US$2.4 million. Most recently, since 2004, the emphasis in the
evolving policy dialogue and knowledge work has been on growth and jobs, investment
climate and SME development, municipal monitoring and financial management, land
reform, and service delivery and impact evaluation.
The International Finance Corporation’ s (IFC) committed portfolio has grown steadily from
US$114 million in 2000 to US$221 million in 2004, IFC’s second largest country portfolio in
Africa after Nigeria. The IFC strategy for South Africa has three key objectives: i) supporting
black economic empowerment, through leading acquisition transactions and support for
SME/entrepreneurship; ii) developing the financial markets and institutions; and iii) helping
South African companies expand into Africa and globally. IFC has built up a strong field
presence. Recent transactions include the Hernic Ferrochrome mining project with
Mitsubishi ($30 million loan and equity); the bond issue guarantee with the City of
Johannesburg ($30 million); and the DBSA credit default swap to support securitization of
their municipal bond portfolio ($18 million) as well as a loan to FirstRand Empowerment
Trust (US$30 million) to finance the acquisition of FirstRand Limited’s common shares.
South Africa has been a member of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)
since 1994. South African investors are the most active users of MIGA guarantees among
Category Two countries, and currently have US$212.5 million of gross MIGA coverage (and
US$161.1 million of net coverage) outstanding across 10 contracts of guarantee. Since
inception, MIGA has issued 12 contracts, worth US$298.3 million of gross coverage, to
South African investors for investments in Lesotho, Mozambique, Nigeria, Swaziland and
Zambia. In December 2003, MIGA issued a US$11.4 million guarantee to IP Direct of South
Africa for its investment in IP Satellite Services of Nigeria.

APPENDIX III

South Africa: Statistical Issues
South Africa publishes a wide array of economic and financial data that are adequate for
surveillance purposes. It subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and
its metadata are posted on the IMF’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB).
Real sector statistics
In June 1999, Statistics South Africa released a major revision of the national income
accounts based on the 1993 System of National Accounts (1993 SNA). The revision raised
nominal GDP by some 13 percent for the 1993-98 period and raised the average annual rate
of growth of real GDP from 2.2 percent to 2.7 percent for the 1994-98 period. In
November 2004, the base year of the national accounts aggregates was changed from 1995 to
2000. At the same time, benchmarking was undertaken to accurately reflect the structure of
the economy, by incorporating new areas of the economy previously not covered, introducing
new and improved source data, and incorporating methodological changes in the compilation
process. These changes resulted in an upward revision of the average annual change in GDP
at constant prices for the period 1998 to 2003 from 2.4 percent to 2.7 percent.
Reporting of real sector data for International Financial Statistics (IFS) is timely.
Data reported for Direction of Trade Statistics (DOTS), however, show substantial
inconsistencies with external trade data reported for IFS, particularly exports.
Labor market statistics based on household survey data are published with lags of about six
months, and unemployment data are available only at a six month frequency. In addition, a
Quarterly Employment Survey has been introduced that covers the formal non-agricultural
sector. It is published with a lag of one quarter with information on employment and
remuneration. A STA mission in March 2005 undertook a review of South Africa’s Labor
Force Statistics and made recommendations designed to improve quality and reliability and
align them with standards set by the International Labor Organization.
Beginning with the April 2003 index, Statistics South Africa issued revisions to the Consumer
Price Index for the period January 2002 to March 2003, reflecting the incorporation of more
reliable data on residential rents.
Government finance statistics
South Africa currently reports data for the consolidated central government and for regional
and local governments for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. It also
reports monthly data covering the operations of the budgetary central government for
publication in IFS. GFS data, although still on a cash basis, are compiled and disseminated
domestically and internationally according to the GFSM 2001 framework.

- 47 -

APPENDIX III

Monetary and financial statistics
South Africa regularly reports monetary statistics for publication in IFS, although there is
room for improving the timeliness of the data on nonbank financial institutions. The SARB is
working on the implementation of the recommendations of the 2003 and 2004 monetary and
financial statistics missions towards full implementation of the methodology recommended in
the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual.
External sector statistics
South Africa is a regular reporter of balance of payments data, which are compiled according
to the guidelines prescribed by the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5).
However, there are deficiencies in the coverage of trade with Southern African Customs
Union (SACU) countries; the capturing and processing of underlying data in this area are
currently receiving attention. Currently, the services transactions distinguish between
transportation and travel services while the other services transactions are, for the time being,
aggregated. Data collected on reinvested earnings on direct investment are currently not
incorporated into the balance of payments statement.
Also, the presentation of international reserve accumulation in the balance of payments
includes both the central bank’s reserves as well as the commercial banks’ foreign exchange
reserves resulting from exchange control regulations. This causes inconsistencies between
the balance of payments and the international investment position, in which commercial
banks’ foreign exchange holdings are excluded from reserves (following recommendation of
the 2001 ROSC mission). Net errors and omissions in the balance of payments are large and
vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Work is ongoing to reduce the large errors and
omissions, which reached 2.3 percent of GDP during 2004.
South Africa disseminates its international reserve position in line with the requirements of
the IMF's template on international reserves and foreign currency liquidity. From 6 March
2005 South Africa values its gold reserves at market price taken at 2:30 p.m. on each
valuation date, whereas previously they were valued at less than the full market price.

APPENDIX IV

Medium-Term Outlook and Debt Sustainability
Background and overview
Over the past decade successful macroeconomic stabilization and structural reforms
have laid the foundation for higher growth in South Africa. As a result, the average rate
of economic growth has increased to 3.4 percent in the last 5 years from 1.2 percent in the
last 15 years prior to democratization, reflecting mainly a turnaround in total factor
productivity (TFP) growth.20

Baseline scenario
The baseline scenario envisages average real GDP growth of 3.4 percent in 2005–10,
similar to the average growth rate in the past five years (Table 1). The scenario assumes
the continuation of current macroeconomic policies and steady, but modest, progress with
reforms (including labor markets and trade), and privatization limited to some non-core
assets. In line with the WEO, it also assumes broadly favorable external conditions,
including average world real GDP growth of just above 4 percent over 2005-10. Under these
assumptions, reducing unemployment significantly may be difficult. Firms may continue to
rely on labor-saving technologies as rigidities persist in the labor market. The government
debt to GDP would be fairly stable, with rising social expenditures and infrastructure outlays
being broadly offset by strong revenue performance.
Accelerated reforms
A comprehensive reform effort could increase annual real GDP growth significantly
above levels in the baseline scenario. Table 2 presents an accelerated reform scenario
leading to 5½ percent annual growth over the medium-term, assuming higher growth

Analysis,” Chapter II, in: Post-Apartheid South Africa: The First Ten Years, eds. Michael Nowak and

APPENDIX IV

contributions from all three growth components, employment, capital, and total factor
productivity. It is difficult to estimate the potential effects of reforms, but, in generating this
scenario the following factors were taken into account:

21

•

A rapid easing of labor market legislation along the lines suggested in this report, that
helps increase employment growth by 1 percentage point to just over 3 percent per
year, could raise real GDP growth by some 0.5 percent per year.

•

Labor market reform, along with further trade liberalization, simplification of the
tariff regime, and public enterprise reform, including privatization, will help improve
efficiency and stimulate innovation. Together, these reforms could be expected to
increase average total factor productivity growth by around 1 percentage point.21

•

Structural reforms that improve the investment climate will stimulate capital
accumulation and could add another 0.5 percent of GDP growth, if the average
growth rate of the capital stock increased by some 1 percentage point per year.

Cross-country evidence shows that bold structural reforms can have a significant positive impact
on growth. For instance, in a cross-country study Wacziarg and Horn Welch (2003) “Trade
Liberalization and Growth: New Evidence,” NBER Working Paper 10152, show that significant trade
liberalization has raised growth by around 1.5 percentage points.

APPENDIX IV

Debt sustainability: Medium-term scenarios
South Africa’s fiscal policies imply a sustainable path for government debt. Under the
policies in the 2005 budget and the medium-term expenditure framework, and assuming
continued strength in revenue, government debt would remain moderate and stabilize at about
35 percent of GDP (Table 3). Gross financing needs would stay close to 5 percent of GDP over
the medium-term, slightly below the average of the past five years (Table 4).
Government debt dynamics remain stable under a variety of shocks, including weaker GDP
growth, a lower primary balance, a 30 percent real depreciation of the exchange rate, and a
10 percent increase in the debt stock (Figure 1). Under each of these scenarios (and assuming
unchanged fiscal stance), the government debt ratio increases slightly over the projection period,
exceeding 40 percent of GDP only with the 10 percent debt shock. The detailed risk analysis in
Chapter II of the Selected Issues Paper confirms this relatively benign outlook.
South Africa’s external debt ratio is projected to stabilize at around its current level of
about 20 percent of GDP, before falling gradually to around 16 percent of GDP by 2010. In
2005, the current account deficit is expected to widen to 3.8 percent of GDP in response to higher
oil prices, the continued strength of domestic demand, and the lagged impact of recent currency
strength. This deficit, however, is envisaged to be largely financed by non-debt creating capital
inflows (with FDI boosted by the purchase of ABSA by Barclays Bank). Over the medium term,
the current account deficit should narrow gradually as the pace of domestic demand begins to
slow and the terms of trade improves moderately following a peak in oil prices in 2006, which
would be accompanied by a gradual decline in the external debt ratio.
South Africa’s external debt position and gross external financing needs are robust to a
range of shocks (Tables 5, 6 and Figure 2). In part this reflects a relatively low level of debt and
a favorable debt structure. One third of the debt is denominated in rands, which limits to some
extent South Africa’s exposure to currency risk. Exposure to rollover risk has been reduced as the
share of short-term debt in total foreign currency debt has fallen from over 50 percent in 19962000 to 38 percent in 2004. Of the stress tests presented in Figure 2, in the short term, the largest
impact would arise from a shock involving a 30 percent depreciation in the real exchange rate, as
a result of which external debt would peak at 24 percent of GDP in 2006 before falling back to
18 percent of GDP in 2010. Over the longer term, the largest impact would arise from a
permanent one-half standard deviation increase in the current account deficit. This would raise
the annual current account deficit by about 0.7 percent of GDP, as a result of which debt would
stabilize at about 20 percent of GDP. Permanent shocks to growth and interest rates would have
only a minor impact on the debt stock. Under the historical average scenario, external debt would
fall to 2 percent of GDP by 2010, suggesting that the baseline projection of 16 percent of GDP is
not unduly optimistic.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
September 2, 2005
This statement provides information that has become available since the staff report was
issued. The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged.
1.
Data released last week reveal continued robust growth of economic activity.
Supply-side GDP data published by Statistics South Africa on August 23 show real GDP
growth of 4.8 percent in the second quarter of 2005, stronger than anticipated and up from
3.5 percent in the first quarter. The rebound in growth partly reflects strong performance of
the manufacturing sector, which grew by 7.3 percent in the second quarter after contracting
in the first quarter. Demand-side GDP data for the first half of 2005 published by the South
African Reserve Bank (SARB) on August 24 show continued strong final domestic
demand—including both consumption and fixed capital formation—but subdued inventory
investment. In the first half of 2005 import growth slowed markedly while export growth
remained steady, and as a result the current account deficit declined to 3.3 percent of GDP,
from 3.6 percent of GDP in the second half of 2004. Twelve-month CPIX inflation rose to
4.2 percent in July, from 3.5 percent in June, mainly reflecting higher fuel and food prices.
2.
This information points to strengthened near-term economic prospects. Staff has
raised moderately its projection for real GDP growth, to 4.3 percent in 2005 and 3.9 percent
in 2006. Projected fiscal deficits have been lowered slightly, to 1.9 percent of GDP in 2005
(calendar year) and 2.1 percent of GDP in 2006, reflecting stronger expected fiscal revenues.
The forecast for the external current account deficit remains essentially unchanged, as the
effect of a lower than anticipated deficit in the first half of 2005 is broadly offset by a weaker
outlook for the country’s terms of trade, owing to higher world oil prices.
3.
At its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting on August 10-11, the SARB
decided to keep the repo rate unchanged at 7 percent. The MPC saw the inflation outlook
as generally favorable, but mentioned several risks, including higher oil prices and continued
strong domestic expenditure. The MPC will also watch closely the trends of wage settlements
and unit labor costs. The SARB’s central forecast envisages CPIX inflation rising moderately
in the period ahead, and peaking at about 5.5 percent in the first quarter of 2006.
4.
Last week Fitch upgraded South Africa's sovereign credit rating one notch to
BBB+. The move brings Fitch rating in line with those of Moody’s and S&P. Fitch cited an
improvement in the country’s growth performance and further strengthening of its
international reserves.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 15, 2005

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with South Africa
On September 2, 2005 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with South Africa.1
Background
South Africa’s macroeconomic performance was strong in 2004 and early 2005. Growth was
supported by a continuation of sound policies and a favorable external environment. Real GDP
grew by 3.7 percent in 2004, and 3.5 percent in the first quarter of 2005. The fairly broad-based
expansion was mainly driven by strong final domestic demand, fueled by growing disposable
income, a large reduction in interest rates, and wealth effects arising from rising housing and
stock prices. The rapid expansion in economic activity led to some increase in employment,
contributing to reduce the unemployment rate to 26.2 percent in September 2004, some
4 percentage points lower than two years earlier. Subsequently, employment continued to grow
but not sufficiently to offset the impact of a growing labor force, and the unemployment rate rose
marginally to 26.5 percent by March 2005.
CPIX inflation has remained within the official 3–6 percent target band since September 2003;
it fell to the lower end of the target in February 2005, before edging up to 3.5 percent in
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.

-2June 2005.2 During 2004, the continued strengthening of the rand helped contain inflationary
pressures and softened the impact of higher oil prices. Expected CPIX inflation for 2005 and
2006 has been within the target band since late 2004. Growth in broad money and bank credit
to the private sector has remained robust.
The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) has maintained its flexible exchange rate policy while
building up international reserves. Gross international reserves increased from the equivalent of
70 percent of short-term external debt at end-2003 to an estimated 178 percent as of end-June
2005. The higher level of reserves and sound macroeconomic policies have contributed to a
further decline in sovereign risk spreads.
The rand continued to strengthen in 2004, a process that started in 2002. This appreciation—as
that of other commodity-currencies, such as the Australian dollar—was associated with a rise in
commodity prices. Also, large capital inflows resulting from strong global appetite for emerging
assets, helped support the rand. This pattern was reversed during 2005, however, with the rand
depreciating moderately.
The external current account deficit widened to 3.2 percent of GDP in 2004, from 1.5 percent of
GDP in 2003, owing to the rapid growth in domestic demand and the strength of the rand.
Import volumes grew strongly, exceeding the growth in export volumes, while the terms of trade
remained broadly unchanged. The current account deficit was easily financed by capital inflows.
The fiscal deficit fell to 1.5 percent of GDP in FY2004/05, from 2.3 percent of GDP a year
earlier, reflecting strong tax revenue performance. Tax revenue rose significantly owing to
buoyant domestic demand and greater efficiency in tax collection. An increase in social
spending, mainly in the form of targeted grants, was partially offset by the impact of lower
domestic interest rates on debt-service payments.
Asset prices rose strongly in 2004 and early 2005. Low domestic interest rates, favorable
growth prospects, and improved business confidence pushed the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange (JSE) all-share index up by 18 percent in real terms during 2004, and a further
10 percent in the first half of 2005. Also, boosted by falling interest rates and new demand by an
emerging black middle class, residential property prices rose by 28 percent in real terms in
2004, and at a lower rate in recent months.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the South African authorities for the remarkable economic
progress achieved since democratization through sound macroeconomic policies and structural
reforms. The economy is now growing strongly, inflation has been lowered and has become
more predictable, public finances have been strengthened, and the external position has
improved markedly. The expansion in economic activity has created additional jobs.
2

The CPIX—the measure targeted by the SARB under its inflation-targeting framework—is equal to
the CPI excluding interest payments on mortgage bonds.

-3Given South Africa’s position in the region, the country’s strong economic performance has
benefited the rest of Africa.
Directors saw South Africa’s near-term economic outlook as favorable. Growth was expected to
remain robust owing to low interest rates, a moderately expansionary fiscal policy, and healthy
growth in the world economy.
Directors noted that serious economic challenges remain, including persistent high
unemployment, widespread poverty, large wealth disparities, and a high incidence of HIV/AIDS.
They supported the authorities’ approach to deal with these problems through policies aimed at
raising economic growth within a stable macroeconomic environment, combined with targeted
initiatives to reduce unemployment and improve social conditions. Directors felt that this
strategy could be bolstered by including substantial labor market reforms and further trade
liberalization.
Directors agreed that sound fiscal management over the past years had created space for a
moderate increase in government expenditure in the period ahead. They supported welltargeted additional spending in the social areas and on infrastructure to help address pressing
social needs and enhance the productive capacity of the economy. At the same time, they felt it
was important to keep the fiscal deficit at levels that would prevent an undesirable increase in
the debt to GDP ratio that would put upward pressure on interest rates. Directors considered
that budget documents could usefully expand the coverage of fiscal indicators to include public
enterprises that carry potentially significant fiscal risk.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ skillful implementation of monetary policy, which had kept
inflation within the target band for about two years. They noted that the inflation targeting regime
had gained credibility, as evidenced by the decline in inflation expectations, and thought that
continued clear communication with the public, emphasizing inflation as the overriding objective
of monetary policy, would further enhance credibility. Directors also considered that targeting
inflation at the mid-point of the band over the medium-term would help anchor inflation
expectations and increase monetary policy effectiveness. They noted some risks to the inflation
outlook, including higher oil prices, a weakening of the rand and a pickup in unit labor costs, and
encouraged the authorities to stand ready to adjust interest rates, if needed, to keep inflation
within the target band.
Directors noted that the flexible exchange rate system had benefited the country, being an
integral element of its inflation targeting regime and facilitating the adjustment of the economy to
external shocks. They shared the authorities’ view of seeking competitiveness gains through
measures that raise productivity and reduce costs. Directors also supported additional
accumulation of international reserves, but noted that reserves could be approaching levels that
would make the case for further accumulation less compelling. Looking forward, they observed
that further analysis of this issue would be useful. Directors agreed with the gradual relaxation
of capital controls, welcomed the advances made in this area in the past year, and felt that
further progress in this direction would be beneficial.
Directors regarded the banking system as fundamentally sound. They noted that most of the
Financial Sector Assessment Program’s (FSAP’s) recommendations were being implemented,

-4which together with other initiatives to enhance the regulatory and supervisory framework would
further strengthen the financial sector’s resilience to adverse shocks. They commended the
authorities on progress so far in facilitating access of previously disadvantaged groups to
banking services. Further advances in implementing the Financial Services Charter and the
introduction of a regulatory framework for institutions specialized in basic banking services
should help accelerate this process.
Directors stressed that success in reducing unemployment was critical for bolstering support for
ongoing reform initiatives. They supported the government’s approach that includes programs
to enhance skills and to provide temporary jobs in infrastructure and other projects, as well as
measures to foster small business development. They noted, however, that this approach could
benefit substantially from a relaxation of restrictive labor market regulations, and encouraged
the authorities to consider reducing the scope of centralized collective bargaining, simplifying
the minimum-wage structure and moderating minimum-wage adjustments, and further
streamlining dismissal procedures.
Directors considered that further trade liberalization and a simplification of the tariff regime
would increase productivity and support growth. Efforts could focus on lowering the overall level
of protection, harmonizing protection across sectors, reducing the number of tariff bands, and
applying ad valorem duties for most items. It would also be important that preferential trade
agreements being negotiated be broad-based and non-discriminatory so as to complement
multilateral liberalization and limit the potential for trade diversion.
Directors supported the government’s objective of enhancing the efficiency of state-owned
enterprises, as this would increase productivity, support infrastructure investment, and reduce
the cost of doing business in South Africa. They also consider it useful to keep open the
possibility of future privatization under an effective regulatory framework.
Directors agreed that further reducing social and wealth disparities was key for improving the
living standards of the entire population, and ensuring a favorable environment for further social
and economic progress. They welcomed the advances made with the Broad Based Black
Economic Empowerment program. Directors noted that progress with land reform had been
more limited, and felt is was important to address the obstacles to faster progress,
while keeping the program grounded on well-defined legal principles. They also noted that
continued and firm action against the HIV/AIDS epidemic will help contain the serious social
impact of the disease.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report for the Article IV consultation with
South Africa may be made available at a later stage if the authorities consent.
