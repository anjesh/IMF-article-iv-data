Staff Report for the 2011 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2011 Consultation with the Czech Republic
Approved by Juha Kähkönen and David Marston
March 18, 2011
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background: The Czech economy has weathered the global crisis relatively well, with the recovery
underway since mid-2009. The government formed in mid-2010 outlined a comprehensive
medium-term policy agenda anchored in fiscal consolidation, which has already yielded credibility
gains. Monetary policy remains supportive, inflation pressures were fairly subdued until the recent
surge in commodity prices, and the banking sector is stable.
Key challenges: With large structural deficits and population aging, public debt is on a rising trend.
Monetary policy is complicated by the contrasting influences on inflation of climbing world
commodity prices and the still nascent recovery. Sustaining robust productivity and GDP growth in
the long run also requires significant policy efforts.
Key policy recommendations: Ensuring debt sustainability and promoting durable growth requires:


Defining additional fiscal consolidation measures beyond 2011—including through pension,
health care, and social benefits reforms—to support the government’s medium-term fiscal
targets and preserve market credibility.



Maintaining accommodative monetary policy until the negative output gap narrows
considerably, unless a spike in inflation expectations, a substantial widening of the interest
rate differential against other advanced countries, or a rapid reduction in labor market slack
necessitate earlier action.



Pursuing productivity-enhancing structural reforms to buttress growth.



Continuing to monitor risks for the banking sector that may arise from further deterioration
of credit portfolios and from foreign parent banks.

The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment of the economic situation and the key policy
recommendations.
The staff team comprising Ms. Murgašová (head), Messrs. Tchaidze and Vázquez (all EUR), and
Mr. Klyuev (RES) visited Prague during February 9–21, 2011. Mr. Kiekens (Executive Director)
and Mr. Kollár (Advisor to the Executive Director) joined the discussions. The mission met with
Minister of Finance Kalousek, Czech National Bank Governor Singer, other senior officials, as well
as representatives of the Parliament, financial and business sectors, academia, and trade unions.

I. CONTEXT
1.
Against the backdrop of a recovery and rising public debt both in the Czech
Republic and in Europe, the Article IV discussions focused on the appropriate mix of
macroeconomic policies to balance the objectives of supporting growth and fiscal
sustainability.


Promoting the recovery in the short term and sustaining robust long-term growth. The
recovery has been supported by external demand and accommodative monetary
policy, but comprehensive structural reforms will be needed to buttress long-term
growth.



Ensuring fiscal sustainability. In the absence of comprehensive fiscal consolidation
over the medium term, debt burden would continue rising and lead to higher interest
rates, with detrimental effects for long-term growth.

2.
The coalition government in power since mid-2010 has outlined an ambitious
policy agenda. The government’s Policy Statement from August 2010 sets out among its
main objectives: (i) reforming public finances to halt the rise in public debt and balance the
general government budget by 2016; (ii) increasing transparency of public procurement; and
(iii) reducing corruption in the public sector. The legislative agenda for the coming year aims
to implement key reforms to address these objectives. Ensuring broad-based support for these
reforms may be a challenge.
II. BACKGROUND
3.
The Czech economy has rebounded from the downturn owing to its strong
fundamentals and the global recovery. Low public debt, a comfortable external position,
absence of pre-crisis asset bubbles, and a stable financial sector led to a relatively moderate
decline in output in 2009 and a subsequent rebound of domestic demand. Deep economic
integration with the euro area allowed the Czech economy to benefit from the recovery in
trading partner countries, particularly Germany.

Domestic demand has become self-sustaining since mid-2010 (Figure 1). Net
exports led the recovery, followed by rebuilding of inventories and an upturn in private
consumption, possibly reflecting pent-up demand. Fixed investment grew moderately in the
second half of 2010, mostly on account of one-off factors. GDP grew by 2.3 percent in 2010.
Consumer and business confidence have improved and spare capacity has been reduced.
Unemployment has declined after peaking in early 2010, the fall in total employment has
abated, and productivity has been increasing faster than labor costs. However, corporate credit
continues to decline, and employment in some core industries, like manufacturing, is still far
from the pre-crisis levels.
With improving productivity, labor costs have slowly
started to increase.

Despite accommodative monetary policy, inflationary pressures remained
subdued until the recent surge in commodity prices. After temporarily becoming negative
in late 2009, headline CPI inflation has largely remained just below the 2 percent target since
mid-2010. This increase reflects growth in regulated prices, indirect tax hikes, and lately the
global commodity prices. The latter also raised producer price inflation. Meanwhile
monetary-policy relevant inflation—CPI inflation adjusted for the first-round effects of
changes in indirect taxes—remains below the target given the still large negative output gap.
In this environment, the Czech National Bank (CNB) has maintained the two-week repo
interest rate at the record low level of 0.75 percent, after cumulative cuts of 325 basis points
between August 2008 and May 2010. In spite of this, asset prices have not recovered to their
pre-crisis levels, and real estate prices have continued a moderate downward adjustment
(Figure 2).

mechanism.

Fiscal consolidation commenced in 2010 and helped yield significant credibility
gains (Figure 4, Table 3). Given the recovery and owing to fears of rising public debt,
the 2010 budget included a set of austerity package with revenues accounting for a large
majority.2 In addition, the government resorted to ad hoc expenditure cuts and freezes to
compensate for underperformance of corporate income taxes and social security contributions.
These efforts and the announcement of medium-term consolidation plans led to an upgrade of
Czech Republic’s outlook to positive by Standard & Poor’s, a decline in spreads on long-term
debt, and interest cost savings of 0.5 percent of GDP relative to the budgeted amount. The
fiscal measures, the interest savings, and the improving economy helped reduce the deficit to
an estimated 4.9 percent of GDP, compared to the target of 5.3 percent of GDP. Despite

CE4 Countries” by Amat Adarov and Robert Tchaidze; the CE4 countries include the Czech Republic, Hungary,
Poland, and Slovakia.
2

The measures, amounting to 2 percent of GDP against unchanged policies, comprised an increase in VAT rates
by one percentage point, an expansion in the base for social security contributions and a postponement of a
planned reduction in their rates, higher excise and real estate taxes, and a number of expenditure cuts, mostly in
social benefits.
Under unchanged policies, the fiscal balance would have deteriorated in 2010 because of (1) the last step in the
phased reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 19 percent; (2) a scheduled reduction in social security
contributions; and (3) the absence of one-off factors that improved the 2009 balance (such as the sale of emission
permits to foreign buyers).

The current account deficit widened in 2010 though competitiveness has not been
eroded (Figure 3, Table 2).3 Export profitability improved and exports picked up, resulting
in sizeable trade surpluses. However, deterioration of the services surpluses to deficits and
significant outflows of interest and reinvested earnings widened the current account deficit.
After weakening at the peak of the crisis, the koruna resumed its long-term trend appreciation.
The real exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals.
9.
Capital inflows resumed, but remain below their pre-crisis levels (Figure 3,
Table 2). Yet their composition has changed, and debt flows now exceed equity flows,
including FDI. Given the low Czech yields, these inflows seem to be driven by the Czech
Republic’s strong fundamentals. 2010 also saw a large outflow of other investment, including
trade credits and large placements of borrowed funds by some corporates in countries where
they plan to expand their business activities. External debt increased to around 48 percent of
GDP, with short-term debt accounting for one quarter.
10.
Spillovers from the debt turmoil in the euro area periphery have been limited.
Real sector linkages are minor as exports to the periphery are marginal, while the muted
reaction of spreads on Czech debt to turmoil in sovereign debt markets is a sign of confidence.
Direct holdings of euro periphery sovereign bonds by Czech banks are not material. The risk
of contagion via parent banks is limited by the traditional domestic business orientation of
Czech subsidiaries and their high capital and liquidity buffers.

Risks to the short-term outlook are tilted downward. Downside risks arise from the
possibility of sovereign debt distress in the euro area periphery spreading to core Europe and
the lack of progress in formulating medium-term fiscal consolidation plans in major advanced
economies. This would lead to lower growth in the euro area and in the Czech Republic. High
commodity prices present another downside risk. On the upside, faster improvement in labor
market conditions could boost private consumption.

In the medium term growth is expected to remain below the pre-crisis levels.
GDP growth is projected to reach around 3 percent beyond 2011 and output gap is forecast to
close around 2014. With income per capita and productivity about 1/3 below the average of
the EU-15, there is scope to accelerate growth further. The authorities and staff concurred that
this would require structural reforms focused on increasing labor participation and labor
market flexibility; enhancing efficiency of higher education, R&D, and the public sector; and
further improving the business climate to attract foreign direct investment (Appendix II). The
authorities have prepared a comprehensive study on improving competitiveness that will form
the basis of reforms in this area.
B. Policy Discussions—Challenges Ahead
Restoring Order in Public Finances
14.
The government’s medium-term deficit targets reflect its strong preference to
achieve fiscal sustainability. The opportunity for a fundamental overhaul of public finances
was missed during the boom years, and the Czech Republic entered the crisis with a structural
deficit and a high share of entitlement expenditures. While the fiscal stimulus and full
functioning of automatic stabilizers were appropriate to cushion the economic downturn
in 2009, public debt has risen by one third since end-2008. The 2010 austerity package was
insufficient to put public finances on a sustainable path. Going forward, the Czech Republic
faces one of the worst demographic trends in the OECD, which will increase aging-related
fiscal costs to almost one-quarter of GDP by 2060. In view of these pressures, the government
intends to reduce the general government deficit below the SGP limit of 3 percent in 2013 and
to balance the general government budget by 2016. Staff support these objectives, as they
help reverse the rising trend of debt.

the Constitutional Court ruled that the

(0.6 percent of GDP) is in conflict with the existing law. The government has until end-2011
to hold another vote to keep the legislation in place.

For example, the 10 percent wage bill reduction, which is achieved via pay or employment cuts at the
discretion of each line ministry, may not necessarily lead to efficiency gains.

sharply. However, if the economy performs below expectations, automatic stabilizers should
be allowed to play out fully. If the government fails to secure the vote necessary to maintain
in place the measures originally approved under the procedure of legislative emergency, in
staff’s view, the government should identify a set of compensating consolidation measures.
17.
Staff urged the authorities to identify and put in place a credible package of
medium-term consolidation measures. To allow the authorities to meet their medium-term
deficit targets, additional measures beyond those in the 2011 budget need to be implemented,
but these still remain to be designed. Staff encouraged the authorities to specify these concrete
steps early to increase the credibility of the adjustment, which, according to staff research,6
decreases the output cost of fiscal tightening. A comprehensive medium-term consolidation
strategy would be preferable to ad hoc revenue increases or across-the-board spending cuts
each year. In staff’s view, rationalizing entitlements and the generous welfare state is
unavoidable to ensure durability of fiscal adjustment. Reducing general transfers or
government consumption or raising VAT revenues (e.g., by eliminating the preferential rate)
and real estate taxes would be more efficient and have lower negative impact on GDP than

The improvement in the primary cyclically-adjusted balance by 1.2 percent of GDP in 2011 is somewhat higher
than the per annum consolidation needed to balance the budget by 2016 (almost 5 percent of GDP over 6 years).

most alternative instruments, such as reducing government investment or increasing payroll
taxes (Appendix III).7 Streamlining public institutions and positions would help lower the
overall wage bill without reducing government wages. Strengthening means-testing would
improve targeting of social benefits, yield savings, and enhance work incentives. The
authorities indicated that they plan reforms in many of these areas and expected relevant
legislation to be introduced in the near term.

The authorities are preparing reforms of the pension and health-care systems
needed to achieve long-term fiscal sustainability (Box 1). Coalition partners recently
agreed on broad parameters of a pension reform, and the government plans to secure its
legislative approval this year. In staff’s view, the main aim should be to ensure long-term
sustainability of the pay-as-you-go system (PAYG). A second fully-funded definedcontribution pillar can help diversify sources of retirement income, but—given the limited
fiscal space—should not lead to accumulation of additional public debt. Staff also support the
proposal for a unification of VAT rates on efficiency grounds, and argue that the rates need to
be calibrated to cover all pension-reform related costs. Staff and the authorities agreed on the
need to protect vulnerable segments of the population from the impact of an effective VAT
hike. The authorities concurred with staff that comprehensive institutional and financing
reforms of the health care system will also be critical to maintain the soundness of public
finances and noted several initiatives under discussion. They plan to secure the legislative
approval of these reforms by end-2012.

See IMF Working Paper No. 11/65 “Effects of Fiscal Consolidation in the Czech Republic” by Vladimir
Klyuev and Stephen Snudden.

13
Box 1. Assessment of Pension Reform Proposals
Coalition partners agreed on key elements of a pension reform, including changes to the PAYG,
introduction of a voluntary second fully-funded defined contribution pillar, and higher VAT rates
(some elements draw on an earlier proposal by an Expert Advisory Group—Appendix IV). Staff’s
views are as follows:
The proposed parametric changes will be insufficient to close the PAYG long-term deficit. The
plan to continue gradually raising the retirement age past 65 years would cover about 4/5 of the
PAYG long-term deficit. In staff’s view, further parametric changes, including a lower weight on
wages in the pension-indexation formula, would be necessary to close the remaining gap. Staff also
recommends accelerating the increase in the retirement age, setting it to 65 years in 2020, in view of
the already high PAYG deficits.
Introduction of a voluntary second pillar will erode the PAYG balance. Redirection of a portion of
social security contributions to the second pillar will increase the PAYG deficits (i.e. create
transition deficits), even though the voluntary nature of the proposed second pillar will likely limit
their size. However, in the long run, the pressure on PAYG financing is likely to rise, as high-wage
earners are more likely to opt out of the redistributive first pillar. The authorities noted the difficulty
of obtaining broad public support for a mandatory second pillar given the negative experience with
defined-contribution plans in other countries. Staff also pointed out that careful design of the second
pillar’s size and institutional arrangements is needed to minimize the operational costs, which could
erode the benefits of the pillar.
Other proposed changes would immediately worsen the PAYG finances. In response to the
Constitutional Court’s ruling that obliges the government to reduce the degree of redistribution
within the PAYG by October 2011, the government has proposed to increase pensions of
higher-income contributors at the expense of those in the middle-income range in a budgetaryneutral way. However, reduction of the assessment ceiling from 6 to 4 times the average wage—
while appropriate on efficiency grounds—and the proposed voluntary redirection of 1 percentage
point of social security contributions by employees to support pensions of their parents would
worsen PAYG deficits.
Staff support the proposed unification of the VAT rates to cover the transition costs associated
with the introduction of the second pillar. The preferential VAT rate is to be raised to 14 percent
in 2012, and in 2013 VAT rates are to be unified at 17.5 percent (the top rate is currently
at 20 percent). A unified VAT is preferable, because taxing basic goods at a reduced rate is a less
efficient way to subsidize low-income households than direct means-tested based support. Staff
emphasize that the VAT increase needs to be calibrated so that it covers all pension-reform related
costs, including the higher compensation of socially vulnerable groups, to avoid pension-reform
induced public debt accumulation.
Staff see scope to improve the functioning of the existing third voluntary pension pillar. This pillar
has a relatively high rate of participation, but the requirement to post positive profits each year leads
to very conservative investment strategies and low asset accumulation. Revising the regulatory
framework to facilitate a more diversified asset allocation would promote savings.

14
19.
The authorities aim to reinforce fiscal institutions. Their plans include
strengthening of fiscal rules, introduction of an act on budgetary discipline and responsibility,
and creation of a National Budget Council. Staff support these efforts, as cross-country
experience suggests that fiscal responsibility laws and budget rules applying to all levels of
government can buttress fiscal discipline and convey a message of fiscal rectitude to markets.
In staff’s view, a National Budget Council could usefully provide an independent evaluation
of fiscal policies, but its autonomy will be essential. The authorities broadly agreed, but
expressed concerns about the costs of an independent Council.

Capital adequacy ratios appear appropriate and have strengthened on the back of
retained earnings. Credit quality has deteriorated and put pressure on banks’

cannot be entirely ruled out, as the operating
environment in the EU remains challenging, some of the parent bank groups have large
exposures to sovereign euro area periphery bonds, and gross intra-group exposures are
sizeable. The authorities agreed, but stated that intra-group contagion was minimized by the

orientation and their high capital and liquidity buffers. Other risks, including liquidity and

severe but plausible macroeconomic and financial environments, without threatening macrofinancial stability.10 Banks also seem well prepared to absorb credit and market losses
stemming from a possible sovereign debt crisis in the euro area periphery as their direct
exposures were not material. At the same time, the results highlighted the need to ensure
prudent profit repatriation to protect the capital cushions of the domestic banks. Staff
welcomed the scope of the exercises and the severity of the stress scenarios, and suggested
incorporating an explicit differentiation of exposures vis-à-vis related companies in the
models to assess the potential for intra-group contagion, with which the CNB concurred.
26.
Reduction of subsidies to depositors of building societies is a step towards
reforming the sector. Existing regulations limit the scope of operation of building societies
to issuance of fixed-rate deposits and providing housing loans. Therefore, some institutions
have significant maturity and duration mismatches in their balance sheets, with associated
interest and liquidity risks. Staff supported the authorities’ plans for a phased introduction of
regulatory changes to establish a more level playing field among building societies and
commercial banks, increase efficiency in the provision of the financial service, and release
scarce public resources that are needed elsewhere. The authorities and staff concurred on the
need to remain vigilant about risks associated with the stability of deposits of building
societies during the transition.
27.
The impact of ongoing international regulatory initiatives on the domestic
banking system is deemed to be low. While a full impact assessment is pending, banks seem
well prepared to undergo a phased implementation of proposed changes to the liquidity and
capital regimes. The authorities prefer to incorporate these changes into the supervisory
review process (as opposed to introduction of hard ratios under pillar 1), to allow for
increased flexibility in their application. They stressed the need to align EC regulations and
Basel III proposals to the largest extent possible, and urged a careful calibration of regulatory
parameters to avoid unwarranted adverse effects on financial intermediation. The authorities
supported the calculation and disclosure of capital buffers at the level of individual legal
entities to protect the financial soundness of bank subsidiaries. They saw merit in maintaining
the flexibility to resolve problem banks at the level of national authorities, calling against
excessive empowering of home supervisors at the expense of host supervisors.
28.
The authorities strengthened the tools to address systemic risk and to deal with
weak credit institutions, but there is room to improve the financial safety net in some
areas. The CNB established a separate department in charge of macro-financial stability.
A 2009 amendment to the Act on Banks strengthened the CNB’s oversight authority over

banks’ liquidity, including special powers to impose temporary across-the-board restrictions
on bank activities (covering also foreign bank branches), in response to situations
jeopardizing financial stability. In addition, the menu of bank-resolution tools was widened,
including by enabling the creation of publicly-owned bridge banks, and entrusting appointed
administrators with powers to carry out purchase and assumption operations. In line with EC
directives, the payment period for insured deposits will be cut to twenty days starting in
June 2011, while the level of bank contributions and the coverage limit were increased
in 2010. While welcoming these initiatives, staff saw room to improve the coordination and
exchange of information between the CNB and the deposit insurance agency, including the
involvement of the latter in war games, which the authorities acknowledged. Staff also saw
merit in allowing the use of deposit insurance funds to support bank resolution under a leastcost principle, which was not shared by the authorities.

reporting from the regulated
institutions. A policy of transparent data disclosure by the CNB also supports external
surveillance and market discipline. However, given the almost universal presence of large
cross-border banks, effective supervision relies critically on close home-host coordination and
exchange of information. Participation of the CNB in the incipient work of the supervisory
colleges of seven banking groups (involving five home supervisors) is critical to ensure an
adequate, comprehensive assessment of banks’ risk profiles. The authorities positively
assessed the work of the supervisory colleges, but noted that it is too early to assess
effectiveness of some of their activities.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
The Czech economy has rebounded from the downturn owing to its strong
fundamentals and the global recovery, but faces a number of policy challenges. Large
structural deficits together with demographic trends are creating fiscal pressures, and under
unchanged policies, would imply a rising public debt burden. Climbing world commodity
prices complicate monetary policy in a situation of still nascent recovery and low core
inflation. Sustaining robust productivity and GDP growth will require significant policy
efforts. The authorities are well aware of these challenges and have prepared an ambitious
policy agenda to tackle them, but implementation of the necessary reforms may not be easy.

19
31.
An accommodative monetary policy remains appropriate in the presence of a
large negative output gap and fiscal consolidation. Appreciation of the koruna and the
sizeable output gap are likely to offset effects of rising commodity prices. Thus a gradual
increase in policy interest rates should commence once the output gap starts closing at a
significant pace, though a rise in inflation expectations or a rapid improvement in labor
markets would warrant earlier action. Interest rate differentials against other advanced
economies need to be also taken into consideration to avoid sharp changes in capital flows,
which affect the exchange rate and inflation in the highly open Czech economy.
32.
Wide-ranging structural reforms are needed to buttress growth. To close the
productivity and income-per-capita gap vis-à-vis EU-15 countries, policies should focus on:
increasing labor participation and labor market flexibility; enhancing efficiency in higher
education, R&D, and the public sector; and further improving the business climate.
33.
Following initial efforts to reign in the fiscal deficit last year, the 2011 budget is a
welcome further step towards consolidation of public finances. The largely expenditurebased focus of the consolidation is adequate and, given the high degree of openness of the
Czech economy, should limit the negative impact on growth.
34.
The authorities’ medium-term fiscal targets are appropriate, but to achieve them
additional reforms need to be specified and implemented rapidly. Balancing the budget
by 2016 would reverse the rising trend of public debt. To meet this objective, efforts should
focus primarily on reducing the high level of entitlement spending and rationalizing the
generous welfare state. The pension reform should ensure the long-term sustainability of the
PAYG finances and introduce a second pillar without additional accumulation of debt. A
broad-based consensus will be necessary to ensure full and successful implementation and
durability of these reforms.
35.
The banking sector is stable and well supervised, though possible risks warrant
close monitoring. The Czech banks’ high capital and liquidity buffers, and their domestic
retail business orientation helped them weather the financial crisis well. Nevertheless, risks of
further worsening of credit portfolios and potential contagion from parent banks cannot be
precluded, and require continued close monitoring and cross-border supervisory co-operation.
36.
It is recommended that the Article IV consultations with the Czech Republic
remain on a standard 12-month cycle.

The dynamic credit expansion ended
with the outbreak of the crisis. Credit
growth dropped from a peak of about
25 percent peak in late 2007 to virtually
zero in early 2010, before recovering to
2½ percent in October 2010. Credit to the
private sector has stabilized at about
60 percent of GDP—broadly in line with the
levels in emerging market economies, but
substantially below those of other advanced
economies. The end of the rapid credit
growth entails an underlying vulnerability for
the banking system, as loan quality tends to

The three main foreign players own about a half of banking system assets. These include two institutions
assisted with public funds: Austrian bank Erste, which owns Česká spořitelna (CS), and Belgian bank KBC,
which owns Československá obchodní banka (CSOB). In addition, French bank Société Générale, which did
not require public support during the crisis, owns Komerční Banka (KB).

deteriorate with the maturing of loan vintages during the downturn of credit cycles.
Credit growth diverged across borrowers and products. Credit to households (accounting
for over half of the total stock of credit), remained relatively robust, particularly for
mortgages. Interbank credit was severely curtailed due to rising concerns of counterparty
solvency and effects of financial deleveraging. Credit to non-financial firms also plummeted,
owing to weak loan demand and tightening of credit standards by banks. Bank intermediation
spreads widened at the peak of the crisis but have been slowly normalizing, particularly for
commercial and mortgage lending. The drop in lending rates, however, failed to transmit the
full force of the monetary policy easing.
14

Credit quality continued deteriorating
throughout 2010, albeit at a slowing
pace. Non-performing loans (NPLs)
increased to about 6½ percent of gross
loans by September 2010, and varied
substantially among groups of banks and
credit types. Large and medium-sized
institutions underperformed the industry,
while building societies maintained the
highest credit quality. Across credit types,
unsecured consumer loans and credit to
non-financial firms have higher NPLs at
9 percent (half of it already classified as
loss). In contrast, credit quality of
mortgages (which represent 40 percent of
total credit) has been less sensitive to the
macroeconomic downturn, reflecting
conservative loan-to-value ratios,
moderate levels of household debt, and
relatively resilient house prices.

authorities to implement a gradual withdrawal of liquidity support measures.

36
Banks’ financial soundness indicators are generally robust and compare well with other
countries. Capital adequacy ratios have increased on the back of retained earnings and all
banks display solvency ratios above 10 percent. The quality of capital is also robust, with
Tier 1 components accounting for about 85 percent of banks’ own resources. Liquidity is also
comfortable and structurally sound. Liquid assets account for about ⅓ of bank balance sheets
and cover ¾ of short-term liabilities, while retail deposits fully cover the non-interbank loan
portfolio. In addition, reliance of banks on short-term wholesale funding is low, and the
banking system has a net external credit position vis-à-vis non-residents, including foreign
credit institutions. Despite increasing loan-loss provisions, banks’ profits have remained
positive, helped by one-off gains from securities sales.

Appendix II. Growth Potential of the Czech Economy
Staff’s analysis suggests that in the long run the Czech GDP growth is bound to slow to
at most 2½ percent.1 This estimate is based on the low projected growth of the Czech
population; the forecasted growth rates of trading partners that consume some 80 percent of
Czech output; and the industry structure of the economy and historical growth rates of value
added in these industries in advanced economies.
There is scope for faster growth in the medium term due to more rapid productivity
growth, but that would require implementing a range of structural reforms. Income per
capita and productivity still remain about 1/3 below that of the EU-15 countries. Theory
suggests that productivity growth can be raised by improving human or physical capital and
know-how spillovers associated with FDI inflows. However, data suggest that the scope for
this may be limited as productivity growth in the Czech economy seems to be more closely
linked to the declining share of young workers in the labor force than in neighboring
countries;2 the stock of physical capital is already high compared to other European
countries; and the stock of FDI liabilities seems to have already converged (in fact, from
above) to European levels (Figure A1).

Percent

On the demand side, net exports have provided a significant contribution to growth.
Openness of the Czech economy and its worldwide export share doubled since 1995.
Following accession to the European Union, contribution of net exports to real GDP growth
has been consistently around 1 percent

According to UN projections, the share of workers younger than 34 will decline from 44 percent in 1995 to
36 percent in 2015. However, these pressures are somewhat alleviated by immigration of young people from
countries in Eastern Europe.

39

Whether the strong growth performance of the pre-crisis years can be sustained
remains a question. The existing structure of the Czech exports and industry, based on
manufacturing, is a potential source of weakness. Exports are dominated by industrial
products destined to EU countries. As population in the EU countries ages, their demand for
the Czech goods will slow down and could also shift towards different kinds of products.
Meanwhile, Czech goods already face competition both from advanced and developing
countries.3 Thus, to maintain the contribution of net exports to growth at substantial levels it
will be essential to either expand the range of trading partners or achieve product
diversification of exports, possibly by moving toward higher value-added merchandize or
services.
Current account deficit improved over time owing to strong exports. However, with increasing income
outflows, the GDP-GNI gap has widened.

Despite recent reforms, there is room to improve business climate, which is key to
boosting productivity and attracting FDI. World Economic Forum ranks the Czech
economy as 36th in terms of competitiveness, Transparency International—as 53rd in terms of
perceived corruption, and World Bank—as 63rd in terms of ease of doing business. In the
European Commission’s Innovation Union Scoreboard, the Czech Republic is 17th out of 27.
In order to improve the business environment, the Czech government has singled out several

For example, while between 1999 and 2009, the share of Czech imports in the EU market for machinery and
transport equipment increased by 2.2 percent, second only to China (8.0 percent), the increase between 2007
and 2009 was 0.6 percent, compared to 1.8 percent for China, and 0.7 percent for the U.S. and Poland. In the
other important segment—the EU market for manufacturing goods—the share of Czech imports increased by
just 0.1 percent between 2007 and 2009, less than market gains by China (2.1), U.S. (0.5), Poland, Switzerland
(0.4 each), Japan, Netherlands, Bangladesh (0.3 each), and India (0.2).

key areas that need to be addressed to improve competitiveness. Bottlenecks include
inadequate infrastructure, low effectiveness of the non-bank financial sector, inefficient
public institutions, slow functioning of courts, and the absence of links between R&D and the
needs of the business sector. The government intends to alleviate the administrative burden
on businesses, enhance electronic communications, and reduce excessive dependence on a
few industries (such as machinery and manufacturing) by moving towards higher-valueadded products by fostering innovation and modernization. The government has also
approved an anti-corruption strategy and is developing a comprehensive approach for
improving competitiveness.

Appendix III. Model Simulations of the Impact of Announced Fiscal Consolidation
Staff have applied the Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal Model (GIMF)1 to
analyze the impact of fiscal consolidation on the Czech economy.2 The principal
conclusions of this analysis are as follows:


The impact of the 2 percent of GDP consolidation package contained in the 2011
budget on real GDP level equals 0.7 percent in 2011 and 0.5 percent in 2012
(compared to the baseline of unchanged policies).3 The simulations assume that the
measures pledged in the 2011 budget will remain in place indefinitely, and no new
measures would be introduced, with one minor exception.4 The results are as follows:


Output growth will fall 0.7 percentage point in 2011, and then turn mildly positive
in 2012 (all relative to the baseline; see the top chart of Figure A3). The shock
will also have a mildly deflationary impact, shaving 0.1 percentage point off CPI
inflation.



In the long run, real GDP will be 0.3 percent higher than in the baseline if the
government uses the fiscal room created by lower debt and interest payments to
reduce distortive labor taxes.



The simulations take into account that the policy interest rate is close to the zero
bound and is unlikely to decrease further in 2011 in response to the fiscal
package. However, relaxing that constraint restriction would only increase real
GDP growth by 0.05 percentage point.

The choice of instruments used in the consolidation matters for the impact on GDP
growth. In staff estimates, to reach its medium-term zero deficit fiscal target, the government

GIMF is a micro-founded, multi-country, dynamic general equilibrium model developed at the IMF and used
extensively for policy analysis. A comprehensive overview of the model can be found in IMF Working Paper
10/34, “The Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal Model (GIMF) – Theoretical Structure.”
2

Full results are presented in forthcoming MF Working Paper No. 11/65 “Effects of Fiscal Consolidation in the
Czech Republic” by Vladimir Klyuev and Stephen Snudden.
3

Since the package reverses the increase in the deficit that would take place under unchanged policies, the
change in the cyclically-adjusted primary balance (CAPB) in 2011 is smaller than the size of the adjustment
package (about 1.2 vs. 2.0 percent of GDP). Hence, the impact of an improvement in CAPB relative to 2010
(rather than relative to 2011 projection under unchanged policies) is correspondingly smaller, or about 0.4
percentage points.

government for deficit reduction beyond 2011, applies from 2012 on.

would have to improve the budget balance gradually by 3½ percent of GDP on top of
the 2011 package. The bottom chart of Figure A3 shows the impact on real GDP of fiscal
adjustment of this magnitude achieved through different fiscal instruments under no
constraint on monetary policy. It illustrates that a consolidation achieved by increasing a
consumption tax (for example, by unifying the VAT rates) and cutting government transfers
and government consumption would have a much less contractionary effect in the short run
than a combination of payroll or income tax hikes and cuts in government investment. It
would also have a positive long-term impact on real GDP.

Appendix IV. Pension System Reform Options—Expert Advisory Group Proposal
The Czech pension system consists currently of two pillars—a mandatory, state-run
universal defined-benefit PAYG (first pillar) and a voluntary private subsidized
supplement (third pillar). The PAYG scheme is financed by social security contributions. It
is projected to run deficits on the order of half a percent of GDP over the next decade. Owing
to impending demographic changes, the deficits are expected to surge around 2030 and reach
a new plateau of 4 percent of GDP by 2055. The supplementary scheme enjoys a high
participation rate, but its size in terms of accumulated assets is rather small, with participants
apparently focused on maximizing state contributions more than on building up savings for
retirement.
A 2010 report commissioned by the government and produced by the Expert Advisory
Group (EAG) recommended a package of reforms.1 The two main elements of the
proposal are a set of measures to contain PAYG deficits and an introduction of a
fully-funded, defined-contribution pillar. Under the EAG’s projections, these changes will be
sufficient to bring the PAYG pillar into balance by around 2075, i.e., once the transition is
over. The package also included a partial substitution of VAT for payroll taxes as a source of
PAYG financing.


The second pillar would be relatively small and would aim to supplement rather than
replace PAYG, which would remain the mainstay of the Czech pension system.
Participation in the second pillar would be mandatory for those under 40 at the time
the scheme is launched. It would

PAYG pillar. These changes include unifying retirement ages for men and women
by 2035 and increasing the retirement age by 2 months per year henceforth;2 linking
growth in pension benefits to CPI inflation;3 and abolishing life-long widow or
widower payments for new pensioners.


The EAG also proposed reducing social security contributions from 28 to 23 percent
and unifying the VAT rate at 19 percent. The change was meant to be broadly
revenue-neutral and was aimed at increasing the efficiency of the economy.

2

Recent reforms have set to increase gradually the retirement age for men to 65 and for women to 62-65
depending on the number of children, without specifying further increases.
3

Currently pension benefits are indexed to 2/3 CPI inflation plus 1/3 of nominal wage growth, with the
government having discretion to grant increases above, but not below those suggested by the formula.

Appendix V. Financial Market Development in the CE4 Countries
Financial markets in the CE4 countries are still shallow compared to other advanced EU
countries. While the depth, measured by market capitalization in percent of GDP, is comparable for
the government bond market, that is not the case for private bond, private credit, and equity markets.
Empirical analysis helps identify factors that slow down development of these segments. A staff
working paper1 links the measures of depth of each segment to macroeconomic fundamentals,
institutional characteristics (such as rule of law, control of corruption, etc), and the international
investment position (IIP) variables that help account for external financing.2

The results suggest that the relative shallowness of some of the financial markets cannot be
explained only by macroeconomic variables.3 However, incorporating indicators of institutional
development and external funding eliminates the gap in case of the equity and the private credit
markets, but not in the case of the private bond market, where a significant gap remains even when
accounting for these factors. The analysis also suggests that development of the public bond market
does not stimulate development of other financial markets via establishing a reference yield, but on
the contrary suppresses it via crowding out.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
The currency of the Czech Republic is the Czech koruna, created on
February 8, 1993 upon the dissolution of the currency union with the
Slovak Republic, which had used the Czechoslovak koruna as its currency.
From May 3, 1993 to May 27, 1997, the exchange rate was pegged to a
basket of two currencies: the deutsche mark (65 percent) and the
U.S. dollar (35 percent). On February 28, 1996, the Czech National Bank
widened the exchange rate band from ±0.5 percent to ±7.5 percent around
the central rate. On May 27, 1997, managed floating was introduced. In
the Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions,
the de facto exchange rate regime of the Czech Republic is classified as a

3
free float. Since 2002, the CNB has not engaged in direct interventions in
the foreign exchange market. International reserves have been affected by
the off-market purchases of large privatization receipts and EU transfers
and the sales of the accumulated interest. On January 31, 2011, the
exchange rate of the Czech koruna stood at CZK 17.696 per U.S. dollar.
The Czech Republic has accepted the obligations of Article VIII and
maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions. The Czech
Republic maintains exchange restrictions for security reasons, based on
UN Security Council Resolutions and Council of the European Union
Regulations that have been notified to the Fund for approval under the
procedures set forth in Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51).

APPENDIX II: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. The Czech Republic subscribed to the Special
Data Dissemination Standard in April 1998, and metadata and annual observance reports for
2006-9 are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board.
Data on core surveillance variables are available to the Fund regularly and with minimal lags
(reporting to STA is less current, especially for foreign trade and the national accounts).
Exchange rates and interest rates, set by the Czech National Bank (CNB), are reported daily
with no lag. Gross and net international reserves are reported on a monthly basis with a
one-week lag, as well as on a 10-day basis (with the CNB’s balance sheet) with a one-week
lag. Consumer prices, reserve money, broad money, borrowing and lending interest rates,
central government fiscal accounts, and foreign trade are reported monthly with a lag of
between one and four weeks. Final monetary survey data are available with a lag of about
one month. GDP and balance of payments data are made available on a quarterly basis with a
lag of two to three months. Since 2003, the main components of the balance of payments are
also available monthly. Annual data published in the Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook cover all operations of the general government, including the extrabudgetary funds
excluded from the monthly data. These annual data are available on a timely basis. Monthly
fiscal data published in International Financial Statistics (IFS) cover state budget accounts
and are available with a two- to three-month lag.
While data quality is generally high, some deficiencies remain in certain areas, and the
authorities are taking measures to improve data accuracy.


National accounts data are subject to certain weaknesses. Value added in the
small-scale private sector is likely to be underestimated, as the mechanisms for data
collection on this sector are not yet fully developed and a significant proportion of
unrecorded activity stems from tax evasion. Discrepancies between GDP estimates
based on the production method and the expenditure method are large and are
subsumed under change in stocks. Quarterly estimates of national accounts are
derived from quarterly reports of enterprises and surveys. The estimates are subject to
bias because of nonresponse (while annual reporting of bookkeeping accounts is
mandatory for enterprises, quarterly reporting is not) and lumping of several
expenditure categories in particular quarters by respondents. Large swings in
individual components of spending and the overall GDP from quarter to quarter bring
into question the reliability of the quarterly data and hamper business cycle analysis.



Recently, revisions to procedures for processing export data have brought external
trade statistics close to the practice in the EU. However, a continued weakness of
foreign trade statistics is the unavailability of fixed base price indices for exports and
imports; these indices are currently presented on the basis of the same month of the
previous year.

6


Monetary survey data provided to the European Department are generally adequate
for policy purposes. However, large variations in the interbank clearing account float,
especially at the end of the year, require caution in interpreting monetary
developments. The CNB has made a major effort to identify the causes of these
variations and adjust the data. In 2002, to meet EU statistical conventions, the CNB
implemented the European Central Bank’s (ECB) framework for collecting,
compiling, and reporting monetary data. The data published in IFS are based on
monetary accounts derived from the ECB’s framework. The same set of accounts also
forms the basis for monetary statistics published in the CNB’s bulletins and on the
website, which are thereby effectively harmonized with the monetary statistics
published in IFS, although the presentation in IFS differs somewhat from the CNB’s.



Annual fiscal data on ESA-95 basis has been prepared by the Czech Statistical Office.
Quarterly data for non-financial accounts have also been compiled and quarterly
financial accounts are being prepared. The Ministry of Finance uses the ESA-95
methodology for the Convergence Program targets. The ESA-95 methodology differs
from the national (fiscal targeting methodology) in terms of the coverage of the
institutions (for example, the Czech Consolidation Agency is included in the central
government under ESA definition) and inclusion of financial transactions and other
accrual items (for example, called guarantees). The Ministry of Finance participated
in the Fund’s pilot project to transition to the statistical methodologies outlined in
Government Finance Statistics Manual, 2001.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
Czech Republic
On April 4, 2011 the Executive Board of the IMF concluded the Article IV consultation with the
Czech Republic, and considered and endorsed the staff appraisal without a meeting. 1
Background
The Czech economy has recovered from the downturn owing to its strong fundamentals and the
global recovery. Low public debt, a comfortable external position, absence of pre-crisis asset
bubbles, and a stable financial sector led to a relatively moderate decline in output in 2009 and
a subsequent rebound of domestic demand. Deep economic integration with the euro area
allowed the Czech economy to benefit from the recovery in trading partner countries. Overall
GDP grew by 2.3 percent in 2010. Confidence has improved, spare capacity has been reduced,
and the fall in employment has abated.
The recovery is expected to slow down in line with developments in the euro area. Staff projects
GDP growth of 1.7 percent in 2011, with output reaching its pre-crisis level by year-end. Net
exports and fixed investment are expected to drive growth, while consumption expansion should
be modest given slow improvements in unemployment and fiscal consolidation. Downward risks
in the short-term outlook stem in part from sovereign and banking sector risks in the euro area
periphery spreading to core Europe. In the medium term growth is expected to remain below the

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

pre-crisis levels, reaching around 3 percent beyond 2011, with output gap forecast to close
around 2014.
The 2010 budget delivered a significant fiscal consolidation, largely based on revenue
measures. These measures, interest costs savings, and the improving economy helped reduce
the deficit to an estimated 4.9 percent of GDP in 2010, from 5.8 percent in 2009, and yielded
significant credibility gains. General government debt reached about 40 percent of GDP and
was easily financed, mostly through issuance of domestic bonds.
Despite accommodative monetary policy, inflationary pressures remained subdued until the
recent surge in commodity prices. After temporarily becoming negative in late 2009, headline
CPI inflation largely stayed below the 2 percent target since mid-2010. This increase reflects
growth in regulated prices, indirect tax hikes and lately global commodity prices inflation. But
with large negative output gaps, core inflation remains low. In this environment, the Czech
National Bank (CNB) has maintained policy interest rates at record low levels.
The virtually foreign-owned banking sector has been stable throughout the crisis. Banks’
liquidity is comfortable and structurally sound, and capital adequacy ratios have strengthened
on the back of retained earnings. The main risks stem from possible further worsening of credit
quality under an adverse scenario and potential contagion from foreign parent banks. However,
CNB’s stress tests indicate that the banking system is well prepared to absorb losses of severe
adverse shocks without threatening financial stability.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2010 Article IV consultation with the Czech Republic, Executive Directors
endorsed the staff’s appraisal, as follows:
The Czech Republic has rebounded from the downturn, but faces a number of policy
challenges. Large structural deficits together with demographic trends are creating fiscal
pressures and, under unchanged policies, would imply a rising public debt burden. Climbing
world commodity prices complicate monetary policy in a situation of still nascent recovery and
low core inflation. Sustaining robust productivity and GDP growth will require significant policy
efforts. The authorities have prepared an ambitious policy agenda to tackle the challenges, but
implementation of the necessary reforms may not be easy.
An accommodative monetary policy remains appropriate in the presence of a large negative
output gap and fiscal consolidation. Appreciation of the koruna and the sizeable output gap are
likely to offset the effects of rising commodity prices. Thus a gradual increase in policy interest
rates should commence once the output gap starts closing at a significant pace, though a rise in
inflation expectations or a rapid improvement in labor markets would warrant earlier action.
Interest rate differentials against other advanced economies need to be also taken into

consideration to avoid sharp changes in capital flows, which affect the exchange rate and
inflation in the highly open Czech economy.
Wide-ranging structural reforms are needed to buttress growth. To close the productivity and
income-per-capita gap vis-à-vis EU-15 countries, policies should focus on: increasing labor
participation and labor market flexibility; enhancing efficiency in higher education, research and
development, and the public sector; and further improving the business climate.
Following initial efforts to reign in the fiscal deficit last year, the 2011 budget is a welcome
further step towards consolidation of public finances. The largely expenditure-based focus of the
consolidation is adequate and, given the high degree of openness of the Czech economy, is
expected to have a limited negative impact on growth.
The authorities’ medium-term fiscal targets are appropriate, since balancing the budget by 2016
would reverse the rising trend of public debt. However, to achieve these targets additional
reforms need to be specified and implemented rapidly. Efforts should focus primarily on
reducing the high level of entitlement spending and rationalizing the generous welfare state,
while the pension reform should ensure long-term sustainability of the pay-as-you-go finances
and introduce a second pillar without additional accumulation of debt. A broad-based consensus
will be necessary to ensure full and successful implementation and durability of these reforms.
The banking sector is stable and well supervised, though possible risks warrant close
monitoring. The Czech banks’ high capital and liquidity buffers as well as their domestic retail
business orientation helped them weather the financial crisis well. Nevertheless, risks of further
worsening of credit portfolios and potential contagion from parent banks cannot be precluded,
and require continued close monitoring and cross-border supervisory co-operation.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
Reader to view this pdf file) for the 2011 Article IV Consultation with Czech Republic is also available.
