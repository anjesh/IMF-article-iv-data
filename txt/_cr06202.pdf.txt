I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Following a period of mixed performance, the Swiss economy is now picking up.
An educated labor force and business friendly environment support high per-capita incomes,
skillful monetary management delivers low inflation, and flexible labor markets keep
unemployment subdued. However, a slow pace of structural reforms has kept productivity
growth low among industrial countries, and some sheltered sectors contribute to a high
domestic price level. As a result, Switzerland’s relative economic position declined in the
past 15 years, with growth averaging only 0.9 percent a year and the public debt ratio rising
steadily (Figure 1, Table 1). Nevertheless, the economic cycle is now picking up with strong
global growth, a disciplined policy framework,
and the onset of some reforms.
2.
The main policy challenges are of a
medium-term nature, reflecting moderating
potential growth and fiscal pressures from
aging. Driven by demographics, the
authorities and the staff project potential
output growth to drop below 1 percent a year
in ten years. Without measures, the primary
fiscal deficit could rise to 5 percent of GDP by
2030 (IMF Country Report/05/190),
highlighting the interaction of subdued growth
and higher entitlement costs.

Output growth is projected to decline.

II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
3.
The slowdown that followed the burst of the equity bubble has come to an end.
On the supply side, the financial sector was particularly affected and made a negative
contribution to growth of 1.8 percentage points of GDP (cumulative) during 2001–04.
However, reduced policy interest rates supported a revival in residential construction, the

telecommunications sector benefited from liberalization, and spending on health care
services continued its upward trend. From a demand perspective, the stagnation in 2001–04
was driven by the weakening of external demand and a protracted slowing of equipment
spending. More recently, the economic rebound in 2005 was supported by exports and an
accommodative monetary policy. Private consumption gained pace as unemployment
stabilized, and concerns about the soundness of the second pillar pension system subsided.1
Housing investment benefited from low interest rates and a demand shift to owner-occupied
apartments. In turn, exports were supported by strong external demand and some weakening
of the Swiss franc.2 GDP grew by 1.8 percent in 2005, narrowing the output gap to
-½ percent (Figure 2).

The financial sector accounted for almost half the growth rebound in 2005. It
benefited strongly from the recovery in global equities and expanded funds under
management. The EU Savings Directive went into effect with a 15 percent withholding tax
on interest income, but did not affect significantly savings intermediation (partly because
investors moved to non-interest bearing instruments).

1

The decline in equity prices and interest rates after 2000 negatively affected the funded pension system (see
Section III-E).

2

During 2005, the franc weakened by 1.9 percent in real effective terms (ULC) and 2.7 percent in nominal
effective terms, dropping below its long-term upward trend. The franc declined slightly against the U.S. dollar
and remained stable against the euro (two-thirds of Swiss exports go to Europe).

-7-

5.
Job creation and unemployment responded with some delay. The labor market
normally lags economic activity (generating productivity gains first), but the reaction was
also somewhat tentative relative to earlier recoveries. With enterprises still cautious, parttime jobs expanded faster than full-time employment (Figure 3). Foreign employment from
EU countries expanded, including with the entry of high-skilled workers from Germany. In
early 2006, unemployment (s.a.) eased to 3.5 percent and vacancies increased.

Inflation is low. CPI inflation averaged 1.2 percent in 2005 and early 2006—within
the SNB’s definition of price stability (0–2 percent)—and core inflation was 0.5 percent.
Low inflation has benefited from declining nonoil import prices (including from China and
India); increased competition in domestic goods and services markets (in
telecommunications, and with lower retail prices following the entry of foreign retailers);
higher productivity growth; and moderate wage developments (including with the relaxation
of restrictions on employment of EU workers) (Figure 4). Nominal wages increased by 1.4
percent in 2005 and are projected to rise by 1.6 percent in 2006, at par with labor
productivity growth.
7.
As growth picked up, the SNB
resumed raising interest rates. The
SNB increased the 3-month policy rate to
1 percent and 1.25 percent in December
2005 and March 2006, respectively. Still,
interest rates remained below their
historic averages and short-term rates are
slightly negative in real terms (Figure 5).
Long-term interest rates continued to
decline, flattening the yield curve. The

slight weakening of the franc also eased monetary conditions somewhat. Money and credit
growth remained strong (Figure 6) while equity prices rose to approach their peak of end2000. Real estate prices rose moderately, with the exception of owner-occupied apartments
whose prices rose sharply, driven by demographics and shifts toward smaller families (Figure
7).
8.
The fiscal impulse was neutral in 2005. Disciplined budgetary operations, with
successful implementation of the debt brake, and tax buoyancy lowered the federal
government deficit below budget. Subnational governments also consolidated, benefiting
from stronger than expected growth. A surge in investment income reduced the social
security deficit, but its structural deficit still deteriorated. Overall, the general government
deficit halved to 0.6 percent of GDP but the structural deficit remained unchanged (Tables
2 and 3). General government gross debt eased to 52 percent of GDP (when deducting the
proceeds from the SNB gold sales, 4.6 percent of GDP, it dropped below 50 percent).
Box 1. Fund Recommendations and Implementation
The authorities tend to pursue prudent monetary, fiscal, and financial sector policies that have been well
aligned with Fund advice. They have found it more difficult to implement structural reforms. With the
high standard of living and absence of pressing difficulties, the status-quo bias is strong. Moreover,
political power is diffused across the highly autonomous levels of government and referenda on reforms
are frequent.
The authorities value the Fund surveillance, but also suggested new means to get the message to the
public, such as publishing the Concluding Statement in German and French and, perhaps, preparing an
op-ed article for the main newspapers.
Monetary policy: Focuses on price stability. The Fund has praised the monetary framework for its
design, transparency, and the SNB for it skillful implementation.
Fiscal policy: The Fund has supported the authorities’ efforts to phase out the federal deficit mainly
through expenditure restraint. It has underscored the risks of unfunded future entitlement costs for longterm fiscal sustainability and has encouraged the publication of fiscal sustainability reports. Expenditure
adjustment plans have been enacted and implemented; the authorities are now preparing a long-run fiscal
sustainability report; and are developing innovative proposals to tackle aging costs.
Financial sector: In line with recommendations of the 2002 FSAP, the authorities have enhanced their
surveillance of the financial system and strengthened the supervision and regulation of insurance. A
focused FSAP update is planned for November 2006.
Structural and trade policies: A recurring theme in the consultations has been the need to strengthen
domestic competition through opening up sheltered sectors, dismantling barriers across the internal
market, and further liberalizing network industries and agricultural trade. The government’s 17-point
growth agenda (2004) contains valuable steps, some of which have begun to be implemented, but the
unfinished reform agenda remains large. Progress in liberalizing agricultural trade remains slow.

III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
9.
With the economy rebounding and effective policy frameworks in place, the
discussions focused on three main issues: ensuring fiscal sustainability in the face of
population aging; fiscal federalism; and the effects of structural reform on prices and
growth. The mission also discussed the pace and timing of the withdrawal of monetary
stimulus, the determinants of the large current account surplus and the exchange rate, and the
outlook for and supervision of the financial sector and the occupational pension schemes.
10.
There was substantial agreement on the direction of policies. Staff encouraged faster
structural reforms, especially opportune now that the cycle is clearly strengthening. The
authorities agreed but underscored the need to build political support for reforms to be adopted.
A. Short-Term Outlook
11.
The staff and forecasters expect growth to accelerate to over 2 percent in 2006,
closing the negative output gap. The strength of leading indicators suggests that the growth
momentum will carry into 2006 (Figure 8). Growth is benefiting from continued strong
external demand, still-supportive monetary policy, and stronger business investment
encouraged by high capacity utilization, low corporate bond spreads, and improved balance
sheets. Low oil dependency is limiting the direct adverse effects from elevated oil prices, and
some increased competition in domestic markets is helping to dampen inflation. The staff
projects growth to taper off in 2007 toward potential.

Risks are mostly external. The downside risk with most serious repercussions, but
also uncertain probability, would be a disorderly unwinding of global imbalances. If the U.S.
dollar were to fall sharply, and U.S. interest rates were to spike, Swiss exports would suffer
and global equity markets could drop sharply. With Switzerland being a premier global
wealth manager, this would reverberate significantly into the Swiss financial sector.
Additional risks were geopolitical instability, which could suddenly push up the franc as a

safe-haven currency, and indirect oil price effects if these were to slow global growth. An
avian flu pandemic could also disrupt growth and the authorities were examining personnel
and IT systems contingencies to mitigate its possible effects. On the upside, the global
environment may remain buoyant with imbalances yet unwinding slowly and smoothly.
Success with implementing domestic reforms could lift potential output growth, and further
assist the expansion in the near term.

The authorities intend to
continue to tighten monetary policy at a
measured pace. The authorities noted that
mixed signals about the strength of the
recovery in early 2005, and very low
inflation, had justified the suspension of
monetary tightening that had been started
in mid-2004. By December 2005,
however, the outlook had clearly
brightened whereas real interest rates
remained below neutral levels. To keep
inflation expectations well anchored, the
SNB resumed the gradual normalization of
the monetary policy stance.

15.
The authorities are vigilant about a possible unwinding of global imbalances.
They emphasized that monetary policy would be relaxed appropriately in the event of an
abrupt appreciation of the franc, which could undermine activity and threaten deflation.
16.
The SNB has a transparent and open communication strategy. Market
participants appreciate the quality of information and guidance provided by the SNB through
publications and speeches. There was consensus that good communication is key to avoiding
surprises in financial markets.
17.
The SNB and the mission discussed two specific features of the monetary policy
framework. Staff noted that it would be preferable to decouple the legal link between
housing rents and mortgage rates, which hinders the effectiveness of policy rates in
controlling inflation and could cause interest rate overshooting.3 The authorities concurred,
but noted that because of the extended period of stable interest rates, this link had been
somewhat less distortive recently. Moreover, the SNB and the mission agreed that a
proposed popular initiative (KOSA) to earmark SNB profits above a certain floor to
financing the social security system could compromise the independence of the SNB and its
ability to focus on price stability. The KOSA initiative is scheduled for a vote in September
2006.
C. External Balance and Exchange Rate
18.
The current account surplus is likely to remain high. The main contributor to the
surplus is the 10 percent of GDP earnings on Switzerland’s large net foreign assets (140 percent of GDP) (Figure 9). From a saving-investment perspective, the current account surplus
reflects high gross savings, which in recent years have exceeded 30 percent of GDP, with
gross investment also strong at over 20 percent of GDP. The business sector accounts for
more than half of gross national savings, reflecting favorable corporate income tax rates
combined with a stable political and business environment that has attracted many
multinationals. Given the complexity of multinational business transactions, it is possible
that the statistical recognition of corporate savings in the Swiss accounts is overstated, but on
the basis of preliminary data the authorities could not readily discern a significant bias.4 5 At
9 percent, the household savings rate is not exceptionally high by international standards and
reflects the stage of the lifecycle of the population (high income levels just prior to a wave of

Legislation stipulates that if mortgage rates go up, landlords are entitled to raise rents. Thus, monetary
tightening could perversely raise inflation through the rental markets.

NFI and NFA are based on the residency concept. Several countries with large multinationals have found that
the concept of ultimate beneficiary owner can lead to significantly lower NFI and NFA.

national savings. In terms of net lending to abroad, the household sector together with
occupational pension funds account for the bulk of the current account surplus.

The trend
real appreciation
of the franc has paused, but the SNB saw scope for it to continue without jeopardizing
competitiveness. This is consistent with the staff’s assessment that the Swiss franc is 5–20
percent below its medium-term equilibrium rate, reflecting mostly undervaluation vis-à-vis
the U.S. dollar.6 The authorities do not intervene

Market forward rates signal the expectation that the franc appreciation will resume.

- 13 in the foreign exchange markets, and were not concerned that the gradual trend real effective
appreciation (on average about 0.7 percent a year)7 would undermine economic activity
given that manufacturing is oriented toward price-inelastic, high value-added markets and the
financial sector (wealth management) tends to benefit from a strong franc (Figure 10).
20.
The authorities discussed several reasons why the real exchange rate may have
paused in its long-run trend appreciation:
•

Domestic reforms could temporarily put downward pressure on the real exchange rate
(a reverse Balassa-Samuelson effect). With prices in sheltered sectors exceeding by
30 percent those in neighboring EU countries, liberalizing domestic reforms will spur
productivity gains and lower mark-ups, especially in these sheltered and nontradable
sectors.8 This puts relative downward pressure on nontradables prices and depreciates
the equilibrium real exchange rate.

•

The very low growth since the housing market collapse in the early 1990s brought
with it a long period of weak absorption, also alleviating the real exchange rate.

•

Monetary policy has been supportive of growth with very low interest rates for some
time, generating negative interest rate differentials vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar.

21.
Thus, while there is room for the franc to appreciate, the exchange rate is
reflecting market factors. The strengthening of domestic growth should boost absorption.
The tightening bias toward neutral policy interest rates also should support the franc.
However, if domestic reforms continue, nontradables inflation could remain subdued for
some time and lower the equilibrium real exchange rate.
D. Fiscal Policies
22.
The authorities were confident that they would meet their objective to eliminate
the structural federal deficit by 2007. Two short-run adjustment packages had been put in
place in 2003 and 2004 to meet the objectives of the federal debt brake. These packages aim
at restraining annual expenditure growth to 1.7 percent per year in 2006–09 (almost half the
rate of nominal GDP growth). The debt brake mechanism was working well in focusing
public attention on the need for adjustment and, with the key measures now in place,
automatic stabilizers would be allowed to operate.
23.
Adjustment in cantons and communes was more moderate. Moreover, after some
consolidation, subnational governments were facing increasing pressures for spending in
education and healthcare. At the time of the mission there was uncertainty to which extent

Switzerland’s excellent inflation performance, despite very low policy interest rates and oil shocks, is
consistent with these beneficial effects beginning to take hold.

- 14 cantons would use the proceeds from gold sales to retire debt.9 Officials noted that 18 out of
26 cantons had announced tax cuts (especially for high income persons; also, some cantons
have no debt). They underscored, however, that most cantons and communes had fiscal rules
and tended to pursue prudent fiscal policies.
24.
Regarding tax competition between the cantons in Switzerland’s highly devolved
federalism, the authorities were not concerned that it would degenerate into a race to the
bottom because: (i) the new financial equalization scheme discouraged “predatory” tax cuts
by linking equalization transfers to a standardized tax base (thus local tax cuts might lead to
smaller revenue transfers) (ii) the attempts at “competitive” tax cuts were limited to very
small cantons with minimal spillovers to large ones and, (iii) should tax competition reach
harmful levels, public pressure for harmonization would increase and thus undermine the
cantons closely guarded independence. Indeed, rather than fearing tax competition, the
authorities felt that in combination with direct democracy, where tax increases are often
subject to referendum (mandatory for federal tax increases), some horizontal tax competition
had helped to contain the size of government and limited the spending bias associated with the
common pool problem (Box 2).

...Switzerland remains a low tax country.

In 2005, the SNB transferred the proceeds from gold sales to the federal government (⅓) and cantons (⅔). The
federation will use its share to bolster the old age pension fund. Most cantons would lower debt, but some were
considering, or had already implemented, tax reductions.

- 15 Box 2. Fiscal Federalism in Switzerland
Switzerland has one of the most decentralized government systems in the world, alongside Canada
and the US. 1/ As cantons can freely raise own revenues, horizontal competition is intense, fostering
accountability. Together with direct democracy, these arrangements tie the size of government to
citizen’s demand for public goods and services rather than to policy makers eagerness to spend, resulting
in a relatively small government sector and low taxes.
Strongly devolved federalism raises policy coordination issues. First, gearing ex-ante fiscal policy
towards macroeconomic objectives is challenging, with a greater risk of procyclical policies and
difficulties to internalize intertemporal pressures. Second, horizontal tax competition may weaken the
government’s ability to meet citizen’s demands. Third, extended devolution may limit economies of
scale.
Empirical evidence confirms that the fiscal stance of the general government has been procyclical,
reflecting mainly subfederal policies. The policy response to rising public debt in the 1990s has been
slow, with the burden of adjustment falling mostly on the federation. However, tax competition is
unlikely to reach harmful levels as net equalization transfers respond negatively to competitive tax cuts.
Also, the mere threat of harmonization discourages cantons to overplay competitive tax reforms.
Fiscal federalism arrangements matter for the policy response to aging. The current system is more
effective at preventing new spending programs than containing pressures from existing ones. In
particular, frictions between the confederation and the cantons on sharing the cost of adjustment for
aging may delay reforms. The federation, currently seen (although legally it is not) as the financier of last
resort for social security, is exposed to the bulk of spending pressures at unchanged policies, which may
encourage free riding by subnational governments.
With limited scope for ex-ante coordination, promoting greater transparency on intertemporal
challenges is essential. The authorities are working on a Long-Term Fiscal Sustainability report, and are
considering extending debt-brake type fiscal rules to entitlement programs. The strong transparency and
discipline imposed by such far-reaching innovations could contain free riding problems.

might not be robust to
structural pressures from aging. The authorities felt that the federation was approaching its
limits of budgetary flexibility with current discretionary expenditure having been reduced
considerably, while tax increases would be subject to mandatory referendum. Thus, given the
mounting pressures from social security and with a view to preserving the credibility of the
debt brake, the authorities agreed that structural fiscal reforms would be needed—and,
indeed, were being prepared. They had already launched a comprehensive review of federal
tasks and subsidies (reports would be prepared by year end).

Under current policies, aging would raise public debt to unsustainable levels.

26.
To place the social programs on a sounder long-run footing, the authorities were
considering several measures, some of which would be far-reaching and require careful
discussion with the public:
•

Disability insurance. More timely intervention for, and faster reintegration of
disabled workers, and slightly higher payroll taxes. The authorities also envision a
0.8 percentage point increase in the VAT, earmarked for the disability fund.

•

Health care. In consultation with cantons, the excess supply of clinics would need to
be reduced. Hospital efficiency would be improved through benchmarking and
applying performance pay. And there would be increased freedom to contract health
and insurance providers, thus leveraging competition. Raising copayments was also
under consideration.

•

First pillar pensions. The authorities intend to raise the female retirement age from
64 to 65 (planned for 2009), seek to extend the working life of older workers, and
would consider reducing indexation for pensions, subject to safeguards for the needy.

•

Civil service pensions. The authorities plan to split the civil service pension fund in
two: one for retirees, with grandfathering of current provisions; and another for
current employees who will be transferred to a defined contribution scheme, without
grandfathering.10

27.
The authorities agreed that dealing successfully with aging would require that
these proposals be placed in a long-run comprehensive policy framework and be
coordinated across levels of government. Therefore, they were preparing the Long-Run
Fiscal Sustainability Report, which could bring out policy options and their separate impact
on the confederation, cantons, communes, and the social security funds. The mission
recommended that the Report include a preliminary public sector balance sheet that
incorporates an estimate of the net present value of projected future deficits under current
policies (Box 3). This could help assess what public assets are vital for the functioning of the
state, and provide indications of the need for fiscal structural reforms.

10

While details are still being worked out, switching to a defined contribution scheme would limit the
contingent government liabilities related to uncertain returns on assets and longevity.

- 18 -

Box 3. Preliminary Public Sector Balance Sheet 1/
A comprehensive public sector balance sheet provides useful information on the health of
public finances. The balance sheet should include all assets and liabilities of the general
government and the present value of the future stream of fiscal balances that is expected to be
generated under current policies.
Preliminary calculations for Switzerland suggest an intertemporal imbalance. The Swiss
public sector owns substantial assets that more than offset the 2004 accumulated net financial
liabilities. However, the present value of unfunded liabilities over the next fifty years is
estimated at 153 percent of GDP. 2/ Taken together, this suggests a negative intertemporal net
worth of 103 percent of GDP.

This number is indicative of the challenge faced by the debt brake and fiscal rules at the lower level
governments. The authorities acknowledge that the debt brake by itself, without structural fiscal reforms,
would not be robust to this pressure.

E. Financial Sector Developments
28.
The authorities noted that the
banking sector was robust, adequately
capitalized, profitable, liquid and
dynamic. They saw Switzerland as
retaining a strongly competitive banking
sector with high-quality and innovative
institutions, good supervision and legal
infrastructure, and excellent
macroeconomic stability. At the same time,
they noted that wealth management by
Swiss institutions was expanding rapidly in
Asia, where demand was most dynamic.
Financial soundness indicators were at
comfortable levels and banks’ equity prices
were strong (Tables 5–8, Figure 11). Bank
profits rose in 2005, benefiting from an
expansion of asset management and trading
activities, lower provisioning, and
restructuring. At the same time, intensifying
competition had put some pressure on interest
rate margins. Low interest rates continued to
stimulate mortgage lending but stress tests
suggested limited vulnerability of households
thanks to moderate levels of loan-to-value and
debt-service ratios.

Swiss banks are comfortably capitalized and ...

Risks in the banking sector appeared well contained and supervisors remained
vigilant. Stress tests conducted by the SNB indicated that for the banking sector as a whole,
an extreme scenario of recession combined with a collapse in equity prices and a rise in
interest rates would reduce the sector’s excess capital without breaching the regulatory
minimum. Lending standards, interest rate and credit risks, and risk transfers, need to be
monitored carefully now that banks are emerging from a long period of low interest rates.
Also, the large international banks would be vulnerable to an abrupt unwinding of global
imbalances. The mission welcomed progress made by the authorities in assessing systemic
risks and recommended that the assessments include stress tests by the large banks using
scenarios specified by the SNB in collaboration with the supervisory office (EBK).

- 20 -

30.
The health of the insurance sector has improved. Balance sheets benefited from
rising equity prices, improved risk management, higher premia, and restructuring. However,
supervisors noted that reserve deficiencies remained in life insurance, and the distribution of
risk management expertise was uneven in the sector. In reinsurance, profitability was
reduced by the natural disasters in the United States but capital remained adequate.
31.
Banking and insurance supervision are being strengthened. Officials confirmed
their intention to make operational in 2008 the integrated Financial Market Supervisory
Authority (FINMA), which brings under one roof the supervision of banking, insurance,
securities, and anti-money laundering. Moreover, cross-border supervisory cooperation and
crisis management capabilities were being strengthened through bilateral memoranda of
understanding with foreign supervisors. Supervisors had started to monitor banks’ exposure
to hedge funds (still limited) and developments in domestic and international credit risk
transfer. The implementation of Basel II was scheduled for January 2007. For insurance, the
authorities are on track to introduce in 2008 the Swiss Solvency Test, an advanced risk-based
regulatory framework similar to the EU’s Solvency II.11

the solvency of the system required moving
away from administratively set parameters that generally do not reflect changing market and
demographic conditions. In addition to the technical discount rate, these include the
guaranteed rate of return, and the conversion rate (determining benefits at retirement) that
does not seem to reflect its actuarially fair value. In this context, the authorities were
considering whether the recently approved gradual reduction of the conversion rate from
7.2 to 6.8 percent was sufficient, given increasing life expectancy and the decline in longterm interest rates.
33.
The authorities welcomed the opportunity to discuss best practices for
supervision of occupational pension funds in the FSAP follow-up scheduled for
November 2006. In this context, the mission encouraged the authorities to review options to

relax restrictions on asset allocation (to improve portfolio performance and risk
management), and to strengthen the regulatory and supervisory framework. Supervision of
pension funds has traditionally been conducted by the cantons, which has led to
fragmentation, and some lack sufficient expertise and resources. The mission welcomed
plans to harmonize supervision across cantons but considered that a centralized regulatory
and supervisory system oriented toward risk-based regulation and supervision might be more
appropriate for a small country like Switzerland.12 The mission also noted that different
regulations between second pillar funds and life insurance funds created distortions.
F. Structural Issues
34.
The authorities agreed that structural reforms remain essential to improving
growth performance (Figure 12). Growth regressions indicate that market-based reforms
aimed at reducing mark-ups could boost annual productivity growth, especially in retailing,
health, agriculture, and network industries. Benefits would also accrue from reducing
regulations and red tape, and substantial market opening in agriculture.
35.

Some valuable progress is underway:

•

Parliament approved a Revised Internal Market Law, which reduces the ability of
cantons to impede cross-border supply of services.

•

Parliament is also advancing toward the liberalization of the electricity market,
with a two-stage opening of the electricity market in 2007 for commercial consumers
and in 2012 for the rest. However, some interlocutors still voiced regulatory
concerns.

•

The authorities have suspended Swisscom’s “last mile” monopoly, which has kept
fixed-line network access fees too high.

36.
In addition, the authorities are launching three new reform initiatives; all
strongly supported by the mission:
•

Privatizing Swisscom shares. The authorities are working on modalities to make this
acceptable under the high likelihood that it will have to pass a referendum.

•

Adopting the “Cassis-de-Dijon principle.” Products (including packaging and
labeling) approved in the EU would automatically be recognized in Switzerland. This
would help lower nontariff barriers and strengthen retail competition.

12

The accompanying Selected Issues paper “A Comparison of the Swiss, Dutch, and U.K. Pension Systems,
with Emphasis on the Occupational Pension Pillars” describes cross-country experiences and reforms in the
aftermath of the equity bubble. These comparator countries have centralized supervision for banking, insurance,
and pension funds, which helps to identify overlapping vulnerabilities and reduce regulatory distortions.

- 22 -

•

Reducing red tape and simplifying regulations, to lower transaction costs in the
economy.

37.
The authorities agreed that the unfinished agenda remained large (Figure 13)
and stressed the need to garner public support. They were pleased by the outcome of
recent referenda (including on the extension of shopping hours), and by the entry of two
large foreign retailers which had sharply intensified competition with visible effects on
prices. It was also clear that consumers were becoming more assertive to seek lower prices,
linked by some interlocutors to aging and more citizens shifting to fixed incomes.
38.
One of Switzerland’s strengths is its flexible labor market. Opening up to the EU-15
was alleviating shortages of skilled labor without evidence that it had raised unemployment.
The extension of the free movement of labor to the EU-10 members, which was accepted in a
referendum last year, would bring further flexibility. The authorities noted their aspiration to
raising further the already high participation rate (Figure 14) by (i) paring existing incentives
for early retirement, tightening the conditions for disability insurance and improving the
modalities of post-retirement employment and, (ii) constructing more daycare centers to raise
female participation. Given the importance of human capital for growth, staff welcomed plans
to raise participation in tertiary education and enhance continuous education.

will liberalize trade in several

protection would drop even to the high levels in the EU. Officials emphasized the importance
of agriculture for Swiss society but noted that new liberalizing reforms were being prepared
for beyond 2007, when the current program expires.

- 23 -

G. Other Issues
40.
Ties with the EU have deepened through bilateral agreements. A first package,
including the free movement of labor, took effect in June 2002 and was extended to the new
EU member states following a referendum in September 2005. A second package—including
the EU savings directive—was signed in October 2004 and associate Schengen membership
was approved in a referendum in June 2005. The Swiss government plans to present in 2006
a report on strategic medium-term options with the EU. However, the electorate remains very
divided over full EU membership.
41.
Officials expressed guarded optimism about the outcome of the Doha round.
They felt that the eventual outcome now depended largely on a compromise that is needed
between the largest players. Meanwhile, the authorities were exploring the possibility of
bilateral free-trade agreements with several countries, including the U.S., Japan and Canada.
42.
Switzerland provides official
development assistance at 0.4 percent
of GNI. Swiss ODA has been praised by
DAC for its high level of effectiveness
and strong focus on poor countries.
Switzerland has also reduced duties on
agricultural imports from LDCs and
supports the Multilateral Debt Relief
Initiative.

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL

45.
Growth prospects for 2006 are favorable and risks appear contained. The
economy emerged from 2005 with momentum and is expected to grow over 2 percent—
thereby closing the output gap in 2006. Although the gradual recovery in the euro area
provides a favorable backdrop for Switzerland, there are some risks—most notably if a
disorderly unwinding of global imbalances were to occur. Headline inflation is projected to
remain slightly over 1 percent, despite the rise in oil costs and sustained supportive monetary
conditions, thanks also to slowly improving competition in domestic markets.

- 24 -

46.
The recovery provides an important opportunity to advance structural reforms
to boost long-run potential growth. Despite welcome progress, the reform agenda remains
large. The adoption of the “Cassis de Dijon” principle on a broad basis would improve
competitiveness and significantly benefit consumers. Farming could be supported by less
distortive instruments than quotas and steep import tariffs that keep food prices high.
Reforms in network industries should be accelerated and their regulatory framework
strengthened.
47.
The key task of the Swiss National Bank is to assure that inflation expectations
remain firmly anchored. Therefore, monetary policy needs to move gradually to a neutral
stance as the output gap is closing. The appropriate pace of monetary tightening needs to be
gauged carefully against key economic indicators, while allowing benefits from reforms and
increased productivity, as they occur, to lift growth. This should not undermine the
expansion. The SNB needs to remain flexible, as in recent years, with willingness to act
promptly and decisively, in symmetrical fashion, if signs emerge of price pressures, or if
exchange rate volatility disturbs monetary conditions (e.g. a safe-haven shock to the franc).
48.
The monetary policy framework is functioning well. Its institutional underpinnings
could be further strengthened by severing the link between rents and interest rates. Linking
social security funding to SNB profits should be avoided.
49.
The franc exchange rate is determined by market forces and is now below its
long-run level marked by gradual appreciation. Faster growth and the normalization of
policy interest rates are expected to strengthen the franc, while success with domestic
reforms could depreciate somewhat the equilibrium real exchange rate, at least for a
transition period. Competitiveness is strong and the gradual appreciation is expected to
resume over the medium term.
50.
Fiscal performance improved in 2005, and should consolidate further in 2006.
The fiscal impulse was neutral, with monetary policy largely on hold—this policy mix was
appropriate. Building on the success of the debt brake mechanism, and recent adjustment
packages, the federal accounts should be in structural balance by 2007. Gradual
consolidation should also continue in the subnational governments.
51.
Fiscal challenges are of a medium-term nature, related to the combined effects
of moderating potential growth and expenditure pressures from aging. The federal debt
brake mechanism is working well, but is best equipped to deal with cyclical pressures and
does not appear sufficiently robust to withstand structural fiscal pressures. The authorities are
appropriately framing a set of potentially far-reaching and innovative structural fiscal
reforms to begin containing the deficits in social programs. Reaching consensus on such bold
structural fiscal reforms is not easy, however, and will require effective coordination with
cantons and communities in Switzerland’s highly autonomous—and successful—federalism,
and extensive discussion with the public.

- 25 -

52.
The authorities’ commitment to preparing a Long-Run Fiscal Sustainability
Report is welcome and could help to forge the needed consensus. A Sustainability Report
that clearly sets out a baseline scenario showing the extent of the task, and presents policy
options and a tentative time table for their implementation can be very valuable in this
respect.
53.
The Fiscal Sustainability Report could usefully include a preliminary
intertemporal public sector balance sheet. Containing an estimate of the net present value
of future implicit liabilities under the welfare state, the balance sheet would help to
communicate the need for action, allow an assessment of what assets are vital for the
functioning of the state, and provide information on the long-run benefits from real and fiscal
structural reforms.
54.
The financial sector appears healthy and well placed to support growth.
Profitability and balance sheets are favorable, and the system is effectively supervised and
regulated. Though global imbalances pose risks, especially for internationally active
institutions, their defenses are strong. Domestically, supervisors should continue to monitor
closely lending standards, interest rate and credit risks, and risk transfers as interest rates
begin to rise. The introduction of the Swiss Solvency Test should bring significant benefits to
insurance, and the activation of integrated supervision (FINMA) should strengthen cohesion
and effectiveness of supervision and regulation.
55.
The financial position of the second pillar pension schemes has improved, but
underfunding remains. It would be important to remove the various regulatory restrictions
including on the discount rate, the guaranteed rate of return, and the conversion rate on the
liabilities side; and constraints on asset allocation that could weaken returns and risk
management capabilities. In supervision, consideration should be given to unifying the
regulatory and supervisory frameworks across cantons, introduce risk-based supervision, and
strengthen disclosure requirements.
56.
Economic policy could benefit from more timely statistics. Fiscal data for
subnational governments have long delays, making monitoring difficult.
57.
Switzerland’s comparatively high level of ODA is welcome. Poor countries could
also benefit from additional efforts to reduce agricultural protection.
58.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Switzerland be held on
the standard twelve-month cycle.

APPENDIX II

Switzerland: Statistical Issues
Switzerland generally publishes timely economic statistics and posts most of the data and the
underlying documentation on the internet. Switzerland is in full compliance with the Fund’s
Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and its metadata are currently posted on the
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. However, a number of statistical gaps and
deficiencies remain, mainly reflecting a lack of resources and the limited authority of the
Federal Statistical Office (BfS) to request information:
•

the SNB does not compile a monetary survey;

•

reliable general government finance statistics appear with considerable lags, mainly due
to delays in compiling fiscal accounts at the level of cantons and communes;

•

internationally comparable fiscal statistics on an accrual basis are not available;

•

pension statistics are published with a long lag;

•

GDP by industry appears with a considerable lag;

To address statistical deficiencies, the authorities have recently taken or intend to take the
following steps:
The SNB launched in 2004 a quarterly survey on the cost of borrowing and completed the
pilot phase in June 2005. From July 2006, the SNB plans to conduct the survey on a monthly
basis. In September 2005, the SNB started compiling more comprehensive statistics on
mutual funds. In October 2005, the SNB published, in collaboration with the Federal
Statistical Office, annual financial accounts for 1999–2003 (stock data). Data on financial
flows and non-financial assets will be published in 2007.
Annual national accounts were upgraded in 2003 to the European System of Accounts 1995
(ESA95) and with the release of the Q4 2004 data, the Secretariat for Economics (SECO)
revised accordingly its quarterly national account estimates. SECO started publishing in
March 2006 a quarterly production account. The main innovations in the new national
accounts were in investment (with detail on information and communications technology),
private and public consumption (hospitals were transferred to the private sector), and the use
of chain price indices (without adjustment for quality).
In 2004, a statistical cooperation agreement was concluded with the EU as part of
Bilateral II for the harmonization of several Swiss statistics with EU standards.
The Federal Finance Administration has started preparations for revamping fiscal statistics
with the adoption of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001, the reform of the
accounting standards for cantons and communes (Weiterentwicklung der Rechnungslegung

- 50 -

APPENDIX II

der Kantone und Gemeinden) and the introduction of full accrual budgeting and accounting
at the level of the federal government (Neues Rechnungsmodell Bund) along the lines of the
International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). Figures according to the new
accounting standards are expected in 2009. In the interim, government finance statistics for
publication in the GFS Yearbook will be reported on a cash basis but presented in the GFSM
2001 framework.
Quarterly balance of payments and international investment position data are compiled
by the SNB and meet international standards. However, monetary gold transactions relating
to sales of gold reserves not required for monetary policy purposes have not been correctly
reflected in the balance of payments. Also, there are inconsistencies between the reserves
template and the reserves data in the international investment position in connection with
balances arising from the distribution to the confederation and cantons during 2005 of the
proceeds from gold sales.
Adoption by the authorities of the Standardized Report Forms for reporting monetary data
to STA will enhance the analytical usefulness of the data. The data on deposit money banks
currently submitted by the SNB to STA for publication in International Financial Statistics
(IFS) lack adequate sectorization and instrument breakdown. The SNB expects to report
more detailed data in the second half of 2006.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation
with Switzerland
On June, 2, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Switzerland.1
Background
After a period of mixed performance, the Swiss economy is showing some spark. Supported by a
favorable external environment and accommodative monetary policy, the economy recovered in
2005, with the financial sector accounting for almost half of the rebound. Unemployment, has
started to recede. Despite rising oil prices, inflation remains under control and the current account
is running a large surplus.
As the recovery gained traction, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) resumed raising its policy interest
rate. Nonetheless, monetary conditions remain supportive as short-term interest rates are still
slightly negative and the effective exchange rate has weakened somewhat. The general
government deficit was halved in 2005 to 0.6 percent of GDP but the structural deficit remained
unchanged owing to the deterioration of the underlying position of social security. The federal
government is on track to eliminate its small structural deficit by 2007.
The staff projects growth to accelerate in 2006 to over 2 percent, closing the negative output gap,
and consumer price inflation to remain just above 1 percent. The risks to the short-term outlook
are mostly external and appear balanced, assuming Switzerland is able to make additional
progress on structural reform.
Executive Board Assessment
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities.

-2Switzerland’s economy continues to gain momentum with low inflation and increasing
employment. Directors commended the Swiss authorities for their prudent macroeconomic
management, sound monetary and fiscal policy frameworks, and flexible labor markets, and
welcomed continued efforts to advance structural reforms. While potentially exposed to a
disorderly unwinding of global imbalances, short-term risks facing Switzerland generally appear
contained. Directors noted that the main medium-term policy challenges are to strengthen
potential economic growth while addressing the fiscal pressures from an aging population.
Directors noted that the current recovery presents an important opportunity for Switzerland to
advance with ambitious economic reforms in order to boost potential growth. In this regard, they
welcomed the efforts at reforming and further opening up the domestic product markets and
network industries. At the same time, Directors underlined the importance of moving forward
decisively with further liberalization of sheltered sectors, including by reducing red tape and state
regulations, lowering nontariff barriers to trade, and reducing the very high levels of protection
and subsidization in the agriculture sector.
Directors supported the authorities’ intention to eliminate the structural federal deficit by 2007.
Noting the strains likely to be put on the public finances by population aging, Directors strongly
supported the authorities’ launching of structural fiscal reforms to place social programs on a
sound long-term footing. In this context, a number of Directors were disappointed that several
cantons preferred to use their share of the proceeds of the gold sale to lower taxes.
They welcomed the authorities’ commitment to prepare a Long-Run Fiscal Sustainability Report,
which should bolster public understanding of the issues involved, and help forge the needed
consensus for reform, including at the subnational levels.
Directors noted that the monetary policy framework continues to serve Switzerland well,
underpinned by effective communication practices of the Swiss National Bank (SNB). Directors
supported the SNB’s move to tighten monetary policy gradually to a neutral stance, while closely
monitoring the pace of tightening against evolving economic conditions. They noted in particular
that the SNB should stand ready to act promptly and decisively if signs of price pressure emerge
or in the event of disruptive exchange rate volatility. Directors welcomed the authorities’ policy of
non-intervention in the foreign exchange markets, in keeping with the Swiss franc’s freely floating
regime.
Directors noted that the Swiss financial system appears to be healthy and dynamic.
They welcomed the strengthening of the regulatory and supervisory framework, and the
authorities’ appropriate vigilance in monitoring financial sector risks. Nevertheless, Directors
noted that there remains room for improving pension industry regulations, and urged the
authorities to consider a unified regulatory and supervisory system, to introduce risk-based
supervision, and to improve disclosure standards.

Statement by Thomas Moser, Executive Director for Switzerland
June 2, 2006
1.
On behalf of my Swiss authorities, I would like to thank the staff for the very
constructive policy discussions and the concise staff report. The report gives an accurate
account of the economic situation in Switzerland and the main policy challenges. My
authorities largely agree with the staff’s appraisal and welcome the policy recommendations.
They also particularly appreciated the selected issues paper, which provides a valuable
contribution to the on-going discussions within Switzerland on fiscal federalism, government
finances and pension scheme reform.
2.
Over the last two years, the performance of the Swiss economy has exceeded
expectations and the expansion is set to continue at a favorable pace. In the fourth quarter of
2005, GDP increased by 2.7 percent on a year-to-year basis, bringing GDP growth to roughly
2 percent for the year as a whole. Economic growth is broadly based. While the external
environment continued to stimulate export growth in 2005, domestic demand has
strengthened. Investment growth, which has been relatively slow in view of favorable
financing conditions and positive developments in earnings, has gained momentum towards
the end of 2005. More remarkable, however, was the relatively strong rebound of private
consumption in 2005, given that it took place without a strong recovery in the labor market.
3.
The reaction of the labor market to the recovery has been weaker than in earlier
cycles. However, several indicators suggest an ongoing upturn in employment since the end
of 2005. In the first quarter of 2006, employment expanded considerably and companies’
hiring intentions improved further. Unemployment, seasonally adjusted, has further eased to
3.4 percent in April and consumer sentiment has improved markedly at the beginning of
2006.
Monetary policy
4.
The Swiss National Bank (SNB) shares staff’s analysis of monetary conditions and
monetary policy in Switzerland. After a pause in the normalization of the monetary policy
stance due to very low inflation and uncertainty about the strength of the recovery in early
2005, the SNB resumed its gradual monetary tightening in December 2005, by increasing the
three-month LIBOR for Swiss francs to 1 percent. In March 2006, the SNB took a further
step and increased the rate to 1.25 percent, a level at which monetary policy is still
expansionary. The most recently published inflation forecast confirms that 1.25 percent does
not represent a steady-state equilibrium level for the three-month Libor. At this juncture –
characterized by the closing of the output gap – and considering the very long transmission
lag of monetary policy in Switzerland and the risks of keeping interest rates low for too long,
it is important – in order to anchor inflation expectations – that the SNB signals that it has a

2
tightening bias. The pace of future tightening will be assessed in the light of new inflation
forecasts and the evolution of key economic indicators.
5.
The SNB welcomes staff’s appraisal that the monetary policy framework is well
designed, transparent and effective. It also appreciates staff’s assessment that its
communication strategy has worked well. The SNB fully shares staff’s recommendation that
the legal link between housing rents and mortgage rates should be lifted. Moreover, the SNB
strongly concurs with the staff’s assessment that the KOSA popular initiative, which
proposes to earmark SNB profits above one billion Swiss francs for financing the social
security system, could compromise central bank independence and the SNB’s ability to focus
on price stability.
Fiscal policy
6.
As noted in the staff report, fiscal developments have been quite positive. My
authorities are pleased with the over-performance at the federal level in 2005, which resulted
in an essentially balanced outcome compared with a projected deficit of 0.4 percent of GDP.
This result stems mainly from lower-than-projected expenditures. Overall, expenditure
growth has been effectively curbed by both a consistent implementation of the debt brake and
the two expenditure reduction programs mentioned in the report. Achieving structural
balance at the federal level is now within reach.
7.
Staff is right to once again stress the medium and long term challenges posed by
rising social security and health spending. The Swiss authorities are well aware of these
challenges and have, therefore, taken important steps to tackle the mounting pressures. The
Federal Council has launched an ambitious project aimed at systematically reviewing the full
range of tasks of the central government. Based on a classification of these tasks into 40
categories, decisions will be taken regarding the areas in which government activity can be
reduced or even eliminated. This will increase the possibilities to act on new challenges and
set the stage for a growth-oriented economic policy.
8.
In the context of this review of central government tasks, the Federal Council recently
adopted the objective to contain the overall growth of federal budget spending until 2015 at
the level of nominal GDP growth. Given the spending pressures stemming from social areas,
this will require ambitious reforms and a substantial trimming-down of existing central
government activities. Looking forward, the time line envisages the completion of an action
plan by end-2006, at which time it should be ready for discussion with cantons and other
stakeholders.
9.
With the new financial equalization framework (NFA) in its final stage of
preparation, issues relating to fiscal federalism are being debated more actively than usual.
My authorities are thus grateful that staff took up their request to assess in detail the

3
macroeconomic aspects of Swiss fiscal federalism. Overall, the analysis highlights some of
the key advantages of highly devolved federalism, such as containing the size of the public
sector. But the staff rightly highlights the challenges that such a system offers in terms of
coordination failures. Cantons can and actually do overcome at least part of these problems
by intercantonal co-operation and cost compensation. Furthermore, the NFA encourages
enhanced horizontal coordination. In this respect, the federal Parliament will, in a sense, play
the role of an arbitrator, because it may force cantons to co-operate under certain conditions.
The respective constitutional amendment covers, amongst other things, high school and
university education.
10.
A further step toward harmonization was taken with the popular vote on
May 21, 2006. The proposed constitutional amendments that will enhance vertical cooperation between the Confederation and the cantons in education were accepted by a large
majority.
11.
The selected issues paper further outlines a very preliminary draft of a public sector
balance sheet for Switzerland. As it includes a forward-looking component, the analysis takes
into account future effects of population aging on public finances. The balance sheet view is
a useful complement to the usual budgetary flow presentation. The results, while useful,
ought to be interpreted with caution, however. Data on the public sector capital stock is
hardly more than an educated guess. Furthermore, estimates of the intertemporal financial
position are sensitive to underlying assumptions. As noted in footnote 39 of the selected
issues paper, it would have been interesting to see how the staff’s estimate reacts to
alternative assumptions on key variables. Nonetheless, the analysis is a useful input to the
challenging task of elaborating a comprehensive picture of long-term fiscal developments in
Switzerland.
12.
The Federal Finance Administration is currently preparing a sustainability report
which includes all three levels of government as well as social security programs, specifically
old-age pensions (the first pillar), disability insurance, and means-tested health-insurance
support. The main result of this exercise will be to show the effects of aging on public
finances under a no-policy-change assumption over a time horizon of 50 years. As long-term
projections are highly uncertain, a sensitivity analysis for key parameters such as interest
rates, productivity growth and demographic variables will be carried out. This will constitute
a crucial element of the report, which should thus provide a comprehensive picture of future
fiscal developments.
Financial sector
13.
Regarding the financial sector, my authorities fully agree with the staff’s findings and
they share the assessment that risks in the banking sector are low. On the strengthening of
cross-border cooperation among supervisors, the amendment of the provision on

4
administrative assistance in stock exchange matters will likely improve matters substantially.
The amendment, which entered into force on February 1, 2006, facilitates and accelerates the
administrative assistance for regulatory purposes in line with international minimum
standards.
14.
My authorities very much welcomed the comparison of the occupational (funded)
pension pillars of the Netherlands, the UK and Switzerland. As in every country, the Swiss
pension system is characterized by a variety of specific goals and parameters that determine
its performance. The Swiss authorities agree that further reforms in the second pillar, and
especially a strengthening of its supervision, are needed. In this respect, options for
addressing the main identified weaknesses have already been put forward. They are
contained in a report by an expert commission published in March, on which the
government’s forthcoming proposals will be based. The reforms under way aim for a uniform
application of revised and stricter supervisory rules across cantons.
15.
The Swiss authorities are looking forward to discussing these issues in greater depth
in the context of the FSAP update to be undertaken later this year.
Structural issues
16.
The staff report presents accurately the authorities’ structural reform efforts.
Increasing productivity growth in the domestic sector is indeed the most important structural
issue. Reforms are needed in health and network industries, agriculture, public services,
mandatory pension schemes, the education sector, and the real estate and construction
sectors. Reform efforts are being undertaken in several of these areas. The authorities are
currently also undertaking a number of reforms to further improve the business-friendly
environment in Switzerland, ranging from corporate governance to corporate taxes.
