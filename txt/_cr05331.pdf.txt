Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives
for the 2005 Consultation with Australia
Approved by David T. Coe and Carlo Cottarelli
August 24, 2005

•

The 2005 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Sydney, Melbourne, and
Canberra during June 8–17, 2005.

•

The staff team consisted of Messrs. Coe (Head), Beaumont, Mercereau, Ms. Cui, (all
APD), and Mr. Ouliaris (RES). Mr. Murray (Alternate Executive Director) attended the
meetings in Canberra.

•

The mission met with Treasurer Peter Costello, RBA Governor Ian Macfarlane, Treasury
Secretary Ken Henry, Productivity Commission Chairman Gary Banks, other senior
officials, academics, and financial, business, and labor representatives.

•

Macroeconomic and structural policies are sound and are consistent with Fund advice. To
address the challenge of increasing healthcare costs and population ageing, the authorities
have taken measures to enhance the sustainability of health spending, and a Future Fund
will be established to cover unfunded public service pension liabilities. The 2005 budget
has announced reforms of welfare policies and the government has also proposed reforms
of industrial relations in order to promote labor force participation and productivity
growth. The authorities continue to monitor private sector balance sheets closely, and are
refining the prudential regulation of household lending. These policies are consistent with
Executive Director's recommendations at the conclusion of the 2004 Article IV
consultation on October 27, 2004 (IMF Country Report No. 04/353,
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pn/2004/pn04124.htm).

•

The Australian dollar is independently floating and Australia maintains an exchange
system free of restrictions. It has accepted the obligations of Article VIII (Annex II).

•

Australia publishes high quality economic and financial data on a timely basis and
subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (Annex III).

-3EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Economic Background
•

Economic activity slowed during 2004 as domestic demand growth eased owing to a
welcomed cooling of the housing market. The appreciation of the exchange rate in recent
years also contributed to the slowing by boosting imports. While the current account deficit
widened, unemployment reached a 28-year low of 5 percent, inflation remained subdued, and
strong revenues lifted the fiscal surplus.

•

Prospects for the Australian economy remain strong. Growth is expected to rise from
2¼ percent in 2005 to about 3½ percent in the medium term as high investment boosts
capacity, particularly in the export sector. Domestic demand growth will remain moderate as
stimulus from the housing market fades, with large terms of trade gains also leading to a
declining current account deficit. Underlying inflation may edge up in the near term, but
upside risks have diminished.

Policy Issues
•

Macroeconomic policies are on track. Monetary policy is in a wait-and-see stance for the
time being, as is appropriate following the moderation in domestic demand. Fiscal policy has
responded prudently to rising export commodity prices, while the mild fiscal stimulus from
the budget may have helped cushion the slowing in activity.

•

Risks to the economic outlook are tempered by flexibility in macroeconomic policies
and in the exchange rate. The risk of a hard landing in the housing market appears to have
eased, but terms of trade gains could be reversed rapidly if global growth slowed.

•

There is now an exceptional opportunity to implement further reforms to sustain and
improve Australia’s strong economic performance. In particular, employment and
productivity can be improved by implementing proposed reforms of labor markets and
welfare policies. Productivity can also be increased by improving price signals in
infrastructure, especially for water, land transport, and electricity, to encourage more
efficient use and stimulate timely investments to expand infrastructure capacity.

•

The authorities’ strategy is to address Australia’s long-term fiscal challenges through
ongoing structural reforms on a broad front. Recent steps to enhance the sustainability of
health spending are welcome, and reforms to strengthen incentives for cost effectiveness in
the health system could have large cumulative benefits by boosting productivity growth in
this key sector. Following best practices in asset management and transparency will help
ensure that the proposed Future Fund makes the greatest contribution to strengthening the
government’s balance sheet.

•

Financial regulation will need ongoing refinement in order to best preserve the financial
health of the private sector, and hence the resilience of the economy. Recent steps in
response to the emergence of nonstandard household lending are prudent.

-4I. REFORMS HAVE PAID LARGE DIVIDENDS
Australia has implemented wide-ranging structural reforms and strengthened the frameworks for
monetary and fiscal policies over the past two decades. These efforts have yielded rapidly rising
incomes through strong job creation and high productivity growth. Inflation has remained low
and net public debt has been virtually eliminated—all in the context of an increasingly stable
and resilient economy.
1.
Australians’ incomes have turned
around decisively. In the 1950s, Australian living
standards were among the highest in the world,
but by 1990 per capita incomes (PPP basis) had
declined to close to the OECD simple average and
ranked in the bottom third of the OECD
membership. Since 1992, however, Australia’s
real GDP has grown at an average annual rate of
3¾ percent, lifting per capita incomes to almost
10 percent above the OECD average by 2003.

1990s to which the NCP contributed raised GDP by 2½ percent.1
•

Fiscal measures helped to overcome barriers to reform. Many aspects of the NCP are in
the jurisdiction of the State governments. The challenge of coordinating these reforms was
partly overcome by recycling to the States the projected federal revenue gains from reforms
in the form of competition payments.

3.
Australia’s economy has also become more stable, owing in part to reforms of the
macroeconomic policy frameworks. The economic expansion that began in 1992 is now in its
14th year, with the economy shrugging off the impact of the Asian crisis in 1997–98, the global
IT slump in 2000–01, and a severe drought in 2002–03. Despite these shocks, the severity of
Australia’s economic fluctuations has declined: the standard deviation in the annual rate of GDP
growth was 0.9 percent in 1992–2004, well below the 2.3 percent in the previous three decades.
The greater resilience of the economy reflects increased flexibility at the microeconomic level as
well as reforms to the frameworks for macroeconomic policy:
•

The floating exchange rate has been a key economic shock absorber. The
Australian dollar was floated in 1983. By moving broadly in accordance with the
fluctuations in external demand and commodity prices, the exchange rate has tempered
the impact of these fluctuations on Australian economic activity.2

•

Monetary policy has preserved low inflation in a flexible manner. The Reserve Bank
of Australia (RBA) adopted inflation targeting in 1993, and was made fully independent
in 1996. CPI inflation has averaged 2½ percent since 1993, right in the center of the
inflation target of 2 to 3 percent. Importantly, this target is to be achieved on average over
the cycle, allowing flexibility for monetary policy to take into account implications for
employment and economic activity.

•

Fiscal policy has been prudent. In 1998, the Charter of Budget Honesty Act laid out
principles of sound fiscal management, within which the government set the objective of
maintaining budget balance, on average, over the cycle. When economic growth
prospects remain sound, the government also aims to maintain a budget surplus on the
forward estimates. This framework has locked in the gains from fiscal consolidation in
the mid-1990s, with fiscal surpluses achieved in six of the past seven years. Government
net worth rose by 9 percentage points of GDP as a result, and net debt is expected to be
less than 1 percent of GDP by the end of 2005/06.

4.
Private investment and growth have been supported by external financing on a
sustained basis within this economic framework. The external current account deficit has
averaged 4½ percent of GDP since 1990, lifting net external debt from 35 percent of GDP to
50 percent by end 2004. Almost all net external debt—97 percent—is owed by the private sector,
with four-fifths being intermediated by financial institutions. Although debt has risen, investment

Issues paper.

-6and valuation gains have raised the private
sector’s domestic assets by even more, increasing
private sector net wealth from 400 percent of
GDP in 1990 to over 600 percent of GDP in 2004.
As a result, net external liabilities have remained
less than one-tenth of the domestic assets of the
private sector.

opportunity to implement further reforms. The
Liberal-National party coalition was elected to its
fourth consecutive term in October 2004, and from July 2005 the government has a majority in
the Senate, which had previously blocked key reforms. There appears to be widespread
recognition of the lasting benefits from past reforms and increasing acceptance of the need for
further reforms.

II. WHY DID THE ECONOMY SLOW RECENTLY?
Activity slowed in the second half of 2004 largely reflecting a welcomed cooling of the housing
market and the rise in the Australian dollar in recent years. The external current account deficit
widened but strong job creation continued and inflation remained low.
6.
Growth averaged 3¼ percent (y/y) in
2004, but slowed to 2 percent (Q1/Q1) by the
first quarter of 2005 (Table 1). Economic
activity was particularly weak in the second half
of 2004, with growth running at an annualized
rate of only 1 percent. Most analysts were
surprised by the extent of this slowdown, which
partly reflected a sharp fall in inventory
investment that was reversed in the first quarter of
2005, boosting quarterly growth (Q1/Q4) to an
annualized rate of 2¾ percent.

Unemployment has fallen to a 28-year
low of 5 percent, but aggregate wage growth
has risen little. Employment growth has
remained strong, at 3 to 4 percent (y/y) in 2005,
possibly because real unit labor costs are below
historical average levels. With labor participation
rising to new highs, indicators of the difficulty of
finding suitable labor have increased.
Nevertheless, average wage rises have edged up
only slightly to 4 percent, despite robust wage
increases in sectors such as construction and
mining.

The RBA tightened the stance of monetary policy in March 2005 to lean against a
prospective rise in inflation. Having kept interest rates on hold since late 2003, the RBA raised
target cash rate by 25 basis points to 5½ percent in March 2005. In its February 2005 Statement
on Monetary Policy the RBA projected that inflation would rise to about 3 percent by the end of
2006, as prospects for domestic demand remained solid while signs of capacity constraints were
emerging, and 2004 PPI data suggested inflation pressure in the pipeline.
14.
The fiscal surplus for 2004/05 is projected to be substantially higher than previously
expected. In the 2005 Budget released in May, the government projects the underlying cash
balance to reach 1.1 percent of GDP in 2004/05 (the fiscal year ends in June), compared with the
surplus of 0.3 percent of GDP projected in the 2004 Budget (Table 3). Revenue is projected to be
almost 1 percent of GDP higher than before, with company taxes particularly buoyant, partly
reflecting the boost in profits from rising export commodity prices.
III. WHERE IS THE ECONOMY HEADING?
A rebalancing of economic growth is expected over the medium term as exports strengthen while
domestic demand moderates, an outlook shared by the authorities, the mission, and most
economic analysts. Housing market risks appear to have eased somewhat, but external risks
remain, although overall prospects are underpinned by flexibility in the economy and
macroeconomic policies.
4

The RBA has noted that the impact on inflation from the appreciation in 2002–03 has been smaller than
expected. The role of increasing goods market competitiveness in accounting for declining exchange rate
pass-through is analyzed in a forthcoming Working Paper.

-915.
Growth is expected to steady in 2005. Real GDP growth is projected to continue at
about 2¾ percent during the remainder of 2005, with year-on-year growth of 2¼ percent as a
result of carry-over effects from slow growth in the second half of 2004. Domestic demand
growth will likely further ease as households respond to lower housing price rises and slightly
higher interest rates. A more rapid slowing is unlikely, as investment intentions remain positive
and consumer confidence is underpinned by strong employment growth, income tax reductions,
and the broad based 25 percent rise in equity prices in 2004. The rising terms of trade will also
support demand, although this effect is expected
to be smaller than in the past (Box 1). Some

owing to higher oil prices, underlying inflation is
expected to edge up more modestly.
16.
Real GDP growth is projected to rise to about 3½ percent on average in the
medium-term, with exports likely to play a greater role as a driver of growth (Table 4). The

After a year of stability in the housing market, potential risks appear to have eased.
Turnover in the housing market has continued with no sign of a sell-off by investors, and most
observers consider that while house prices might decline further in some areas, a major
exogenous shock would be required to interrupt a continued soft landing. Although investors
play a growing role in the housing market relative to owner-occupiers—accounting for almost
one-third of housing loans—they also have a relatively long investment horizon, which reduces
5

Infrastructure is not expected to be a significant constraint on exports in the medium term, as State
governments and private operators are boosting infrastructure spending, including in some of the facilities
facing capacity limits recently (e.g., the port at Dalrymple Bay in Queensland). Moreover, most
investments by large resource sector enterprises incorporate a dedicated infrastructure.

- 10 Box 1. The Terms of Trade Boom—Prospects and Macroeconomic Implications
Australia’s terms of trade (TOT) are rising to
historically high levels. Strong world demand,
especially from China, has driven up the price of
commodities of which Australia is a major
exporter. Most recently, with effect from
mid-2005, new contracts have locked in large
price increases in U.S. dollar terms for some of
Australia’s key exports, e.g., a 70 percent rise for
iron ore, and a 120 percent increase for hard
coking coal. Moreover, a decline in the prices of
Australia’s manufactured goods imports has also
contributed to the steady improvement in TOT. 1

These TOT gains are likely to reverse as global supply responds to higher commodity prices, but the
timing is uncertain. Current high prices have triggered a surge in investment in several commodity sectors
worldwide, which should place downward pressure on Australia’s export prices over time. For example,
world production of iron ore is expected to increase by around 20 percent in the next three years. But the
continued strength of world demand makes the timing and extent of price adjustment difficult to predict.
Recent research finds that half of past TOT gains were dissipated within two or three years on average.2
Domestic demand will be boosted by the TOT gains, but these effects may be smaller than usual
because the gains are concentrated in the mining sector. The mining sector is 50 to 60 percent foreign
owned and employment is a small share of the total. Hence, as a rule-of-thumb, about one-third of the rise
in mining revenues will be received by State and Federal governments through higher royalties and tax
receipts, one-third will accrue to foreign investors, leaving only one-third for the domestic private sector,
largely reflected in higher stock prices for mining companies. In addition, the rise in mining investment is
expected to be contained by expectations that commodity prices will decline, and the consolidation of the
global mining sector in recent years may also serve to moderate the investment cycle.
Exchange rate flexibility will play a key role in

commodity prices, the Australian dollar has risen substantially to date, thereby tending to moderate
inflationary pressures.

- 11 downside risks to house prices. Some countries have experienced a slump in consumption after
housing markets cooled, but an analysis of consumption behavior suggests this risk is modest in
Australia (Box 2). Nonetheless, higher household indebtedness could make consumer spending
more sensitive to shocks, particularly if they also affect interest rates.
18.
However, recent terms of trade gains could be reversed more rapidly than expected.
Demand for Australia’s export commodities would fall if downside risks to global growth are
realized—possibly reflecting a disorderly adjustment of global imbalances—especially if there
were a hard landing in East Asian growth. There could be further downward pressure on
commodity prices if the global supply of resource products increases more than expected owing
to the substantial rise in global investment in the resource sector in recent years. A sharp fall in
export commodity prices would lower incomes and domestic demand, but the impact would be
significantly mitigated by risk-sharing with foreign investors in the traded goods sector,6 time
lags in investment responses, and the likely depreciation of the exchange rate—although this
buffer would be less effective if the shock involved a large fall in the U.S. dollar.
19.
The economy remains well placed to manage both external and domestic risks.
Australia’s relatively high and rising net external debt, just under one-half of which is short-term,
would, on the face of it, appear to represent a source of vulnerability, as it does in other
countries. On closer inspection, however, it is not clear that it significantly raises vulnerability to
external shocks because private sector balance sheets are strong and currency and liquidity risks
are well managed, with most external debt either denominated in Australian dollars or hedged
(Annex I). While net foreign liabilities are expected to rise before stabilizing in the medium
term, a depreciation of the exchange rate would facilitate an orderly decline in the external
current account deficit if this rise in liabilities was to reduce the attractiveness of foreign
investment in Australia. This is consistent with stress tests that do not suggest significant
external vulnerabilities (Annex I, Figure I).7 Considering the remaining housing market risks, the
authorities’ analysis finds that banking sector and household sectors are robust to substantial
declines in house prices (Section IV.D and Annex I), thereby containing the potential impacts on
domestic demand and foreign investor confidence. Experience during the Asian crisis
underscores the resilience of the Australian economy to external shocks, and there is also ample
scope for macroeconomic policies to help cushion the economy against either external or
domestic shocks.
20.
Nonetheless, maintaining a high trend rate of economic growth will be a challenge.
Demographic changes are expected to slow growth in Australia’s working age population from
1½ percent to about 1¼ percent in the medium term. With an unchanged rate of labor force
participation, labor productivity growth would need to continue at the 2¼ percent pace achieved
in the last 14 years, which, owing to past reforms, was above trend productivity growth in earlier
decades. There is scope to raise labor participation but relatively high productivity growth will
still be required to underpin the prospects for sustained strong growth in living standards.
6

The potential risk-sharing benefits of closer financial integration with the Asian region are explored in
Chapter II of the forthcoming Selected Issues paper.

7

To better capture the impact of a large fall in the exchange rate, the analysis presented in Figure 1 of
Annex I allows for the high foreign currency hedging coverage of private external debt.

- 12 Box 2. Will Consumer Spending Slump as the Housing Market Cools?
The substantial rise in housing prices in many industrialized countries in recent years has lifted
household wealth and expanded the scope for households to finance higher consumption. In some
cases—notably Australia, Ireland, Spain, and the U.K.—prices have risen by 50 to 90 percent since 1999.
The resulting rise in home equity has increased the collateral for borrowing, and relatively low nominal
interest rates have encouraged households to leverage on this collateral to finance spending. To the extent
that this spending is not on housing assets, i.e., housing construction including additions and alterations,
the household sector’s net equity in housing declines. Such “housing equity withdrawal” loans have
grown significantly in recent years, especially in the U.S., the U.K., and Australia.1
Experience in the Netherlands suggests that housing equity withdrawals may slow quickly, with a
negative impact on economic activity. 2 House prices in the Netherlands increased rapidly in the second
half of the 1990s and household debt rose by two-fifths of the increase in the value of housing. In
1998-2000, annual GDP growth averaged 4 percent, with growth boosted by an estimated 1 percentage
point on average each year as the result of housing equity withdrawals. But home equity withdrawals
declined sharply as housing price increases slowed from mid-2000, reducing consumption growth by an
estimated 1 percentage point in 2001 and 2002 and ½ percentage point in 2003, although the recession in
the Euro area may also have played an important role in these developments.
With household credit growth slowing as the housing market cools in Australia, it is important to
understand the sensitivity of household consumption to these developments. A life-cycle model of
household consumption was estimated in which household’s disposable income, net wealth (housing and
financial), and the real interest rate influence consumption trends. Changes in the unemployment rate and
household equity withdrawals were included as they could affect short-run movements in consumption.
The model explains real household consumption from 1988 to 2004 quite well (standard error ½ percent).
Controlling for other variables, household
equity withdrawals were found to have
negligible effects on consumption.
Disposable income, real interest rates, and net
housing wealth are the key determinants of
household consumption expenditure in
Australia, with changes in net financial wealth
having little effect. Overall, it appears that
housing equity withdrawals are not a driving
force for consumption in Australia, rather they
are more a source of financing.3

The cooling housing market in Australia might still affect consumption via net housing wealth, but
interest rate flexibility could moderate the overall macroeconomic impact. If, for example, the
household sector’s net housing wealth declined by 5 percent, the model predicts that consumption would
decline almost ½ percent after one year and by ¾ percent in the long run. However, Australia has the
flexibility to cut interest rates if this is consistent with keeping inflation on-track in the medium term,
thereby moderating the decline in consumption and boosting other spending.

- 13 IV. HOW TO SUSTAIN STRONG ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE?
Australia enjoys an exceptional opportunity to lay the foundations for sustained strong economic
performance: the medium-term economic outlook is sound; the fiscal position is strong; and
public attitudes to reforms are broadly supportive. Reforms of labor markets, welfare policies,
and infrastructure are the main priorities to support high productivity growth and raise
employment. Strong growth will help tackle the long-term fiscal challenges, but reforms to
moderate growth in health spending are also important. In the meantime, protecting the
financial soundness of the private sector will underpin the resilience of the economy, and
macroeconomic policies should continue to respond flexibly to potential shocks.
A. Maintaining Sound and Flexible Macroeconomic Policies
21.
The current broadly neutral monetary stance will remain appropriate if moderate
demand growth is sustained. The RBA noted that most recent indicators suggested some
moderation in domestic demand growth, with underlying inflation expected to rise modestly in
the medium term, to peak at around 3 percent in 2006. The authorities consider a wait-and-see
attitude appropriate in view of the diminished upside risks to the inflation outlook. If there were
shocks to external or domestic demand, monetary policy is well placed to respond in either
direction to cushion the economy, which would be fully consistent with achieving the RBA’s
medium-term inflation objective.
22.
Although house prices have stabilized
somewhat and household credit growth has
eased, developments in the housing market and
household finances still need to be monitored
closely. The authorities judged that the downside
risks associated with the housing cycle have eased
following the two interest rate hikes in late 2003.
The rise in household leverage may partly be a
response to greater macroeconomic stability, and
households’ high net worth would help moderate
the impact of negative shocks on demand. The
RBA considered, nonetheless, that it is
appropriate for monetary policy to recognize that
the interest sensitivity of spending may have
increased due to higher household indebtedness.
23.
Australia’s flexible exchange rate will
continue to play a crucial role in buffering
shocks. Responding to fundamentals, in particular
the historically high terms of trade, the exchange
rate has remained at relatively high levels in
2004-05.8 This appreciation contributed to a

Staff analysis finds the exchange rate is about 15 percent above its medium-term equilibrium using a
macroeconomic balance approach (see P. Isard et al, 2001, Methodology for Current Account and
Exchange Rate Assessments, IMF Occasional Paper No. 209), although this approach does not allow for
changes in the terms of trade.

- 14 slowing in growth and a widening in the external current account balance in 2004, but it also
played a valuable role by easing inflation pressures directly through lower import prices and
indirectly by switching expenditure to imports. After the RBA rebuilt its foreign reserves to a
more comfortable level during 2002–03, the accumulation of reserves has been modest more
recently, with little effect on the foreign exchange market.
24.
Higher surpluses projected in the 2005 Budget are appropriate. The budget included
significant tax reductions along with modest expenditure increases partly linked to welfare
reforms, suggesting a mildly expansionary fiscal stance.9 Nonetheless, the underlying cash
balance is projected to remain at close to 1 percent of GDP over the next four years, up from
¼ percent of GDP in the previous budget. This reflects expected revenue gains from higher
export commodity prices, as well as a revised methodology for projecting revenues to correct the
consistent under-prediction in recent years.10 The authorities considered that the adjustments in
taxes and expenditures in the 2005 budget were prudent as a significant portion of the higher
revenue outlook had been saved in the form of higher surpluses. Moreover, the revenue
projections allowed for a fall in export commodity prices to historical average levels by 2007/08.
The mission agreed, and noted that the mildly expansionary stance of fiscal policy in the last two
budgets may have cushioned the recent slowing in growth without placing undue stress on
monetary policy or the public finances.
25.
The authorities stressed that fiscal policy will continue to manage uncertainty in the
terms of trade outlook within the transparent medium-term framework. The upswing in
export commodity prices has so far boosted corporate profitability, and hence company tax
revenue, with only a relatively modest impact on domestic demand. If there was a decline in
export prices, allowing the full operation of the automatic fiscal stabilizers would be consistent
with the objective of budget balance over the course of the cycle. In coming years, as the budget
projections are updated the authorities will reevaluate the extent to which the recent terms of
trade gains were a cyclical or permanent factor, and fiscal policies would be adjusted if
necessary. The mission supported this forward-looking approach, noting that if room for further
tax reforms emerged the authorities should focus on measures that would encourage labor force
participation and productive investments.
B. Tackling Long-Term Fiscal Challenges
26.
Australia is aiming to tackle the challenges of rising healthcare costs and population
ageing on a broad front. Compared with other OECD countries, the ageing of Australia’s
population is more gradual. Nonetheless, the Productivity Commission estimates the long-term
9

Personal income taxes were cut most, with phased increases in the thresholds for the highest rates of
personal income tax—which were low by OECD standards—and a reduction in the lowest income tax
rate from 17 to 15 percent, with an annual cost of two-thirds of a percent of GDP from 2006/07. The
fiscal stance is judged to be mildly stimulatory, even with a broadly stable fiscal balance, as revenues
were supported by terms of trade gains.
10

Following a review of the methodology, revenue projections have been made more responsive to
changes in incomes, mostly affecting projections of income taxes from companies and “other
individuals.” As structural changes could partly account for the higher estimated income sensitivity, the
new methodology is being applied cautiously as further analysis is carried out.

- 15 financing gap of the Commonwealth government at some 6½ percent of GDP by 2045, with
rising healthcare costs being the main contributor. The risks around this outlook are significant
given the difficulty of anticipating the effects of developments in medical technology such as
pharmaceuticals (Box 3). To manage this challenge without excessive increases in tax rates or
government debt, the authorities are acting on a number of fronts:
•

Lifting incomes and hence the revenue base. Increases in labor force participation and
labor productivity can significantly narrow the long-term fiscal gap.11 Accordingly, the
government has recently announced structural reforms of the labor market, welfare, and
training (Section IV.C).

•

Enhancing the sustainability of health spending. Recognizing that health spending will
increase in the longer run, the government aims to moderate its growth while continuing
to achieve high standards of healthcare.

•

Ensuring that government savings are available to meet long-term fiscal needs.
Fiscal surpluses are currently being deposited with the RBA as government debt is very
low and the authorities have decided to retain a government debt market. To raise the
expected return on these assets, and ensure that they are used to cover specific long-term
liabilities, the government plans to establish a Future Fund by the end of 2005.

27.
To underpin the success of the Future Fund (FF), it will be critical to follow
international best practices in its management and transparency. 12 The FF will invest fiscal
surpluses in order to cover the liability arising from those public service pensions which are not
funded, currently standing at about 10½ percent of GDP. Inflows to the FF will come from future
fiscal surpluses, privatization proceeds, and from its own investment income. To safeguard the
assets of the FF, legislation will provide that outflows cannot begin until the unfunded liability is
fully covered and that they then must be used to meet the pension payments covered by the FF,
which are projected to average about 0.6 percent of GDP. The FF will be governed by an
independent board, with members selected by the government based on their financial expertise;
other key details, such as the nature of the investment mandate that would guide asset allocation,
are expected to be clarified in the coming months.
28.
Far-sighted steps to enhance the sustainability of health spending are being taken,
and ongoing reform efforts will be needed. The government has announced increases in the
safety net thresholds for Medicare, along with a phased increase in the thresholds for the
Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). To further contain the rapid growth in pharmaceutical
spending the PBS would seek to put downward pressure on pharmaceutical costs, and the
government is also aiming to moderate growth in the cost of distributing pharmaceuticals to the
11

Raising participation rates to the top one-fifth of the OECD is estimated to close the long-term fiscal
gap by 2 percent of GDP, with a similar effect from raising labor productivity growth by ½ percentage
point so long as productivity growth in government services also increases. See D. Gruen and M. Garbutt,
“The Long Term Fiscal Implications of Raising Australian Labor Force Participation or Productivity
Growth,” Treasury Working Paper, 2004-01.
12

Arrangements for the Future Fund are compared with those in other countries in Chapter III of the
forthcoming Selected Issues paper.

Box 3. Healthcare Costs are a Key Risk to Australia’s Long-Term Fiscal Prospects
Rising healthcare costs are central to
long-term fiscal pressures. The Productivity
Commission projects government spending to
rise by 6½ percent of GDP over the next four
decades.1 Health spending is projected to rise to
10.3 percent of GDP in 2044–45, up from
5.7 percent of GDP in 2002–03, accounting for
two thirds of the total rise in spending.

- 17 public. With healthcare services provided by different levels of government, the authorities have
recognized the importance of reducing duplication and gaps in services by improving
coordination. Looking ahead, one of the key challenges will be to make the most cost effective
use of new medical technology.13 The mission encouraged the authorities to find ways to make
the incentives within the health system—including those faced by users and purchasers of
technology—consistent with improved cost effectiveness in order to raise productivity growth in
healthcare services. Past experience (e.g., the Hilmer Review that preceded the NCP) suggests
that a comprehensive public review could help create a consensus for health reform.
C. Implementing Further Structural Reforms
29.
Australia has scope to further close the
income gap with the leading economies. Even
with the gains made in the past 14 years, per capita
incomes (PPP basis) remain some 20 percent below
those in the United States, with only part of this gap
accounted for by the effects of Australia’s
remoteness on productivity.14 Structural reforms to
raise productivity and employment levels would
help close the income gap, and thereby also
contribute to reducing the long-run fiscal shortfall.

Recent research suggests that about two-fifths of the productivity gap with the U.S. may reflect
Australia’s remoteness from global markets and its relatively low population density, see J. Rahman,

The work tests do not apply to current DSP recipients. New DSP applicants who are assessed as being
able to work more than 15 hours per week will have an obligation to seek part-time work. A similar parttime work obligation will also apply to single parents with school age children.

Further reforms of industrial relations are needed to expand labor demand and

Moreover, minimum wages are relatively high

proposed a comprehensive set of reforms to
Source: UK Low Pay Commission, National Minimum Wage, 2005
address these issues, including:17
•

Transforming the determination of minimum wages by establishing an Australian Fair
Pay Commission, which will focus more on the implications for employment than the
current adversarial system for setting minimum wages, while not reducing minimum
wages from their current level;

•

Providing legislative protection of key working conditions—annual leave, parental
leave, personal leave, and maximum ordinary hours of work—to replace the no
disadvantage test for employees with collective and individual employment contracts;

•

Scaling back employment protection by limiting the coverage of unfair dismissal laws
to enterprises with more than 100 employees, and by extending the qualification period
for unfair dismissal coverage from 3 to 6 months, while retaining protection against
unlawful termination for discrimination;

•

Unifying the Federal and State industrial relations systems and streamlining the
agreement making process to reduce costs and uncertainties.

These reforms face significant opposition from trade unions, which expressed concern that they
will lead to a two-tier labor market; the authorities, on the other hand, did not view this as a
major concern since strong social protections would remain in place for employees. The mission
urged the implementation of this package of reforms to widen employment opportunities and
raise productivity by enhancing flexibility in work arrangements. Training and education
initiatives to support productivity growth were also announced recently in the budget and by the
Council of Australian Governments.

The Commonwealth Government’s submission for the 2005 Safety Net Review surveys ten papers
estimating the relationship between wages and employment in Australia. All papers find a negative
relationship, and the two papers focusing on minimum wages more specifically both find a negative
elasticity of employment demand with respect to the minimum wage.

Productivity gains can also be realized by improving the efficiency of key
infrastructure sectors, where reform of pricing is essential. A recent review proposed
regulatory reforms to reduce the risk of infrastructure constraints on export performance, but
important infrastructure reform challenges remain, especially in water, land transport, and
electricity (Box 4). Reform programs to address some of these issues, such as the National Water
Initiative, are already in place, and the recent meeting of the Council of Australian Governments
agreed to renew the NCP reform agenda. With demand for infrastructure services likely to grow,
the mission urged that the reform agenda be ambitious. In particular, improving the price signals
in each of these sectors is a priority to encourage the efficient use of water, road and rail
networks, and electricity. Such signals will also help stimulate appropriate and timely
investments to meet growing demand. Given the positive role of competition payments in
helping to coordinate past reform efforts, the mission noted that the government’s strong fiscal
position could facilitate measures to assist States in overcoming hurdles to reforms.
33.
Trade liberalization is part of Australia’s growth strategy. Multilateral trade
liberalization under the Doha round is a priority for the authorities, as this is the only avenue to
secure progress on key issues for Australia such as trade in agricultural products. To ensure
complementarity with the multilateral process, the authorities have negotiated bilateral free trade
agreements (FTA) with comprehensive coverage. FTAs with Thailand and the U.S. came into
force in January 2005; separate FTA negotiations with China, ASEAN, Malaysia, and the U.A.E.
began during 2005; and a feasibility study of an FTA with Japan is planned. The few remaining
high tariff rates continue to be cut—in January 2005, tariff rates on textiles were reduced from
25 to 17.5 percent, and the rate on automobiles was reduced from 15 to 10 percent, with these
rates to reach 5 percent by 2015 and 2010, respectively.
34.
Australia is increasing its official development assistance (ODA). To assist in
recovery and reconstruction following the Indian Ocean Tsunami, Australia has increased
assistance to Indonesia by A$1 billion over a five year period. Commitments to promote stability
and growth in Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and other Pacific Island countries have
also been increased substantially.18 The budget for 2005/06 allocates 0.28 percent of national
income for ODA, up from 0.25 percent in 2004; Australia remains committed to achieving the
United Nations target of 0.7 percent.
D. Protecting the Private Sector’s Financial Health
35.
Microeconomic analysis of households’ balance sheets indicates that household
sector vulnerability is more limited than suggested by aggregate indicators. The financial
and corporate sectors remain in strong financial health, but a rise in aggregate household interest
payment burdens in recent years could signal increased household financial vulnerability.19
However, based on a survey of over 7,000 households, the RBA reports that household debt is
concentrated on high income groups, who have relatively low debt-service burdens and
18

A more extensive discussion of Australia’s external assistance policy is available in IMF Country
Report No. 04/353, and Box 5 in particular.
19

The decline in unemployment and the rise in household net worth in Australia in recent years will tend
to offset the effect of a higher interest burden on household financial distress, see J. Whitely et al, “An
empirical model of household arrears,” Bank of England Working Paper, 2004, No. 214.

- 20 Box 4. Averting Infrastructure Constraints—Getting the Pricing Right is Crucial
Recent transportation bottlenecks have raised concerns that Australia’s infrastructure could become
a constraint on growth. Long queues of ships outside two of the major coal ports on the east coast—
Dalrymple Bay and Newcastle—indicated that port and rail facilities were limiting exporters’ ability to
meet rapidly expanding demand for coal, especially from China.
Improved regulatory arrangements can lower the risk of infrastructure constraints on exports.
Infrastructure is typically the responsibility of the States in Australia, with some infrastructure being
privately managed but subject to state level regulation. In Dalrymple Bay, for example, the private port
operator is subject to regulation by the Queensland Competition Authority, which covers issues like
changes in user charges. A taskforce commissioned by the Prime Minister found that there was a need for
greater regulatory certainty.1 It proposed the option of referring a dispute between infrastructure providers
and users to a federal agency, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, in cases where State
regulators could not resolve an issue within six months.
Even with a better regulatory system, notable challenges remain in key infrastructure sectors:
•

Water: citizens in many of Australia’s major cities face restrictions on their water use. This
rationing is partly a symptom of prices that are low compared with European countries,
encouraging relatively high water usage. Agriculture uses about two-thirds of Australia’s water, but
some estimates suggest that up to one-third of irrigation water is wasted, and much water may not
be put to its best use—88 percent of water is used to produce only ½ of agricultural output.

•

Land transport: the share of freight carried between Australia’s capital cities by rail has fallen
from 70 to 30 percent in the past three decades, as weak rail profitability is reflected in low
investment and poor service levels. A significant part of this decline reflects low road access
charges for heavy long-distance trucks, which do not include a return on the capital invested in
roads. The Bureau of Transport and Regional Economics calculates that road access charges would
need to roughly double to achieve neutrality with rail.

•

Electricity: retail prices for electricity vary significantly across States as the development of a
competitive nationwide electricity market has been hindered by retail price controls and regulatory
complexity. Uncertainties about potential carbon charges have also delayed some investment.

Better pricing of infrastructure services can promote the best use of these services while also
stimulating appropriate investments. State governments are planning large increases in infrastructure
spending, but simply increasing the quantity of infrastructure is not an efficient strategy. In the case of
water, appropriate prices would not only moderate demand by discouraging waste and inefficient uses of
water, it would also enhance supply by making investments (e.g., in dams, pipe repairs, and recycling
facilities) more economic. A well functioning market in rural water rights is therefore needed. Similarly,
removing the implicit subsidy to heavy road users through higher access charges would stimulate the use of
rail transport and reduce the cost of maintaining and expanding roads. Appropriate price signals would also
promote the large investments in electricity generation and transmission needed in coming years.
Preliminary estimates of the productivity gains from infrastructure reforms are substantial.2 A
comprehensive infrastructure reform agenda is estimated to raise GDP by 2 percent, with rural and urban
water reforms contributing almost half of these gains.

percent of households were considered to be in a
vulnerable position due to high loan-to-value (LVR)
or debt-service ratios. These survey data are from
2002, and while middle-income households became
more active housing investors during 2002-03, the
authorities considered that the likely increase in
vulnerability was modest.

institutions’ exposures to the household sector.

The Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority
(APRA) noted that even in the face of slowing
credit growth and increased pressure on margins from non-bank lenders, banks had shown no
enthusiasm for lending to subprime debtors. This contrasts with developments in the second half
of the 1980s, reflecting more sophisticated management of credit risk. To meet the needs of selfemployed persons there has been an increase in lending with more limited verification of creditor
income information—so called “low doc” loans. Although these loans are typically less than
1 percent of bank portfolios, and their default rates are similar to standard loans, APRA had
taken the precaution of tightening the LVR requirements for “low doc” loans to qualify for a risk
weight of 50 percent.21 APRA has also raised capital requirements for mortgage insurance
companies effective from the start of 2006, although the two major companies were already well
capitalized. Moreover, as part of its Basel II related reforms, APRA plans to adopt a tiering of
risk weights for housing loans based on the LVR of households, in order to make capital
requirements more consistent with the underlying risk of the loan portfolio.
37.
The authorities are participating in an FSAP during 2005–06 with the aim of
identifying and prioritizing improvements in financial regulation. Issues likely to be
addressed during the FSAP include the effectiveness of the newly integrated structure of
supervision, implications from the dominance of the major financial conglomerates, and
vulnerabilities linked to the housing sector and foreign borrowing. Preparations are well
advanced, with the authorities working on the appropriate design of stress tests and detailed self
assessments of the relevant standards and codes.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
38.
Australia’s implementation of wide-ranging reforms in the past two decades has
paid dividends in many dimensions. Structural reforms in the labor market, trade policy, the
financial sector, public enterprises, and infrastructure were complemented by the adoption of a
floating exchange rate and medium-term frameworks for both monetary and fiscal policies.
Concrete returns on these efforts have included rising incomes owing to high productivity
20
21

Reserve Bank of Australia, Financial Stability Review, March 2005.

For standard housing loans to qualify for risk weight of 50 percent rather than 100 percent, the loan
must have mortgage insurance if the LVR is above 80 percent. From September 2004, to qualify for a
50 percent risk weight, “low doc” loans need mortgage insurance if the LVR exceeds 60 percent.

- 22 growth, strong job creation reducing unemployment to a three-decade low of 5 percent, low and
stable inflation, and the near elimination of net public debt—all in the context of an increasingly
stable and resilient economy.
39.
Prospects for the Australian economy remain strong notwithstanding the slowdown
in 2004. This slowdown largely reflected a welcomed cooling of the housing market, which was
itself a reflection of astute and timely actions by policymakers, along with the strength of imports
owing to the appreciation of the Australian dollar. With job creation, business investment, and
consumer confidence remaining robust, the healthy growth that resumed in early 2005 is
expected to continue. Exports are expected to play a greater role in driving growth in the medium
term, which together with sharp rises in Australia’s export commodity prices will tend to narrow
the external current account deficit over time. Enhanced labor market flexibility has enabled the
economy to cope with excess demand in specific labor markets without generalized wage
pressures. While headline inflation may approach 3 percent in 2005 because of higher oil prices,
underlying inflation is expected to edge up only modestly before declining again toward the
middle of the target range.
40.
Macroeconomic policies are on track. The stance of monetary policy is now broadly
neutral, and a wait-and-see attitude is appropriate given the slowing of activity over the past year
and the associated decline in upside risks to inflation. The stance of fiscal policy is mildly
expansionary largely owing to prospective tax reductions, helping to cushion the slowdown in
growth without placing undue stress on monetary policy or public finances. Indeed, the
projection for the underlying cash balance surplus has been revised up to almost 1 percent of
GDP over each of the next four years, reflecting the government’s prudent commitment to
ongoing surpluses while the economy remains strong. The transparent medium-term fiscal
framework has again proven its value, with the authorities making appropriate allowance for the
likelihood that export commodity prices will decline in coming years.
41.
Risks to the outlook are cushioned by flexibility in macroeconomic policies and in
the exchange rate. Australia’s recent large terms of trade gains could be reversed more rapidly
than expected if a disorderly adjustment of global imbalances weakened export demand,
especially if there was a sharp slowdown in east Asia. However, the flexible exchange rate has
helped buffer such shocks in the past, and the economy has proven resilient to substantial
exchange rate fluctuations, partly reflecting the extensive hedging of the foreign currency
component of external debt. Potential risks to domestic demand appear to have eased after a year
of stability in housing prices and a smooth deceleration in household credit, although continued
monitoring of the housing market is clearly warranted. Monetary policy stands ready to respond
to external or domestic shocks in either direction, and the strong fiscal position means that the
automatic stabilizers are also free to operate.
42.
As in many countries, Australia faces the medium-term challenge of addressing the
economic consequences of an ageing population and rising healthcare costs. Because
Australia’s ageing is more gradual than in most other industrial countries, the authorities are in
the enviable position of being able to focus on further structural reforms to boost medium-term
growth, and hence, the revenue base, complemented by measures to enhance the sustainability of
government expenditure. Australia’s strong track record of successful implementation of
structural reforms to improve supply-side efficiency makes this strategy credible. Moreover,
there appears to be widespread recognition of the lasting benefits from past reforms and
increasing acceptance of the need for further reform. Together with the robust fiscal position,

- 23 there now exists an exceptional opportunity to implement additional far-reaching structural
reforms. If this opportunity is seized, Australia should continue to have one of the strongest
performing economies among the economically advanced countries. If, however, the structural
reform effort falters, economic growth is likely to decline as the population ages, and future
generations will be faced with a substantial fiscal shortfall.
43.
Employment and productivity can be lifted by implementing labor market and
welfare reforms. The authorities are adopting a mutually reinforcing set of welfare and
industrial relations reforms to encourage the transition from welfare to work and increase labor
market flexibility. By supporting productivity growth and widening the opportunities for
employment, the implementation of these reforms would have substantial medium-term growth
benefits. Looking ahead, further progress in raising labor force participation among the
population aged over 55 will be needed in order to moderate the impact of population ageing on
employment.
44.
Infrastructure reforms, including a more efficient regulatory system, would also
boost productivity and real incomes. Simply increasing the quantity of infrastructure is not
likely to address issues in the water, land transport, and electricity sectors in a sustainable or
efficient manner. The key is to price these infrastructure services correctly so as to reflect capital
and scarcity costs, and as appropriate, externalities. An ambitious new reform agenda is therefore
needed in each of these areas to create incentives for the efficient utilization of infrastructure and
also for appropriate and timely infrastructure investments. The government’s strong fiscal
position could facilitate measures to assist States in overcoming hurdles to the implementation of
reforms.
45.
Enhancing the sustainability of health spending can make a major contribution to
tackling Australia’s long-term fiscal challenges. Recent changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefit
Scheme and Medicare, coupled with planned reforms of pharmaceutical distribution, are
important steps to moderate the growth in health spending. But there are other fundamental
challenges to sustainability, such as making the most appropriate use of advances in medical
technology, which may require some strengthening of the incentives for cost effectiveness facing
both users and providers of healthcare services. By covering unfunded public service pension
liabilities, the Future Fund can also play a valuable role in meeting long-term fiscal challenges.
The proposed governance framework of the Future Fund is sound, and decisions on the
investment mandate and transparency arrangements will benefit from assessing best practices
among funds in other countries.
46.
Efforts to enhance financial regulation must continue to help preserve the resilience
of the economy. While banks are demonstrating more sophisticated credit risk management in
this cycle, the authorities have responded prudently to the emergence of nonstandard household
lending. The well advanced state of preparations for the FSAP in 2005-06 is welcome, as is the
authorities’ commitment to using the FSAP to help refine their regulatory framework.
47.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Australia take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

ANNEX I

AUSTRALIA—ECONOMIC VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT
1.
Australia’s vulnerability assessment remains broadly unchanged from the last assessment,
and the economy remains well placed to manage adverse external shocks.22 Net foreign liabilities
remain high relative to other advanced economies, mainly reflecting private sector borrowing,
and the external debt has become more concentrated in private financial corporations due to
increased intermediation of flows by banks. Despite the large share of foreign currency
denominated debt, the currency risk is mitigated through extensive hedging. Corporate and
banking sector balance sheets remain strong, and they have proven to be resilient to large swings
in exchange and interest rates in the recent years. Housing prices have risen substantially in
recent years, but analyses using microeconomic data indicate that a relatively small share of
households are potentially vulnerable to a significant fall in housing prices, and the banks are
sufficiently well capitalized to withstand a substantial housing market correction.

Foreign currency risks are limited by extensive hedging. The share of gross debt
denominated in foreign currency is around 65 percent. Nevertheless, a survey by the Australian
Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed that foreign currency assets of Australian entities exceeded
foreign currency liabilities at end-June 2001, with a net long foreign currency position of
$149 billion.23 In particular, private corporations appeared to have relatively minimal direct
exposure to exchange risk; a significant portion of their overseas borrowing was hedged
naturally. While banks have borrowed substantially in foreign currencies, they have made
extensive use of derivatives to hedge the
exposure. Around 65 percent of these

purposes. One indication of the
effectiveness of the banks’ hedging is the limited variation in the sector’s earnings in the face of
the sharp movements of the Australia dollar in recent years.24 Taking into account foreign
currency hedging, the country’s international investment position has been little affected by the
movements of the exchange rate.25
Although half of the external debt has a maturity of less than a year, the refunding
risks are limited by the banks’ active liquidity management. The maturity profile of the
external debt primary reflects the borrowing patterns of the financial sector. Over the last year,
however, banks have lengthened the maturity profile of their external borrowings, in light of the
historically low yield in the global capital market. Banks also increased their holdings of liquid
assets to 12 percent of the total assets from 8 percent in 2000. Perhaps more important than these
simple ratios is the fact that the financial innovation and the availability of funding facilities have

The survey captures around 90 percent of total foreign currency assets and liabilities. See “Australia’
foreign currency exposure and hedging practices”, Reserve Bank of Australia, August 2002. An updated
survey is expected to become available by the end of 2005.

Given the extensive hedging of the foreign currency exposure, the impact of a one time large

strengthened the banks’ capacity to meet their short term liquidity needs. For instance, the rapid
development of asset backed security market has enabled the banks to treat their residential
mortgage loans as a potential source of liquidity. Indeed, analysis by the Australian Prudential
Regulation Authority (APRA) indicates that liquidity is comfortable under a range of scenarios.
In addition, in case of a temporary loss of access to offshore funding, the banks could also tap
onshore sources of liquidity (such as the Interbank Deposit Agreement for the four large banks),
with borrowing costs contained as the RBA determines the short end of the yield curve through
the official cash rate.

on high income groups who have
relatively low debt service burdens and significant financial assets.27 Only 2 percent of
households were considered to be in a vulnerable position due to debt service ratios over
50 percent of after-tax income, and only 4 percent of households had loan-to-value ratios
exceeding 75 percent.

26

The rapid increase of household debt was driven by households’ easier access to credit and the
relatively lower interest rate environment. As a result, the total household debt rose from a low level by
international standards to levels comparable to those in the United Kingdom, and slightly higher than in
the United States, although the overall gearing ratio (ratio of liabilities to assets) is still relatively low. See
“Household Debt: What the Data Show”, Reserve Bank of Australia Bulletin, March 2003.

Banks
10.
Australia’s banking sector performance remains very strong. With a robust domestic
economy, Australian banks remained solidly profitable in 2004; the return on assets for the four
major banks was over 1 percent and the return on equity rose to 18 percent.28 The banking
system is also adequately capitalized, maintaining total capital of 10½ percent and tier-one
capital of 7½ percent of risk-weighted assets. 29 The overall asset quality of the banking system
remains very high, with impaired assets of only 0.3 percent of total assets, and provisions
increased to more than 170 percent of impaired assets. The strength of the Australian banks is
reflected in their ratings by independent credit rating agencies—all of the four major banks have
a credit rating of AA- or better.

The banking sector is
robust to shocks, in
particular, to a relatively
sharp correction in the
housing market. Housing
loans comprise about half of
total bank loans, hence a major
correction to housing prices
could have some spillover
effects on the banking system.
Nonetheless, official stress
tests have shown that the

The four major banks accounted for around 80 percent of banking system loans.

29

While well above the 8 percent minimum, the capital adequacy ratio of Australia’s banking system is
somewhat below the level in many advanced economies. However, financial markets and ratings agencies
recognize that the balance sheets of the Australian banks are less risky than implied by the standard riskweighted assets measure, partly owing to the relatively high share of housing loans—it is notable that the
Basel II standards will lower the risk weight on housing loans.

30

APRA considered the impact of a 30 percent fall of real property prices on the authorized deposittaking institutions (ADI), with the latter including banks, building societies, and credit unions. This stress
test found that the strong capital positions enjoyed by ADIs as a group will not be substantially affected
by such a shock. The aggregate default ratio will be around 3.5 percent, and over 90 percent of ADIs
would survive such losses without breaching the minimum regulatory capital requirement. See “Stress
testing housing loan portfolios," APRA Insight, 3rd Quarter/4th Quarter 2003.

floating, but the Reserve Bank of Australia retains discretionary power to intervene. On May 31,
2005, the U.S. dollar/Australian dollar exchange rate was US$0.7557=$A 1.00. There are no taxes or
subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Australia has notified the Fund under
Decision 144 of the imposition of exchange restrictions vis–à–vis Iraq, the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, the Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, and Zimbabwe. In late 1999, Australia
imposed restrictions on financial transactions with the Taliban (the Islamic State of Afghanistan).

ANNEX III

AUSTRALIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Australia publishes a wide array of economic and financial data. It has subscribed to the
Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and its metadata are posted in the Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB). Economic and financial data provided to the Fund are
considered adequate for surveillance purposes.
C. Real Sector Statistics
National Accounts
2.
In late 2005, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) will release new GDP estimates
based on an updated set of supply-use tables. Work to date indicates that the level of GDP may
be revised upwards, although such a revision is likely to have little effect on growth rates.
Prices
3.
Over the next few years, the Australia Bureau of Statistics (ABS) plans to introduce
indices measuring the change in the prices of financial services into the CPI. Since mid-2004,
the ABS has released experimental price indices for financial services, covering both direct
charges such as banking and real estate service fees, and indirect charges such as the interest rate
margins. These indices are expected to be included into the headline CPI from the third quarter
of 2005. In addition, with the 5-year review of the CPI, the weights in the CPI basket will be
updated, based largely on the 2003–04 household expenditure survey.
4.
The ABS released a new price measure—the Price Index of Domestic Final Purchases
(DFP)—on an experimental basis since July 2001. The index reflects purchases of Australian
residents (households, governments, and businesses), with import prices included and export
prices excluded. The series is confined to final market purchases, and, thus, avoids the issue of
multiple counting of price impacts, which would result if prices of intermediate stages of
production were included.31 The items and weights for this economy-wide measure of prices are
derived from the 1994–95 input-output tables. The ABS plans to regularize the production of the
DFP in the next few years, when the existing system for compiling price indexes is updated to
accommodate this.
5.
Beginning in November 2004, the ABS published new annual non-wage labor cost
indices. These indices, covering superannuation, workers’ compensation, annual leave, and
payroll tax, will contribute to the development of indices of overall labor costs.

31

Price changes of intermediate purchases are provided by the Stage of Production producer
price index introduced in July 2000.

- 44 -

ANNEX III

Labor
In February 2002, the ABS released two new measures of labor underutilization. In conjunction
with existing unemployment statistics, the new measures provide a broad view of labor
underutilization. The two new measures are: (i) the labor force underutilization rate, which is
defined as the unemployed plus the underemployed as a percentage of the labor force; and
(ii) the extended labor force underutilization rate, which includes the unemployed, plus the
underemployed, plus two groups that are marginally attached to the labor force—persons
actively looking for work, who are not available to start work in the reference week but available
to start work within four weeks, and discouraged job seekers—as a percentage of the 'extended'
labor force (i.e., the labor force plus the two marginally attached groups). Currently, the new
series are available on an annual basis back to 1994, but ABS is working to create a quarterly
series for the labor force underutilization rate, which is expected to be available by October
2005.
6.
Since July 2003 the ABS has also published experimental measures of volume based
labor underutilization in terms of the number of hours of labor (rather than the number of people
affected). The volume of underutilized labor in the labor force is derived as the number of hours
of work sought by unemployed persons plus the number of additional hours of work offered by
underemployed workers. The statistics are expected to be included in the official figures from
late 2006.
D. Government Finance Statistics
7.
The Australian Commonwealth (central) Government introduced accrual budgeting with
the 1999/2000 Budget estimates that were released in May 1999. Consolidated Financial
Statements for the Commonwealth and all State governments now contain a complete set of
financial statements and various summary measures of government performance prepared on an
accrual basis in accordance with applicable Australian Accounting Standards. Separate
Government Finance Statistics (GFS) statements, in accordance with the GFSM (2001)
methodology, are produced for the budget and mid-year updates of the estimates and the final
budget outcomes publications. The ABS has been producing quarterly GFS estimates for many
years as an input into the quarterly national accounts. In March 2004, the ABS published
quarterly data on the operations of general government and nonfinancial public corporations,
excluding data on financing. It is currently working with the Commonwealth and State
governments to produce a harmonized set of GFS and accounting data, which is expected to
commence with the 2006/07 budget.
8.
Australia is a regular reporter of GFS data for publication in IFS and the GFS Yearbook.
Cash data from the Department of Finance Monthly Financial Statements are used for
publication in IFS.
E. Monetary and Financial Statistics
9.
Data are reported to the Fund by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) on a monthly
basis and cover operations of the RBA and those of the trading and savings banks. The accounts

- 45 -

ANNEX III

of other deposit-taking institutions are not included. To compile these data, the RBA uses several
unpublished data sources, some of which are produced on a quarterly basis. Therefore, monthly
data published in IFS are partly based on estimates. The RBA advised it was not at present in a
position to submit the new Standardized Report Forms for monetary statistics.
F. External Sector Statistics
10.
The ABS is working to further enhance the coverage of trade in services, especially in
education. The timeliness of the international investment position (IIP) statistics has been
improved by releasing the data one quarter earlier. There have also been revisions to IIP data as a
result of improved reporting and the identification and correction of errors. The estimates in the
July 2004 issue of the Balance of Payment and International Investment Position are presented
on a calendar year basis, which will allow for better analysis in terms of international
comparisons as data for most other countries are available on a calendar year basis. In addition,
quarterly External Debt Statistics are now also available in the Balance of Payment and
International Investment Position publication.
11.
The ABS is currently conducting a survey on Australia’s foreign currency exposure, an
update to the 2001 survey. The purpose is to provide updated statistics on Australian enterprises’
foreign currency exposure, the level of risks associated with that exposure due to adverse
movements in the exchange rates, and the extent to which hedging is used to mitigate the risks.
The results are expected to be published in October 2005. In future, it is expected that the foreign
currency exposure survey will be updated every three years, subject to funding being available.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation
with Australia
On August 29, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Australia.1
Background
Australia has implemented wide-ranging structural reforms and strengthened the frameworks for
monetary and fiscal policies over the past two decades. As a result, Australia’s economic
expansion is now in its 14th year, with growth averaging 3¾ percent owing to a combination of
strong job creation and high productivity growth. Inflation has remained low and the consistent
fiscal surpluses in recent years have contributed to the elimination of net public debt.
Real GDP rose by 3¼ percent (y/y) in 2004, but growth slowed in the second half of 2004.
The slowdown mostly reflected a deceleration of domestic demand following a welcomed
cooling of the housing market, with housing prices slowing from an annual average growth of
17½ percent in 2001–03 to being largely flat in the year to March 2005. As a result,
consumption growth moderated and dwelling investment fell. Business investment remained
buoyant, reflecting high levels of profitability and capacity utilization. Employment has grown
strongly, at 3 to 4 percent in 2005, reducing unemployment to a 28-year low of 5 percent, with
no sign of generalized wage pressures.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2The external current account deficit widened to 6½ percent of GDP in 2004 as payments to
foreign investors rose owing to high mining sector profits. The trade balance was stable, with
increases in the terms of trade to historically high levels offsetting the strong growth in imports
following the large exchange rate appreciation in 2002-03. In the first quarter of 2005, the real
exchange rate stood 16 percent above its average level since 1990. Export volume growth was
limited to 4 percent despite the strong global demand for commodities, partly as a result of
constraints on mine capacity and on transportation infrastructure in some areas. The current
account was financed mainly through external debt issues by financial institutions, with net
external liabilities rising to 65 percent of GDP.
CPI inflation has been steady at about 2½ percent, with a waning of the effects of the exchange
rate appreciation on tradable goods prices balanced by a modest easing in the inflation rate of
nontradable goods. Having kept interest rates on hold since late 2003, the Reserve Bank of
Australia (RBA) raised the target cash rate by 25 basis points to 5½ percent in March 2005, to
lean against a projected rise in inflation to about 3 percent by the end of 2006.
The fiscal position continued to be strong. In the 2005 budget released in May, the government
projected the underlying cash balance to reach 1.1 percent of GDP in 2004/05, compared with
the surplus of 0.3 percent of GDP projected in the 2004 budget. Revenue is projected to be
almost 1 percent of GDP higher than budgeted, with company taxes particularly buoyant, partly
reflecting the boost in profits from rising export commodity prices.
Growth is expected to rise from 2¼ percent in 2005 to about 3½ percent in the medium term,
although this will require continued strong growth in productivity. Domestic demand growth will
likely remain moderate as stimulus from the housing market fades, while exports are expected
to strengthen as substantial investment in the export sector boosts capacity. As a result, the
external current account deficit is expected to decline back to its historical average of about
4½ percent of GDP in the medium term even as part of recent terms of trade gains unwind
owing to increases in the global supply of commodities. While headline inflation may approach
3 percent in 2005 because of higher oil prices, the recent easing in domestic demand growth
suggests that underlying inflation will edge up only modestly before declining back towards the
middle of the target range in the medium term.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for the sustained strength of Australia’s
economic performance, which they attributed to an exemplary setting of economic policies and
institutions, supported by broad consensus on many issues. This includes wide-ranging
structural reforms implemented over the past two decades, along with a prudent and flexible
management of monetary and fiscal policies within transparent medium-term policy frameworks
that has helped enhance the resilience of the economy. Going forward, Directors encouraged
the authorities to continue with their structural reform efforts, in order to further raise productivity
and labor force participation and address the fiscal impact of an ageing population.
Directors concurred that the outlook for the economy is favorable. While growth had slowed
somewhat in the second half of 2004 owing to a welcome cooling of the housing market and the
earlier appreciation of the Australian dollar, the resumption of growth in early 2005 is expected

-3to continue, with demand underpinned by strong job creation and business investment.
Medium-term prospects for stronger growth in exports supported by high investment in the
resource sector, together with moderate growth in domestic demand, will tend to narrow the
large external current account deficit.
Directors viewed the current wait-and-see monetary policy stance of the Reserve Bank of
Australia as appropriate. While headline inflation may approach 3 percent in 2005 owing to
higher oil prices, underlying inflation is likely to remain consistent with the authorities’ targets
over the medium term, given the moderation in domestic demand growth. Directors welcomed
the stabilization of the housing market in 2004 and 2005, together with the easing in household
credit growth, which partly reflected astute and timely policy actions. Nevertheless, close
monitoring of the housing market and household sector finances will need to continue.
Against this background, Directors welcomed the continued improvement in risk management
techniques by banks, and supported the timely refinements of prudential regulations in
response to the emergence of nonstandard household lending. To preserve the soundness of
Australia’s financial sector, they encouraged continued efforts to enhance financial regulation,
and welcomed the authorities’ commitment to using the forthcoming FSAP to help identify
reform priorities.
Directors agreed that Australia’s medium-term fiscal position is robust, with the underlying fiscal
surplus projected at almost 1 percent of GDP on average over the next four years, partly
reflecting large increases in export commodity prices. Since not all of these gains may be
lasting, Directors considered the allowance for a substantial decline in export prices in the
medium-term revenue projections of the 2005 budget to be appropriately prudent. They also
welcomed the tax reductions in the past two budgets, which, by contributing to a mildly
expansionary fiscal stance, may have helped cushion the recent slowing in growth.
Directors considered that exchange rate flexibility will continue to play a key role in tempering
the impact of possible shocks on growth, including those that might arise from a rapid reversal
in recent terms of trade gains. They also supported the free operation of the automatic fiscal
stabilizers and the readiness of monetary policy to respond flexibly to external or domestic
shocks. Directors noted the role that extensive foreign currency hedging is playing in
contributing to the resilience of the economy to substantial exchange rate fluctuations. At the
same time, Directors concurred that the high level of private external debt, in the context of
sustained current account deficits, requires continued close monitoring.
Directors considered that Australia’s strong track record of successful implementation of
structural reforms bodes well for addressing the significant economic challenges that lie ahead
from an ageing population and rising healthcare costs. They endorsed the authorities’ strategy
to address those challenges through further reforms to boost medium-term growth, and hence
the revenue base, complemented by measures to enhance the sustainability of expenditure.
Directors observed that Australia’s sound economic outlook and robust fiscal position create an
exceptional opportunity to implement these reforms.
Directors accordingly welcomed the measures announced in the 2005 budget to expand labor
force participation by encouraging the transition from welfare to work. They supported the

-4proposed reforms of the industrial relations system aimed at further improvements in labor
market flexibility that would facilitate additional gains in productivity and employment. The
authorities should also continue efforts to raise labor force participation among the population
aged over 55 to moderate the impact of population ageing on the outlook for employment and
growth.
To further raise productivity and incomes toward those in the leading economies, Directors
recommended the adoption of an ambitious new reform agenda in key infrastructure sectors. In
particular, steps to improve the price signals for water, land transportation, and electricity would
enhance incentives for their efficient use and stimulate timely investments to expand
infrastructure capacity. The importance of stronger competition in the communications sector
and increased research and development was also highlighted.
Directors welcomed the recent reforms of pharmaceutical benefits and Medicare as important
steps to address rising healthcare costs, which are the main source of long-term fiscal
pressures. Further efforts to enhance the sustainability of healthcare spending will nevertheless
be needed, and Directors encouraged the authorities to explore how incentives in the health
system could be strengthened to improve healthcare productivity growth. Directors agreed that
the proposed Future Fund, by covering unfunded public service pension liabilities, and
operating in accordance with international best practices, is also set to play a valuable role in
meeting long-term fiscal challenges.
Directors commended Australia’s commitment to trade liberalization under the Doha Round,
and the increase in official development assistance. They encouraged the authorities to
continue to make progress toward the United Nations target.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report for the Article IV consultation with
Australia may be made available at a later stage if the authorities consent.
