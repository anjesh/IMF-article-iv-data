STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
November 30, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Prospects: In the near term, growth will be stimulated by public investments in
infrastructure, bringing on stream new oil developments, and by the recovery of
agriculture from the 2011 drought. In the medium term, oil production is expected to
rise from 120,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2011 to about 180,000 bpd in 2015–17, with
a corresponding increase in exports and government revenues. However, absent further
oil discoveries, proven reserves will be exhausted in twenty years. This highlights the
need for diversifying exports and improving the business climate for the non-oil sector.
Oil dependence: Oil accounts for over 70 percent of fiscal revenues, 90 percent of
exports of goods, and 35 percent of GDP. As a result, Chad is vulnerable to revenue
losses in case of an oil revenue drop. This underscores the need for a savings buffer.
Food security: The 2011 drought exposed more than one million Chadians to severe
food shortages, prompting international humanitarian assistance. This experience
underscored the need for a national strategy to strengthen resilience to shocks. The cost
of ensuring food security should be evaluated and provided for in the budget.
Fiscal policy: In 2011, budget discipline improved, allowing for setting aside some
resources as a savings buffer. These gains were short-lived. In 2012, budget discipline
weakened and fiscal policy became expansionary. To achieve sustainability, fiscal policy
should aim at a gradual tightening of the non-oil primary deficit to build a savings buffer
against an oil revenue shock, and smooth the transition to the post-oil era.
Debt sustainability: The external public debt-to-GDP ratio rose from 25 percent in 2010
to 26½ percent in 2011, and will likely rise further over the medium term, reflecting the
expected borrowing under the $2 billion (18 percent of 2012 GDP) Master Facility
Agreement signed in 2011. To mitigate the associated risk of debt distress, foreign
debt-financed investment spending should be paced, taking into account absorptive
capacity constraints and the anticipated decline in oil revenues over the long term.

INTRODUCTION

1.

Despite the tensions across the Sahel region, Chad’s security situation has been

improving. Episodes of ethnic strife along the Chad-Libya border are still occasionally reported
and developments in Mali and Nigeria point to elevated security threats. However, peace with
Sudan holds and the pockets of the 2008 rebellion are reported to have disappeared.
2.

Nonetheless, because of past armed conflicts, the 2011 drought, and the recent

floods, many residents are in need of humanitarian assistance. Hundreds of thousands
displaced by armed conflicts in Chad and in the neighboring countries live on a nearly
permanent basis within Chad’s borders.1 The 2011 drought exposed over one million people to
severe food insecurity. The floods of 2012, the full impact of which is yet to be assessed, affected
700,000 people and damaged a significant share of crops.
3.

Recent political developments were marked by personnel changes among

high-level civilian and military ranks and a prolonged strike by public sector employees. In
the first half of 2012, high-profile arrests and dismissals, mainly in response to allegations of
corruption, led to the replacement of several cabinet members and senior government officials.
In late July, public sector employees went on strike demanding large wage increases
(100 percent over three years). So far, the government has resisted these demands. However,
protests resumed in late October.

II.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

Economic performance in 2011–12 has been marked by coming on stream of several large
industrial projects. A severe drought provoked a decline in agricultural production, causing
a food security crisis and a sharp increase in inflation in late 2011. Some needed fiscal
consolidation was achieved in 2011 but was largely reversed in 2012.
4.

Growth slowed in 2011 and inflation accelerated at year’s end, while the balance-

of-payments strengthened. After a strong recovery in 2010, real GDP growth slowed to
1.7 percent in 2011 as oil production resumed its downward trend and agricultural production
1

According to the UNHCR, there are more than 300,000 refugees from the Darfur province of Sudan and from
the CAR and over 100,000 internally displaced persons, including returnees from Libya, living in Chad.

was affected by the drought in the Sahel region. The drought also pushed up the prices of food
and the overall consumer price inflation accelerated to about 11 percent (year-on-year) at year’s
end. Helped by the high international prices of crude oil and the completion of several large,
foreign-financed industrial projects, the overall balance of payments posted a surplus.
5.

The non-oil primary deficit (NOPD) declined in 2011 and the overall fiscal balance

swung from a deficit to a small surplus leaving room for private sector credit expansion.
The NOPD was reduced from 31.2 percent of non-oil GDP in 2010 to 28.1 percent in 2011 as a
result of lower security and investment spending. This reduction, although short of the original
budget target (18.6 percent of non-oil GDP), was a positive development (Box 1). Helped by
soaring oil prices, the overall fiscal balance (commitment basis, excluding grants) shifted from a
double-digit deficit in 2010 to a small surplus in 2011. Broad money grew by 12 percent, in
parallel with the non-oil nominal GDP. Credit to the economy increased by about 19 percent.
Box 1. Chad: The Implementation of the 2011 Article IV Recommendations
Fiscal policy and sustainability: Staff called for a supplementary budget aiming to contain the non-oil
primary deficit to about 26 percent of non-oil GDP in 2011, as a step toward attaining a sustainable fiscal
position over the medium term. The authorities adopted a supplementary budget with an NOPD target
significantly higher than recommended by staff. Some effort was made to reduce the NOPD relative to the
2010 outturn; however, in 2012, fiscal policy reverted to an expansionary stance.
Public financial management (PFM): Priority measures recommended in this area included: (i) restricting
the use of emergency spending procedures (DAO); (ii) eliminating payments to government suppliers in
excess of budget allocations; and (iii) observing the public procurement code. Staff also recommended
focusing PFM reforms on harmonizing local practices with the new Economic and Monetary Community of
Central Africa (CEMAC) guidelines. The recourse to DAOs diminished in 2011, but increased again in 2012,
leading to a surge in extra-budgetary spending. No significant progress has been made in other areas.
Policy environment for new enterprises: Staff advised the authorities to ensure that the newly created
public enterprises and enterprises partly owned by the state (notably, the oil refinery) operate on a
commercial basis and are financially viable. The authorities continue to interfere with pricing decisions of
these enterprises, leading to losses and increasingly costly subsidies from the budget.
Strengthening financial sector stability and development: The 2011 FSAP proposed measures to ensure
financial sector stability (Box 7). The authorities recapitalized two state-owned banks and a third state-owned
bank is being restructured. There was no progress on other recommendations related to cash flow and
public debt management, access to credit, the legal and judicial framework, and the pension sector.

In 2012, economic activity is estimated to have rebounded. Real GDP growth of

5.4 percent is driven by the coming on stream of several industrial projects, including the impact of
a full year of operation of the Djermaya oil refinery, which started production in mid-2011, and the
opening of the Baoré cement plant. Favorable weather conditions spurred a recovery in agricultural
output, which should yield an increase in the main crops, if the effects of the recent floods are
contained. Oil production is expected to stabilize following the first full year of production at the oil
field operated by the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). Oil production and exports by
the Exxon-led consortium are expected to continue their downward trend. As the food crisis
receded, inflation started to decline. Food prices are expected to ease in the last quarter, as new
crops reach the market, and inflation to drop to about 6 percent at year’s end.
Food security
7.

The 2011 drought and the recent floods prompted the authorities to define a national

strategy to strengthen the resilience of the Chadian economy to weather shocks. A new
approach, developed in collaboration with international partners (including FAO and WFP), focuses
on improving water management, warehouse capacity, and information systems (Box 2).
Box 2. Chad: Food Security and the Path to Resilience
Chad is highly sensitive to food production shocks due to natural disasters. The 2011 drought caused a
50 percent drop in cereal production (to 1.6 million tons), leaving the country in need of 455,000 tons. It also led to
the drying up of pastures and drinking-water for livestock. As a result, 2.5 million Chadians became exposed to food
insecurity (based on the WFP definition) starting in late 2011 until mid-2012, and 1.2 million, mainly in the Sahel
zone, faced severe food insecurity (Annex I). In mid-2012, the weather shifted to the other extreme, with floods
covering seven percent of farm-land and affecting 700,000 people in thirteen of Chad’s twenty-two regions.
Multiple sources of funding and logistic support were mobilized to alleviate food shortages. In December
2011, the government declared a drought-related emergency and made a call to the international community for aid.
The international community donated $386.2 million in food assistance. (The biggest contributors were the United
States and the European Union). The government mobilized CFAF 8.8 billion ($17.4 million) to distribute food to the
regions in need. As of September 2012, the government allocated CFAF 1 billion ($2.0 million) for flood victims.
Recent weather shocks have prompted the government to broaden its food security efforts from emergency
response to strengthening the resilience of the Chadian economy to such shocks. Many projects aiming to build
resilience to the extremes in weather are underway to improve irrigation and water management, warehouse capacity
and information systems for the government, development partners, and farmers.

Fiscal performance in 2012
8.

The 2012 budget aimed at a significant fiscal consolidation, consistent with the path

toward the medium-term sustainability. The 2012 budget envisaged an NOPD below 20 percent
of non-oil GDP, as recommended during the 2011 Article IV consultation. However, the budget
lacked sufficient provisions to achieve its objectives. In particular, it underestimated problems with
revenue collection (mainly due to the proliferation of arbitrary exemptions and weaknesses in
customs administration) and recurrent spending pressures that had led to a significant overrun in
2011. These included a larger-than-budgeted-for energy bill (mainly, fuel subsidies for electricity
generation), subsidies for other public enterprises, and spending on security and investment.
Contingent provisions, notably, to deal with the food security crisis, also proved insufficient.2
9.

As a result, a large fiscal slippage was registered in the first eight months of 2012.

Non-oil revenue collection through August was three percent lower than the amount registered in
January–August 2011. At the same time, the domestically-financed non-interest expenditure
(commitment basis) through August was by seven percent higher than in January–August 2011,
including nearly six percent of non-oil GDP in extra-budgetary spending, mainly on investment and
purchases of goods and services. This performance was not consistent with the intended fiscal
consolidation and signaled that the annual budget NOPD target was beyond reach.
10.

The more relaxed fiscal stance was confirmed in a 2012 supplementary budget,

adopted in October. The revised NOPD target is 28.1 percent of non-oil GDP (compared with
19.7 percent in the original 2012 budget). The overall deficit could reach 8 percent of non-oil GDP
(compared with a small surplus in 2011). Supplementary budget appropriations cover mostly
subsidies for the electricity company and other public enterprises, security spending, and large
unidentified “centralized expenditure”, to be financed by drawing down deposits at the BEAC.
11.

Even the revised NOPD target is subject to risks. The supplementary budget may

underestimate (by about 1 percent of non-oil GDP) a likely non-oil revenue shortfall. Additional

2

During the discussions on a possible staff-monitored program in April 2012, it was estimated that, to accommodate
these budgetary pressures, the NOPD would need to be relaxed to at least 23 percent of non-oil GDP (Box 3).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CHAD

spending may arise from wage pressures and subsidies to state-owned enterprises. Absent a major
adjustment in the final quarter of the year, the NOPD could exceed 29 percent of non-oil GDP.

Box 3. Chad: 2012 Discussions on a Staff-Monitored Program
The authorities initiated discussions on a staff-monitored program to lay down a track record for an ECF
program in 2013.1 These discussions proved inconclusive as the authorities decided to implement the Master
Facility Agreement (MFA) signed with the Eximbank of China in August 2011 (see below).
Improved fiscal performance in 2011 created the basis for discussions on a staff-monitored program
(SMP), which were held at the margins of the 2012 Spring Meetings. The proposed SMP
(covering April-December 2012) aimed at an NOPD target of 23 percent of non-oil GDP in 2012. It included
several measures to improve PFM: (i) reconciliation of the net government position vis-à-vis the banking system
prepared by the public treasury with the position calculated by the BEAC; (ii) preparation of the monthly treasury
cash-flow plan; (iii) provision of data on all contracts related to external investment projects; and (iv) compilation
and centralization of data on public external and domestic debt.
Discussions on an SMP could not make progress. The MFA with the Eximbank of China is not compatible with
standard IMF program requirements and, more broadly, with the HIPC Initiative objectives. The MFA ($2 billion,
or 18 percent of the 2012 GDP) is problematic for several reasons: (i) the borrowing terms fall short of the
standard concessionality requirement; (ii) collateralization of payment obligations subordinates other creditors,
violates the existing negative pledge clauses (e.g., in the World Bank debt instruments), and contravenes the
reserve surrender requirements under the BEAC law; and (iii) the disbursement of the MFA, especially over a
short period, would nearly double the external debt of Chad and significantly raise the risk of debt distress,
making it incompatible with debt sustainability objectives. The non-concessionality of the MFA and its impact on
debt sustainability are also seen by other creditors (e.g., the Paris Club and the African Development Bank) as an
obstacle to Chad’s achieving debt relief under the HIPC Initiative. Despite these concerns, the authorities
informed staff in late June that all conditions for the MFA to become effective had been met and that they
intended to implement the MFA. This position was confirmed during the Article IV mission in September.
1 Given the track record previously accrued by Chad under the PRGF, after reaching the decision point in May 2001, at least six months of satisfactory
performance under an ECF would be required to reach the HIPC completion point, provided that all the other HIPC triggers are met, which was the case
several years ago; however, a recent assessment indicates that there was some back-tracking on several triggers, notably in the area of health-the
implementation status of the HIPC is currently being reviewed by the World Bank staff. Also, a full year of a successful implementation of a poverty
reduction strategy (PRS) would be required; the new PRS is under preparation.

III. PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
Budget overruns were induced by weak treasury management and the repeated use of
emergency spending procedures. PFM reforms stalled. Subsidies to public enterprises surged,
and the policy framework for public enterprises remains a challenge.

Inadequate preparation of the budget and its bypassing with the frequent use of

domestically financed spending (excluding
wages and debt service). Investment and
spending on goods and services accounted
for the bulk of the DAOs.

PFM reforms stalled. The authorities started streamlining the treasury operations by closing

nonessential government accounts and broadening the reach of the treasury single account.
However, in June 2012, an in-depth review of treasury reforms showed that most of the intended
measures had not been implemented. As a result, the introduction of the treasury cash flow plan
was postponed until 2013. Also, the authorities backtracked on their intentions to improve the
procurement system, which largely relies on non-competitive bids. Finally, no progress was made on
budget transparency; the authorities have yet to submit to parliament the report on past budget
execution (Loi de règlement), delayed now for many years.
Subsidization policy toward public enterprises
14.

Subsidies to public enterprises are widespread, have increased markedly in 2012, and

represent a major drain on the budget. Preliminary estimates suggest that subsidies for public
enterprises rose from 3.4 percent of non-oil GDP (8.8 percent of domestic non-wage primary
spending) in 2011 to 4.8 percent of non-oil GDP (12.1 percent of domestic non-wage primary
spending) in 2012. In addition to the traditional recipients of subsidies, such as the electricity and
water companies and the cotton parastatal, the list of subsidized enterprises now includes new
companies, such as the cement plant, the oil refinery, the tractor assembly plant, and the fruit juice
company. All these companies sell their products and services at prices significantly below cost
recovery levels.

The petroleum pricing policy remains a challenge for Chad’s industrialization strategy

and a source of vulnerability for the budget. After the opening of the oil refinery in mid-2011, the

Nevertheless, subsidization of gasoline continues,
and is encouraging smuggling (e.g., at the pump,

gasoline is 30 percent cheaper in Chad than in Cameroon and 50 percent cheaper than in the
Central African Republic). IMF technical assistance recommended, among other things, finding an
export outlet for the refinery excess production and allowing it to increase its capacity use
(current level is about 20 percent) (Box 4).

Box 4. Chad: The Djermaya Oil Refinery—Issues in Petroleum Taxation and Pricing
An FAD technical assistance mission visited Chad in May 2012 to assess petroleum sector revenue
management and to provide FARI model-based cash flow projections for the oil refinery. The refinery started
production in June 2011 with a processing capacity of 1 million tons per year. It is owned by the Société de
Raffinage de N'Djaména (SRN) SA, a joint-venture company between CNPC (60 percent) and the Chad government
(40 percent) via the state-owned oil company (SNH). The main findings were as follows:



Economic viability of the refinery. Despite its relatively small size, the refinery is economically viable.
This is due in part to high international oil prices but also to the fact that Chad is a landlocked country and
importing fuel is very expensive. Under the current outlook, the integrated (oil production and refining) operation
has the potential to generate revenues for the government and profits for the private operator.



The importance of finding export markets. The sustainability of this operation depends heavily on
exporting a significant share of the production to neighboring markets (Nigeria, Cameroon and the CAR).


Scope for limited retail price subsidies. The scope for selling refined products on the domestic market at
a discount, relative to the international prices, and still generating profits for the private operator as well as revenue
for the government also depends crucially on exporting a significant share of the refinery's production.

16.

Agriculture is also a large recipient of subsidies. These include price subsidies for

fertilizers, direct support for microfinance, and for the mechanization of agriculture (with the use of
the locally assembled tractors). Moreover, transformation enterprises (e.g., in textiles and fruit
processing) are also receiving subsidies.

Authorities’ views
17.

The authorities recognize that PFM problems affect budget execution. They see the

need to improve budget preparation, to strengthen its credibility, and to eliminate repeated
extra-budgetary spending. PFM reforms are viewed as important but lack of technical capacity is
impeding their implementation.
18.

The authorities acknowledge that continued subsidization of public enterprises is

problematic. Adjustments to retail prices of cement and petroleum products are being considered.
The authorities also agree that finding an export outlet for the excess production of the refinery
would help improve its financial performance. In view of the exceptionally high electricity tariffs in
Chad, they consider important to maintain, or even increase, electricity subsidies. They expect
planned investments in power generation and distribution to improve the financial situation of the
energy sector. The authorities intend to re-focus the support for agriculture in the context of the
strategy to increase resilience of the Chadian economy to weather shocks.

IV. MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK
The expected significant increase in oil production in the next few years relaxes somewhat the
sustainability constraints. However, building a savings buffer to mitigate the impact of oil
price volatility and to smooth government spending remains important.
19.

Prospects of new oil production coming on stream are central to the medium term

outlook. Based on information from CNPC, Exxon, and Griffiths (a small Canadian operator), oil
production is expected to increase from
120,000 bpd in 2011 to a peak of nearly 190,000

developments, oil production would start
diminishing already in 2016. Staff estimates that
government revenues from oil will rise to about
30 percent of non-oil GDP in 2015 and will fall
gradually to about 20 percent of non-oil GDP by
2017, owing to the projected drop in international

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

CHAD

oil prices and the expected reversion of oil production to a downward trend.3
20.

Public investments in infrastructures and an increase in cotton production are key

drivers for non-oil growth over the medium-term. The recent restructuring of Cotontchad is
expected to lead to a recovery in cotton output to its historical levels, and to an increase in non-oil
exports. However, the rehabilitation of the cotton industry is unlikely to compensate for the trend
decline in oil production. Other non-oil exports must be developed to ensure external sustainability
(Box 5).
21.

Prospects for additional oil revenue offer a considerably larger fiscal space over the

medium term. With the new developments coming on stream and higher international oil prices, oil
revenue over the medium term (2013–17) is now projected to be $5 billion higher than projected
last year, of which $4 billion is expected to come from new oil developments. This suggests that the
desirable medium-term NOPD path could be somewhat more relaxed than recommended in the
2011 Article IV consultation.
22.

Despite this improved outlook, Chad continues to be vulnerable to volatile oil

revenues. Oil accounts for more than 70 percent of fiscal revenues, about 90 percent of total
exports of goods, and 35 percent of GDP. Government revenue from oil (including corporate income
tax) is more volatile than oil prices and export receipts. Most notably, a 50 percent drop in
international oil prices in 2009 entailed a nearly 75 percent drop in government oil revenues.
A significant drop in oil prices may also stifle the development of new oil projects and lead to
a production cutback by the incumbent producers, presenting the authorities with the need for
a sharp fiscal adjustment. Oil production and revenue transfers are also subject to uncertainty.4

3

These estimates are preliminary and should be verified and confirmed by an in-depth analysis of the production
and cost recovery profile of these new oil fields.
4

The revenue uncertainty is partly related to moving in early 2012 from collecting oil royalties in cash toward
collecting them in kind and to contracts with new oil producers being of different type (the contract with Griffiths is
based on production sharing, while contracts with the Exxon-led consortium and the CNPC are of tax/royalty kind).

Box 5. Chad: Exchange Rate and External Competitiveness Assessment
Chad’s external competitiveness is heavily influenced by a number of exogenous factors, including oil prices
and the euro/US dollar exchange rate. Competitiveness is also affected by a narrow domestic non-oil production
base, significant natural barriers to trade, and weak institutions.
Real Effective Exchange Rate

CEMAC

60

In recent years, Chad’s real effective exchange rate (REER)
has been tracking closely the CEMAC’s gradually
appreciating REER, with minor deviations reflecting
mainly fluctuations in Chad’s inflation path compared to
the region’s average. Thus, staff’s assessment of CEMAC’s
external sustainability and non-oil REER also applies to
Chad, suggesting that, under current policies, Chad’s
REER is broadly in line with fundamentals (SM/12/122).

40

This is confirmed by applying various CGER
methodologies for Chad, placing its non-oil REER at
1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010

modified methodology, based on Bems/de Carvalho Filho
(2009), Chad’s non-oil REER is overvalued by about
4–5 percent, slightly below the REER in the CEMAC area as a whole. The test relies on a current account norm
derived from the assumption that oil wealth is used for smoothing intertemporal consumption. Both norms
disregard investment expenditure, which accentuates estimated overvaluation if the medium-term current account
is heavily influenced by public investment (as is the case in Chad), even if the investment is sound.
20

2005 = 100

0

Chad’s strong oil-export driven external position projected over the medium term may result in further appreciation
of its REER. Given the diminishing oil resource base in the long term, a prolonged continuation of this trend would
be harmful to Chad’s competitiveness. Chad’s fragile domestic production base, including for the traditional export
products, and high capital and productivity-adjusted labor costs in other sectors, suggest that a real depreciation
would help diversify its export production. However, given Chad’s membership in the currency union,
competitiveness should be enhanced mainly through measures to improve the business environment and
appropriate aggregate demand management (notably, fiscal policy).

For the methodological underpinning, refer to Lee et al. (2008), Exchange Rate Assessments: CGER Methodologies, IMF Occasional

Working Paper No. 09/281.

23.

Mitigating the risks of a sudden drop in oil revenues remains central to a prudent

medium-term fiscal strategy (Annex II). The recommended strategy aims at (i) smoothing
expenditure over the medium term; (ii) saving part of the oil revenue to create a financial buffer of at
least 15 percent of non-oil GDP by 2017 (from a very low level at end-2012, given the expected
draw-down of deposits implied by the execution of the revised 2012 budget) ; (iii) implementing tax
reforms and other measures to improve the business environment and help diversify revenue
sources away from oil; and (iv) keeping the investment program and subsidies manageable, given
absorptive capacity and fiscal sustainability constraints, and the need to ensure sufficient resources
for social spending programs. To achieve these objectives, the recommended adjustment over the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

CHAD

medium term would be anchored on a reduction of the NOPD to 14–15 percent of non-oil GDP by
2017. This adjustment is critical to achieving sustainability as it would ensure that, over time, the
authorities would have at their disposal a cushion sufficient to absorb the impact of a negative oil
price shock similar to that experienced in 2009 for at least one year (i.e., sufficient time to adjust if
the shock proves durable). The proposed adjustment would also help reduce the public debt-toGDP ratio from about 36 percent at end-2011 to about 32 percent by 2017. To this effect, it is also
assumed that the disbursement of the external project loans over the medium term is paced to
ensure long-term debt sustainability.5
24.

The recommended medium-term adjustment is feasible, and remains consistent with

the intermediate financing constraints. Since new oil developments are not expected to yield a
large increase in government revenue until 2015, the budget will be subject to a relatively tight
financing constraint in 2013–14, calling for a stepwise tightening of the NOPD by 3–4 percentage
points of non-oil GDP per year (starting with a reduction of the NOPD to 25 percent of non-oil GDP
in 2013).6 This adjustment could be achieved by (i) implementing measures to increase non-oil
revenue, including the elimination of the arbitrary tax and customs duty exemptions, measures to
improve revenue administration, and incentives for private companies to leave the informal sector;
and (ii) a reduction in subsidies and grants (mainly in subsidies for public enterprises and
exceptional security transfers) and in the domestically-financed investment spending (to be largely
offset by the additional foreign-financed investment spending under the MFA).
Authorities’ views
25.

The authorities count on the additional oil revenues to provide financing for

investment in infrastructure and creation of new enterprises, in particular, in the energy

5

The staff medium-term framework represents a normative (prudent) scenario and is also presented in the DSA
under an alternative scenario to determine conditions under which the MFA could be consistent with debt
sustainability. The DSA baseline scenario assumes that the MFA remains non-concessional and is disbursed over a
shorter period (five years), reflecting staff’s best understanding of the authorities’ policy intentions. In addition, the
authorities’ policy intentions would entail somewhat higher growth over the medium term.

6

In November, the authorities submitted to parliament a project of the 2013 budget with an NOPD target of
25 percent of non-oil GDP. However, this target is predicated on a significant increase in non-oil revenue.

sector. They emphasize the upside potential of the new oil developments and are of the view that
fiscal consolidation over the medium term would not be necessary. They also are not convinced of
the need to build a savings cushion. They appreciated Fund’s assistance in developing capacity for
oil revenue projections and expressed interest in further cooperation with Fund staff in this area.

V. DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
Additional oil revenues are expected to strengthen Chad’s debt servicing capacity and to allow
for more external borrowing (e.g., to finance public investment); however, the updated debt
sustainability analysis (DSA) shows that the $2 billion MFA exceeds the available space for
new borrowing and, if implemented on current terms, entails a high risk of debt distress.
26.

Overall public debt has been increasing rapidly in recent years. The public debt-to-GDP

ratio increased from just over 30 percent at end-2010 to about 36 percent at end-2011. This was
mainly due to a rapid increase in domestic public debt and non-concessional governmentguaranteed external debt to finance government stakes in new enterprises (e.g., the Djermaya oil
refinery and the Baoré cement plant). Public external debt is projected to increase over the medium
term, reflecting the expected disbursement under the MFA to finance the construction of a new
airport for N’Djamena and several other projects in transport infrastructure and in the energy sector.
The borrowing terms under the MFA are commercial and its repayment secured through the
collateralization of oil export receipts.7
27.

Implementing the MFA in its current form is inconsistent with debt sustainability

objectives. The updated DSA shows that the MFA entails a high risk of debt distress. This conclusion
holds even if the growth impact of the associated projects is taken into account and the fiscal
position is assumed to be adjusted to establish collateral required under the MFA. An alternative
scenario shows that all sustainability thresholds would be observed if the implementation of the
MFA was phased in over ten years and the terms of the MFA and of the subsequent borrowing were
sufficiently concessional. Nevertheless, even in that case, Chad would continue to face a moderate
risk of debt distress, due to the low level of non-oil tax revenue and exports and its exposure to oil
7

The financial terms of the MFA include an interest rate of 1.5 percent and a risk fee of 4.0 percent (on top of the
interest rate). The tenor of each loan is not to exceed 20 years, including the grace period of five years. Overall, the
implied grant element is 1.8 percent. For detailed description of the MFA, see Staff Report for the 2012 Article IV
Consultation—Debt Sustainability Analysis, ¶3.

price volatility. The DSA also shows that, absent further large oil discoveries, the ambitious
investment plans based on foreign borrowing over and above the 2011 MFA—such as the
construction of a trans-Chadian railway—would not be consistent with debt sustainability.
Authorities’ views
28.

The authorities downplay the debt sustainability concerns arising from the MFA. They

consider that new oil developments will generate a cash flow sufficient to meet debt obligations
under the MFA, which are secured by oil export receipts. They also point out that if the DSA were
conducted with the use of the revised national accounts, the PV of debt-to-GDP ratios would be
lower, indicating a higher space for additional borrowing than implied by staff projections.8 The
authorities also believe that the contemplated investments will have significant positive economic
externalities and a higher impact on non-oil growth.

VI. BUSINESS CLIMATE
Poor business climate continues to constrain private sector development in Chad. The shared
awareness of the problem between the local business community and the authorities is
promising but the task ahead appears daunting.
29.

Chad’s business climate is widely perceived as unfavorable to the development of the

private sector. The IFC ranks Chad 184th among 185 countries classified in its Doing Business 2013
report, with particularly low marks for starting a business, resolving insolvency, and paying taxes.
Transparency International’s 2011 Corruption Perception Index ranks Chad 168th out of a total of
183 countries. The 2011 Mo Ibrahim index, which summarizes the assessment of governance
performance in 53 African countries, puts Chad at the 52nd place.
30.

Most private enterprises in Chad operate informally, except a handful of

multinationals linked mainly to the oil sector. Local private sector includes small and
medium-sized enterprises, operating at the fringes of the economy, as well as large enterprises,
8

The authorities have produced new estimates for 2005–11 consistent with the 1993 System of National Accounts,
with actual data for 2005 and 2006, based on the 2005 input-output structure of the economy. The new GDP
estimates are 15–20 percent higher than the presently used figures (1995 basis), primarily due to a large increase in
the tertiary sector, reflecting broader coverage of activities and inclusion of estimates for the informal sector. Staff
encouraged the publication of the new national accounts by the National Institute of Statistics (INSEED). Staff plans
to adopt the new GDP estimates once they are put in use by the ministry of finance and the central bank.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CHAD

particularly in commerce or construction, many of them living off public contracts, but eluding
taxation. Formal private companies operate in a few niches of the economy, including telecoms,
sugar refining, or tobacco processing.
31.

Since 2011, several initiatives have been undertaken to improve the business climate.

The National Council of Employers of Chad (CNPT) has published a White Book, which identifies the
key obstacles to private sector development. These are: (i) lack of confidence in the rule of law;
(ii) inefficiency and unfairness in the application of the fiscal regime; and (iii) structural weaknesses,
including shortages and the high cost of energy, underdevelopment of finance and
telecommunications, and scarcity of qualified labor. The White Book also proposes a detailed reform
program for the improvement of the business climate (Box 6). Some efforts in this regard were
already made by the National Investment and Export Agency (ANIE), including the opening of a
“one-stop window” to facilitate the creation of new enterprises.
Box 6. Chad: The White Book of the CNPT—Selected Suggestions
The White Book of the CNPT takes stock of the measures that would help private sector develop its potential.
These include:
Legal environment:
- Ensure business security (legal and judicial) which is a prerequisite to investment
- Adopt more precise laws against abusive attribution of damages
- Engage in arbitration before any legal proceedings under the OHADA system
- Provide training for judges on the CIMA (Inter African Conference for the Insurance Market) Code
- Adopt an anti-corruption law
Tax and customs:
- Update the current General Tax Code by integrating different finance acts
- Develop a Fiscal Procedural Code and a Taxpayer Code
- Establish a regular publishing of fiscal laws and as well as tax and customs schedules
- Strengthen the rigor in revenue collection to reduce undue solicitation
- Professionalize customs services and eliminate the pseudo-official customs brigades
- Reduce the minimum presumptive tax and broaden its crediting beyond the corporate income tax
- Create tax incentives to make staying in the informal sector unattractive
Travel, logistics, and telecommunication:
- Lower taxes on airplane tickets to 5 percent from the current average of 40 percent
- Improve access to other sea ports (Cotonou, Port Sudan, etc.,) to create competition for Douala
- Enable the use of the fiber optic connection by all licensed telecom operators
- Foster the use of 3G technology to allow easy access to high-speed internet
- Foster training in telecom and information and communication technologies (ICT)
Human capital:
- Create an engineering school in electromechanical engineering, petroleum, and mining
- Ensure adequate social infrastructure for a skilled and healthy workforce to reduce labor costs

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CHAD

Authorities’ views
32.

The authorities have a more positive view of the business climate. They note that

insufficient information on Chad and the opportunities it offers is a factor in its unfavorable scores
and a deterrent to private investment. To bridge this information gap, the ANIE has been asked to
increase media outreach and other promotion activities. Following the endorsement of the CNPT’s
White Book at the highest political level, the authorities intend to consult further with the private
sector with a view to coining a consensus on a reform agenda.

VII. FINANCIAL SECTOR
Financial sector conditions have improved since the 2011 FSAP, owing to the recapitalization
of state-owned banks, strong growth of several private banks, and technological innovations,
including mobile banking and the increased use of other modern means of payments.
Nevertheless, private sector access to financial services remains difficult, and the large
exposure of the banking system to the government represents a major risk.
33.

The health of the financial sector has improved with the recapitalization of the state-

owned banks.9 As a result, the ratio of regulatory capital to risk-weighted assets increased from
6.7 percent to 19.7 percent. In addition, most banks in need of rehabilitation have developed
actions plans required by COBAC and fully endorsed by the 2011 FSAP; however, most other FSAP
recommendations, related, among others, to cash flow and public debt management, the legal and
judicial framework, and pension sector, have not been implemented (Box 7).
34.

Despite the strong growth of deposits in private banks (including two transnational

sub-Saharan African banks), financial intermediation remains low. At end-2011, the ratios of
broad money and private sector credit to non-oil GDP were about 23.5 percent and just above
10 percent of non-oil GDP, respectively.10 Also, other indicators show a very low level of financial
intermediation: fewer than 25 depositors per 1000 adults (compared to 200 for SSA), fewer than
3 borrowers per 1000 adults (compared to 50 for SSA), and less than 1 bank branch per 1000km2

9

The cost of bank recapitalization to the budget was about ¼ percent of non-oil GDP.

10

Private deposits accounted for about a half of broad money. All bank deposits (including government deposits)
were below 15 percent of non-oil GDP, in either case, significantly below the average for sub-Saharan Africa.

Box 7. Chad: Main Findings and Recommendations of the 2011 FSAP
Recommendations:

Follow-up:

Banking sector stability.
Finding: two banks have a negative equity.
Recommendation: the government should recapitalize
the banks and prepare a viable business plan.
Priority/Timeframe: High/Immediate.

Two of the three state banks have been recapitalized with
public and foreign capital, and action plans for
development of their bank activities have been prepared.
The third state bank is being restructured with the state
selling the majority of its share to the future acquiring
foreign investor.
A committee, created to monitor the net government
position (NPG) vis-à-vis the banking system,
recommended to include 45 additional accounts to the
NPG. It confirmed closure of 201 government accounts
that were inactive, while 7 others were closed and their
balances transferred to the Treasury account. The treasury
cash flow plan has not yet been elaborated and cash
management remains limited to the daily assessment of
the availability of funds.
The BEAC is actively trying to reduce delays in updating
financial information on borrowers in the credit registry
and is encouraging banks to accelerate their reporting of
data at the BEAC. More needs to be done to encourage
the use of the accounting system by businesses.

Cash flow and public debt management.
Finding: Poor government cash flows management leads
to financial vulnerabilities.
Recommendation: the government should establish,
under the leadership of the Ministry of Finance, with
active participation of the BEAC and line ministries, a
treasury committee to monitor the government’s cash
position.
Priority/Timeframe: High/Immediate.
Access to financial services.
Finding: Access to services is constrained by the lack of
adequate information on borrowers.
Recommendation: The BEAC should develop an adequate
credit reporting system and the government should
encourage the use of the accounting system by
businesses.
Priority/Timeframe: High/Medium term.
Legal and judicial framework.
Finding: The business community has no confidence in
the judicial system.
Recommendation: The government should establish a
credible inspector’s general office to investigate and
prosecute the corruption in the justice system and
introduce arbitration and mediation for dispute
settlement outside courts.
Priority/Timeframe: High/Near term.
Pension sector.
Findings: The National Retirement Fund (Caisse Nationale
des Retraites du Tchad or CNRT) has been technically
bankrupt for 20 years. The national Social Security Fund
(Caisse Nationale de Sécurité Sociale or CNPS) has an
overall surplus that could be used to increase the
purchasing power of pensioners and maintain the
financial viability of the pension system.
Recommendation: The government should repay its
debts to both funds and remain current on its future
obligations (Ministry of Finance). An actuarial study
should be conducted to help establish the long-term
financial viability of the system (Ministry of Labor).
Priority/Timeframe: High/Near term.

Application of banking regulation and commercial laws is
hampered by a lack of capacity and limited expertise of
officials in resolving commercial disputes. Thus, the
government still needs to establish a credible inspector’s
general office, favoring impartiality, independence, and
effectiveness in the legal and judicial system. Banks are
often condemned unfairly and abusively, which in some
cases results in confiscation of their accounts at the BEAC.
A law limiting such abusive practices is being developed.
The government has not yet paid its debts to the two
funds, and an actuarial study to establish the long-term
financial viability of the system has not yet been
undertaken.

Credit is expensive and resources for long-term financing are scarce, while banks’

exposure to the public sector remains a major risk. The government and some large enterprises
(mostly foreign-owned) receive credit at 7–8 percent (barely positive in real terms), while small

bank assets have a maturity of less than a
month and 70 percent less than a year).
Distribution of bank lending among various
economic activities is skewed toward

construction and the energy sector (both mostly funded from public sources or heavily dependent
on government subsidies) and commerce. The oil and gas sector, which contributes the largest share
of GDP, accounts for only 4 percent of bank credit, as international oil companies rely on offshore
sources of funding. The concentration of bank lending on government and its suppliers, which was
identified by the 2011 FSAP as a key risk, continues to expose the banking system.11
36.

Inadequate infrastructure (electricity and telecommunication) and legal system are key

impediments to financial deepening.12 The development of mobile banking should help increase
access to financial services. However, banks continue to be reluctant to offer credit, even against
legally recognized collateral, because of difficulties in exercising legal guarantees. In this regard,
Chadian bankers emphasize the importance of (i) strengthening the legal and judicial framework,
to ensure fair treatment of lenders in legal disputes; and (ii) improving the land tenure system and
developing a reliable cadastre, to increase the collateral pool. Finally, the development of the
11

The 2011 FSAP determined that (as of March 2011) about 70–80 percent of gross loans were extended to the
public sector, with the government being, directly or indirectly (through government suppliers, contract holders, or
public servants), the only significant banking client. Based on the information provided by individual banks during
the recent Article IV mission, it appears that this exposure has not changed significantly. The stress test performed by
the 2011 FSAP revealed that public debt service distress would have major consequences for bank capitalization.

12

Some progress has been made in the development of telecommunications infrastructure with the placement of the
international fiber optic connection. Its extension would enable banks to reach the population outside N’Djamena.

Islamic banking, so far non-existent in Chad, is seen as a way to increase financial intermediation by
tapping the savings of Chad’s large Muslim population.
Authorities’ views
37.

The authorities are satisfied with the steps taken to improve the condition of state-

owned banks and do not see the large banks’ exposure to the government as a problem.
Instead, they see the government as a reliable client of the banking system and as a major source
of liquidity and income for banks. However, they acknowledge that more could have been done to
shore up the finances of the pension system, to strengthen the credit registry, and to improve the
legal and judicial framework.
38.

The authorities emphasized that several initiatives are under way to deepen financial

intermediation. A strategy for improving access of small and medium-sized enterprises to credit
and lowering their borrowing cost is being validated by the government. A new approach is being
developed to ensure reimbursement of loans to microfinance institutions, while limiting the
involvement of the government funds. The authorities also intend to give a new role to the
state-owned development bank by turning it into a mortgage bank.

VIII. STAFF APPRAISAL
39.

The improved security situation, strong oil revenue receipts, and prospects for

additional oil production coming on stream over the next few years create a unique
opportunity for Chad to address its development and poverty reduction needs. To capitalize on
these favorable circumstances, Chad needs a medium-term strategy for transforming the oil windfall
into a source of sustainable growth for the non-oil economy, putting in place a market-oriented
policy framework for the new enterprises, and introducing public financial management reforms to
optimize the use of additional oil resources.
40.

Chad’s vulnerability to weather shocks came to the fore in the context of the 2011

drought and recent floods. Staff welcomes the broadening of the policy focus from the emergency
response toward building resilience. To this effect, the cost of implementing the contemplated
policies to address food security should be properly evaluated and provided for in the budget,
including sufficient appropriations for the replenishment of buffer stocks and the implementation of
a multi-pronged strategy to strengthen Chad’s resilience to weather shocks.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

CHAD

41.

The relatively good fiscal performance registered in 2011 helped steer the economy

toward medium-term sustainability; however, weaker fiscal discipline in 2012 reignited
concerns about the course of fiscal policy. The 2012 supplementary budget deviates from a
sustainable path. The envisaged expansion of the deficit also entails a draw-down of the deposits at
the BEAC and thus delays the realization of financial savings to protect Chad against the risk of a
downward shift in international oil prices.
42.

The authorities should uphold the central role of the budget as a fiscal policy

instrument and press ahead with PFM reforms. Currently, the budget does not accurately reflect
the government’s economic policies and the continued recourse to extra-budgetary spending
undermines the implementation of stated budget objectives. The lack of progress on PFM reforms
entails unnecessary costs. To remedy these shortcomings, the authorities should follow through on
the implementation of their PFM reform agenda. These reforms should be accompanied by the
strengthening of institutional, technical, and human capacities of the Ministry of Finance and Budget
(MFB) and the harmonization of local practices with the new directives of the CEMAC.13
43.

The early experience with the new public enterprises underscores the importance of

putting in place an appropriate market-oriented policy framework for these companies. The
authorities’ intention to reduce subsidies for public enterprises is welcome. However, to ensure that
these enterprises contribute to the development of a modern industrial fabric in Chad, they should
have a degree of freedom in price setting consistent with cost recovery. And, a regulatory
framework for healthy competition should be established in the sectors susceptible to monopolistic
practices. For the oil refinery, it remains crucial to find an export outlet for its excess production to
increase its capacity utilization and improve its financial condition.
44.

Public (domestic and external) debt level remains manageable for the time being, but

the authorities’ intention to scale up foreign debt-financed public investment entails an
elevated risk of debt distress. The authorities are encouraged to calibrate their public investment
policy, taking into account Chad’s debt service capacity and its high vulnerability to oil price shocks.
Being a low income country, Chad should seek highly concessional terms for its external loans. The

CEMAC members are expected to complete the transposition at the national level of the new CEMAC directives of
public financial management by December 31, 2013.

authorities are encouraged to seek to resolve the incompatibility between the MFA and debt
sustainability objectives.
45.

The 2013 budget should be anchored on the objective of medium-term fiscal

sustainability, taking into account the need to build a precautionary savings cushion. Given the
firm expectation of a significant increase in oil revenue from the new oil projects coming on stream
in the near term, staff currently recommends an NOPD path that is less constraining compared with
the path in the 2011 Article IV consultation. Nevertheless, starting with 2013 and over the medium
term, a gradual tightening of the NOPD would be required to offset the expected decline in oil
revenues over the long term. This gradual tightening would generate savings, primarily, to serve as
a cushion against an oil revenue shock, but also to help smooth the transition to the post-oil era.
46.

The publication of the White Book by the CNPT is an important step toward improving

Chad’s business climate. The authorities are encouraged to work closely with the business
community to further the agenda outlined in the White Book, in particular by improving the legal
environment for private enterprises, making tax policy more business-friendly, professionalizing tax
and customs administration, and developing the key elements of infrastructure.
47.

The recapitalization of state-owned banks improved financial stability indicators but

the concentrated exposure of banks to the public sector remains a source of risk. In the short
term, to mitigate this risk, banks are encouraged to continue holding capital buffers in excess of the
required minimum 8 percent. Looking forward, a durable solution to this problem would come from
greater private sector participation, which should be encouraged, including by setting incentives for
informal sector enterprises to migrate to the formal sector. Further, the strengthening of the
centralized credit registry would help contain credit risk, and the implementation of the anti-money
laundering framework would help strengthen governance.
48.

Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Chad be held on the

regular 12-month consultation cycle, in accordance with the decision on Article IV
consultation cycles.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By
Marcelo Giugale and
Jeffrey Lewis (IDA),
Mauro Mecagni and
Dhaneshwar Ghura (IMF)

Prepared by the staffs of the International Development
Association and the International Monetary Fund

Chad’s public domestic and external debt indicators have worsened since 2010 and the
large amount of non-concessional borrowing contracted in 2011 entails a high risk of
debt distress. The assumptions underpinning the debt sustainability analysis (DSA) have
been revised from last year to reflect significant increases in projected oil production,
prices, and related government revenues, and higher external borrowing. The latter
reflects mainly the expected implementation of the $2 billion non-concessional Master
Facility Agreement (MFA) signed with the Eximbank of China in August 2011. The
updated baseline scenario shows that, if the MFA is implemented in its current form, all
prudential thresholds will be breached within the projection horizon. An alternative
scenario shows that all prudential thresholds would be observed if: (i) the MFA were
concessional (with a grant element of 35 percent); (ii) it was implemented over ten years
(instead of five); and (iii) other external borrowing was drawn mainly from concessional
sources and its amount remained moderate.

CHAD

BACKGROUND
Recent Developments in Public External Debt
1.

Chad’s external public debt burden indicators improved considerably in 2001–09, thanks to the

strong oil-driven growth and low borrowing from abroad. Nonetheless, the drop in international oil prices
in 2009 pushed the external public debt-to-GDP ratio from about 20 percent in 2008 to 23 percent in 2009,
revealing Chad’s vulnerability to a negative oil price shock.
2.

In 2010–11, the authorities borrowed abroad on non-concessional terms and external (public and

publicly guaranteed) debt increased.1 As a result, the rate of debt accumulation (the year-to-year change in
present value (PV) of debt relative to previous year’s GDP) spiked between 2009 and 2010–11, in part due to
the low grant element of new borrowing (both from Libya and China). Because of a higher-than-anticipated
recourse to external borrowing (including guaranteed debt) and despite a better-than-anticipated overall fiscal
situation (a surplus of 1.6 percent of non-oil GDP), helped by the record-high oil revenues, the external public
debt-to-GDP ratio exceeded 26 percent at end-2011 (compared to 24 percent anticipated in the 2011 DSA).
3.

In August 2011, the authorities signed a Master Facility Agreement with the Eximbank of China

(MFA). The MFA is an umbrella contract for individual facilities that would be activated to finance eligible
projects for a total amount of up to $2 billion (or 18 percent of the 2012 GDP) over a five-year period. Projects
to be funded under the MFA include: (i) a new international airport for N’Djamena; (ii) a gas power plant
(100 MW); (iii) construction of 400–500 km of roads; (iv) a two-lane road bridge near N’Djamena; (v) cultivation
of 20,000 ha of agricultural land; and (vi) a cement plant (with a capacity of 600,000 tons per year). The financial
terms of the MFA are non-concessional. The borrowing terms include: (i) an interest rate of 1.5 percent; (ii) a risk
fee of 4.0 percent (a top up of the interest rate); (iii) a management fee (upfront) of 0.6 percent on each
individual facility; (iv) a commitment fee of 0.4 percent levied on the unutilized portion of each individual facility;
(v) the limit on the tenor of each facility not to exceed 20 years; and (vi) a grace period of five years. The
payment obligations under the MFA are collateralized on oil export receipts. Thus, the signing of the MFA is
significantly affecting the baseline scenario which was retained by staffs in the 2011 DSA.
1

Among others, the authorities took a $300 million loan from the Libyan Foreign Bank, which was disbursed over
2010-11 and guaranteed about $600 million of debts disbursed in 2010–11, comprising the loan to finance the 40 percent
share by the state oil company (SHT) in the oil refinery built by the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), and a
loan to finance state shares in the Baoré cement factory.

Sources: World Bank, Chadian authorities, selected creditors and staff estimates.

The end-2011 external public debt stocks are estimated by staff based on World Bank Debt Reporting System (DRS) end-2010
debt stock, Chad’s debt management office’s estimates of 2011 disbursements and amortization, and Ministry of Economy and
Planning estimates of 2011 project loan disbursements. The official external debt stock data underestimate the actual level of
external debt. Most notably, the debt registry captures the loan from Libya but not the associated debt service, and it does not
capture the loans from China for the state’s stakes in the joint-venture refinery and in the Baoré cement factory, and other
government-guaranteed debt. Also, project loan disbursements are recognized only after a long lag. Both text tables have
discrepancies with corresponding fiscal or balance of payments flow estimates, giving rise to residuals in the sustainability analyses.

Status of Implementation of Debt Relief Initiatives
4.

Poor macroeconomic policy performance prevented Chad from reaching the completion point

under the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. Chad reached the Decision Point
under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative in May 2001. Its inability to meet agreed fiscal targets and to implement a
program under the IMF’s Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) was a principal obstacle to debt relief.
The 2005 PRGF arrangement expired in 2008 without any reviews being concluded. Subsequent efforts to
resume the path toward debt relief with the support of IMF Staff-Monitored Programs (SMPs) were also
hindered by fiscal slippages and, more recently, by the decision to borrow externally in large amounts and on
non-concessional terms. Furthermore, Chad has not shown a satisfactory implementation record under the
poverty reduction strategy and progress towards other completion point triggers2 has either been slow or
inconsistent (with early gains followed by backsliding).

Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, May 4, 2001, pp. 29–31.

5.

Meeting the conditions for debt relief under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative and the Multilateral Debt

Relief Initiative (MDRI) would help reduce external debt in half (in nominal terms). MDRI relief would
cover the full stock of debt owed to three multilateral creditors (IDA, IMF, and the African Development Fund
(AfDF)). In nominal terms, this could total over $1 billion and would imply a reduction in debt service of about
$40 million per year, for about 30 years.3

Recent Developments in Public Domestic Debt
6.

The stock of public domestic debt has grown, mainly as a result of drawing on central bank

statutory advances and the sale of over CFAF 100 billion of five-year savings bonds. Chad’s domestic
debt is estimated at about CFAF 474.1 billion (9½ percent of GDP) at end-2011. The stock of public domestic
debt includes central bank statutory advances (avances statutaires); rescheduled debt (dettes conventionnées);
legal payment obligations (engagements juridiques); and two public bond issues. In addition, CFAF 56.4 billion
represent estimated short-term treasury arrears.4 In July 2011, the authorities completed a sale of over
CFAF 100 billion of five year savings bonds with a 6 percent coupon.5

The 2011 stock is estimated based on data at end-March 2012.

3

Since the last remaining portion of Chad’s debt owed to the IMF eligible for MDRI debt relief is due in July 2013, the IMF
would provide no debt relief under the MDRI if the completion point was delayed beyond that time.
4

The authorities made a significant effort to reduce domestic payment arrears in 2010, but payment arrears appear to
have resurged in 2011.
5

Sixty three percent of the issue was purchased by Chadian residents. Banks, local and regional, purchased two-thirds of
the issue. With accrued interest, the stock of this public bond is estimated at CFAF 121 billion at end-December 2011.

Debt Burden Thresholds under the Debt Sustainability Framework
7.

For the purpose of defining debt burden thresholds under the Debt Sustainability Framework

(DSF), Chad is a weak policy performer. Chad’s rating on the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment (CPIA) is 2.48 on average for 2007–2011 (on a scale from 1 to 6), down from 2.88 in 2005 to
2.43 in 2011.

DSA ASSUMPTIONS

Oil production and revenue: Chad’s medium- and long-term macroeconomic outlook is characterized

by a temporary sharp increase in oil production in 2014–17 and a steady decline of oil production over the
subsequent fifteen-year projection period (Box 1).6


Oil production is expected to rise from 120,000 bpd in 2011 to about 180,000 bpd in 2015–17. This
second oil boom will likely be temporary; proven reserves in the new fields are much smaller than
that in the original Doba basin and will also likely be nearly exhausted around 2030. Hence, oil
production and exports are projected to decline steadily to negligible levels beyond 2030.

6

Oil production at the Doba oilfield (exploited by the Exxon-led consortium) started in 2003, reached its peak of
63 million barrels in 2005 and, absent other oil developments, will decline with annual output projected to become
negligible beyond 2030. In 2011, oil production began at a second oil field, Bongor, operated by the CNPC
(only one-third the size of the Doba field). At present, Bongor produces crude oil at a rate of about 15,000 barrels per
day, as feedstock for the oil refinery, resulting in a near complete substitution of petroleum product imports. Exports of
crude oil from Bongor are expected to start within a year and reach 60,000 bpd in 2014. Oil from another smaller operator
(Griffiths, Canada) is expected to come on stream shortly thereafter.

Chad’s oil trades below the WEO reference price, reflecting a quality discount and transport cost.7
For the medium term (five-year horizon) the price of Chadian oil is assumed to drop from $103.7
per barrel (all discounts included) in 2012 to about $83.6 per barrel in 2016–17, in line with the
trend projected in the IMF’s World Economic Outlook (WEO). From 2018 onward, the price is
assumed to increase 3 percent per year in U.S. dollar terms (consistent with the assumption used
by the IMF in long-term projections for other sub-Saharan African countries).
Fiscal policy: The analysis assumes a buildup of financial savings in the medium term and a sustained

fiscal adjustment throughout the entire projection in transition to the post-oil era. The increase in oil production
is expected to lead to about $4 billion more in oil revenues for the government by 2017 than projected in the
2011 Article IV report, helping to maintain oil revenues above 25 percent of non-oil GDP until 2016. This would
be sufficient to generate savings of about $2 billion by 2019, if the non-oil primary deficit (NOPD) is reduced
from about 29 percent of non-oil GDP in 2012 to below 10 percent of non-oil GDP by 2019. Over the longer
term, it is assumed that dwindling oil revenues will be offset by a steady decline of total government primary
spending from 27 percent of GDP in 2012 to 18 percent in 2032 and the primary balance will be adjusted
gradually to reach a small surplus by 2032. This sustained process of adjustment is expected to be achieved
mainly by: (i) increasing non-oil revenues (from about 10 percent of non-oil GDP at present to over 15 percent
of non-oil GDP by 2032); (ii) reducing total investment outlays from over 20 percent of non-oil GDP to below
10 percent of non-oil GDP; and (iii) cutting recurrent spending, notably, by eliminating exceptional security
transfers and subsidies to public enterprises (at present, jointly accounting for about 9 percent of non-oil GDP).
10.

The DSA analysis is conducted in two stages reflecting different external financing

assumptions. First, a baseline (current policies) scenario reflects the stated intentions of the authorities to
implement the MFA on current terms, and therefore assumes that the full amount ($2 billion) is disbursed
within a five-year (2012–17) horizon. The baseline scenario also features continuation of the borrowing policy
on non-concessional terms beyond the medium term, with gross disbursement of about 3½ percent of GDP
per year (approximately the same level as projected for the MFA implementation period). Second, the analysis
aims at determining the conditions under which the implementation of MFA would be consistent with debt
sustainability. This alternative (prudent) scenario is consistent with the medium-term fiscal framework
recommended by staff and presented in the staff report.

The discount was fairly constant (about $6.50) until recently when it dropped to about $2.50 due to the disruption of oil
exports from South Sudan, which increased the demand for (a very similar) Chadian oil. This discount is expected to
rebound over the near term to its normal level.

Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions, 2012–2032
Baseline Scenario:
Real GDP growth is driven by a sharp growth of oil production in the next five years and a steady decline in oil
production over the following fifteen years. Large foreign-financed investments (see below) are assumed to raise
non-oil GDP growth in the medium term (6.5 percent in 2013–17). Beyond that, non-oil GDP growth is assumed
to stabilize at about 5.0 percent in the long term. Inflation is assumed to stabilize at 3 percent, consistent with
the CEMAC convergence criterion. The external current account will turn into a significant surplus in 2014–17,
with the increase in oil exports and the drop in imports related to the development of the new oil fields. With the
decline in oil exports, the external current account is projected to turn into a deficit.

The fiscal outlook features an increase in oil revenues in the medium term and their decline in the long term. The
authorities are assumed to reduce the NOPD to about 15 percent of non-oil GDP by 2017, and to generate
savings up to $2 billion, needed as collateral for the MFA.
External financing: (i) a $2 billion MFA with the Eximbank of China on non-concessional terms and its
implementation over 2012–17 (investments under the MFA are assumed to raise the non-oil GDP growth up by
about one percentage point during the MFA implementation phase and by about 0.5 percentage point beyond
2017); (ii) external project financing (grants and loans) of 5.5 percent of non-oil GDP on average per year beyond
2017. Grants (mainly for social programs) are assumed to stay constant in real terms and will decline to about
1 percent of non-oil GDP by 2030. Loans are assumed to be increasingly from non-traditional (non-Paris Club)
creditors, resulting in a decline of the average grant element of borrowing. In the absence of an IMF arrangement,
HIPC and MDRI debt relief for which Chad is eligible are not taken into account.
Domestic financing: reimbursements of BEAC statutory advances by 2022 (as per the newly revised agreement)
and the 2011 savings bond (Emprunt obligataire) by 2016. Additional domestic debt is assumed to be issued to
meet the residual financing needs during the period when a portion of oil revenue is being set aside as collateral
for the MFA. As a result, gross domestic debt rises from 9.5 percent of GDP in 2012 to about 11.5 percent in 2017.
Alternative Scenario:
Growth and inflation profile is broadly the same, with some differences in the first ten years reflecting mainly the
implementation of the MFA over ten years (instead of five). The fiscal outlook features the same degree of
consolidation over the medium term in NOPD terms (a maximum feasible rate of 2–3 percent of GDP per year).
External financing assumptions: (i) MFA with no collateral requirement and on concessional terms (grant
element of 35 percent); (ii) borrowing beyond MFA is also assumed to be on concessional terms with borrowing
scaled back to approximately a half of the amount projected under the baseline. Since savings are not assumed to
be related to the collateral requirements under the MFA, financing needs are met with lower additional domestic
borrowing, such that gross domestic debt is projected to decline to 6 percent of GDP by 2017.

EXTERNAL DEBT DSA
Baseline (Current Policies) Scenario
11.

The evolution of external debt is driven by the large volume of project loans, including the

MFA. Going forward, new borrowing is expected to be dominated by non-concessional project financing,
mainly from commercial or non-Paris Club official sources. This is predicated on the assumption that, absent a
substantial improvement in macroeconomic and public financial management performance, traditional donors
(multilaterals and Paris Club) will likely continue to provide roughly the same very low amount of concessional
loans (compared to other SSA countries), mainly for humanitarian and development projects. During the period
of MFA implementation, the average concessionality of new borrowing (assuming a discount rate of 3 percent)
would turn negative and stay so through the projection period (Figure 1a).
12.

The comparison of the current baseline scenario with the baseline featured in the 2011 DSA

reveals large differences reflecting a significant change in Chad’s borrowing policy (Figures 5–7). This
change was anticipated by staffs in the 2011 DSA. It was presented in a customized alternative scenario
featuring large non-concessional borrowing for public investment projects and drawing attention to the need
for proper assessment of their consequences for debt sustainability. The signing of the MFA confirmed the
importance of the risks anticipated by staffs in 2011.
13.

Under the baseline scenario, all external indebtedness indicators exceed their critical

thresholds, indicating a high risk of debt distress. The present value of external public and publiclyguaranteed debt exceeds the 30 percent of GDP threshold starting in 2016 through the end of the projection
horizon (Figure 1b). With the projected steady decline in oil exports beyond the 2013–16 horizon, the PV of
debt and debt service is expected to rise relative to exports, with the former projected to exceed the critical
threshold starting in 2018, and the latter in 2026. Both indicators would remain above thresholds through the
end of the projection period (Figures 1c and 1e). Similarly, the PV of debt and debt service in percent of
revenues exceed their respective thresholds in 2022 and 2025, respectively (Figures 1d and 1f).

Stress Tests
14.

Under the shock scenario assuming that key macroeconomic variables will remain at their ten-

year average values, the debt burden indicators would quickly breach the sustainability thresholds. This
suggests that if the authorities were to incur current account deficits far higher than foreign direct investment
(FDI) inflows in the oil sector (e.g., as they did in 2010, when they ran down their official foreign exchange

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CHAD

reserves), all three PV-based indicators would quickly breach the applicable thresholds by very high margins
(Historical Scenario in Figure 1b, c, d; and Scenario A1 in Table 3b).
15.

Chad’s external debt burden indicators are also highly sensitive to a negative shock to exports

(e.g., an oil price shock). Across all indicative debt burden thresholds, the most extreme shock is a drop in
export growth in 2013–14 (i.e., proportional to a two-standard-deviation lower oil price) (Most extreme shock in
Figure 1 and B2 Bound Test in Table 3b); debt would be on a path breaching all indicative debt burden
thresholds.
16.

Finally, a customized stress test shows that borrowing for other contemplated large capital

projects (beyond the 2011 MFA) would increase even further the risk of debt distress. In addition to the
$2 billion MFA (signed in August 2011), the authorities have signed a letter of intent with a Chinese contractor
for construction of an extensive railroad connection ($7 billion) linking through Chad the Cameroon and Sudan
networks. A customized analysis by staff shows that if the railway project started in 2014 and was implemented
over the next 10 years in addition to the projects covered in the 2011 MFA, and with no reduction in the
baseline level of spending and borrowing, the PV of debt-to-GDP path would breach the 30 percent threshold
in 2014 and peak in 2023 at 78 percent, implying a significantly increased risk of debt distress (Figure 1g). All
critical thresholds would be breached under the usual commercial terms (5.5 percent interest rate, 5 years grace
period, 20 years maturity) and also under the most concessional terms (36 percent grant element; 1.5 percent
interest rate, 5 years grace period, 20 years maturity).

Alternative (Prudent) Scenario
This scenario is tailored to preserve debt sustainability. To this effect, it is assumed that $2 billion under the
MFA would be disbursed over ten years, starting in late 2012. The MFA is assumed to be concessional, with a
grant element of 35 percent. The analysis shows that the projected decline in exports beyond the medium term
is the most stringent constraint on Chad’s capacity to borrow. To make room for the disbursements under the
MFA and, at the same time, ensure that the PV of debt-to-exports ratio remains below 100 percent, other
borrowing would need to be scaled back to about one-third of the amount assumed in the baseline scenario
even if the grant element of new borrowing is about 20 percent (Figure 3a). With this constraint satisfied, all
other indicators remain below their critical thresholds. However, even in that case, shock scenarios point to a
moderate risk of debt distress, which must be mitigated by prudent fiscal policy, and by maintaining an
adequate savings cushion to ensure debt service capacity in case of a sudden loss of oil revenue.

PUBLIC DEBT DSA
17.

The consideration of domestic debt does not alter fundamentally the assessment of Chad’s

debt sustainability. Given the moderate size of Chad’s domestic debt, the baseline adjustment in the non-oil
primary balance, and expected oil revenues, the public debt indicators are driven mainly by the external debt
component, indicating a high risk of debt distress. The domestic debt component would increase from
9.5 percent of GDP in 2011 to 16.1 percent of GDP in 2032, reflecting the increased residual financing needs, as
the portion of oil revenues used as collateral is not available for budget financing. Altogether, the public debt
stock increases gradually from about 36 percent of GDP in 2011–12 to 53 percent of GDP in 2032.
18.

Stress tests confirm that the current fiscal stance is not sustainable. Even with ample oil

revenues, and assuming that financing could be secured, the resulting debt path would increase steeply,
leading to an unmanageable debt and debt-service burden (Fixed Primary Balance Scenario in Figure 2).
A temporary shock to real GDP growth in 2013-2014 would also impair public debt sustainability
(Most Extreme Shock in Figure 2 and Bound Test B1 in Table 2a).

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CHAD

THE AUTHORITIES’ VIEWS
19.

The authorities expressed interest in debt relief through the HIPC process. They urged

consideration of Chad’s special post-conflict circumstances, the importance of public investment in
infrastructure to long-term growth, and the need for debt relief to create fiscal space for additional
development spending (including foreign-financed). At the same time, the authorities are determined to
pursue an accelerated development strategy financed through foreign borrowing on non-concessional terms
and secured through oil receipts.
20.

The authorities downplay concerns about the debt sustainability implications of the MFA. They

consider that new oil developments will generate a cash flow sufficient to meet debt obligations under the
MFA. The authorities also believe that the contemplated investments will have significant positive economic
externalities that would help sustain non-oil growth at a level higher than 5 percent per annum assumed in the
DSA projections. The authorities intend to pursue their own debt sustainability analysis, with consultants, to
assess the fiscal space for debt-financed public investment.

DEBT DISTRESS CLASSIFICATION AND CONCLUSIONS
21.

In staff’s assessment, despite improved oil production and revenue prospects in the next few

years, Chad faces a high risk of debt distress. The DSA suggests that under the baseline (current policies)
scenario Chad’s overall public and external debt dynamics are not sustainable. This is due to the significant
increase in public external debt over the medium term, reflecting the implementation of the MFA on
non-concessional terms and continuation with large amounts of non-concessional borrowing for other public
investment projects. In this scenario, all public and publicly-guaranteed external debt and debt service
indicators breach the critical thresholds. This conclusion holds even if the hypothetical growth impact of the
associated projects is taken into account and the underlying fiscal position is assumed to be adjusted to help
set aside funds needed to collateralize the disbursements under the MFA.
22.

An alternative (prudent) scenario shows that all indicative thresholds would be observed if the

MFA were implemented over ten years and on concessional terms. However, to make room for the MFA,
all other borrowing would also need to be mostly concessional and its amount scaled back to about a half of
the amount projected in the baseline scenario. Even in this case, the DSA underscores Chad’s sensitivity to
shocks, especially an oil price shock, and stress test results remain a source of concern.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

CHAD

23.

Progress toward the HIPC completion point (including the improvement in the CPIA score)

would substantially reduce Chad’s debt vulnerabilities. However, given the current weak record for fiscal
policy implementation and the non-concessional nature of the MFA with the Eximbank of China, prospects for
re-embarking on the path to debt relief under the HIPC process are remote.

2

Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.

3

Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate chan

4

Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.

5

Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.

6

Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

7

Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.

8

Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.

3

Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4

Includes official and private transfers and FDI.

5

Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.

6

Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.

4

Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.

5

Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.

6

Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

7

Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.

8

Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Memorandum item:
Grant element assumed on residual financing (i.e., financing required above baseline) 6
Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1

Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt-creating flows.

2

Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.

3

Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4

Includes official and private transfers and FDI.

5

Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.

6

Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Safeguards Assessments

The Bank of the Central African States (BEAC)
is the regional central bank of the Central
African States. The most recent safeguards
assessment of the BEAC was completed on
July 6, 2009. The findings of this assessment
indicated that implementation of previous
safeguards recommendations on financial
reporting, internal audit, and internal control
was limited, and that the changing risk profile
of BEAC foreign exchange holdings required
further actions to strengthen safeguards at
BEAC. Subsequent to revelation of Paris office

fraud, a series of measures and longer term
safeguard measures were agreed between the
IMF and BEAC in order to continue with
country programs. Consequently, BEAC
adopted an action plan for 2010 with the aims
of strengthening key safeguards. In addition,
since 2010, BEAC and the Fund agreed on
additional measures to address the
weaknesses highlighted by the special audit
and strengthen governance bodies. Fund staff
is actively monitoring the implementation of
these measures.

IX. Exchange Rate Arrangement
Chad maintains an exchange system that is
free from restrictions and multiple currency
practices on payments and transfers for
current international transactions. The BEAC
common currency is the CFA franc, which was
formerly pegged to the French franc and is
now pegged to the euro. Repurchase of
CFA franc banknotes exported outside the
BEAC zone was suspended on August 2, 1993.
Effective January 12, 1994, the CFA franc was

devalued by 50 percent in foreign currency
terms, and the exchange rate was adjusted
from F 1 = CFAF 50 to F 1 = CFAF 100. Since
January 1, 1999, the CFA franc has been
pegged to the euro at the rate of
EUR 1 = CFAF 655.957.
X. Article IV Consultations
Chad is on the 12-month cycle. The next
Article IV consultation is expected to take
place by December 2013.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has capacity-related shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
There is scope for improvement in quality, coverage, and timeliness in most macroeconomic datasets.
The authorities have recently taken the initiative to improve the macroeconomic database, particularly
the national accounts. The 2007 Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) found that
the statistical system was weak and suffers from a shortage of both financial and human resources.
National accounts: The authorities have revised national accounts estimates, moving from the 1968
System of National Accounts (SNA) to the 1993 SNA, for 2005–11. However, compilation remains
weak owing to inadequate funding for the Institut National de la Statistique, des Etudes Economiques
et Démographiques (INSEED). In addition, dissemination of data and metadata to the public could be
improved by more timely releases and more detailed information. See staff report for further details.
Price statistics: The Harmonized Consumer Price Index (HCPI) is of rather good quality. However, it
covers only the capital city and the reporting lag sometimes exceeds two months. The regional
authorities have work underway to improve the quality of the HCPI in each of the Central African
Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC) countries.
Government finance statistics: Data weaknesses create uncertainty about the central government’s
actual fiscal position and hamper debt sustainability analysis. Staff is compelled to prepare estimates
of central government financial operations from disparate administrative sources that may or may not
fully reconcile with domestic bank financing or changes in net indebtedness.
Monetary statistics: Banque des Etats de L’Afrique Centrale (BEAC) reports the expected core
monetary and financial indicators within the expected lag, and has begun reporting data through the
standardized report forms (SRFs) in June 2012. A key shortcoming of monetary and financial statistics
is the lack of clear reconciliation between the domestic banking sector’s net credit to the government
and the implicit financing in the weak government financial accounts. In addition, the depository
corporations’ survey omits the large number of microfinance operations in the country.
Balance of payments: Weaknesses in Chad’s balance of payments data create uncertainty about its
actual external position and hamper debt sustainability analysis. Customs-based data are unreliable
and suffer from coverage problems, to the extent that they are not relied upon for balance of
payments or national income estimation. Staff must estimate current and capital flows from disparate
administrative sources, to supplement the official balance of payments. The IMF Statistics Department
has recommended tighter coordination among the CEMAC, INSEED, and other agencies in order to
improve data coverage. BEAC headquarters is coordinating technical reforms to improve data quality
and timeliness.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Chad has been a participant in the IMF’s GDDS
A Data ROSC was published in August 2007.
since September 24, 2002. GDDS metadata and
plans for improvement need to be updated.
III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
Only international liquidity, monetary statistics, GDP, and prices are currently reported to STA for
publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS). Chad has not yet been able to resume
reporting of detailed data for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. Annual fiscal
data through 2001 have been reported and are included in the IFS database. The BEAC has yet to
submit test monetary and financial statistics using the standardized report forms. Chad has yet to
submit BOP and IIP data to STA.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 14, 2013

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with Chad
On December 14, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Chad on a lapse of time basis. Under the IMF’s lapse
of time procedures, the Executive Board completes the Article IV Consultations without
convening formal discussions. 1
Background
Economic performance in 2011–12 has been marked by increased oil exploration, weather
shocks, and coming on stream of several large industrial projects. A severe drought provoked a
food security crisis and a sharp increase in inflation in late 2011. Some fiscal consolidation was
achieved in 2011 but was largely reversed in 2012.
After a strong recovery in 2010, real gross domestic product (GDP) growth slowed to
1.7 percent in 2011 as oil production declined and the drought affected agricultural production.
Helped by high international prices of crude oil and the completion of several large, foreignfinanced industrial projects, the balance of payments posted a surplus.
In 2012, real GDP growth is estimated to have rebounded to about 5½ percent, driven by the
coming on stream of several industrial projects and a recovery in agriculture. Inflation is
expected to drop to about 6 percent at year’s end, if the effects of the recent floods on food
prices remain contained.
In the near term, growth will be stimulated by public investments in infrastructure and bringing
on stream new oil developments. In the medium term, oil production is expected to rise, with
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board.

a corresponding increase in exports and government revenues. However, absent further oil
discoveries, proven reserves will be exhausted in twenty years.
In the area of public financial management (PFM), the repeated use of emergency spending
procedures has led to significant budget overruns. Subsidies to public enterprises have surged,
and the policy framework for public enterprises remains a challenge.
The public debt-to-GDP ratio increased significantly in recent years and will likely rise further
over the medium term, reflecting the impact of the Master Facility Agreement (MFA) signed in
2011 with the Eximbank of China.
Chad’s weak business climate is perceived as an obstacle to private sector development. The
shared awareness of the problem between the local business community and the authorities is
promising but the task ahead is challenging.
Financial sector conditions have improved since the 2011 Financial Sector Assessment
Program mission, owing to the recapitalization of state-owned banks, strong growth of several
private banks, and technological innovations, including mobile banking. Nevertheless, private
sector access to financial services remains limited and the banking system remains excessively
exposed to the government.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2012 Article IV Consultation with Chad, Executive Directors endorsed staff’s
appraisal as follows:
The improved security situation, strong oil revenue receipts, and prospects for additional oil
production coming on stream over the next few years create a unique opportunity for Chad to
address its development and poverty reduction needs. To capitalize on these favorable
circumstances, Chad needs a medium-term strategy for transforming the oil windfall into a
source of sustainable growth for the non-oil economy, putting in place a market-oriented policy
framework for the new enterprises, and introducing public financial management reforms to
optimize the use of additional oil resources.
Chad’s vulnerability to weather shocks came to the fore in the context of the 2011 drought and
recent floods. Staff welcomes the broadening of the policy focus from the emergency response
toward building resilience. To this effect, the cost of implementing the contemplated policies to
address food security should be properly evaluated and provided for in the budget, including
sufficient appropriations for the replenishment of buffer stocks and the implementation of a
multi-pronged strategy to strengthen Chad’s resilience to weather shocks.

3
The relatively good fiscal performance registered in 2011 helped steer the economy toward
medium-term sustainability; however, weaker fiscal discipline in 2012 reignited concerns about
the course of fiscal policy. The 2012 supplementary budget deviates from a sustainable path.
The envisaged expansion of the deficit also entails a draw-down of the deposits at the Banque
des Etats de l’Afrique Centrale and thus delays the realization of financial savings to protect
Chad against the risk of a downward shift in international oil prices.
The authorities should uphold the central role of the budget as a fiscal policy instrument and
press ahead with PFM reforms. Currently, the budget does not accurately reflect the
government’s economic policies and the continued recourse to extra-budgetary spending
undermines the implementation of stated budget objectives. The lack of progress on PFM
reforms entails unnecessary costs. To remedy these shortcomings, the authorities should
follow through on the implementation of their PFM reform agenda. These reforms should be
accompanied by the strengthening of institutional, technical, and human capacities of the
Ministry of Finance and Budget (MFB) and the harmonization of local practices with the new
directives of the Communauté Economique et Monétaire de l’Afrique Centrale (CEMAC). 2
The early experience with the new public enterprises underscores the importance of putting in
place an appropriate market-oriented policy framework for these companies. The authorities’
intention to reduce subsidies for public enterprises is welcome. However, to ensure that these
enterprises contribute to the development of a modern industrial fabric in Chad, they should
have a degree of freedom in price setting consistent with cost recovery. And, a regulatory
framework for healthy competition should be established in the sectors susceptible to
monopolistic practices. For the oil refinery, it remains crucial to find an export outlet for its
excess production to increase its capacity utilization and improve its financial condition.
Public domestic and external debt levels remain manageable for the time being, but the
authorities’ intention to scale up foreign debt-financed public investment entails an elevated risk
of debt distress. The authorities are encouraged to calibrate their public investment policy,
taking into account Chad’s debt service capacity and its high vulnerability to oil price shocks.
Being a low income country, Chad should seek highly concessional terms for its external loans.
The authorities are encouraged to seek to resolve the incompatibility between the MFA and
debt sustainability objectives.
The 2013 budget should be anchored on the objective of medium-term fiscal sustainability,
taking into account the need to build a precautionary savings cushion. Given the firm
expectation of a significant increase in oil revenue from the new oil projects coming on stream
in the near term, staff currently recommends a non-oil primary deficit (NOPD) path that is less

CEMAC members are expected to complete the transposition at the national level of the new CEMAC directives of public
financial management by December 31, 2013.

4
constraining compared with the path in the 2011 Article IV consultation. Nevertheless, starting
with 2013 and over the medium term, a gradual tightening of the NOPD would be required to
offset the expected decline in oil revenues over the long term. This gradual tightening would
generate savings, primarily, to serve as a cushion against an oil revenue shock, but also to help
smooth the transition to the post-oil era.
The publication of the White Book by the National Council of Employers of Chad is an important
step toward improving Chad’s business climate. The authorities are encouraged to work closely
with the business community to further the agenda outlined in the White Book, in particular by
improving the legal environment for private enterprises, making tax policy more businessfriendly, professionalizing tax and customs administration, and developing the key elements of
infrastructure.
The recapitalization of state-owned banks improved financial stability indicators but the
concentrated exposure of banks to the public sector remains a source of risk. In the short term,
to mitigate this risk, banks are encouraged to continue holding capital buffers in excess of the
required minimum 8 percent. Looking forward, a durable solution to this problem would come
from greater private sector participation, which should be encouraged, including by setting
incentives for informal sector enterprises to migrate to the formal sector. Further, the
strengthening of the centralized credit registry would help contain credit risk, and the
implementation of the anti-money laundering framework would help strengthen governance.
