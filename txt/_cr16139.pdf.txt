IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Thailand
On May 23, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Concluded the
Article IV Consultation1 with Thailand.
The Thai economy recovered in 2015 after a slowdown induced by political uncertainty. Output
grew by 2.8 percent in 2015 supported by accommodative monetary policy and a boost in public
spending. The current account surplus rose to 8 percent of GDP as a result of improving terms of
trade, contracting imports associated with tepid domestic demand, and soaring tourism. Headline
inflation moved into negative territory, and, at -0.9 percent, significantly undershoot the Bank of
Thailand’s new inflation target of 2.5±1.5 percent. Lower inflation mostly reflected the fall in
energy prices, but core inflation and inflation expectations also declined in 2015. Financial
markets weathered well repeated bouts of global volatility and the financial system remained
robust.
The recovery is expected to continue, but at a modest pace and subject to downside risks. Growth
is projected to improve to 3 percent in 2016 and 3.2 percent in 2017, still below most other
ASEAN economies and Thailand’s historical record. Headline inflation is expected to recover as
the effects of lower oil prices gradually abate, but will likely undershoot the central bank’s target
again this year, as inflationary pressures continue to be depressed by sluggish demand.
Headwinds may arise from further weakness in the international environment as well as from
political uncertainty and structural bottlenecks that weigh on potential growth.
Strong fundamentals enhance Thailand’s resilience in the face of external and internal
challenges. High international reserves, a sizable current account surplus, and relatively limited
foreign debt helped cushion shocks from the weak and volatile global environment. Moderate
public debt, a wide investor base, a well-capitalized banking sector, and strong policymaking

institutions provide additional layers of protection. Moreover, policy space can be used to
maneuver if downside risks were to materialize.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors recognized the resilience of the Thai economy in the face of external and
internal challenges and the strength of its policy making institutions. Directors viewed
Thailand’s external position as strong, underpinned by high international reserves and low
foreign debt. The current account surplus is expected to narrow over time as domestic demand
strengthens and terms-of-trade shocks reverse. Directors noted, however, that the ongoing
recovery is modest and subject to downside risks while core inflation remains low due to weak
demand. Against this backdrop, Directors encouraged the authorities to secure a strong and
lasting recovery through an expansionary policy mix, steps to safeguard financial stability and
structural reforms to boost growth potential.
Directors welcomed the expansionary fiscal stance which should be placed within a
Medium Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF). They encouraged the authorities to rapidly
implement their investment plan with due attention to governance and transparency.
Directors also stressed that short-term stimulus measures to support farm income should
make way for social safety nets that are better aligned with structural challenges. They
underscored that the MTFF should aim to increase tax revenues over the medium term and
prepare for the fiscal implications of rapid population aging. Directors commended the high
priority attached to enacting the fiscal responsibility law and the ongoing review of the health
care system to address sustainability, adequacy, fairness, and efficiency.
Directors noted that the current accommodative monetary policy stance is appropriate. Going
forward, while there is room for further easing, this should balance support for the economy
against financial stability concerns and the need to preserve policy space. Directors commended
the high standard of transparency achieved by Thailand’s monetary policy framework and
suggested that communicating a determination to steer inflation toward the medium-term target
would enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission. Directors recommended
maintaining exchange rate flexibility as the first line of defense against external shocks.
Directors supported tighter macroprudential policies to maintain financial stability in
a low interest rate environment. They also supported efforts to strengthen the supervision of
specialized financial institutions, foster coordination among regulators, upgrade the
macroprudential policy framework, and improve crisis prevention and resolution mechanisms.
Directors emphasized close monitoring of potential systemic risks from interconnected financial
conglomerates and high household debt.
Directors called for concerted action to lift productivity and potential growth. They underscored
the need to promote structural transformation, improve the quality of education and vocational

training, and mitigate the impact of population aging by reforming pensions. Enhancing public
infrastructure investment could help crowd in private investment and boost economic potential,
while advancing trade integration could catalyze structural reforms and enhance competitiveness.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ plan to assess the merits of joining the Trans-Pacific
Partnership Agreement.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
May 4, 2016

KEY ISSUES
The Thai economy is recovering, but the outlook is subdued and subject to
downside risks. GDP growth is projected to pickup up slightly to 3.0 percent in 2016
and 3.2 percent in 2017, below most other ASEAN economies and Thailand’s own
historical record. Weak domestic and external demand, coupled with volatile global
financial conditions, will remain headwinds, while structural bottlenecks weigh on
potential growth. Inflation is expected to remain low in the foreseeable future.
Strong fundamentals provide room for maneuver to lift economic prospects in
both the near and the long run. Staff advocated a three-pronged approach to anchor
a long-lasting recovery, including: implementing an expansionary macroeconomic policy
mix; safeguarding financial stability; and boosting potential growth.


The expansionary fiscal stance is welcome and should be placed within a
medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF). The government’s investment plans should be
implemented without delay, with due attention to good governance and
transparency. Short-term stimulus measures should give way to social safety nets
better aligned with structural challenges. The MTFF should underpin a strategy to
increase tax revenues over time and prepare for the fiscal costs of population aging.



There is scope for further monetary easing. The lingering negative output gap,
negative headline inflation through Q1 2016, falling inflation expectations, and
downside risks warrant additional monetary accommodation. Exchange rate
flexibility should remain the first line of defense against external shocks, while
judicious intervention can be used to mitigate excessive volatility.



Tighter macroprudential policies would safeguard financial stability. Ongoing efforts
to improve the supervision of Specialized Financial Institutions (SFIs), foster
coordination among financial sector regulators, upgrade the macroprudential toolkit,
and improve crisis prevention and resolution would further strengthen the financial
stability framework. The BOT should also establish a contingency plan for a tail event
of household defaults, deleveraging, and output contraction.



Escaping the middle-income trap requires concerted action on several fronts, including
improving education quality and vocational training, augmenting labor supply by
raising the effective retirement age and facilitating migration, promoting structural
transformation, and advancing trade integration. Enhancing public investment
execution and management would also help crowd in private investment and boost
potential growth above the current estimate of 3 percent.

CONTEXT
1.
Thailand remains resilient in the face of external and internal challenges. A flexible
exchange rate, high international reserves, and relatively low foreign debt provide buffers against
external shocks. Moderate public debt, a wide investor base, well-capitalized commercial banks, and
strong policymaking institutions are additional layers of protection. As a result, Thailand weathered
relatively well repeated episodes of global financial volatility. Moreover, strong fundamentals
provide policy space to maneuver if downside risks materialize.

since the mid-2000s.

3.
Against a subdued outlook and downside risks, discussions focused on strategies to
anchor a long-lasting recovery and lift growth potential. Economic policies were broadly in line
with Fund advice in 2015, but macroeconomic stimulus and structural reforms were less ambitious
than recommended by staff (Appendix 1). In this consultation, staff advocated a three-pronged
approach to: (i) deploy an expansionary macroeconomic policy mix that aligns short- and long-term
goals; (ii) safeguard financial stability; and (iii) enhance potential growth.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
4.
The economy recovered in 2015 after a slowdown induced by political uncertainty.
Output grew by 2.8 percent—close to its current estimated potential growth rate but still below
most other ASEAN economies and Thailand’s past record. Growth accelerated in the second half of
the year, on the strength of government spending, a pickup in private consumption, and soaring
tourism. Net exports made a modest positive contribution to growth, while private investment
declined for the third year in a row.

Public investment supported economic activity, particularly through community-based
infrastructure projects. Notwithstanding higher investment, the cyclically-adjusted public sector

7.
The credit cycle moderated, but household debt reached a historic high. Credit demand
from Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) and households picked up at end-2015, but
depository corporations tightened credit standards given concerns over credit quality (except for
large firms). As a result, overall credit growth by depository corporations slowed to 4.9 percent (y/y)
in December 2015. Non-depository institutions also tightened credit standards for households, but
increased credit to nonfinancial corporations mainly through bond and equity finance. Amid weak
income growth, the household debt-to-GDP ratio reached 82 percent of GDP in the fourth quarter
of 2015, roughly double its level a decade ago. In turn, corporate debt has been broadly stable yet
high at 81.1 percent of GDP in the third quarter of 2015.

In 2015, the current account surplus climbed to 8 percent of GDP, thanks to improving terms-oftrade, recovering tourism, and contracting imports. In U.S. dollars, goods exports and imports
declined by 5.6 percent and 11.3 percent, respectively.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
9.
The modest recovery is expected to continue in 2016 and the medium term. A slight
improvement in confidence and lower energy prices foreshadow a pickup in private consumption,
though high debt and low agricultural prices will continue to adversely impact rural households.
Public investment would remain a key driver, rising over the next few years and crowding in private
investment. As a result, GDP growth is projected to rise to 3 percent in 2016 and 3.2 percent in 2017
and then decline toward its 3 percent potential rate over the medium term as the fiscal impulse
fades and population aging reduces labor input. The output gap would close gradually by end-2018.
Headline inflation is projected to turn positive in 2016, but would take time to converge to the midpoint of the target band. With household and corporate debt at relatively high levels, credit
expansion would remain subdued and stay broadly in line with nominal GDP growth, as it did in
previous recoveries under political uncertainty. The current account surplus is projected to narrow
over the medium term, as positive terms-of-trade shocks partially reverse and imports strengthen
on account of higher investment. Tourism would remain a bright spot.

10.
Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside, though strong fundamentals enhance
Thailand’s resilience (Appendix 2). Rebalancing in China may result in a faster slowdown or larger
spillovers. A bout of global financial volatility may accelerate capital outflows and tighten financial
conditions. On the domestic front, slower-than-expected execution of infrastructure projects would
reduce domestic demand. Further delays in general elections could exacerbate political tensions,
denting confidence and investment. Deflation could become entrenched, resulting in higher real
interest rates and rising real debt burden. Debt overhang in the household sector could create a
stronger-than-expected headwind to consumption and, in an adverse scenario, affect financial
institutions’ balance sheets. If downside risks materialize, Thailand’s strong fundamentals provide
policy space to maneuver.

11.
The authorities broadly shared staff’s assessment of the outlook and risks. They
concurred that the recovery would be gradual, supported mainly by public spending and tourism.
The authorities were slightly more optimistic on short-term prospects and expected core inflation to
pick up somewhat faster than in staff’s baseline scenario. They also assessed that potential growth
could be higher than estimated by staff. In their view, the most significant downside risks stemmed
from the external environment, in particular from weak foreign demand, China’s economic
transition, shifts in global trade, and the slump in commodity prices.

POLICIES FOR A LONG-LASTING RECOVERY
A. Implementing High Quality Fiscal Stimulus
12.
The fiscal stance is expected to turn moderately expansionary in coming years. The
central government’s FY2015/16 budget foresees a deficit of 3 percent of GDP if fully executed, with
infrastructure rising to 20 percent of total expenditure. The authorities are also implementing shortterm quasi-fiscal measures to support farmers and SMEs, and a multi-year transport infrastructure
plan worth 13 percent of GDP to be carried out primarily by state-owned enterprises (SOEs) (Box 1).
Staff’s baseline scenario assumes a 60 percent execution of the infrastructure plan, in line with
historical record. This translates to annual fiscal stimulus by the consolidated public sector of
½ percent of GDP on average between FY2014/15 and FY2017/18.

13.
Staff supported the expansionary fiscal stance, in particular through infrastructure
investment, which is consistent with debt sustainability. Upgrading infrastructure would provide
multi-year stimulus to domestic demand, crowd in private investment, and help close the lingering
negative output gap. It would also help narrow the current account gap and enhance potential
growth.1 On short-term stimulus, staff acknowledged the need for temporary relief to farmers
affected by low commodity prices and drought conditions. However, staff noted these measures
may exacerbate contingent liabilities from SFIs and provide incentives to remain in the large, lowproductivity agricultural sector. Going forward, staff recommended developing social safety nets
better aligned with structural challenges, including on-budget cash transfers for poor households
and skill-upgrading programs to facilitate entry into higher productivity sectors. The authorities
should also disclose the cost of quasi-fiscal measures and ensure timely compensation to SFIs.
14.
The success of the investment program will depend on its effective management and
implementation. Staff welcomed the authorities’ plan to restructure transport SOEs and
encouraged a review of tariff setting and compensation agreements of public sector obligations to
ensure financial sustainability, contain contingent liabilities, and increase transparency. Staff also

The investment plan would be consistent with debt sustainability even assuming full execution and no payoff in
growth. Considering a fiscal multiplier of 0.9, estimated for Thailand integrating the two-way linkages between fiscal
policy and economic activity, public debt would peak at 49 percent of GDP in 2019, still below the government’s
ceiling of 60 percent of GDP (Appendix 3). If domestic demand were to recover much faster than in the baseline
scenario, tax reform and public expenditure prioritization should create space for the infrastructure plan.

highlighted the need to formulate a comprehensive national investment plan, expand the budget
coverage, enhance the transparency of investment execution, and improve project selection.
Thailand: Public Investment Trends and Processes
Investment in Thailand has lagged regional levels, allowing peers to catch up in public capital stock and
competitiveness. Thailand scores relatively well on investment processes, though there is scope to strengthen
planning and budgeting, expand budget coverage, and enhance transparency of execution. (IMF, “Public Investment

An MTFF would further strengthen policy formulation and transparency. Staff advised
that the fiscal responsibility law focus on procedural rules and mandate the formulation of an MTFF,
comprising a fiscal policy statement with multi-year macro-fiscal forecasts; a fiscal risk statement;
and a debt sustainability analysis. The MTFF should specify indicative rolling ceilings for the deficit
ratio consistent with the debt ceiling of 60 percent of GDP endorsed by the Cabinet, which
continues to be appropriate.
16.
The MTFF should underpin a strategy to build fiscal buffers over time and prepare for
the fiscal implications of the aging population. Staff welcomed the recent introduction of the
inheritance tax and the forthcoming review of the tax system, including property taxes and the
personal income tax. Staff recommended a gradual return of the VAT rate to 10 percent, from the
current 7 percent, once growth is on sound footing and the output gap closes, while mitigating the
impact on vulnerable groups. A single-rate

require immediate attention. Inequity in benefits is also exacerbated by widespread informality,
accounting for over half of employment. In this context, staff advised a comprehensive review of the
fragmented health and pension schemes (Selected Issues Paper, Chapter 2). Parametric reforms may
be needed with due attention to equity, sustainability, and efficiency.

The authorities generally concurred with staff’s recommendations.


They emphasized that public spending would play a crucial role in supporting growth,
shoring up confidence, and crowding in private investment. They stressed their commitment
to execute the infrastructure plan, while noting challenges arising from the complexities of
the mega projects. They stated that the 12th National Economic and Social Development
Plan (NESDP, 2017–21) would contain a comprehensive investment plan and agreed that
SOE reform should strengthen governance and investment management. On short-term
stimulus measures, the authorities clarified that technical assistance on alternative crops was
provided in parallel with the stimulus loan program to encourage innovation and structural
transformation.



The authorities also reiterated the high priority attached to enacting the fiscal responsibility
law, currently under consideration of the Council of State. They agreed on the need to
increase tax revenues over time, with their priorities set on broadening the tax base by
streamlining tax expenditures and enhancing collection efficiency through a national
e-payment system. On social security, the authorities highlighted that the ongoing review of
the health system addressed sustainability, adequacy, fairness and efficiency considerations.
They also noted that the National Savings Fund, established in 2015 as a voluntary saving
scheme for informal workers, would help support retirees.

B. Easing Monetary Policy
19.
Staff argued there is scope for further monetary easing. In staff’s view, the lingering
negative output gap, negative headline inflation through Q1 2016, low core inflation, falling inflation
expectations, and downside risks warranted additional monetary accommodation. Without further
easing, inflation is expected to remain below target for several years. Tighter macroprudential
policies can safeguard financial stability in a low interest-rate environment, particularly in the highly
indebted household sector (see below).
20.
As policy rates approach the zero lower bound, anchoring expectations through clear
and credible communication is critical. Protracted slides in oil prices or sizable negative demand
shocks could entrench deflationary pressures and de-anchor inflation expectations, depressing
demand by raising real interest rates and increasing the real debt burden (Appendix 4). In such a
scenario, policy actions supported by clear communication should decisively shape expectations of
low policy rates for an appropriately long period of time, to help strengthen the response of lending
rates and the exchange rate and improve monetary policy transmission.
21.
Thailand’s monetary policy framework has achieved a high standard of transparency.
Staff welcomed the recent adoption of an explicit medium-term inflation target and suggested that
it feature more prominently in BOT messages. Staff also noted that conveying forward-looking
monetary policy decisions would be facilitated by targeting monthly year-on-year (not year-average)
inflation, in line with global practice.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

THAILAND

22.
Exchange rate flexibility should remain the first line of defense against external
shocks. Amid uncertain global conditions, the authorities should give priority to maintaining
exchange rate flexibility, supported by judicious intervention to mitigate excessive volatility.
23.
The authorities assessed monetary policy as sufficiently accommodative. In their view,
fiscal stimulus in the pipeline would be more effective in supporting the economy than an interest
rate cut. The authorities also stated the advantages of preserving policy space in light of uncertain
external conditions, as well as concerns about triggering excessive search for yield behavior, which
could lead to the buildup of risks to financial stability if interest rates dropped too low. They
considered that the current policy framework and communication strategy had been successful in
anchoring inflation expectations and projected that inflation would pick up once the base effect of
past oil price declines faded away.

C. Safeguarding Financial Sector Stability
24.
The Financial Soundness Indicator map suggests a medium rating on financial sector
vulnerability, on account of the rapid credit cycle and the buildup of household debt. Staff
welcomed the ongoing moderation in credit growth, but highlighted that the continued rise in
household debt required vigilance, particularly against weak income prospects (Appendix 5).
Corporate balance sheets remain sound overall, despite lower profitability in the SME, natural
resource, and manufacturing sectors given developments in commodity markets and global trade.

1/ The latest data is based on 2015Q4 data, except the credit cycle ratios that are based on 2015Q3 data.
Due to data availability, credit cycle analysis is based on Other Depository Corporations (ODCs), while
balance sheet soundness analysis is based on commercial banks that hold about 70 percent of assets in ODCs.

25.
Commercial banks seem well positioned to face the turning of the credit cycle, but SFIs
and credit cooperatives are more exposed to strained credit segments. Among commercial
banks, foreign exchange liabilities are contained and risks of currency mismatches are relatively low.
Buffers are also strong on average, with high capital, liquidity, and profitability ratios,
notwithstanding an uptick in NPLs and leverage ratios from a low base (Selected Issues Paper,
Chapter 3). On SFIs, staff welcomed the recently completed onsite inspections by the BOT, which
revealed relatively strong capital adequacy and provisioning (except for two smaller institutions). At
the same time, average NPLs are higher than for commercial banks at 5.9 percent, and as high as
9.2 percent for corporate loans. Staff recognized efforts by SFIs and credit cooperatives to extend
loan maturities for households under pressure and prevent a buildup in NPLs, but cautioned against
evergreening of loans. Staff also emphasized the importance of closely monitoring payment
delinquency and implementing complete stress tests to assess any need for higher buffers.
26.
Tighter macroprudential policies would safeguard financial stability in a low interestrate environment. At the moment, overall financial stability risks appear contained. However, active
search for yield by domestic and foreign investors may drive financial investments to the real estate
sector and to less-regulated and increasingly interconnected nonbank institutions. In addition, some
developers have issued nonrated bonds, fueling housing supply. The authorities should stand ready
to tighten macroprudential policies to address risks in specific sectors. In particular, lower loan-tovalue (LTV) and debt-to-income (DTI) ratios and stricter mortgage lending standards, such as for
multiple investment properties, could help contain the still rapid growth in housing loans and in
land and condominium prices.2 Staff also cautioned that systemic risks from interconnectivity and
the operations of financial conglomerates should be monitored closely, particularly against the
increased supply of nonrated products to high net worth investors by securities companies.
27.

Staff recommended several measures to develop the financial stability framework:



Strengthening supervision and oversight, including by completing the transfer of SFIs to the
prudential supervision of the BOT and fostering effective coordination between the BOT and
other regulators.



Upgrading the macroprudential policy framework. There is considerable scope to deepen
systemic risk analysis. Priorities include tracking the strength of the credit cycle, leverage ratios
and unhedged exposures in specific sectors, and systemic risks from interconnectivity. The
macroprudential toolkit can be expanded to include counter-cyclical prudential requirements,
special weights on riskier loans, and capital surcharges for systemic institutions. The recently
established Financial Stability Unit in the BOT is a stepping stone to a stronger institutional
setup and should be followed by pending legal and administrative changes.

2

The BOT has successfully used macroprudential tools in the past, including ceilings on LTV ratios on residential
properties and varying risk weights on high value loans (B. Nijathaworn, “Macroprudential Policies and Capital Flows:
Managing under the new Globalization,” 2010).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

THAILAND



Improving crisis prevention and resolution by granting the BOT resolution authority over SFIs and
developing contingency plans for bank resolution and systemic crises. Ongoing efforts to clearly
define the roles and responsibilities of the BOT and the Ministry of Finance are welcome.



Addressing risks from high household indebtedness, with the BOT establishing a contingency plan
for a tail event comprising self-reinforcing cycles of household defaults, deleveraging, and
output contraction. If needed, voluntary out-of-court or government-sponsored debt
restructuring programs could help restore borrowers’ ability to service their debt.

28.
The authorities emphasized that Thailand’s overall financial system remained robust.
They noted that the onsite inspections had found that most SFIs were financially sound, while the
transfer of SFI prudential supervision to the BOT, to be completed by end-2016, would strengthen
the regulatory and supervisory framework. They acknowledged that additional work was needed to
fill regulatory gaps in the still small cooperatives’ sector and noted ongoing close cooperation with
cooperatives’ regulators. The authorities agreed on the need to remain vigilant and preempt a
further buildup in household debt, especially among lower income households, though they saw
limited risks to financial stability at the current juncture. They noted the merits of upgrading the
macroprudential policy framework by enhancing data quality and risk monitoring tools.

D. Advancing Trade Integration
29.
Staff assessed Thailand’s external position as stronger than levels consistent with
medium-term fundamentals and desired policies. Based on the External Balance Assessment
(EBA) model, and taking into account Thailand-specific factors, staff estimated that the current
account balance in 2015 was about 1.5 to 3.5 percent of GDP higher and the REER was 2.5 to
6 percent weaker than warranted by medium-term fundamentals and desired policy settings.
International reserves exceeded the range of Fund’s composite adequacy metrics and stood at
180 percent of the metric unadjusted for capital controls at end-2015. Developments in early 2016
are unlikely to change the assessment (Appendix 6). The current account gap is expected to narrow
over the medium term, as policy stimulus is deployed, political uncertainty dissipates, and domestic
demand recovers. External debt is projected to remain relatively low under various shocks
(Appendix 7).
30.
Weak goods exports and deteriorating competitiveness are a concern. Goods exports
have fallen across all destinations, except to CLMV countries, and across most products, except for
automobiles. The decline can be attributed to weak demand abroad, low commodity prices, and a
slide in competitiveness.3 Trade with ASEAN-5 countries declined more than trade with China, whose
rebalancing toward services boosted tourism. As in other countries, Thailand experienced a
significant drop in the income elasticity of trade in recent years (Box 2).

Thailand’s rankings in the World Bank’s Doing Business and the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness
indexes slipped in 2015.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THAILAND

31.
A clear strategy for trade integration remains an important priority. Thailand would
benefit from active participation in global and regional integration initiatives given its high openness
and advanced regulatory framework. It should take advantage of opportunities within the ASEAN
Economic Community (AEC) and review the benefits of joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP),
which would include expanding access to major export markets, developing service sectors, and
catalyzing structural reforms.
32.
The authorities concurred on the strength of Thailand’s external sector. In their view,
the sharp decline in oil prices explained a large part of the unexpected rise in the current account
surplus. They also projected the current account surplus to decline over the medium term, driven by
a pickup in domestic demand supported by expansionary policies and the partial reversal of shocks
to terms of trade. The authorities also agreed on the potential benefits from further trade
integration and are assessing the pros and cons of joining the TPP.

E. Boosting Potential Growth
33.
Thailand is a middle-income country facing numerous structural challenges. It is an
aging society with relatively low educational attainment and an oversized agricultural sector. Its
industry has been losing competitiveness, with some products becoming obsolete. R&D investment
and innovation are low.
34.
Escaping the middle-income trap will require concerted action on several fronts.
Enhancing potential growth calls for investing in infrastructure and human capital, addressing the
rapid population aging, and facilitating structural transformation (Box 3). Achieving the potential
growth target of 5 percent set in the 12th NESDP would require ambitious structural reforms to lift
Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth to 3.5 percent (from 1.8 percent in staff’s baseline).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

THAILAND



Infrastructure. Improving investment execution and management would crowd in private
investment and boost capital accumulation and productivity. Structural fiscal reforms should
build fiscal space over time.



Human capital. Higher quality of education, greater focus on Science, Technology, Engineering,
and Math subjects, and better alignment of vocational training with employers’ needs would
help raise labor productivity.



Population aging. Thailand’s rapid population aging is depressing the growth in the labor force
and in potential output. The effective retirement age needs to be better aligned with life
expectancy. In addition, a more open policy toward foreign workers would help alleviate labor
shortages in skilled and unskilled occupations.



Structural transformation.
o

The government seeks to encourage higher-value-added activities via revised Board of
Investment incentives and to take advantage of Thailand’s geographic location via Special
Economic Zones in neighboring countries with lower labor costs. Investment incentives need
careful coordination and clear communication to enhance their cost-effectiveness.
Moreover, appropriate design, evaluation and disclosure are essential for their success.

o

With agricultural income under pressure from low prices and drought conditions, the
government’s initiatives to facilitate transition to higher-yield crops and to agri-business,
while providing interim support to farmers, are welcome. This agenda could be expanded to
provide education, information, and incentives for rural workers to shift to other sectors,
where labor shortages have been cited as an obstacle to growth, and to take steps to raise
agricultural productivity.

Most of these measures—e.g., public investment, greater competition in the service sector,
incentives to hire agricultural workers in modern sectors—would also stimulate domestic demand
and thus are particularly beneficial in the current conjuncture.
35.
The authorities agreed that structural reforms were critical for Thailand to live up to
its potential. They broadly shared staff’s diagnosis and emphasized their multi-faceted strategy to
upgrade the economy and boost productivity. They noted programs underway to enhance
competitiveness, including incentives for super-clusters, high value-added activities, and R&D
investment. On immigration, the authorities were of the view that Thailand was sufficiently open to
foreign workers.

STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
Thailand remains resilient in the face of external and internal challenges, but the
ongoing recovery is modest and subject to downside risks. Headwinds arise from the weak and
volatile global environment as well as from political uncertainty and structural bottlenecks. Core

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THAILAND

inflation will continue to be depressed by tepid demand. Headline inflation is expected to recover
somewhat along with oil prices but will likely undershoot the BOT’s target again this year.
37.
The expansionary fiscal stance is welcome and should be placed within an MTFF. The
government’s investment plan should be implemented without delay, with due attention to good
governance and transparency. Short-term stimulus measures should give way to social safety nets
that are better aligned with structural challenges. Embedding the expansionary fiscal plans in an
MTFF would strengthen policy formulation and transparency. The MTFF should underpin a strategy
to increase tax revenues over time and prepare for the fiscal implications of the aging population.
Social security reform should aim to strengthen equity, sustainability, and efficiency.
38.
There is room for further monetary easing. With output below potential, headline
inflation in negative territory through Q1 2016, and low core inflation, there is scope for further
monetary easing. Its effectiveness could be enhanced by communicating the BOT’s determination to
fight off deflationary pressures and steer inflation toward the medium-term target.
39.
Tighter macroprudential policies can help maintain financial stability in a low-interestrate environment. The authorities should stand ready to tighten macroprudential policies to curb
lending to highly indebted households and certain segments of the real estate sector. Systemic risks
from interconnectivity and the operations of financial conglomerates should also be monitored
closely. Ongoing efforts to improve supervision of SFIs, foster coordination among regulators,
upgrade the macroprudential policy framework, and improve crisis prevention and resolution would
further strengthen the financial stability framework.
40.
Thailand’s external position is strong, supported by high foreign reserves, low foreign
debt, and an elevated current account surplus. Thanks to its strong external position, the baht
appreciated modestly in real effective terms in 2015 despite persistent capital outflows. The large
current account surplus is expected to narrow over time as domestic demand strengthens and
shocks to terms-of-trade partially reverse. Thailand’s gross reserves exceed the Fund’s adequacy
metrics and there is no need to build up reserves for precautionary purposes. In response to external
shocks, the exchange rate should continue to move flexibly and serve as the first line of defense.
41.
Escaping the middle-income trap requires concerted action to lift productivity and
potential growth. The adverse impact of aging on potential growth and the fiscal position can be
mitigated by reforming pensions, improving productivity, and facilitating migration. Improving the
quality of education and aligning it with the needs of the modern economy would help raise labor
productivity. Infrastructure investment would help crowd in private investment and increase capital
accumulation. Periodic evaluation, careful coordination, and clear communication may enhance the
cost-effectiveness of investment incentives. Further trade integration could boost competitiveness
and catalyze structural reforms.
42.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Thailand take place on a
standard 12-month cycle.

Box 2. TPP—What Does it Mean for Thailand?
Thailand’s trade has slowed down significantly in recent years. Trade peaked in 2012, with exports and imports reaching
57 percent and 55 percent of GDP, respectively, benefiting from integration in global value chains and strong FDI inflows. Since 2012,
Thailand has experienced a continuous contraction in trade, including in 2015. On the export side, industrial exports, which account
for 80 percent of the total, declined by 5.5 percent, while rice and rubber exports declined by 15 percent. On the import side, oil and
non-oil products declined across the board. As in other countries, Thailand’s growth has become less trade-intensive since the Global
Financial Crisis.

The TPP is likely to change the global trade landscape. The TPP is a far-reaching agreement covering about 40 percent of the
world GDP. It encompasses not only tariff reductions for goods trade but also
lower barriers to investment and services trade. Moreover, it covers other

countries. Meanwhile, in other sectors, including automobiles, TPP rules of
origin are more liberal and should continue to allow participation of
nonmembers.
The TPP could have important implications for Thailand. The 12 TPP
countries account for roughly 40 percent of Thailand’s total exports and 45 percent of FDI inflows, though Thailand has FTAs with
most TPP countries except for the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Thailand would face greater competition in the U.S. market,
which accounts for 10 percent of total exports, with major exports such as garments, agricultural goods and automobiles currently
subject to tariffs ranging from 3 to 22 percent. Competition from TPP signatories (in particular, Malaysia and Vietnam) will likely
increase, notably in commodities (rice, rubber and wood) and manufacturing products. Investment flows could also be diverted away
from Thailand toward TPP members seeking greater access to the United States and other TPP markets. In this regard, U.S.
investment, which accounts for 8 percent of FDI inflows into Thailand, and Japanese and Korean investment in the manufacturing
industry could be at risk. According to Petri and Plummer (2016),1 Thailand would be one of the most negatively impacted countries
in terms of income and export losses, given its large share of exports destined to TPP countries, strong competition from TPP
members, and high tariffs on main exports.
Thailand should carefully assess the potential benefits from joining the TPP. The TPP could help offset Thailand’s recent sluggish
trade performance and deteriorating competitiveness. Specifically, Thailand’s automobile industry is among potential winners, as it
exports nearly 60 percent of its overall production as a regional base for the world’s top carmakers. Other beneficiaries may include
garment and textile industries, where TPP member countries are currently among Thailand’s largest destinations and immediate tariff
reductions are implemented under the TPP. More than just boosting trade and investment, the TPP could catalyze momentum for
structural reforms and industrial transformation. Implications for the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the AEC,
and other existing and ongoing trade agreements also need to be thought through to maximize synergies and minimize overlap.

Box 3. Thailand: Lifting Potential Growth
Thailand’s potential growth slowed from 5 percent in the mid-2000s to 3 percent in the last five years. The slowdown was
much more pronounced in Thailand than in other emerging markets, driven by a sharp fall in TFP growth and lower employment
growth. Low TFP growth in Thailand reflects a slow reallocation of labor from low-productivity agriculture to more productive sectors
and a decline in FDI in manufacturing.1 In turn, the growth of the working-age population (15–64) declined from 1 percent
in 2003-07 to less than 0.4 percent in 2011–15.

Staff estimates potential growth of 3 percent in absolute and per capita terms over the medium-term—a pace clearly
insufficient to pull Thailand out of the middle-income trap. Over 2019–21, labor input is forecast to decline in line with the
working age population (UN, 2015, World Population Prospects).2 Capital input is forecast to increase in line with staff’s baseline
scenario, with private investment following on the coattails of the partially implemented government’s infrastructure plan. A slight
pickup in TFP growth is also envisaged.
How can the growth in the standard of living be accelerated? Efforts to increase the participation rate of older workers
(in particular, increasing the mandatory retirement age) and to facilitate migration of workers from neighboring countries could stem
the decline in labor supply, at least in the medium to long term. Investment growth could be higher if public investment execution is
improved. Gradually increasing the VAT rate to its statutory rate, broadening the tax base, and strengthening tax administration
should create fiscal room for additional public investment. These plans and improvements in the business climate could crowd in
private investment. With constant (rather than declining) labor input over 2019–21 and fixed investment growth of 5.5 percent per
year (the forecast for 2018, rather than the drop to 4.6 percent in staff’s baseline), factor inputs would contribute 1.5 percentage
points to growth (from 1.2 percentage points in the baseline). To increase potential growth to 4 percent (from 3 percent in the
baseline), TFP growth would need to accelerate to 2.5 percent (from 1.8 percent in the baseline), supported by structural reforms.
Such an increase is within reach, allowing a slow yet steady convergence to per capita income levels in advanced economies. Further
lifting potential growth to 5 percent, the target in the 12th NESDP, would require a very substantial acceleration in TFP growth to
3.5 percent and an urgent push to ambitious structural reforms.
The following steps could significantly increase TFP:3
 Improving the quality and relevance of education and vocational training;
 Facilitating the hiring of skilled foreign workers;
 Improving public investment management processes;
 Providing incentives, information and training to facilitate transition into higher-productivity occupations;
 Increasing agricultural productivity, including by scaling up average farm size;4
 Increasing competition, particularly in the service sector; and
 Advancing trade integration.

Appendix I. Thailand—Staff Policy Advice from the
2015 Article IV Consultation
Staff Advice
Allow exchange rate flexibility to be the first line
of defense against external shocks, with judicious
intervention to avoid excessive volatility and
overshooting.
Consider further monetary easing if fiscal
stimulus is weaker than expected and the
economy remains sluggish.
Set indicative inflation targets beyond a one-year
horizon.
Continue strengthening the regulatory and
supervisory framework, following the transfer of
SFIs prudential supervision to the BOT.
Strengthen the oversight of the fast-growing
credit cooperative sector.
Support economic recovery with expansionary
fiscal policy while framing it in a medium-term
framework.
Undertake an evaluation of the public
investment process, including projects
implemented by SOEs.
Consider a gradual rise of the VAT rate to
10 percent, from the current 7 percent, once the
recovery is firmly entrenched.
Augment labor supply by increasing mandatory
retirement age in the civil service and
regularizing migration from neighboring
countries.

38

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Policy Actions
The BOT has adhered to its policy of intervening
in foreign exchange markets only to prevent
excessive volatility.
The BOT cut the policy rate by 50 basis points in
the spring of 2015.
The BOT announced a medium-term inflation
target.
The BOT has conducted onsite examinations of
all SFIs. Revamping their prudential regulation
and resolution framework is moving forward, in
consultation with the Ministry of Finance.
The BOT is helping strengthen the supervision of
credit cooperatives, including through technical
assistance to the Ministry of Agriculture.
A series of fiscal stimulus measures have been
rolled out while expediting the disbursement of
local infrastructure projects. The fiscal
responsibility law was approved by the Cabinet
and submitted to the Council of State.
At the request of the authorities, the Fund
provided TA in early 2016 on public investment,
covering both the government and SOEs. A
comprehensive public investment plan is being
prepared for the 12th development plan.
Priority is given to broadening the tax base while
enhancing tax collection, in the context of a
modest economic recovery.
The retirement age is being increased in selected
professions, while broad policies are under
review.

Threat

Likelihood

Impact

Policies to Minimize Impact

External Risks
Tighter or more
volatile global
financial
conditions

M

M: While high international reserves and sound
commercial banks would mitigate the impact, a surge
in global financial market volatility could be disruptive,
particularly against the backdrop of growing linkages
between cross-border financial flows and domestic
credit conditions.

Allow exchange rate flexibility to be the first line
of defense, with judicious currency intervention
to avoid excessive volatility. Provide liquidity to
ensure orderly markets. If financial volatility and
capital outflows affect the real economy and
constrain monetary stimulus, redouble efforts to
accelerate public investment execution to bolster
domestic demand.

Significant
slowdown in
China and/or
other major
emerging
economies

M

H: Given Thailand’s integration in regional supply
chains and high exports, a slowdown in major Asian
economies would have a severe effect on the country.
Likely terms-of-trade improvement—given Thailand’s
large net imports of oil—would provide some cushion.

Re-invigorate exports by actively participating in
regional and global trade integration initiatives,
strongly engaging with fast-growing regional
markets such as CLMV countries, and enhance
competitiveness through structural reforms and
infrastructure investment.

Structurally weak
growth in key
advanced
economies

H

M: With the EU, Japan, and the United States each
accounting for about 10 percent of Thailand’s exports,
a deterioration in the advanced countries’ economic
outlook would depress demand for Thailand’s
products.

Structural reforms and infrastructure
development would raise returns to private
investment and strengthen domestic-demandled growth. Greater orientation toward CLMV
could buttress exports.

Delays in
infrastructure
project
implementation

M

M: Lower-than-projected public investment would
reduce domestic demand in the cyclically weak
economy and would reduce Thailand’s productive
potential in the longer term. It may also weaken
confidence in the government’s ability to manage the
economy, denting private investment and FDI inflows.

Lower the policy rate to offset weaker fiscal
stimulus. On the fiscal side, employ alternative
quick-disbursing yet well-targeted measures,
focusing on vulnerable groups with high marginal
propensity to consume and small shovel-ready
investment projects.

Deflation
becoming
entrenched

M

M: After more than a year of negative CPI and falling
core inflation, with weak domestic demand and low
commodity prices, inflation expectations may shift
down as BOT repeatedly misses the inflation target.
Resulting higher real interest rates and rising real debt
burden would further depress domestic demand.

Lower the policy rate. Signal the intention to keep
it low for long and emphasize the commitment to
the inflation target to re-anchor expectations. Use
macroprudential policy if necessary to address
vulnerabilities exacerbated by low interest rates.

Household debt
overhang boiling
over

M

M: Highly leveraged households may hold back
spending or banks may tighten credit supply, which
would dampen consumption. Furthermore, the debtservicing capacity of households could be constrained
in a vicious cycle of deleveraging and low growth or if
the interest rate cycle turns.

Use available room for additional fiscal and
monetary stimulus. Explore options for household
debt restructuring.

Exacerbation of
drought
conditions

M

M: Disruptions to agricultural production and,
potentially, tourism and industrial activities would
affect output and exports. In addition, water shortage
and rationing may intensify rural-urban tensions.

Provide income support to affected households
while assisting them with farming alternate
products. At the same time, transition from
agricultural occupations into industry and
services should be encouraged and supported.

Renewed
political
instability

M

H: Consumer and business confidence would be
damaged, dampening private investment and FDI
inflows. Public investment plans would be put on hold
again. Supply-side disruptions and international
sanctions are possible. Capital outflows would put
pressure on credit and asset markets.

Allow automatic stabilizers to work. Provide
adequate liquidity to banks to minimize
disruptions in the financial system. Let the
exchange rate be the first line of defense in case
of capital outflows, but use judicious intervention
to avoid excessive volatility.

Domestic Risks

“L”=Low; “M”=Medium; “H”=High. The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most
likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the
baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability
between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the
authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Appendix III. Thailand—Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
1.
Background. The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) framework for market access countries
expands upon the previous DSA to include: (i) an assessment of the realism of baseline assumptions;
(ii) an analysis of risks associated with the debt profile; (iii) macrofiscal risks; (iv) stochastic debt
projections taking into account past macrofiscal volatility; and (v) a summary of risks in a heat map.
2.
Macroeconomic assumptions. Real growth is projected to average slightly above 3 percent
in the medium term, supported in part by public infrastructure investment.
3.
Fiscal assumptions. In staff’s baseline projections, the public sector primary deficit would
worsen from 1.3 to 1.8 percent of GDP between 2016 and 2018 and then improve to 0.8 percent of
GDP in 2021.1 Regarding the transport sector multi-year infrastructure development plan, staff
assumes an implementation rate of 60 percent.
4.
Data coverage. The coverage of public debt in Thailand is fairly comprehensive, including
central government debt, nonfinancial SOEs debt, and SFI debt guaranteed by the government. Local
authorities’ debt (under 1 percent of GDP) is excluded from public debt statistics and this DSA.
5.

Realism of baseline assumptions.



The median forecast error for real GDP growth during 2007−2015 is -2.3 percent of GDP and
may look relatively large at first glance. However, over this period, Thailand went through a
series of unexpected shocks that had a significant impact on growth, such as the Global
Financial Crisis, the flood in 2011, and political uncertainty.



Forecast errors for the primary balance and inflation are comparable to other countries.

6.
The DSA framework suggests that Thailand’s public debt would remain sustainable in
the medium term under various shocks. However, vigilance is needed to ensure that risks
stemming from financial sector contingent
Thailand: Public Debt
liabilities are contained.
(In percent of GDP)
50



1

Under the baseline, the debt-to-GDP ratio is
projected to hover around 45-46 percent,
which is below the government’s ceiling of
60 percent and far below the benchmark of
70 percent for market access countries. The
full execution of the transport sector
infrastructure plan (instead of 60 percent
under the baseline) would result in a slightly

higher debt trajectory: the peak debt-to-GDP ratio would increase by 3 percent to reach
49 percent of GDP by 2019,2 still below the government’s ceiling of 60 percent. This contrasts
with the historical scenario under which the debt-to-GDP ratio declines steadily to 41 percent
by 2021 on the back of sustained fiscal surpluses and higher growth.


The fan chart, which incorporates feedback effects among macroeconomic variables and relies
on historical data to calibrate shocks, illustrates the impact of additional risks to the baseline.
Even under the worst quartile case, the debt-to-GDP ratio would remain well under the
benchmark of 70 percent, suggesting that Thailand’s debt is likely to remain sustainable in the
medium term even in the worst case scenario.



Of the four macro-fiscal shock scenarios, namely, primary balance shock, interest rate shock,
growth shock and exchange rate shock, the growth shock has the largest impact on debt ratios.
In such scenario, real GDP growth falls by one 10-year historical standard deviation (3 percent)
for two consecutive years from 2017, resulting in a deterioration of the primary balance. This
leads to a higher interest rate and lower inflation (0.25 percentage point per 1 percent of GDP
worsening of the deficit). The debt-to-GDP ratio reaches 50 percent in 2018, still below the
government’s ceiling (60 percent) and the framework’s benchmark (70 percent).



Shocks to financial sector contingent liabilities have by far the largest impact on debt ratios. A
one-time capital injection equivalent to 10 percent of commercial banks’ assets results in a oneoff increase in government spending of 13 percent of GDP. If the shock is augmented to include
SFIs, the government spending increase jumps to 17 percent of GDP. These shocks are
combined with an increase in the interest rate (0.25 percentage points per 1 percent of GDP
worsening of the deficit) and a one standard-deviation shock to growth. Under the scenario that
involves commercial banks only, the debt-to-GDP ratio reaches 62 percent in 2019. Under an
augmented shock scenario that involves SFIs in addition to commercial banks, the debt-to-GDP
ratio reaches 67 percent. While these scenarios may entail low probability, they underscore the
importance of properly managing the regulatory frameworks and risks of financial institutions,
including SFIs.

7.


Heat map.
The heat map suggests moderate risk on the external financing requirement (defined as the
current account balance plus amortization of short-term external debt at remaining maturity)
and on the share of public debt held by nonresidents (including official lenders such as the
World Bank). At 9 percent, the external financing requirement exceeds the lower threshold of
early warning benchmarks (5 percent), but large official foreign reserves of over 40 percent of
GDP provide comfortable buffers.

2

Staff assumes a nominal fiscal multiplier of 0.9, estimated for Thailand taking into account the two-way interactions
between fiscal policy and economic activity. For details on the methodology, see S. Dodzin and X. Ba, ”Estimating
Fiscal Multipliers using a Simplified General Equilibrium Model” (forthcoming).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

41

THAILAND



42

The share of public debt held by nonresidents is 16 percent of the total, slightly exceeding the
lower threshold of early warning benchmarks (15 percent). A well functioning domestic bond
market underpinned by a wide base of investors provides some comfort in this regard.
Thailand’s government bond yield has been relatively stable, despite volatile global financial
markets and political uncertainty. Furthermore, Thailand’s public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected
to hover around 45 percent of GDP, which is below the government’s ceiling of 60 percent and
far below the benchmark of 70 percent in the framework.

Appendix IV. Thailand—Avoiding Dark Corners
1. The Inflation Targeting regime in Thailand brought higher stability to inflation and
inflation expectations over the last decade (Grenville and Ito, 2010). More recently,
however, lower oil prices and relatively low growth have pushed headline inflation into negative
territory through Q1 2016, and left medium-term inflation expectations at historical lows.
Moreover, downside risks stem from the international environment, with disinflationary
pressures spreading across the globe.
2. In this context, this appendix explores the scope/power of monetary policy actions to
avoid potential “dark corners” of deflation should downside risks materialize. This is
illustrated by simulation results based on a stylized new Keynesian model built along the lines of
Clinton and others (2015). The policy reaction function is guided by Inflation-Forecast Targeting
(IFT) to capture Thailand’s monetary policy institutional setting. Finally, the economy is assumed
to face additional disinflationary pressures from weaker global growth and subdued commodity
prices that, in the absence of any monetary policy action, would keep headline inflation below
the target band and the output gap in negative territory over the simulation horizon (12
quarters).
3. Simulations consider two extreme scenarios for the reaction of monetary policy to
disinflationary pressures. Under the “aggressive easing” strategy, the policy rate hits the
zero-lower bound floor from the current 150 basis points in three quarters, and stays there for
the rest of the simulation horizon (Text figure, red line). Headline inflation would return to the
target point in three quarters and fluctuate within the BOT’s target range for the rest of the
simulation horizon. In particular, the inflation rate temporarily overshoots the 2.5 percent target
point, so that the simulation allows for a recovery to the target in price level terms. Core inflation
would remain subdued, though a “dark corner” with unanchored inflation expectations is
avoided. Moreover, by preventing further declines in inflation and inflation expectations,
aggressive monetary easing can also prevent a rise in real interest rates and help close the
output gap by the end of the simulation horizon.
4. The advantages of decisive monetary policy action can be illustrated by an alternative
policy reaction that keeps rates on hold for another five quarters. Model simulations
suggest that a delayed policy reaction would lead to a very subdued headline inflation path,
with the inflation rate below the target band (Text figure, blue line) and core inflation in negative
territory over most of the simulation horizon. Moreover, lack of accommodation in nominal rates
would lead to further declines in inflation expectations, exerting an increase of around 200 basis
points in real rates and contributing to a widening negative output gap. In this scenario, a
(delayed) policy cut of 50 basis points after those first five quarters is not able to close the
output gap and inflation undershoots the target band within the simulation horizon. In the
current subdued inflation environment, careful monitoring of disinflationary forces and
readiness to act and communicate in decisive manner (see Alichi et al., 2015) would be
fundamental to prevent the entrenchment of deflationary expectations and avoid dark corners.

2. Debt dynamics were influenced by several factors, including quasi-fiscal measures and
macroeconomic developments. Following the 2011 floods, the government introduced a
first-car buyer program to boost the auto industry, which increased demand for car loans. The
use of credit cards to smooth consumption also expanded rapidly and pushed household debt
further up. Economic growth was sluggish during 2013–15, and declines in commodity prices,
coupled with a severe drought, hit farmers’ income particularly hard. Moreover, low inflation
opened a widening gap between real interest rates and real income growth in recent years.
Further deflationary pressures would increase the real cost of servicing the debt, leading to even
more unfavorable household debt dynamics in the future.

household loans exceeding household deposits.
The BOT has recently conducted onsite inspections of all SFIs and found no imminent systemic
risks. However, financial soundness indicators in these institutions vary considerably, and two
small SFIs are under restructuring. Some SFIs and cooperatives have also seen an increase in
households facing difficulties to remain current on loan payments. Although their NPLs have
been relatively contained by active refinancing opportunities, developments should be
monitored closely.
4. Against this background, the authorities should consider proactive strategies to
address risks form high household debt. Recent developments in the housing market, and
risks from search for yield behavior, call for vigilance. As financial conglomerates increase their
role in the financial landscape, understanding interconnectivity of financial institutions and
addressing systemic risks would help guard against risks to financial stability. Ongoing efforts to
transfer the prudential supervision of SFIs to the BOT and enhance coordination among
regulators are steps in the right direction. Similarly, expanding data collection and analysis of
systemic risks would help better inform any need for tighter macroprudential policies. Moreover,
strengthening the resolution framework would help enhance market discipline and mitigate
excessive risk taking. Proactive policies would help maintain financial stability.

Foreign
asset and
liability
position and
trajectory

Background. The net international investment position (NIIP) improved steadily from -48 percent of GDP in 2000 to -3 percent of GDP in 2009. Subsequently, higher
foreign liabilities raised the NIIP to -23 percent of GDP in 2014. In 2015, the NIIP halved to around -11 percent of GDP due to portfolio investment outflows and subdued
FDI inflows amid steadily rising outward investment by residents.
Assessment. The deterioration of the NIIP during 2010–2014 appears to be largely due to valuation changes as, on average, the current account was in surplus. There
are limited risks to external debt sustainability as Thailand’s external debt is projected to remain low and net foreign liabilities (as a percent of GDP) are expected to
stabilize. The improvement of the 2015 NIIP may not be auspicious as it was mainly driven by portfolio outflows and sluggish FDI. 1/

Current
account

Background. Thailand’s current account (CA) has been volatile over the last decade, ranging from a 4 percent of GDP deficit in 2005 to a 7¼ percent of GDP surplus
in 2009, against a broadly stable trend real appreciation. The current account surplus came down from its peak in 2009 to a deficit of 1¼ percent of GDP in 2013 and
rose back to a surplus of 8 percent of GDP in 2015, with imports declining faster than exports amid record low oil prices. The decline in net oil imports between 2014
and 2015 was 2.6 percent of GDP, explaining more than half of the improvement in the CA.
Assessment. In cyclically-adjusted terms, the EBA CA model estimated the 2015 CA at 7.6 percent of GDP and the CA norm at 1.3 percent of GDP. The CA gap of
6.4 percent of GDP consists of a policy gap of 1.5 percent of GDP, of which 0.7 percent of GDP corresponds to domestic policy gaps, and an unexplained residual of 4.9
percent of GDP. The large unexplained residual is likely due to Thailand-specific factors not well captured by the EBA model, including political uncertainty weighing on
domestic demand and underdeveloped social safety nets, particularly pensions for informal workers. Considering these factors, staff assesses the CA gap within 1½ to
3½ percent of GDP of the level consistent with medium-term fundamentals and appropriate policies. 2/ The CA gap is expected to narrow over the medium term, as
policy stimulus is deployed and private confidence recovers.
Background. Barring the global financial crisis, the Thai baht has been appreciating in real effective terms since 2005. The real effective exchange rate (REER) weakened
during the Fed’s tapering talk in mid-2013 and started to appreciate from mid-2014. During 2015, the REER appreciated by 2.5 percent on average, while the CA surplus
increased. The null contribution of REER appreciation to narrowing the CA gap was likely due to the Thailand-specific factors outlined above, weak domestic demand
and imports, the build-up of global value chains, and volatile capital flows.
Assessment. The EBA index REER gap in 2015 is estimated at -2.8 percent; the EBA level REER gap is estimated at -11.2 percent, but with a large unexplained residual.
Using an elasticity of 0.6, staff assesses the 2015 REER to be 2.5-6 percent below levels consistent with medium-term fundamentals and appropriate policies.
Background. The capital and financial account balance has been negative since 2013. In 2015, the negative balance increased to $18 billion due to portfolio outflows in
both equity and bond markets and subdued FDI inflows. The authorities continued with financial account liberalization, encouraging outward investment by residents.
Assessment. Up to 2013, Thailand enjoyed overall portfolio inflows benefiting from its strong fundamentals. But from 2013, Thailand has faced headwinds, including the
Fed’s interest rate lift-off, China’s slowdown, and political uncertainty. Capital outflows are manageable considering the resilience of the external sector and the flexibility
of the baht, partially offsetting the large current account surplus.

Technical
Background
Notes

Background. The exchange rate is floating with intervention limited to mitigating excessive volatility. International reserves gradually declined from 52 percent of GDP
in 2012 to 43 percent of GDP in 2015, but stand at over three times short-term debt, 180 percent of the IMF’s reserve metric unadjusted for capital controls, and
211 percent of the metric adjusted for capital controls.3/During 2015, reserves declined by around $12 billion, mostly from the net forward position amid persistent
depreciation pressures against the U.S. dollar.
Assessment. The decline in reserves suggests possible intervention to mitigate market volatility, but there is no clear evidence of one-sided intervention considering
valuation effects from the strong U.S. dollar. Thailand’s gross reserves are higher than the range of IMF’s adequacy metrics and there is no need to build up reserves for
precautionary purposes. The exchange rate should continue to move flexibly to serve as a first line of defense against adverse shocks.
1/ The valuation effect results from the difference in returns between foreign assets and liabilities. On the one hand, large capital inflows in most years in the
period 2005-2012 contributed to the growth of asset prices and baht appreciation. As a result, investment returns accruing to foreign investors increased. On the other
hand, a large proportion of Thailand international investment assets consist of foreign exchange reserves, which were mainly invested in foreign government bonds with
lower return.
2/ The EBA model has a large (and rising since 2013) unexplained residual for Thailand, likely driven by political uncertainty not captured by available institutional quality
indices and measures of global risk aversion. During 2015, political uncertainty and associated weak private sector confidence weighed on domestic demand against the
backdrop of high household debt and a cautious adjustment to the sizable oil windfall. Political uncertainty, compounded by prolonged discussions with potential
investors, also led to delays in the execution of large public investment projects, with public investment picking up by year-end through shovel-ready projects with
relatively low import content. Moreover, the public health expenditure variable may not capture still underdeveloped social safety nets, in particular low minimum
pensions accruing to the large informal sector (which accounts for over 50 percent of employment). These factors may increase private sector precautionary savings.
3/ The adjusted metric relies on de jure measures of capital controls. Using these measures to classify Thailand’s capital account openness is problematic, as such de jure
indices are not granular enough to measure the extent of capital account liberalization in Thailand and do not capture whether outflow controls are binding. Moreover,
recent actions to further liberalize capital outflows are not incorporated in this adjusted metric. Staff considers the unadjusted adequacy metric to be more appropriate.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Overall Assessment
Overall Assessment:
The external position in 2015 was
stronger than warranted by
medium-term fundamentals and
desirable policy settings.
However, the overall assessment
and the size of the 2015 CA gap
are subject to a wide margin of
error reflecting Thailand specific
factors not sufficiently captured in
the EBA model, such as political
uncertainty and underdeveloped
social safety nets. Developments in
early-2016, including a continued
surplus in the current account
amid capital inflows, are not likely
to change the overall assessment.
Potential policy responses:
Accommodative macroeconomic
policies and the planned boost to
public infrastructure will support
domestic demand and help lower
the current account gap.
The authorities should continue to
allow the exchange rate to move
flexibly as a first line of defense
against external shocks.
Intervention should be limited to
smoothing excessive market
volatility.



Reserves exceed all adequacy
metrics, thus there is no need to
build up reserves for precautionary
purposes.
The authorities should reform
social safety nets, notably the
fragmented health insurance and
pension schemes compounded by
widespread informality.

Appendix VII. Thailand—External Debt Sustainability Analysis
1.
Thailand’s external debt is projected to remain relatively low over the medium term,
declining from about 33 percent of GDP in 2015 to about 29 percent of GDP in 2021 under
the baseline scenario. Stress tests indicate that external debt would remain stable under various
shocks, such as a higher interest rate, weaker GDP growth, a lower current account balance, and a
one-time 30 percent depreciation of the baht. Under these shocks, the external debt-to-GDP ratio
rises somewhat above the baseline over the projection period. In the case of the exchange rate
depreciation shock, the debt ratio would rise to about 54 percent of GDP. However, this scenario
does not take into account the adjustment in trade flows that would take place if such depreciation
were to occur, i.e. a sharp improvement in the current account that would significantly bring down
the debt-to-GDP ratio.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
After more than a decade when the baht was effectively pegged closely to the U.S. dollar through a
basket of currencies, the exchange rate regime was changed on July 2, 1997. Both the de jure and de
facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating.
Last Article IV Consultation:
At the conclusion of the 2015 Article IV consultations, Executive Directors were encouraged by the
recovery of the Thai economy after a series of shocks in recent years, and noted that the resilience
of the economy has been underpinned by solid economic fundamentals that reflect prudent
macroeconomic management. Looking ahead, they noted that risks are tilted somewhat to the
downside and that the estimated output gap would close only gradually. Directors agreed that the
current accommodative fiscal and monetary policies are appropriate to support the recovery. Over
the medium term, however, Directors noted that fiscal consolidation combined with structural
reforms in infrastructure, education, and immigration, would be key to sustain higher growth, while
at the same time protecting financial stability. In addition, they welcomed the reforms to generalized
subsidy programs, including the rice pledging scheme and energy pricing, and their replacement
with targeted and means-tested support to vulnerable groups. The elimination of cross-price
subsidies among different fuel types and the reinstatement of excises on diesel are welcome
developments as they will reduce economic distortions and contribute to stronger public finances.
Directors welcomed the transition to a headline inflation target in the monetary policy framework.
They noted the recent reduction of the policy rate and indicated that there might be scope for some
further monetary easing, if the expected recovery is delayed. While volatile capital inflows have
presented challenges to macroeconomic management, Directors agreed that Thailand’s strong
policy buffers, including ample reserves and a flexible exchange rate, have served the country well
and have provided the tools to address potential market volatility. They welcomed the progress
made in strengthening financial stability in Thailand and the authorities’ decision to extend the
supervision and regulatory framework of the Bank of Thailand to specialized financial institutions.
Recent Technical Assistance:

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of April 6 2016)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. The authorities have continued to improve
the quality and coverage of data. The dissemination of additional data may enhance the basis for
macroeconomic analysis.
National accounts: The National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) compiles annual
and quarterly GDP estimates using both the production and expenditure approaches. The annual GDP
volume measures are derived at previous year’s prices and as chain-linked indices with 2002 as the
reference year. The NESDB introduced new quarterly GDP current price and chain-linked volume
estimates in May 2015.
Price statistics: The Bureau of Trade and Economic Indexes (BTEI) compiles and disseminates a
monthly consumer price index with weights based on expenditure data collected from households
during the 2011 Socio-Economic Survey. Index coverage is restricted to middle-income urban
households. In addition to headline CPI, the BTEI publishes aggregate indexes for the low-income and
rural populations.
Government finance statistics: The authorities provide data to the Fund consistent with the
Government Finance Statistics Manual, 2001 (GFSM 2001). Data are contributed to both the Government
Finance Statistics Yearbook and the International Finance Statistics. General government fiscal data are
provided to the IMF annually—more timely publication would be desirable. Nonetheless, the authorities
publish monthly data for key GFS-based numbers for the central government budget on their website.
In addition, the authorities compile GFSM 2001-based data for the non-financial state enterprises
(SOEs), although there are delays for selected SOEs. The authorities also publish public sector debt data
in their website, including debt of non-financial SOEs and Specialized Financial Institutions.
Monetary statistics: The authorities submit the Standardized Reporting Forms (SRFs) for monetary
statistics on a timely basis. 10 FSIs for Thailand are published on the IMF’s FSI portal.
Balance of payments: The authorities started publishing balance of payments statistics under BPM6 in
September 2011. The historical data goes back to 2005—a longer historical series would be useful. The
methodology for compiling balance of payments data remains adequate. Additional source data to
complement the ITRS have been developed recently and coverage has been expanded to include
estimates of reinvested earnings and worker remittances outflows. Further improvements are expected
to enhance the data coverage and accuracy of BOP and IIP statistics, in particular in areas where new
concepts have been introduced by BPM6 such as in goods and services. Quarterly IIP data are
disseminated since late 2014 (starting with the first quarter of 2012), in line with SDDS'
recommendation. The data are collected quarterly and publicly available with a lag time of one quarter.
The last observation available for quarterly IIP is Q4-2015 (at time of assessment). Data on external debt
and debt service have significantly improved since the introduction of a quarterly survey of private
nonbank external debt.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Prepared by

Asia and Pacific Department

1.
This supplement reports on information that has become available since the
Staff Report was circulated to the Executive Board on May 6. It does not alter staff’s
broad assessment of policy issues and recommendations contained in the report.
2.
Recent data remain consistent with an ongoing gradual recovery in growth
and inflation.


GDP growth. Real GDP grew by 3.2 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2016,
up from 2.8 percent in the last quarter of 2015. Public expenditure, including doubledigit growth in public investment, and net exports were the main drivers, while
private consumption growth moderated somewhat, given persistently low
agricultural income and the fading impact of short-term stimulus measures. On the
supply side, the non-agricultural sector continued to lead the recovery, supported by
strong tourism and construction.



Inflation. In April, headline inflation turned positive (0.1 percent year-on-year), a few
months ahead of staff’s forecast, as temporary factors led to an unexpected uptick in
food prices, while the base effect of oil prices continued to wane. Core inflation stood
at 0.8 percent, reflecting subdued demand-side inflationary pressures, broadly in line
with staff’s baseline.

3.
Thai financial indicators continue to strengthen in line with regional
developments. Thailand’s ten-year government bond yield declined 57 bps
year-to-date, the equity market index is up by 9.2 percent, and the Thai baht appreciated
by 1.4 percent against the US dollar, but was relatively stable in nominal and real
effective terms.
4.
On May 11, the Bank of Thailand kept the policy interest rate unchanged at
1.5 percent. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) judged the Thai economy would
continue to expand at a gradual rate although it acknowledged greater downside risks
on the domestic front. Nonetheless, low bond yields and a decline in commercial bank
lending rates contributed to easing monetary conditions. Therefore, the MPC voted
unanimously to maintain the policy rate at 1.5 percent to preserve policy space, while
noting that risks to financial stability from search-for-yield behavior continued to warrant
close monitoring.

Statement by Pornvipa Tangcharoenmonkong, Alternate Executive Director
for Thailand
May 23, 2016
1. The Thai authorities express their profound appreciation to the IMF mission team for the
constructive and candid policy discussions, which centered on policies towards a long
lasting economic recovery. They are in broad agreement with the staff’s analysis and the
three-pronged policy recommendation to implement an expansionary macroeconomic
policy mix, safeguard financial stability and boost long-term potential growth. The
authorities welcome staff’s recognition of Thailand’s strong macroeconomic
fundamentals and ample buffers that have helped the country withstand adverse shocks
relatively well, and would like to provide an update on the latest developments as well as
clarifications on some policy issues.
Recent Developments and Near-Term Outlook
2. The Thai economy has been on a gradual recovery path since the beginning of 2015
as private sector confidence is restored. In the first quarter of this year, the economy grew
by 3.2 percent, driven mainly by government spending and broad-based increase in the
number of inbound tourists. This outcome is in line with the authorities’ growth
projection of slightly above 3 percent for the year 2016.
3. The authorities concur that risks to the economic outlook are tilted to the downside
from both external and domestic fronts, including weak global growth prospects,
China’s engineered slowdown due to the structural rebalancing, changes in global trade
structure, plummeting commodity prices, as well as the drought’s impact on the income
of agricultural households. In addition, implementation and communication of monetary
policy in major economies may continue to be a key contributing factor to capital flow
and exchange rate volatility.
4. Despite significant uncertainties and headwinds, Thailand is able to maintain
overall economic stability and sound fundamentals, supported by a strong external
position, robust banking system and flexible exchange rate. Nevertheless, recent global
economic and financial conditions do not warrant complacency and the authorities are
closely monitoring global developments and preparing policy toolkits in order to
appropriately counter unexpected shocks.
Macroeconomic Policy Response
5. On fiscal policy, the authorities view that public spending will continue to play a
crucial role in driving growth in 2016 and beyond, in particular, investment
expenditure that will help crowd-in private investments given its larger scale compared to
last year. With steadfast resolution to get the economy back on sustainable growth path,
the government is committed to pressing ahead with the implementation of key
infrastructure projects. The expedition of the water resources management and road

2
transportation system projects has resulted in satisfactory expansion of public investment
at 12.4 percent in the first quarter of this year, following a 41.2 percent growth in the
fourth quarter of 2015. Against this backdrop, the authorities are optimistic that
investment plan execution will progress at a higher rate compared to historical average
and staff’s assumption, and believe that it will contribute to shoring up private confidence
and market sentiment.
6. The Ministry of Finance has placed high priority on expediting the enactment of the
Fiscal Responsibility Act to enhance public finance management, especially on fiscal
prudence and transparency. The draft Act has been approved by the Cabinet in March
2016 and submitted for consideration of the Council of State. The ongoing reforms of
State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) together with the establishment of a Holding Company
for SOEs, would enhance their governance and transparency, and also contribute to
efficient implementation of government projects in the future. The authorities are
encouraged by staff’s public debt sustainability analysis which suggests that Thailand’s
public debt would remain on a sustainable path in the medium term despite various shock
scenarios.
7. On monetary policy, the authorities have maintained an accommodative stance to
provide favorable liquidity and credit conditions in order to complement expansionary
fiscal policy in supporting domestic demand, while preserving financial stability. The
authorities take note of staff’s concerns over risk of deflation associated with negative
headline inflation and falling inflation expectations in 2015, but view staff’s assessment
as too pessimistic. The development of headline inflation (in terms of y-o-y percentage
change) in Thailand is rather country-specific to the extent that it is more sensitive to
global oil price movements due to smaller tax cushion in retail fuel prices, in comparison
to other oil importing countries. As such, the latest figures already show headline
inflation returning to positive territory in April 2016 as the impact of base effect of high
oil prices from past periods dissipates. Meanwhile, the latest medium-term consensus
forecast for headline inflation (April 2016) stands close to the inflation target at 2.5
percent, suggesting that medium-term inflation expectations remain relatively well
anchored. The authorities anticipate that headline inflation will gradually rise in 2016 and
2017 as a result of continued positive base effect and gradual closing of output gap, albeit
remaining subject to the uncertain outturn of global oil price movements and domestic
demand recovery.
8. The authorities stress the importance of preserving policy space in light of potential
policy spillovers of major economies and the bouts of volatility in the period ahead.
Although staff’s simplified-model simulation of aggressive monetary policy easing
(assuming 150 bps policy rate cut to zero percent) suggests that it might help prevent a
downward spiral of inflation expectations, further easing needs to sufficiently take into
account the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission under the low interest
environment, and more importantly, the potential side effects on search-for-yield

3
behavior and financial stability. The Monetary Policy Committee will remain vigilant on
macroeconomic and financial developments, and stand ready to make use of available
policy space should significant risks materialize.
9. Thailand has witnessed capital flows and financial market volatilities in recent
periods driven by policy divergence of major central banks and the foreign
investors’ search-for-yield behavior. In this regard, the flexible exchange rate has
helped act as a shock absorber for the economy. The Bank of Thailand (BOT) also
occasionally uses foreign exchange intervention to mitigate excessive exchange rate
volatility so as to prevent its adverse effect on domestic financial conditions. In addition,
the BOT announced additional measures earlier this year to relax foreign exchange
regulations under the Capital Account Liberalization Master Plan aimed at deepening
Thailand’s financial markets and encouraging outward investment by residents to balance
capital flow movements.
Financial Sector Stability
10. We are encouraged by staff’s acknowledgement that Thailand’s financial system
remains resilient amidst volatility in global financial markets and welcome in-depth
assessment of macro-financial stability. The banking sector, the key financial
intermediary, has been performing well with comfortable level of capital buffers,
liquidity and profitability ratios. Notwithstanding, the authorities acknowledge that there
are pockets of vulnerabilities among Specialized Financial Institutions (SFIs) and less
regulated intermediaries such as saving/credit cooperatives and non-bank financial
institutions whose exposure to commercial banks have increased over the years.
11. In line with staff’s recommendation, the authorities give high priority to continue
strengthening supervision and oversight of SFIs, most of which are financially
healthy. The transfer of supervisory authority over SFIs to the BOT is expected to be
completed by the end of this year to ensure that SFIs would remain financially sound,
while effectively fulfilling their mandates. The BOT is working on the necessary
preparation to carry out both on-site and off-site examinations of SFIs for compliance
with its regulations and risk management standards.
12. Exposure of cooperatives to commercial banks may have noticeably increased but
remains small in absolute terms. Deterioration in their financial standings is thus likely
to be contained, with limited spillovers to the overall banking sector. Nevertheless, given
that potential implications for retail stakeholders remain, the supervisory agency has been
in close consultation with the BOT on appropriate application of banking standards on
savings cooperatives, and cooperatives’ participation in the national credit bureau
database to improve credit analysis and enhance risk monitoring.
13. The issue of high household debt still lingers, partly as a result of deteriorating
debt-service capabilities of agricultural and low-income households. The authorities

4
share staff’s concern that the debt overhang could weigh down consumption and in turn,
hinder economic recovery. Nonetheless, recent figures suggest that household debt has
somewhat leveled-off following the application of more stringent credit standards and as
the legacy from government’s consumption stimulus measures subsided. To address debt
overhang, the authorities are working on policy measures to facilitate banks in the
process of household debt restructuring.
14. The authorities note staff’s recommendation to tighten the macroprudential policies,
but consider that the various measures currently in place are sufficient at this
juncture. Available policies in the current toolkit are not only in the form of regulations
(e.g. LTVs, loan-loss provisioning, specific risk weights, capital surcharges, etc.), but
also by means of moral suasion which have proven effective so far. The authorities are of
the view that further tightening would require caution in light of sluggish growth. The
degree of adjustment and timing of implementation are also critical to achieve the desired
outcome without unintended consequences. To prepare for possible risks to financial
stability, the authorities are undertaking study on new measures such as Debt-to-Income
Ratio, and stepping up efforts to enhance data quality as well as risk monitoring tools to
improve effectiveness of macroprudential policy implementation. In this respect, the
authorities would like to express appreciation for the Fund’s technical assistance in
strengthening Thailand’s financial stability framework.
Structural Reforms
15. The authorities recognize that structural issues will have an important bearing on
the economy in the long-run. A number of reform policies and measures are underway
to facilitate structural adjustment in the period ahead by promoting high value-added
industries, transforming to digital economy, as well as deepening regional integration to
strengthen the country’s competitiveness. To achieve such objective, a number of
infrastructure upgrade projects will facilitate a more effective transfer of factors of
production both within the country and to neighboring countries. This plays to Thailand’s
geographical advantage of being located at the heart of the ASEAN economic
community. The authorities have taken steps to improve the ease of doing business in
Thailand and collaborated with the private sector to streamline business incorporation
process, reduce red tape and documentation requirements.
16. Regarding developments in regional integration, Thailand continues to benefit from
the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) and participation in other trade
partnerships is also being considered. Within ASEAN, the fast-growing CLMV
countries have become Thailand’s important trading partners. Their robust growth
performances despite the global slowdown would contribute to Thailand’s economic
recovery in the period ahead. As pointed out by staff, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)
could have important implications on the global trade structure going forward. Thai
authorities are now studying the costs and benefits of TPP, and have been in consultation
with national stakeholders to thoroughly evaluate opportunities from as well as the
economic and social implications of joining the agreement. In addition, the authorities are

5
working on other trade partnerships such as the Regional Comprehensive Economic
Partnership (RCEP) between ASEAN and six key regional economies.
17. The authorities are aware that aging population could have important implications
not only on labor productivity, but also on adequacy of social safety nets and pose
contingent fiscal burden. On staff’s recommendation for a more open policy toward
foreign workers, the authorities view that labor policy has been adequately flexible in
addressing labor shortages and priority has been given to policies for improving
migration management to solve the illegal workers problem and limit their impact on
public health expenditure. To tackle this important issue in a holistic and sustainable
manner, the authorities continue their efforts on upgrading labor skills in collaboration
with the private sector, reforming the education system, and promoting the use of
technology to increase productivity.
18. On fiscal consequences of population aging, the authorities are initiating the work
on pension system reforms. The Ministry of Finance has set up a committee to
undertake this task although details have yet to be released at this early stage. The
authorities also aim to enhance individual savings through National Savings Fund that
will cover 25 million people aged between 15-60 years in the informal sector so as to
encourage accumulation of savings for retirement.
Final Remarks
19. The authorities believe that the Thai economy’s strong fundamentals and resilience will
provide solid foundation to meet the future challenges, while the country’s long-term
potential and competitiveness will be enhanced by the steadfast implementation of much
needed reforms, many of which would foster sustainable private investment. The
authorities look forward to continued support by the Fund through invaluable technical
assistance in their reform endeavors.
