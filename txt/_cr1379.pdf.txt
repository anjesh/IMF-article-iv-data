STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. The economy recovered quickly from the global crisis of 2008-09, with low inflation,
and healthy growth is expected to continue. However, risks to the outlook are tilted to the
downside. Absent consolidation, large fiscal deficits would make public debt dynamics
unsustainable in the long-run. Moreover, current policies could result in overheating, a risk that
has been heightened by surging capital inflows.
The short-term policy mix should be adjusted. A tighter fiscal stance would mitigate risks of
rising inflation and external imbalances. The authorities should also stand ready to increase
interest rates and allow greater exchange rate flexibility if signs of inflationary pressure emerge.
In the absence of fiscal adjustment, bolder monetary policy action may be required to ensure
price stability.
Steady fiscal consolidation is required over the medium term. The threat of unsustainable
public debt dynamics calls for corrective action. The authorities’ intention to renew tax reform
efforts and implement other fiscal consolidation measures is a welcome first step. A moderately
front-loaded adjustment would strike the appropriate balance between achieving fiscal
sustainability and maintaining robust growth. Postponing fiscal consolidation further could
endanger macroeconomic stability.
It is important to strengthen the monetary policy framework, by increasing exchange rate
flexibility and completing the transition to inflation targeting. This would permit consolidating
gains in lowering inflation made in recent years.
Further improvements in financial system regulation and supervision as well as structural
reforms to stimulate potential growth are desirable. Deepening consolidated and risk-based
supervision as well as gradually adopting Basel III capital and liquidity standards would further
buttress financial system soundness. Efficiency-enhancing measures to fuel competition and
eliminate red-tape would help boost growth and bolster external competitiveness.

OVERVIEW
1.
Costa Rica was resilient to the 2008-09 financial crisis and recovered quickly. In
response to the downturn, the authorities increased public expenditure and entered in a high-access
precautionary Stand-By Arrangement with the Fund (that ended in mid-2010), while depreciation of
the colón facilitated external adjustment. Macroeconomic and financial stability were maintained.
After falling modestly in 2009, real GDP grew strongly in 2010-12, with low inflation. As global
economic conditions improved, private capital inflows resumed and the nominal exchange rate
returned to pre-crisis levels, reaching the floor of the exchange rate band by end-2010.
2.
However, the fiscal situation deteriorated markedly and attempts to correct it have
encountered strong headwinds. The budgetary stimulus imparted in 2009, mainly through a rise in
wages and transfers, was not reversed when the economy improved and a new government took
office. The increase in public expenditure combined with an endogenous fall in revenue (which was
above trend in 2008) pushed the fiscal deficit above 5 percent of GDP by 2010—from near balance in
2008. While the authorities curbed expenditure growth in 2011-12, the budgetary position improved
only moderately and public sector debt kept on climbing. A revenue-enhancing tax reform aimed at
placing the public sector balance on a sustainable path was voided in 2012.

Growth picked up in 2012, with inflation well within the policy limits. Real GDP grew by
about 5 percent in 2012 (up from an average of 4½ percent during 2010-11), buoyed by strong
investment and exports, especially in manufacturing. As a result, the negative output gap that arose
during the downturn is estimated to have almost closed. By year-end, headline inflation stood at
4.6 percent, comfortably within the 4-6 percent official target range, and core and producer price
inflation were also subdued. At a historical low of 5.7 percent in December, twelve-month inflation
expectations were anchored within the target range.

A significant rise in capital inflows more than offset a modest increase in the external
current account deficit and placed strong appreciating pressure on the colón. Robust foreign
direct investment (FDI), higher public and private external borrowing, and, since late August 2012, a
rise in net portfolio inflows increased the financial and capital account surplus. The rise in private
capital inflows kept the colón at the bottom of the exchange rate band, and prompted the central
bank to step up its foreign exchange purchases. As a result, net international reserves (NIR) at end2012 rose to US$6.9 billion, close to adequacy metrics (Box 1).

Competitiveness has eroded and may not be adequate to ensure long-term external
stability. Since 2005, the real effective exchange rate (REER) has appreciated by over 30 percent,
largely due to high inflation differentials. Multilaterally consistent estimates under the EBA and CGER
approaches suggest that the current account deficit is above medium-term fundamentals-based
levels (Box 1) and point to moderate REER overvaluation. Productivity-enhancing reforms (¶ 27) and
wage restraint would help restore

While public expenditure growth was
contained, the fiscal deficit remained large and
the public debt ratio kept rising. During 20112012, the authorities slammed the brakes on the
rapid swelling of public expenditure of 2008-10 by
freezing public sector vacancies, containing wage
growth, rationalizing outlays on goods and
services, and postponing non-priority public
investment projects. These efforts helped reduce
the fiscal deficit to an estimated 4½ percent of
GDP in 2011 and 2012, from a peak of 5½ percent
of GDP in 2010. However, they did not prevent a

Box 1. Costa Rica: External Stability Assessment
Costa Rica’s share in global merchandise trade fell in the last decade, but the export-oriented
services sector is growing rapidly. Costa Rica’s share in total world trade has decreased mostly driven
by a lower contribution of traditional exports. This decline and the significant widening observed in the
merchandise trade deficit, however, were partly offset by a steady increase in the surplus of the real
services balance.

Survey-based indicators of competitiveness highlight some key challenges. Costa Rica’s ranking in

the same magnitude, though at a much slower

Multilaterally-consistent estimates suggest that Costa Rica’s REER is moderately overvalued, and
that a narrower current account deficit would be warranted over the medium term.
External balance assessment (EBA) estimates rely on econometric analysis to gauge the values of key
indicators of external sustainability implied by fundamentals and desirable policies:

Box 1. Costa Rica: External Stability Assessment (concluded)
•

The current account regression-based approach points to a sustainable cyclically-adjusted current
account deficit of about 2.7 percent of GDP, which is 2 percentage points below the current
cyclically-adjusted level. The gap reflects in part the effect of the large fiscal deficit and generous
social protection policies that reduce the need for precautionary saving.

•

Preliminary estimates under the REER regression-based approach point to an overvaluation of
about 25 percent. This result, however, should be interpreted with caution. While it is driven in part
by identifiable factors—notably, again, by the country’s fiscal policies and high social spending— it
is also characterized by a large regression residual.

•

Under the external sustainability approach, the net foreign asset (NFA) position would stabilize at
the benchmark level of 26 percent with a current account deficit of 1.9 percent. This suggests that
the REER gap is about 23 percent. However, if alternative estimates for the NFA position are used,1
the NFA-stabilizing current account deficit widens to 3.5 percent and the estimated REER
overvaluation drops to 12 percent.

Methodologies developed by the IMF’s Consultative Group on Exchange Rate Issues (CGER) also suggest
that the real exchange rate is moderately overvalued: three different approaches produce a deviation
from fundamentals-based values in the range of 7.9 to 14.6 percent.

While Costa Rica’s current account deficit appears elevated, its financing structure mitigates
risks. The current account deficit is mostly financed by FDI inflows, which have hovered at about 5
percent of GDP per year since 2005. As a result, Costa Rica’s net international investment position is
negative, with more than 60 percent of the external liabilities are comprised of FDI liabilities. Such
financing structure makes the external accounts less vulnerable to sudden changes in global financial
conditions.
The level of net international reserves (NIR) is somewhat below the composite adequacy metric.
According to staff’s estimates, Costa Rica’s NIR stand at about 95 percent of the reserve adequacy
metric that captures countries’ vulnerabilities based on their exports and asset-liability structure, as well
as the risk of related outflows.2

The Supreme Court voided a revenue-enhancing tax reform. As discussed in the staff
report for the 2011 Article IV consultation, a tax reform aimed at increasing public revenues by
1½-2 percentage points of GDP (by broadening the tax base and turning the sales tax into a fullfledged value-added tax) was the cornerstone of the government’s fiscal consolidation strategy. In
March 2012, Congress approved the bill but a month later the Supreme Court nullified it, citing
procedural irregularities in its legislative approval. Since then, the authorities’ fiscal policy strategy
focused on containing expenditure, strengthening tax administration, and reducing borrowing costs
by tapping international capital markets. The government placed US$1 billion Eurobonds in late 2012
and is planning to place an additional US$3 billion in the coming years.
8.
Domestic financial conditions tightened during 2012. Although the monetary policy rate
has remained at 5 percent since mid-2011, other interest rates rose significantly, especially during
the first half of the year, driven by large government borrowing and buoyant private sector credit
demand. Interest rates declined somewhat late in the year, but remained above the previous year’s
level. A broader-based index developed by staff (comprising variables such as interest rates, the
REER, and house prices) also pointed to tighter financial conditions (Box 2). Despite this tightening,
credit expansion to the private sector was slightly higher than nominal GDP growth.

Box 2. Costa Rica: Financial Conditions
A Financial Conditions Index (FCI) was developed for Costa Rica. Financial conditions can be
defined as the current state of financial variables that influence economic activity. The FCI seeks to
summarize the information contained in key financial variables and capture the link between them and
economic activity. A VAR analysis was used to decompose the contribution of various financial
indicators to real GDP growth. The FCI was built as the sum of the cumulative impulse responses of real
GDP to each of the relevant financial

variables. The financial variables used

overall FCI reflects the total contribution
of financial conditions to GDP growth.
The estimated FCI suggests that financial conditions tightened in 2012. The rise in the basic passive
interest rate and a weaker stock market during the first half of the year were the main drivers of the
tightening in the FCI. Financial conditions eased somewhat during the second half of the year, partly
driven by a decline in the basic passive interest rate in the fourth quarter. However, considering the year
as a whole, financial conditions in 2012 were on average tighter than in 2011. Tighter financial
conditions may have been a drag on growth, which showed slowing signs in the second half of the year.

The financial system remained sound, though dollarization continues to be a source of
vulnerability. Capital adequacy stood well above regulatory requirements and liquidity remained
robust. Profitability was stable, albeit somewhat below that of regional peers, and non-performing
loans are at manageable levels. Reliance on foreign funding is small and exposure to foreign assets
modest. Staff analysis suggests that a potential intensification of sovereign and banking strains in
advanced countries would not have a large direct impact on credit or the financial system in Costa
Rica (Box 3). Stress test exercises conducted by bank supervisors in 2012 yielded similar results.
Although the banking sector has a long open foreign exchange position, a large depreciation of the
colón may impact asset quality, given large unhedged liability dollarization of households and
corporations.

Box 3. Costa Rica: Cross-Border Spillovers1
Strong trade and financial linkages make Costa Rica particularly sensitive to shocks emanating
from the United States (U.S.). The U.S. is Costa Rica’s main trading partner, the destination of over a
third of its merchandise exports and the source of almost 40 percent of its merchandise imports.
Financial linkages also are strong, with a large share of external assets and liabilities of Costa Rica’s
banks concentrated in the U.S. In addition, the bulk of foreign direct investment flows comes from the
U.S. (64 percent of the total FDI stock is of U.S. origin).
Risks stemming from a growth slowdown
in the U.S. are significantly higher than
those from lower growth in other trading
partners. Results from multi-country VAR
analysis suggests that an adverse shock of
½ standard deviation in U.S. growth could
lower Costa Rican GDP growth by 1 3
percentage points in 2013 and ¾ percentage
points in 2014. A U.S. growth shock would
propagate to Costa Rica both directly and
indirectly through its negative impact on
other Central American countries. In
comparison, a shock of a similar size in China
would lower growth by 1 5 and 2 5 percentage
points in 2013 and 2014, respectively, while
growth shocks in Europe and the rest of
Central America would have very modest
effects.

Fiscal adjustment in the U.S. could have comparatively significant but still limited effects on
Costa Rica. Simulations suggest that each percentage point of GDP of fiscal adjustment in the United
States would reduce Costa Rican growth by about 0.1 percentage points.
Though the presence of foreign banks is important, the direct effects of banking stress spillovers
on the Costa Rican economy do not seem large. As of end-2012, the market share of international
banks subsidiaries was about a third of the banking sector’s total assets. The private and public sectors
also have been actively involved in direct cross-border borrowing from international banks. The
associated rollover risks, however, appear to be moderate, as the upstream exposure of Costa Rica to all
BIS reporting banks does not exceed 13 percent of total credit.2




The analysis of various stress scenarios based on the RES/MFU Bank Contagion Module suggests that
the impact of large haircuts in the sovereign debt of some European countries on international banks
lending to Costa Rica would be close to zero. This is due to the limited sovereign exposure of these
banks to the euro area periphery countries.
The estimates also indicate that the direct impact on lending to Costa Rican residents from a
10-percent decline in value in European assets (both sovereign and non-sovereign) held by
international banks lending to Costa Rica would not exceed 3 percent of GDP.

Macroeconomic Outlook and Risks

10.
Both authorities and staff project growth to decelerate in 2013, with inflation and the
current account deficit remaining broadly stable. Real GDP growth would ease to 4¼ percent
largely on account of a lower contribution from net exports and a somewhat slower expansion in
domestic demand. On the supply side, the bulk of the slowdown would come from manufacturing
after an exceptionally strong performance in 2012. With output still slightly below potential, inflation
is projected to stay within the target range and the current account deficit would not change
materially. The overall balance of payments would remain strongly in surplus, amid continuing large
FDI and portfolio inflows, leading to further substantial NIR rise.
11.
Staff’s medium-term baseline scenario envisages continuing growth but a modest
deterioration in fundamentals. This central setting contemplates no fiscal consolidation over the
forecast period (given uncertainties surrounding passage of the tax reform, ¶ 21), and projects the
output gap to close by 2014, after which growth would converge to a steady-state potential rate of

12

COSTA RICA

4½ percent. The overall fiscal deficit would increase to about 7½ percent of GDP by 2018, and the
public debt ratio would rise steadily to about 50 percent of GDP. With prudent monetary policy,
inflation is projected to hover around 5 percent, though the current account deficit increases to
about 6 percent of GDP.

An alternative scenario that incorporates the authorities’ fiscal consolidation intentions
yields a stronger outlook. The authorities aim to start a process of adjustment as well as adopt
monetary and exchange rate policies that would keep the economy on a robust growth path, while
alleviating lingering vulnerabilities. This scenario would have inflation gradually declining to trade
partners’ levels and would improve prospects for long-term external and fiscal sustainability (¶s 5
and 19). According to staff analysis, the authorities’ plans would have only moderate short-term
output costs and help lower inflation and the current account deficit over the forecast period.

Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. Downside risks stem from both external
and domestic sources. While deviations from the assumed baseline for each of the risk factors listed
below could occur in either direction, the probability of downside occurrences is deemed prevalent.
•

Weaker global growth would reduce the demand for Costa Rican exports and FDI flows,
weakening domestic activity. Costa Rica would be particularly sensitive to a worsening in the
U.S. growth outlook, given close trade and financial links.

•

Higher global risk aversion would ease the pressures stemming from large capital inflows
but, if extreme, could impair access to international capital markets and bank lending, with
adverse implications for growth, the balance of payments, and the fiscal accounts.

•

Inflation shocks could stem from an increase in commodity prices, stronger-than-expected
price pressures from current policies, or inability to manage large private capital inflows.

•

The persistence of a large fiscal deficit, and the ensuing rise in the public debt ratio, could
render the economy vulnerable to sudden changes in financial market conditions, and
reduce the authorities’ policy space to respond to adverse shocks. Also, large government
financing requirements could raise domestic interest rates, and weigh on private investment
and growth.

•

A large depreciation of the colón (in the event of an adverse balance of payments shock)
could weaken the balance-sheets of corporate and households, given their negative foreign
exchange positions, raising credit risks for banks, hurting economic activity.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
14.
Discussions centered on how to maintain macroeconomic stability and reduce
vulnerabilities, while taking actions to spur potential growth and boost competitiveness. In the
near term, tighter fiscal and monetary policies may be necessary to maintain macroeconomic
stability. In addition, fiscal consolidation is necessary to place public finances on a long-term
sustainable path, the monetary policy framework should be further improved to maintain low
inflation, financial sector supervision and regulation should be further enhanced, and structural
reforms are needed to boost the growth potential of the economy and bolster competitiveness.

A.

Near-term Policy Mix

15.
Staff cautioned about inflationary risks. Though inflation has stayed subdued since 2009,
risks of an uptick stem from: (i) continued capital inflows in the context of a lax global financial
environment and a rigid exchange rate system; (ii) potential second round effects from higher global
food prices (deserving special attention in light of their elevated pass-through in the past); and
(iii) the imminent closure of the output gap. While agreeing with this assessment, the authorities
highlighted that inflation expectations have recently fallen and are well-anchored within the target
range.
16.
There was agreement that a tighter policy stance would help safeguard macro stability,
but the authorities indicated that major fiscal adjustment was not possible in 2013.
•

Staff argued that a tighter fiscal stance in 2013 would contribute to mitigate risks of inflation
and a wider external imbalance. It would also represent a step towards ensuring long-term
sustainability (¶ 19). In staff’s assessment, a fiscal correction of about 1-1½ percent of GDP in
2013 would be appropriate, taking into consideration inflation and fiscal sustainability
concerns as well as the cyclical position of the economy (¶ 20 and AN 3). The authorities
noted that, while administrative efforts to contain expenditure and improve tax collections
would continue and result in some decline of the fiscal deficit, a correction of the magnitude
recommended by staff would require passage of fiscal measures, notably tax reform, through
Congress, which the authorities considered unlikely to be enacted before 2014 owing to the
parliamentary calendar.

•

The authorities indicated readiness to tighten monetary policy if signs of inflationary pressure
emerge. Staff highlighted that, in the absence of fiscal adjustment, actions may be required
to keep inflation within the target range. The central bank indicated that, to prevent a
resurgence of inflation, it would consider raising the policy rate and allowing greater
exchange rate flexibility, probably coupled with adoption of capital flows management
measures.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

COSTA RICA

B.

Safeguarding Fiscal Sustainability

17.
The authorities concurred that current fiscal trends are unsustainable in the long-term.
While efforts made in 2011-12 to contain expenditure yielded important results (¶ 6), the fiscal deficit
remains well above debt-stabilizing levels. Moreover, in the absence of measures, the consolidated
public sector deficit would rise to about 7½ percent of GDP by 2018, driven by higher education and
investment spending and a mounting interest bill. This would increase public sector debt to about
50 percent of GDP by 2018 (from 33 percent of GDP at end-2011). The authorities acknowledged
that a rise in debt of that magnitude would raise vulnerabilities and erode the underpinnings of
macroeconomic stability.
18.
The authorities also acknowledged that the pension system’s financial position has to
be strengthened. The Old Age, Disability and Survivor insurance plan run by the Social Security
agency (Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social or CCSS) as well as the pension funds of the judicial
system and teachers are actuarially imbalanced. They are projected to turn a cash deficit over the
medium and long term due to system maturation and population aging (AN 3). Preliminary
projections suggest that an adjustment equivalent to about 1½ percent of GDP would be required to
ensure actuarial equilibrium of all pension systems for the next 100 years. The authorities indicated
that a joint study (by the CCSS and the Superintendence of Pensions) would allow determining more
precisely the size of the imbalance. Based on the results from the study, gradual corrective measures
(in the form of higher contributions, lower replacement rates, an increase in the retirement age, or a
combination of measures) would be considered.
19.
The authorities agreed that substantial improvement in the primary balance was
necessary to attain fiscal sustainability. Staff noted that a permanent improvement in the primary
balance of 2½-3 percent of GDP was necessary to stabilize the public debt ratio, and that the
improvement would have to be 1½ percentage points of GDP higher to remedy the actuarial
imbalance of the pension system (¶ 18), with the long-term fiscal sustainability gap thus totaling
4-4½ percentage points of GDP. Staff also argued that, beyond stabilizing the public debt ratio, it
might be prudent to rebuild the budgetary buffers heavily eroded during 2009-10, considering the
high sensitivity of public debt dynamics to shocks and the substantial risks to the outlook. Attaining
this goal would require an additional improvement in the primary balance of about 1 percent of
GDP.

20.
It was recognized that the pace of fiscal consolidation had to strike a balance between
lowering the sustainability gap and limiting the adverse impact on growth. While cyclical
considerations (output is close to potential) and the rapid pace at which public debt is growing call
for significant upfront fiscal tightening, the overall adjustment needed to achieve sustainability
should be adopted gradually. Staff analysis suggests that a reasonable balance would be attained by
undertaking about one third of the fiscal consolidation in 2013 (or at the latest in 2014) followed by
smaller steps in subsequent years (AN 3). With a fiscal multiplier of about 0.3 (multipliers tend to be
small when the output gap is virtually closed), consistent with the authorities’ own estimates, the
proposed adjustment path would be expected to have a small output cost over the forecast period.
At the same time, staff cautioned against further postponing fiscal adjustment, emphasizing that the
longer the delay, the larger will be the improvement in the primary balance required to stabilize the
public debt ratio. Postponing fiscal consolidation would also increase the risk that currently favorable
financial conditions reverse, which would precipitate a disorderly adjustment.
21.
The authorities favor a fiscal consolidation strategy with both revenue and expenditure
components.
•

•

Recognizing Costa Rica’s low tax effort, the
authorities saw significant scope to increase
public revenues. They remained convinced that a
tax reform similar to the one they had proposed
in 2011-12 had to be the cornerstone of the
fiscal consolidation strategy. For this reason, the
authorities considered that their plan to
resubmit a tax reform proposal to Congress was
an important step, as it would allow consensus
to be built before a new administration takes
office in May 2014. Staff agreed and welcomed
new legislation approved in 2012 to strengthen
revenue administration.

C.

Upgrading the Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy Framework

22.
Staff commended the authorities for having lowered inflation to single digits. Having
posted double-digit inflation for almost 30 years, Costa Rica has managed to lower it to
4-6 percent since 2009. This achievement has been underpinned by continued efforts by the central
bank to improve monetary control and strengthen its monetary operations framework, notably
through the establishment of a corridor for short-term interest rates and the launch of a policy
interest rate in 2011. Inflation, nonetheless, remains above that of trading partners. The authorities
reaffirmed their goal to reduce inflation to trading partners’ levels (about 3 percent) over the
medium term.
23.
However, the monetary policy framework still presents weaknesses. Staff argued that
the continued adherence to the exchange rate band was undermining the hard-won gains in
lowering inflation, and the central bank’s ability to anchor inflation expectations. With the exchange
rate at the bottom of the band and persistent appreciating pressures, the central bank has thus far
reconciled monetary and exchange rate policy objectives by sterilizing foreign exchange purchases.
However, the risk is high that sterilization costs will increase, widening the central banks’ deficit,
particularly if capital inflows rise further. Clinging to the rigidity of the current exchange rate band
could then lead to higher inflation. The central bank recognized these risks and indicated that,
should conflicts arise, the inflation target would take precedence over other objectives.
24.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to adopt full inflation targeting, but are
concerned that removal of the band would result in abrupt colón appreciation. To protect
macroeconomic stability, staff repeated the advice given in past Article IV consultations of
eliminating the exchange rate band and establishing the inflation target as the undisputed anchor of
monetary policy. This would allow greater use of the exchange rate as a shock absorber. A more
flexible exchange rate regime would also make market participants more cognizant of two-way risks
in exchange markets, promoting the development and use of hedging facilities and the reduction of
foreign currency mismatches. The authorities concurred in principle, but they saw a serious risk of a
large appreciation of the colón at the present juncture. To mitigate the latter, the authorities noted
that they may consider the adoption of capital flow management measures (CFMs). Staff noted that
the elimination of the band would not preclude the central bank from engaging in foreign exchange
market interventions to smooth out exchange rate fluctuations as long as these do not undermine
the inflation target. At the same time, it stressed that CFMs cannot replace fiscal and monetary
policies as the key levers for preventing excessive REER appreciation over the medium term.

D.

Financial Stability

25.
The authorities are working to implement pending recommendations from the 2008
FSAP update. Progress in implementation has been slow, largely due to a crowded legislative
agenda. Key pending steps include empowering the Superintendence of Financial Institutions to
conduct consolidated supervision, providing adequate protection to bank supervisors, strengthening
bank resolution procedures, and broadening the supervisory perimeter to non-bank financial
institutions, all of which require passage of new legislation. On the supervisory front, staff welcomed
progress in establishing risk-based supervision, and advised the authorities to step up efforts for its
full implementation.

26.
Staff supported the gradual adoption of Basel III standards to improve further the
resilience of the financial system. It noted that implementation of Basel III standards should be
tailored to the characteristics of the Costa Rican financial system. Staff argued that the regulatory
and risk management frameworks would benefit from firming up capital quality and increasing
liquidity and capital requirements in line with Basel III standards. In particular, it advised introducing
Basel III definitions of capital, a capital conservation buffer, and a leverage ratio. Supervisors agreed
and confirmed that a coverage ratio conforming to Basel III will be introduced shortly. Staff estimates
that adopting Basel III capital requirements would have a negligible negative growth impact (AN 4).

E.

Structural Reforms

27.
There was agreement that Costa Rica needs structural reforms to boost potential
growth and buttress competitiveness. Staff recommended lifting competition in the banking
sector (including by removing legal and regulatory differences between private and public banks),
fostering the development of the domestic capital market, addressing infrastructure bottlenecks, and
streamlining business regulations. According to staff estimates, efficiency gains from these measures
could increase potential growth by up to 2 percentage points over the long run, although these are
subject to a considerable degree of uncertainty. The authorities underlined the need to increase
investment in infrastructure and noted ongoing projects in this area. They also pointed out progress
in increasing competition in the insurance sector, which is expected to contribute to financial
deepening.

STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
Having recovered fast from the global crisis of 2008-09, Costa Rica is well placed to
maintain vigorous growth, but external and domestic strains loom large. The output gap that
emerged during 2008-09 has almost closed, while inflation is well within the target range and
projected to remain stable. However, risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. On the external
front an adverse shock in the U.S. would have a significant impact on growth. As for domestic risks,
the current policy mix may not be conducive to lasting macroeconomic stability, and may result in
overheating. Surging capital inflows, amidst lax global financial conditions, increase this risk. At the
same time, continuing sizable fiscal deficit could hurt confidence and raise borrowing costs.
29.
To lessen risks for macroeconomic stability, the fiscal deficit should be reduced and
monetary policy prepared for tightening. While spending growth has been contained in the last
two years, the fiscal deficit remains large, and public sector debt is rising. With a closing output gap,
an early fiscal correction of about 1-1½ percent of GDP would contain the risk of an acceleration of
domestic demand, which could stir up price pressures and external imbalances. Such an adjustment
would also make an important contribution toward stabilizing the public debt-to-GDP ratio. The
monetary policy stance appears conducive to stable inflation. However, risks that inflation may turn
higher than anticipated persist. Accordingly, interest rates should be raised and greater exchange
rate flexibility allowed, if there is evidence on an inflation uptick.

30.
Ambitious fiscal consolidation should be sustained over the medium term. The current
fiscal path, with continuously rising government debt, is untenable in the long-term and exacerbates
macroeconomic fragilities. The authorities should thus seek to stabilize the public-debt-to-GDP ratio,
which would require a permanent improvement in the primary balance of about 2½-3 percentage
points of GDP. Additional adjustment (of about 1½ percentage points of GDP) would be necessary to
bring the pension system to actuarial equilibrium. The pace of fiscal consolidation should balance the
objectives of lowering the sustainability gap and limiting the adverse short-term impact on growth,
which is quite feasible, since fiscal multipliers are low when the output gap is small. Reducing
gradually the public debt ratio is also desirable to increase fiscal policy buffers.
31.
Fiscal consolidation should include both revenue and expenditure measures. The size of
the fiscal adjustment required to ensure sustainability calls for a multi-pronged strategy. There is
significant scope to increase public revenues, since Costa Rica’s tax effort is low for an upper-middleincome country. In this connection, the intention of the government to seek parliamentary approval
of a new version of the tax reform is welcome. In addition, revenue administration should be further
strengthened. At the same time, current expenditure growth, which greatly outstripped nominal GDP
growth during 2008-10, should be restrained, including through efficiency gains, as planned by the
authorities.
32.
The monetary policy framework should be strengthened by moving to inflation
targeting and allowing greater exchange rate flexibility. Continued adherence to the exchange
rate band system may imperil the low inflation achieved in recent years, in light of the strong
appreciating pressures exacerbated by the large capital inflows. Sterilization of foreign exchange
purchases will become increasingly costly and ultimately compel the central bank to allow higher
inflation. To protect macroeconomic stability, the authorities should phase out the exchange rate
band and establish the inflation target as the sole nominal anchor of the economy. Foreign exchange
market interventions by the central bank to smooth out exchange rate fluctuations and strengthen
the NIR position would still be possible insofar as these do not undermine the inflation target. If
necessary, these policies, along with appropriate fiscal and monetary policies, could be
complemented for a limited period by macro-prudential and other capital flow management
measures.
33.
Further improvements in regulation and supervision of the financial system are
desirable. The risk of a sharp deterioration of the bank loan portfolio following a large depreciation
of the colon (given that a sizable share of dollar-borrowers does not generate significant earnings in
foreign currency) is of particular concern. To mitigate this and other vulnerabilities, measures
recommended in the 2008 FSAP update but still not implemented should be adopted. On the
supervisory front, full-fledged introduction of risk-based supervision should be a priority. In addition,
the regulatory and risk management frameworks would benefit from firming up the existing capital
quality and increasing liquidity and capital requirements in line with Basel III standards.

34.
Structural reforms should be pursued to boost potential growth. Measures to lift
competition in the banking sector (including by promoting higher private sector participation), foster
the development of the domestic capital market, reduce infrastructure bottlenecks, and streamline
business regulations are especially important.
35.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

Exchange Rate Arrangement. Costa Rica’s de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as a
“crawling band,” while the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a “stabilized
arrangement.” Since October 2006, the de jure exchange rate arrangement has been a crawling
band with an increasing width. The ceiling and floor of the band have been adjusted several times,
most recently in January 2009, when the crawl rate of the band’s ceiling has been set at 0.20 colones
(previously 0.06 colones) a business day. The floor of the band has been flat since July 2008. As of
January 23, 2013, the intervention buying and selling exchange rates were 500 and 765.25 colones

PAST FUND STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS AND
IMPLEMENTATION
2011 Article IV Staff Recommendation

Implementation

Fiscal Policy


Rebuild fiscal buffers that were used to contain the
impact of the global crisis. Moreover, fiscal consolidation
is needed to safeguard fiscal sustainability over the
medium and long term. More ambitious fiscal
consolidation targets than those envisioned by the
authorities would be advisable.



The consolidation strategy should center on both
revenue enhancing measures and expenditure restraint.
Planned efforts to strengthen tax administration are also
appropriate.



The near-term risks to the inflation outlook stem
from possible second-round effects from higher
commodity prices and sustained capital inflows. The
authorities should stand ready to increase interest rates if
signs of inflationary pressures emerge.



Upgrading the monetary policy framework should
receive higher priority. Exchange rate flexibility should be
raised and the interest rate corridor narrowed to enhance
monetary control.



The fiscal deficit has remained high,
although the authorities have contained
somewhat expenditure growth since 2011



The tax reform proposed by the
authorities in 2011 was void by the Supreme
Court in early 2012 due to procedural
irregularities. Since then, the authorities have
shifted their fiscal adjustment efforts to
containing expenditure pressures,
strengthening tax administration, and
reducing borrowing costs by tapping
international markets. The authorities intend
to resubmit a tax reform to congress.

Monetary Policy





Inflation has fallen to historically lows,
partially in response to the authorities’
continued efforts to strengthen the
monetary operations framework, notably
through establishment of a corridor for
short-term interest rates and the launch of a
policy interest rate in 2011.



The authorities have reiterated their
intentions to move to a more flexible
exchange rate system, although the band
system is still in place and the exchange rate
remains at the appreciated end of the band.

Speed up the transition toward inflation targeting.
Too long a transition may compromise the central bank’s
credibility.

Financial Sector


Implementation of the 2008 FSAP recommendations
should be accelerated.



Progress on introducing FSAP
recommendations has been mixed.



Congressional approval should be sought for
legislation to enhance consolidated supervision, establish
a deposit insurance system and strengthen the bank
resolution framework.



Critical legislation to enhance
consolidated supervision and strengthen
bank resolution remains to be approved.





The authorities should continue working to
introduce risk-based supervision.

By end-2012, implementation of a riskbased supervision methodology had been
largely completed, but more work needs to
be done to make it fully operational.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK AND BANK-FUND
COLLABORATION UNDER THE JOINT MANAGEMENT ACTION
PLAN (JMAP)
1.

In November 2012, the IMF’s Costa Rica team led by Mr. Figliuoli (mission chief) met

with the World Bank’s Costa Rica team led by Mr. Calvo-Gonzalez (lead economist and PREM
sector leader) to discuss macroeconomic challenges, identify macrocritical structural reforms,
and coordinate the two teams’ work.
2.

The teams agreed that Costa Rica’s main macroeconomic challenges are to safeguard

fiscal sustainability, increase the effectiveness of monetary policy, maintain financial sector
stability and enhance competitiveness.
3.

The teams also discussed the risks to Costa Rica’s inflation outlook stemming from

large capital inflows, high commodity prices and closing of the output gap.
4.

Based on the shared assessment of macroeconomic challenges, the teams identified

four structural reform areas as macrocritical:


Fiscal consolidation. The fiscal consolidation strategy should comprise both revenue and
expenditure components. On the revenue side, consensus should be sought to enact a tax
reform along the lines of the 2011-12 proposal. On the expenditure side, the focus should
be to contain the pace of growth of current expenditure, including wages and transfers. In
addition, the authorities should continue working on strengthening revenue administration.



Monetary policy framework. The transition to inflation targeting and greater exchange rate
flexibility should be accelerated in order to lock in low inflation achieved in recently years.



Financial sector stability. Progress has been made in adopting risk-based financial
supervision. Looking ahead, approval of legislation on consolidated supervision, deposit
insurance and banking resolution will be critical to bring the regulatory framework up to
international best practices.



Competitiveness. The country is making progress in addressing issues of universal coverage
and quality in secondary education, and is seeking to develop its scientific and technological

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

COSTA RICA

capabilities, which would help position Costa Rica as a knowledge economy. There is also
strong commitment to improving the business environment and removing burdensome red
tape. Given the sizable investments required to upgrade infrastructure and the tight fiscal
situation, the government is seeking to create the institutional conditions to engage the
private sector in financing, construction and management of infrastructure projects (publicprivate partnerships). The government has already begun to open the insurance, electricity
and telecommunication sectors to private investment.
5.

The teams agreed the following division of labor:



Fiscal consolidation. The IMF (the Fund) will continue to provide policy recommendations on
macro-fiscal issues, including the overall strategy of fiscal consolidation and the tax reform.
The World Bank (the Bank) will provide technical assistance to support the use of publicprivate partnerships as a vehicle to finance key infrastructure projects. The government also
requested assistance to improve financial management, service delivery, and sustainability of
its social security system.



Monetary policy framework. The Fund will continue to provide policy recommendations
regarding the transition to inflation targeting and a more flexible exchange rate regime.



Financial sector stability. The Bank and the Fund will cooperate as necessary in assisting the
country in implementing the FSAP recommendations.



Competitiveness. The Bank will continue to provide policy recommendations in key areas. In
terms of lending, the government is being supported by a project in higher education
(approved in September 2012). The government has also requested technical assistance

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of January 2013)
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. The quality of macroeconomic data
has continued to improve in recent years. This was confirmed by a reassessment of the Data Module
Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) that was published in February 2010.
Further statistical improvements are being pursued, including in the real, monetary, fiscal and
balance of payments sectors. The Central Bank, the Ministry of Finance, and the National Institute of
Statistics and Census make data available to the public through regular official publications on their
websites (www.bccr.fi.cr, www.hacienda.go.cr, and www.inec.go.cr).
National accounts: National accounts are compiled generally in accordance with the System of
National Accounts 1993 (SNA 1993). However, the reference year 1991 for the series at constant
prices is outdated. Estimation of rentals for owner occupied dwellings should be improved.
Accounting depreciation is used instead of estimating consumption of fixed capital. Double
deflation method is not applied. Changes in inventories are obtained as residuals and the Chow Lin
(without indicator) method is applied for benchmarking quarterly value added of activities,
comprising a third of GDP. Non-observed/informal activities are not properly covered. The Central
Bank started a project for changing the base year to 2012 and implementing the recommendations
of the System of National Accounts 2008 (2008 SNA) that are relevant for the Costa Rican economy.
Price statistics: The compilation of the consumer price index (CPI), in general, employs concepts
and definitions from the 1993 SNA and the international CPI manual. However, the CPI lacks a
market basket component to measure the cost of owner-occupied housing. Also, the index only
covers urban households located in greater San Jose, which comprise approximately 46 percent of
the total population and 72 percent of the urban population of Costa Rica. Individual price index
data are not generally verified against similar data from other databases such as the producer price
index (PPI) and agricultural price indices. Nevertheless, atypical movements in the data are
investigated and corrected when necessary.
Except for being compiled only by product aggregations and not by economic activity as well, the
PPI is compiled based on concepts and definitions from the 1993 SNA and the international PPI
Manual. However, the weights, the establishment sample, and the product sample for the PPI that
were introduced in 2000 are based on 1997 sales data. Therefore, the index needs updating. A
comprehensive assessment of the source data is being carried out, and this is guiding the
production of new source data to update the PPI and the national accounts. The export and import
and import price indices as well as the PPI are currently being updated.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

COSTA RICA

Government finance statistics: The concepts and definitions used in compiling GFS generally
follow the guidelines of the GFSM 1986. However, financing data and government debt, which use
national concepts that combine instruments and holders, are not in accordance with international
standards. A migration path to the GFSM 2001 has been adopted in the context of the GFS
harmonization project for Central America, Panama, and the Dominican Republic. Monthly fiscal
statistics are only compiled and disseminated for budgetary central government, while annual
statistics are compiled and disseminated for the entire public sector and its subsectors. The place of
issue (Costa Rica or abroad) criterion is followed to classify domestic and foreign debt, instead of
the internationally recommended residency criterion. Fiscal data discrepancies among national
compilers on particular items are not regularly reconciled, although large fluctuations or
discrepancies are investigated. Fiscal statistics are not regularly reconciled with monetary statistics,
or other macroeconomic statistics.
Monetary Statistics: Costa Rica’s monetary statistics are broadly in line with the methodology of
the MFSM. Classification/sectorization follows the MFSM with some exceptions. The social security
system accounts are not presented within the central government, but aggregated with other public
sector accounts. Some financial assets and liabilities are not disaggregated by economic sector.
Accrued interest is not classified together with its underlying instrument.
Balance of Payments: The balance of payments statistics broadly follow the concepts and
definitions in the BPM5. While generally adequate and derived from sound collection programs,
source data are incomplete to compile some services in the current account, financial transactions of
the nonfinancial private sector, and remuneration of employees. Foreign direct investment
transactions and positions are valued on a cash basis instead of the recommended accrual basis.
Services are recorded at the time the service is provided. While other income transactions are
recorded on an accrual basis, interest on public external debt is recorded on the due date; no
adjustment is made to convert interest to accrued values. Transfer prices in some cases are not
converted to market prices.
Data Standards and Quality: Costa Rica is in observance with the Special Data Dissemination
Standards (SDDS). Data Module Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) was
published in February 2010.

Staff Statement by the Staff Representative on Costa Rica
February 22, 2013

1.
This statement provides additional information that has become available since the staff
report was issued. It does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.

Headline inflation has risen and interest rates have fallen.



Annual headline inflation climbed to 5.7 percent in January, from 4.6 percent in
December, owing to important increases in the education, entertainment, and alcohol and
tobacco components of the consumer price index. Nevertheless, headline inflation
remained within the 4-6 percent official target range. Core inflation stayed at 3.3 percent
(y/y), the same as in December.



A key interest rate, the basic passive rate (BPR), declined to 7.8 percent as of February
14. The BPR has declined steadily since October, reflecting the increased liquidity
brought about by large capital inflows and more reliance on external financing by the
government. The sharp increase in the BPR observed in the first half of 2012 has almost
fully reversed.

3.
The authorities announced their intention to adopt macro-prudential and capital
flow management measures (CFMs) to stem the increase in private capital inflows. They
submitted to congress a bill proposing: (i) a surtax—of up to 30 percentage points over the
regular income tax rate—for interest, dividends, and capital gains from investment by nonresidents (excluding foreign direct investments); and (ii) the application of a reserve requirement
on the same investments. At the same time, the central bank introduced temporary limits on
credit growth by banks.
4.
As noted in the staff report (SM/13/36), staff thinks that CFMs are not a substitute
for the adjustments in macro policies that Costa Rica needs. Those adjustments include
reducing the fiscal deficit, standing ready to tighten monetary policy, if needed, and allowing
greater exchange rate flexibility by removing the band. CFMs may be a useful transitory
complement to these measures, which are needed to alter the “pull factors” behind the recent
surge in capital inflows.

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 1, 2013

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation
with Costa Rica
On February 22, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Costa Rica.1
Background
Costa Rica’s economy has proven resilient to the adverse shocks of recent years. A proactive
policy response, supported by a high-access precautionary Stand-By arrangement with the
Fund (that expired in mid-2010), allowed to maintain macroeconomic and financial stability and
mitigate the effects of the global financial crisis of 2008-09. After falling by 1 percent in 2009,
output recovered quickly. Real GDP grew at an average pace of 4½ percent per annum in
2010-12, while inflation stood within the 4-6 percent official target range.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with

members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summing ups can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
A sizable rise in capital inflows more than offset a modest increase in the current account
deficit (estimated at about 5½ percent of GDP in 2012). The resulting balance of payments
surplus placed strong appreciating pressure on the local currency. Net international reserves
rose to US$6.9 billion at end-2012 (from US$4.8 billion at end-2011), reflecting large foreign
exchange purchases by the central bank and the government’s placement of a US$1 billion
bond in international capital markets in late 2012. This notwithstanding, competitiveness,
which eroded significantly in recent years, may pose a risk to external stability in the long term.
The reversion of this tendency requires enhancing productivity while improving fiscal
sustainability and maintaining prudent monetary and exchange rate policies.
The overall public sector deficit stayed broadly unchanged at about 4½ percent of GDP in
2012. Efforts to contain expenditure growth and strengthen tax administration continued, while
enactment of an ambitious tax reform approved by Congress was voided by the Constitutional
Court owing to procedural problems. The consolidated public sector debt rose to 38 percent of
GDP at end-2012, up from 27 percent of GDP at end-2008. The authorities are preparing a
fiscal consolidation plan that will be discussed with all sectors of society. Once consensus is
reached, the plan would be submitted to Congress aiming for approval before the next
administration takes office in May 2014.
Financial sector indicators remained healthy, with adequate levels of liquidity and
capitalization. Although the authorities maintained the policy rate unchanged, other interest
rates rose significantly, particularly during the first half of 2012. Financial conditions began to
ease toward the end of year. Credit to the private sector increased by about 13 percent (y/y) in
nominal terms, with stronger growth in the foreign-currency denominated segment.
Real GDP growth is expected to slow from about 5 percent in 2012 to about 4¼ percent in
2013 and hover at around its estimated potential rate of 4½ percent over the medium term. In
the absence of significant fiscal consolidation, inflation is projected to remain above that of
trading partners, at about 5 percent, while the external current account deficit is anticipated to
rise to about 6 percent of GDP through 2018.
The economic outlook is generally positive, but the balance of risks is tilted to the downside
amid external uncertainties and domestic policy challenges. Weaker-than-expected growth in
the United States, a global financial shock, or a rise in world oil prices are the main sources of

3
external risk. Risks also arise from an eventual resumption of large private capital inflows,
which would call for a combination of tighter fiscal and monetary policies and greater exchange
rate flexibility to avoid overheating. Finally, lack of fiscal consolidation would lead to a steady
rise in public debt, which would increase vulnerabilities and may erode the underpinnings of
macroeconomic stability.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors welcomed Costa Rica’s strong economic recovery since the global financial crisis
and the continued favorable outlook for growth. In light of the risks posed by the external and
internal challenges, Directors emphasized that policies should be geared towards maintaining
macroeconomic stability, reducing vulnerabilities, and boosting growth potential and
competitiveness.
Directors underscored the importance of preserving fiscal and debt sustainability and
commended the authorities’ efforts to enhance revenues and contain expenditures. However,
additional measures will be necessary to reduce the large deficits and the public debt-to-GDP
ratio. In this context, Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to resubmit to congress a
tax reform proposal which aims at broadening the tax base, reducing tax exemptions, and
strengthening revenue administration, with a view to have it approved by May 2014 when the
new administration takes office. Directors also highlighted the importance of keeping current
expenditure growth in check, especially on public sector wages and transfers, while improving
its quality in the social sectors. Strengthening the pension system should be a priority as well.
Directors recognized that the current fiscal trend is unsustainable in the long run and therefore
welcomed the authorities’ commitment to fiscal consolidation. Most Directors agreed that a
moderately front-loaded adjustment would strike an appropriate balance between addressing
Costa Rica’s fiscal challenges and maintaining robust growth. Some Directors were of the view
that adjustment efforts should be considered in light of the political economy situation and
should also not jeopardize the success of the Costa Rican social-economic model.
Directors commended the authorities for strengthening the monetary framework and bringing
inflation down to single digits. However, given the risks posed by the rigid exchange rate
regime and continued capital inflows, they called for further action to upgrade the monetary

4
and exchange rate policy framework. Directors noted the authorities’ concern about exchange
rate flexibility, but generally recommended increasing exchange rate flexibility as it would allow
greater use of exchange rate as a shock absorber. In general, Directors also saw merit in
establishing an inflation target as the anchor of monetary policy to protect macroeconomic
stability. Directors were generally of the view that appropriate fiscal and monetary policies
could be complemented, for a limited period, by capital flow management measures and that
these should not be a substitute for needed macroeconomic adjustment.
Directors recommended further strengthening of the supervision and prudential regulations of
the financial system, and stressed the importance of implementing pending recommendations
of the 2008 Financial System Assessment Program’s update. They also underlined that full
implementation of risk-based supervision and gradual adoption of Basel III capital and liquidity
standards would further buttress financial sector stability.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue advancing their structural reform agenda to
raise potential growth and bolster competitiveness. In this regard, addressing infrastructure
bottlenecks and streamlining business regulation should be key priorities.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Mr. Rojas and Mr. Cosenza Jimenez on Costa Rica
February 22, 2013
On behalf of our Costa Rican authorities, we would like to thank staff for a well-written set of
papers on the Costa Rican economy. The Article IV report adequately reflects the constructive
dialogue between our authorities and staff during the consultation process in December, and is a
good indication of the collaborative relationship between Costa Rica and the Fund. As a small
and highly integrated economy, Costa Rica has a significant stake on an environment that
promotes a well-functioning global economy. My authorities see their productive engagement
with the Fund as part of their contribution to that environment.
Background
In 2012 Costa Rica grew 5.1 percent (yoy), compared to an average growth of 4.7 percent in
2010-11. Most industries were more dynamic in 2012 compared to 2011, including
manufacturing, services, commerce, construction and agriculture. The expansion in economic
activity was also supported by buoyant credit, which grew at 14.4 percent, though dollardenominated credit grew at a much higher rate of 19 percent.
Costa Rica has managed to lower its inflation rate to 4-6 percent since 2009, after posting
double-digit inflation for almost 30 years. This achievement was underpinned by the
strengthening of the Central Bank’s operational framework. The authorities are committed to
adopt a full inflation targeting framework once economic conditions are appropriate. Concerns
remain that the removal of the exchange rate band may result in abrupt appreciation of the colón
as long as international interest rates in developed countries remain at historic lows and keep
appreciation pressures on an already overvalued exchange rate.
Owing to a dynamic private sector and strong public sector financing requirements, pressure on
domestic interest rates increased steeply during the first quarter of 2012 and persisted through the
third quarter. Net external public financing was negative during this period as external debt
amortization surpassed new external borrowing, adding to pressures on the domestic credit
market. In this context, the Costa Rican Congress approved a new international bond issuance
program for up to US$4 billion over a 10-year period with a maximum amount of US$1 billion
per year. The Government placed $1 billion (2.2 percent of GDP) in November 2012 after nearly
eight years of absence in the international bond markets. This bond placement, together with
significant private capital inflows and coordinated action by Treasury and Central Bank to
reduce public sector competition for funds in the credit market, contributed to a sizable decline in
domestic interest rates (400 basis points on 10-year local currency Government bonds),
compared to 2011.
The Central Government deficit in 2012 was 4.4 percent of GDP, lower than originally
envisaged at the beginning of the year, due to the combination of current expenditure contention

policies and the strong effort by domestic tax and customs administrations to curb evasion and
smuggling. Additionally, the 10-year US$1 billion international bond placement at 4.25 percent
interest, the lowest rate ever for a Costa Rica sovereign, has allowed the authorities to improve
the profile of Costa Rica’s debt.
Monetary Policy
Along with the international bond placement in November 2012, private portfolio inflows surged
from September 2012 to January 2013, putting appreciation pressure on the exchange rate and
complicating the conduction of monetary policy. The Central Bank made significant purchases
of foreign exchange to defend the exchange rate band, well exceeding foreign exchange
purchases scheduled for 2012. Aside from the impact of these operations on monetary aggregates
and associated sterilization costs, the authorities were particularly concerned over the volatile
nature of such inflows and their potentially destabilizing impact on prices and on the financial
sector. Furthermore, the current monetary imbalance coupled with a high interest rate differential
posed a significant challenge for monetary authorities.
As a result, the authorities decided to seek approval from Congress for expanded powers in order
to impose temporary measures (six months, but renewable if conditions so require) and only in
the context of an external disequilibrium produced by portfolio inflows. Such powers would
allow authorities to increase the tax rate on bond interest paid to non-residents and to impose
non-remunerated deposits on foreign capital inflows directed toward the purchase of bonds
placed in the Costa Rican market. Since the draft law was submitted to Congress four weeks ago,
portfolio inflows have receded and Central Bank foreign exchange purchases have practically
ceased. The draft law will not impact international bond placements by non-financial public
institutions and will preserve the rules of the game for investors that made domestic bond
purchases before changes in such tax rates or non-remunerated deposits take place.
Fast growth in private sector credit during 2012 increased inflationary risks and its dollardenominated component heightened the risks faced by unhedged borrowers, whose capacity to
pay may be impacted by exchange rate depreciation. As a result, the Central Bank has imposed a
temporary ceiling on dollar-denominated and total credit growth. These ceilings are consistent
with 9 percent and 12.2 percent annualized growth rates in dollar-denominated and total credit,
respectively, and with the economy’s projected nominal growth of about 11 percent in 2013.
The Central Bank is prepared to tighten monetary policy in the event that inflationary pressures
arise, as long as this does not trigger a new surge in capital inflows. Through successful
negotiations with state banks and weekly open market operations, in February the Central Bank
withdrew a large fraction of the excess liquidity that resulted from foreign exchange purchases
over the past three months.

Fiscal Policy
Despite efforts to enhance revenue and contain expenditures, ongoing since 2010, the authorities
recognize the need for additional efforts to reduce the fiscal deficit, now over 4 percent of GDP,
to levels that are sustainable over the medium term. The Government considers that a fiscal
consolidation effort of about 2.5 percent of GDP is required over the period 2014-18, and should
include measures on both the revenue and expenditure sides.
A key element of this strategy is tackling the public sector’s structural challenges in expenditure
and financing. The government is already analyzing how to improve the compensation system
for public employees in order to make it more equitable and efficient, as well as how to optimize
resource management in the entire state apparatus and contain interest payments. By accessing
the international market and extending maturities of new debt in the domestic market, the
Government is improving its liquidity management and debt structure.
The fiscal consolidation program will be developed in three stages. The starting point will be the
tax reform agreements reached over the past two years in the context of the tax reform that was
voided by the Constitutional Tribunal in 2012. This will need to be supplemented with additional
initiatives arising from meetings with think tanks, social sectors, the media and political parties
in the first stage, which will conclude by June 2013 with the publication of a proposal that will
be the centerpiece of a National Dialogue in a second stage. The document will include policy
actions both on structural spending, improvements to minimize tax evasion and fraud, and tax
reform.
During the second stage, the Government will engage all sectors of society to improve the
proposal. At this point, the participation of the presidential candidates of the major political
parties would be sought. Once a consensus is reached on the fiscal proposal, the Government
will present it to Congress in the form of one or several draft laws aiming for Congress approval
before the new government takes office in May 2014.
As in many other developing and developed countries, demographic changes are likely to strain
the public pension system in the long term and will require parametric adjustments either in
pension contributions, pension benefits or retirement age. The Costa Rican authorities are
already looking into the issue and are in the process of undertaking an actuarial study that may
determine the real size of the actuarial deficit over the long term, the effectiveness of alternative
measures and adequate timing to deal with the issue.
Our authorities strongly believe that guaranteeing Public Sector solvency is an issue of national
interest that goes beyond any particular government. They see the 2013-14 electoral process as
an opportunity for the government, political parties, and all sectors of the economy to seek and
agree on a comprehensive and balanced solution safeguarding the sustainability of Costa Rica’s
public policies in the long run.

Financial Sector Issues
The Superintendence of Financial Institutions (SUGEF) has set as a strategic goal the
implementation of risk-based supervision, which would start operating in 2014. The authorities
will proceed, in line with the recommendations of the 2008 FSAP update, with the modification
of existing prudential legal framework for the effective implementation of this approach,
together with the final drive for the approval of two projects already submitted to Congress and
which seek to strengthen the financial framework and disciplinary penalties.
The authorities are committed to a gradual transition to Basel III, centered on the issues of
liquidity and prudential regulations. Given the current situation in terms of capital inflows to the
country, SUGEF proposed to the National Supervisory Council of the Financial System,
CONASIF, stricter rules on currency matching and maturity, as well as strengthening criteria on
risk evaluation for dollar-denominated credits. The CONASIF is expected to approve the
measures in the following weeks.
Finally, in November 2011 CONASSIF created the Macroprudential Surveillance Committee in
order to strengthen the financial system's ability to identify and mitigate potential systemic risks.
In 2012, the committee held, in coordination with the other regulators, a stress exercise of the
financial system that was conceived as a pilot for both regulatory bodies and supervised entities,
and which will be repeated periodically. This test identified weaknesses in terms of conceptual,
methodological consistency, communication and coordination issues that will be shared with the
financial entities shortly.
