STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. Economic growth stagnated in 2011 after two years of contraction. With
unfavorable external conditions and subdued domestic demand, GDP is expected to
contract further by 1½ percent in 2012, only modestly picking up by ¾ percent in
2013. Risks are large and tilted to the downside, mainly related to possible setbacks in
Croatia’s external partners in the EU and the Balkans. Despite a significant narrowing of
the current account deficit, external vulnerabilities remain high.
Fiscal policy. The authorities are committed to fiscal consolidation as implied by the
Fiscal Responsibility Law and, in due course, the EU economic governance mechanisms.
The targeted budget deficit in 2012 will likely be achieved. However, further efforts are
needed in 2013 and beyond to return to fiscal sustainability and retain market access in
a way that minimizes headwinds to growth.
Monetary and financial sector policies. Within their framework centered on a broadly
stable exchange rate, the CNB has appropriately allowed in recent years increased twoway exchange rate flexibility, which has facilitated macroeconomic adjustment and
limited speculation. Continuing to allow increased exchange rate flexibility while
accumulating reserves during periods of ample foreign exchange liquidity would
improve the economy’s resilience to external shocks. The largely foreign-owned
banking system remains stable, well capitalized and resistant to shocks, although
growing NPLs, indirect credit risk stemming from vulnerable borrowers, and sizeable
dependence on parent banks for funding require careful monitoring.
Structural reforms. Only limited progress has been made in recent years to improve
Croatia’s structural weaknesses that have severely affected competitiveness, limiting
export and productivity growth. The government’s new structural reform program is a
good start, but many key reforms remain to be developed to return to reasonable
medium-term GDP growth.

A sizeable output gap has kept inflation

labor market conditions kept core inflation low (Figure

mid-2012 due to the impact of a VAT increase and the
rise in food and energy prices. Nominal and real annual
wage growth remained subdued.

3.
A new government is in office. A center-left coalition won the December 2011 elections.
EU accession is expected for mid-2013.

B. Outlook and Risks
4.
GDP is projected to contract further in 2012, while medium term prospects are
constrained by deep-rooted competitiveness problems. High-frequency indicators suggest
negative growth of about -1½ percent, with expanding tourism only partly offsetting weak industrial
production and construction. Low confidence, high unemployment, and feeble credit growth will
keep domestic demand subdued in the near term. GDP is projected to rise only modestly in 2013 by
¾ percent on the back of the expected sizeable public investments. Further on, growth is expected
to pick up slowly as domestic demand recovers and the external environment improves, with
inflation hovering around 3 percent and the external current account deficit widening to 4¼ percent
of GDP in 2017. Barriers to investment and employment growth, if not forcefully addressed, will keep
potential growth modest and the negative output gap will close only gradually. Private sector
deleveraging should slowly reduce external debt with new borrowing remaining subdued (Table 6).
5.
Risks to the outlook are large and clearly tilted to the downside. Significant setbacks in
Croatia’s main external partners in the EU and the Balkans are a near-term key risk to economic
prospects and financial stability (see ¶32). In the medium term, should fiscal consolidation and
structural reforms stall, sluggish growth and elevated vulnerabilities will further weaken the
economy’s ability to withstand shocks (Annex I). On the upside, the forthcoming EU accession can

spur official and private capital inflows, but the experience of other new member states suggests
that concerted efforts are needed to strengthen EU funds absorption capacity.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Fiscal Consolidation to Shore Up Macroeconomic Stability

7.
Staff expects that the 2012 budget
deficit target will be reached, provided the collective agreements for public servants are amended
to eliminate bonuses and other entitlements, as the government proposes. This success would,
however, be achieved in a sub-optimal way, with overruns in the wage bill and social security
benefits partly offset by underexecution of capital expenditure. On the positive side, revenue is
expected to overperform, bolstered by improved tax and arrear collection.

8.
Despite the good start, fiscal sustainability remains at risk. On current policies, staff
projects that the budget deficit will remain above 3½ percent of GDP throughout the medium term,
as the moderate savings from the reforms enacted so far will be offset by sluggish revenue and
growing interest expenditure (table below). Public debt would eventually exceed 60 percent of GDP
(and 75 percent including publicly guaranteed debt). Failure to deliver significant consolidation risks
sovereign and corporate rating downgrades, deterioration in market sentiment, higher interest rates,
and possible loss of external market access.
9.
Against this background, staff recommended gradual but steady fiscal consolidation
for a number of years. In the short run, the imperatives of establishing credibility, satisfying the
requirements of the Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL), and maintaining market access call for a
structural adjustment of about 1¼ percent of GDP in 2012 and ¾ percent in 2013.1 Further on, a
gradual but steady adjustment path of about ½ percentage point of GDP a year in structural terms

strikes the right balance between lukewarm growth prospects and shrinking fiscal space. The boost
in investors’ confidence, the fall in borrowing costs for both the public and the private sector, and
the resulting increase in investment that such a policy would trigger should largely offset its drag on
growth, especially if the savings focus on unaffordable entitlements (see ¶10). Staff recommended
that consolidation be continued until the structural deficit reached zero. This policy would lower
debt, vulnerabilities, and borrowing costs to a manageable levelparticularly in view of the sizable
contingent liabilitiesand create fiscal space for countercyclical policies. It is also consistent with
the EU Fiscal Compact, which calls for a structural deficit of at most ½ percent of GDP adjusted
down for the fiscal costs of ageing. Furthermore, it will reduce the total financing requirement in
2014–17 when the amortization needs rise sharply and financing constraints could become binding
(Figure 6).

competition. The government should launch a wideranging social dialogue on the need to reform these
sensitive areas and identify early on the measures that will make the FRL targets in 2013–15 credible.
11.
Additional efforts appear needed in 2013. On currently contemplated policies, staff
projects that the 2013 general government budget deficit will amount to 3.3 percent of GDP, with

percentage point, mainly due to one-off effects.
To comply with the spirit of the FRL and
minimize the risk of losing market access in the
face of rapidly rising public debt (projected to
exceed 55 percent of GDP in 2013), staff advised
cutting expenditure further by ½ percentage
point of GDP and targeting a headline deficit of
no more than 3 percent of GDP, after accounting
for the revenue loss from further rebalancing of
the tax mix (see ¶12). The recommended
expenditure cuts can be achieved by preventing

12.
Staff welcomed the efforts to rebalance the tax structure away from labor in a
revenue-neutral way and encouraged the authorities to pursue them further. The 2012 health
contributions-VAT rebalancing, a.k.a. fiscal devaluation, should improve competitiveness and
underpin demand for labor. To reduce the revenue loss from the intended further 1 percentage
point cut in health contributions in 2013, staff recommended increasing the zero VAT rate on certain
domestic sales to 10 percent rather than the minimum admissible 5 percent under EU requirements,
with part of the additional revenue used to augment targeted social assistance. Furthermore,
introducing a modern value-based property tax, accompanied by transferring additional spending
responsibilities to local governments, would also help. However, the proceeds of such tax are likely
to be low in the short term given the need to improve the land and property registers.
13.
Staff agreed that the planned large investment projects by state-owned enterprises
could support growth, but warned that they should be accompanied by efficiency-raising
enterprise restructuring and subjected to a careful cost-benefit analysis. The projects in the
energy sector, water supply, education, and health care could underpin growth, reduce costs and
energy dependency, and raise the economy’s potential. They should, however, be accompanied by
restructuring of the involved state-owned enterprises to ensure efficient implementation. Moreover,
given that these investments will raise the debt of the broader public sector, staff recommended a
careful assessment of their benefits for long-term growth versus financial cost. In this context, the
authorities appropriately plan to rely as much as possible on the forthcoming EU structural and
cohesion funds and private borrowing in a PPP context; care should be taken in the latter case,
however, to ensure the proper division of the associated benefits, costs, and risks.
14.
Staff advised considerable strengthening of the Fiscal Council. Created to monitor
compliance with the FRL, the Council needs a clarification of its mandate, resources to implement it,
and independence from the executive. In particular, it should be made clear that the Council is
expected to assess compliance with the FRL both on an ex-post and ex-ante basis, with the technical
parameters of these assessments unambiguously defined and written reports required.

Authorities’ Views
15.
The authorities underscored their commitment to credible and sustained consolidation
in line with the FRL. They noted that delays in implementing their plans for wage reform were
caused by the need to achieve buy-in from the labor unions. Moreover, the late approval of the
2012 budget affected the pace of public investment. Going forward, they broadly agreed with staff’s
recommendations for the deficit and expenditure adjustment in 2013, indicating that they were
already developing similar plans. In particular, the authorities outlined their plan to gradually
introduce a modern and equitable property tax, while transferring some health expenditures to the
local governments. Regarding the medium term, the authorities viewed staff’s advice as consistent
with the EU Stability and Growth Pact and the Fiscal Compact, noting that they would develop the
necessary reforms to comply with these mechanisms after extensive social dialogue.

B. Monetary Policy: Defending the Nominal Anchor
16.
The CNB continues to pursue its long-standing stable exchange rate policy within the
de jure managed float framework. The CNB fended off depreciation pressures in 2011–12 with
foreign exchange interventions and relaxation of foreign currency reserve and liquidity
requirements, while allowing increased exchange rate flexibility (Figure 4). In September 2012 the
CNB intervened to accumulate reserves and fight seasonal appreciation pressures. At present, there
is ample liquidity on domestic markets, both in kuna and foreign currency (Figure 3).
17.
With inflation contained, the CNB attempted to support credit growth while
maintaining broad exchange rate stability. The CNB took a number of measures in early 2011 to
stimulate credit (Figure 3). 2 However, when depreciation pressures emerged in late 2011, the CNB
tightened back, raising the reserve requirements. When the pressures subsided, the CNB again
eased the reserve and foreign currency liquidity requirements in April 2012. They also reached an
agreement with commercial banks to channel the released liquidity together with additional bank
funds toward cheap loans to the economy in a scheme involving risk-sharing with the state-owned
Development Bank (HBOR). Despite these initiatives,

18.
Staff encouraged the CNB to continue
allowing increased exchange rate flexibility, while
agreeing that large exchange rate movements would
be harmful. Since 2009, the CNB has appropriately
allowed increased two-way exchange rate flexibility,
which has facilitated macroeconomic adjustment and
limited speculation. At the same time, the extensive
liability euroization suggests that large exchange rate

Foreign currency liquidity of 1.8 percent of GDP was injected into the system by lowering the foreign currency
liquidity requirement; the overnight deposit rate was reduced by 25 basis points; the borrowing terms of various
credit stimulating schemes were relaxed, and new schemes were introduced.

fluctuations could severely affect banks’ and borrowers’ balance sheets.3 Staff noted that in this
context strong fiscal and structural policies are indispensable to improve competitiveness and restart
growth, as the experience of regional peers indicates.
19.
Staff noted that pursuing two goals with one instrument was difficult. The CNB aims at
keeping the exchange rate stable, while trying to boost credit growth. These two objectives often
require opposite changes in domestic liquidity conditions, making monetary policy prone to
confidence-damaging reversals.
20.
Credit support schemes could mitigate the ongoing credit slowdown, but caution is
needed to avoid potential side effects. Staff agreed that credit schemes aimed at boosting credit
growth (¶17) could serve as a second best tool to help underpin economic activity in an
environment of weak credit demand and high bank risk aversion. However, staff advised caution to
avoid compromising HBOR’s balance sheet or banks’ credit standards, which would raise future
NPLs.
Authorities’ views
21.
The CNB reaffirmed their commitment to a broadly stable exchange rate policy, while
recognizing the benefits of some exchange rate flexibility. They noted the substantial
contractionary impact of exchange rate depreciation in a euroized economy, while pointing out that
the associated competitiveness gains would be limited given the small export base, the capacity
constraints in tourism, and the large pass-through to domestic inflation. The CNB concurred that
fiscal and structural reforms are the only way to restart growth while stressing that the exchange
rate anchor allows such reforms to proceed in a stable macroeconomic environment.
22.
The CNB argued it was possible to balance between maintaining a stable exchange
rate and supporting credit. The authorities agreed that excessive volatility in prudential
requirements should be avoided but stressed the importance of maintaining high reserve
requirements and foreign liquidity ratios given the fact that CNB is not the lender of last resort in
foreign currency. They stressed that the strict criteria for granting loans under the credit support
schemes should prevent deterioration of credit standards, while pointing out that the impact on
credit will unfortunately be limited this year given the slow disbursement of funds.

C. Preserving Financial Stability
23.
Despite the slow deterioration in asset quality, the largely foreign-owned banking
sector is stable, well-capitalized, and resilient to shocks. The ongoing recession is affecting the
nonperforming loan (NPL) ratio, which reached 13 percent in June 2012, with corporate NPLs at
23 percent. Profitability has started to decline from relatively high levels, in part owing to a pick-up
in specific NPL provisions, which still remain low relative to neighbors and history (text table and
Table 8). Nevertheless, high capital adequacy and liquidity ratioseven if somewhat flattered by low
3

Household and corporate loans in foreign exchange (including indexed loans) are 70-75 percent of their total loans,
respectively, and this exposure is only partially hedged, subjecting banks to significant indirect credit risks.

provisionsindicate sufficient buffers to ensure the system’s stability. Notably, the CNB stress tests
suggest that most banks could absorb the effects of an increase in the NPL ratio to 20 percent
(34 percent for corporates), and only a few banks would need additional capital totaling about
0.6 percent of GDP.4 Liability deleveraging has been proceeding gradually, averaging about
3 percent of the outstanding stock per quarter in 2011 Q3–2012 Q2.

24.
Nevertheless, staff argued that risks to systemic financial stability remain, mainly from
external spillovers. The low coverage of NPLs by specific loan-loss provisions may adversely impact
capital adequacy in case of further deterioration of the loan portfolio. The large exposure of
borrowers to currency and interest rate risk creates significant credit risk for banks. In addition, the
strong dependence of subsidiaries on euro area parent banks for funding exposes them to the risk
of contagion, with potentially substantial impact on growth.5 6
25.
In this context, staff stressed the importance of safeguarding financial stability
through strong regulation and enhanced supervision, including close cooperation with home
supervisors. Staff advised the CNB to maintain high statutory capital buffers, to continue close
monitoring of liquidity and credit developments, and call for raising banks’ capital if needed. Staff
also recommended ensuring realistic loan classification and valuation of collateral as well as
adequate provisioning for NPLs. Staff strongly encouraged coordination with home supervisors to
foresee and limit deleveraging pressures. In this regard, the recently launched Host Country Cross
Border Forum under the auspices of the Vienna 2.0 initiative is timely.
26.
Staff also urged the authorities to ensure swift resolution of NPLs. If not addressed, the
high level of NPLs is likely to drag economic growth down by limiting credit supply. Fast NPL
resolution requires cooperation between creditors and debtors as well as elimination of regulatory,
tax, and legal obstacles. In particular, speeding up the bankruptcy process, removing the difficulties
to foreclose collateral, and resorting more to out of-court restructuring should help.

The stress tests assumed a 10 percent depreciation of the exchange rate along with a 4 percent drop in real GDP.

Liabilities to nonresidents represent a quarter of total bank liabilities, 90 percent of which are to parent banks,
mainly from Italy and Austria.

6

GFSR (October 2012) estimates that deleveraging in Western Europe could reduce credit growth in emerging
Europe by about 5 percent. Staff estimates for Croatia suggest that each percentage point reduction in real credit
growth subtracts about 0.15 percentage point from GDP growth.

Authorities’ views
27.
Both the authorities and banks pointed out that bank liability deleveraging was
prompted by Croatian banks taking advantage of rising domestic deposits to reduce external
credit lines in view of stagnating credit demand. They acknowledged that real estate market
illiquidity hampered collateral valuation. The CNB stated, however, that the required general
provisions of 0.85-1.2 percent of performing loans to cover latent losses provided an additional
buffer against capital losses.
28.
Concerning the impact of new regulations, the authorities explained that the new law
on financial operations intends to speed up the resolution of NPLs by increased reliance on out
of court settlements and restructuring. A key objective is to resolve the long standing corporate
illiquidity problem and thus spur lending to companies with viable projects. The authorities
explained that Basel III requirements could be easily met by the major banks. In fact, Basel III would
allow lower capital adequacy rates than the current Croatian requirements; however, the CNB
intends to explore the option of requiring more capital if needed from individual banks.

D. Mitigating External Vulnerabilities and Spillover Risks
29.
Despite the narrow current account deficit, competitiveness is weak. Since 2009, the
current account has stayed close to 1 percent of GDP,

percent, the average level in emerging Europe.
However, a range of alternative gauges of competitiveness, notably high wages relative to
productivity, declining market shares, and substantial non-price weaknesses stemming from the
inhospitable business environment and the rigid labor market suggest competitiveness problems
that have severely limited export growth performance (Box 1).
25

30.
External vulnerabilities remain high and the
international reserve buffer should improve. Debt rollover
risks are significant with external (mostly private) debt of
about 100 percent of GDP, and an external financing
requirement of about 30 percent of GDP (Figure 10). Crossborder claims of BIS reporting banks on Croatia’s borrowers
are the highest in the CESEE countries at about 60 percent of
GDP (half of which to banks). Net capital inflows to the private
sector have continued to slow down significantly and
maturities are shortening; the increase in portfolio investment
in recent years reflects government bond issuance and some
repatriation of banks’ foreign assets (Figure 5). Furthermore,

despite some recent increase reserves remain low relative to various reserve adequacy metrics and
are not projected to rise further under the baseline scenario (Table 4).7 The CNB should therefore
continue to use periods of ample foreign exchange liquidity to accumulate international reserves,
aiming for at least 100 percent coverage of short-term debt.

31.
However, market confidence has improved lately. Bond and CDS spreads have declined,
influenced by external factors and Fitch’s raising the sovereign outlook to stable, although they
remain elevated compared to peers (Figure 4). The government has maintained access to
international markets, issuing a US$1.5 billion bond in 2012. Yields on domestic issues benefitted
from large liquidity in the market, and have been decreasing in the course of 2012.
32.
A strong intensification of the euro area crisis would significantly affect Croatia via
real and financial channels. Lower exports combined with net capital outflows would strongly
pressure the exchange rate.8 The likely reduction and higher cost of external bank and corporate
financing would lead to a credit crunch, while growing NPLs are likely to weigh on banks’
profitability. Dwindling fiscal revenue and increasing expenditure needs would significantly widen
the fiscal deficit. Given the reduced liquidity, domestic financing of the fiscal deficit would become
challenging and would further crowd out private sector financing, while the deteriorating fiscal
position and growth outlook could lead to a rating downgrade, sharply raising the cost of external
financing.
33.
In this scenario, the policy response should aim to mitigate the shock while
facilitating adjustment and continuing with fiscal and structural reforms. Fiscal policy should
allow automatic stabilizers to work on the revenue side, but planned expenditure adjustment
measures should continue and may even need to be frontloaded if access to financing becomes an
issue. The focus of monetary and financial policies should be on resisting large exchange rate
depreciation and supporting financial stability. The CNB could relax prudential measures to increase
the provision of foreign currency liquidity and seek official financing, e.g. through swap lines.
7

The projected reserve coverage of short-term debt at remaining maturity in the 85-90 percent range is below the
accepted rule of thumb of at least 100 percent for emerging market economies. In addition, reserves seem also low
based on a weighted metric tailored for stable exchange rate regime (text table).

Authorities’ views
34.
The CNB agreed with the need to build international reserves further to alleviate
investors’ perception of Croatia’s risk, although they stressed that the large share of intra-company
debt should be taken into account when assessing reserve adequacy. The authorities concurred with
staff on the main policy responses in case of significant deterioration of the external environment.

E. Structural Reforms to Raise Growth
35.
Croatia’s rigid labor market and difficult business environment hamper medium-term
growth. Recent years have seen some reforms in pension and unemployment benefits, but only
limited measures have been taken to foster labor market flexibility, improve business climate, and
reduce the size of the public sector (Box 1). Far reaching reforms are therefore needed to return to a
reasonable medium-term GDP growth and reverse the sharp increase in unemployment.
36.
Staff urged the authorities to implement a strong reform agenda to address these
weaknesses. The government’s program, adopted in August, is a good start and some measures
have already been taken. However, many key reforms remain to be developed. Staff recommended
that priority be given to measures aiming to: (i) raise labor force participation via a faster increase in
the retirement age for women to 65, a further increase to 67 for both men and women, higher
penalty for early retirement, and tighter control over the apparently abused system of disability
retirement; (ii) improve labor market flexibility by reducing hiring and dismissal costs, including for
poor performance, ensuring that the envisaged single open-ended contract does not impede
flexibility, and allowing firms to opt out from onerous sector-level collective agreements;
(iii) following the best examples in the region, foster competition and reduce barriers to market
entry by relaxing the licensing and administrative requirements to open a business (notably at the
local level) and speeding up privatization. Staff estimates that these reforms could lift GDP growth
by about 2 percentage points in the medium to long term by improving labor force participation,
productivity and export growth (Box 2).
37.
Staff stressed the importance of taking full advantage of Croatia’s forthcoming
accession to the EU. Potential official and private capital inflows triggered by EU accession could
significantly boost medium-term growth if oriented to productivity-enhancing projects. This,
however, requires designing a coherent development strategy with clear project prioritization,
strengthening the administrative capacity to develop those projects, reducing barriers to investment,
and creating fiscal space for Croatia’s co-financing of EU-funded projects.
Authorities’ views
38.
The authorities largely agreed with staff’s diagnostics and reform priorities. They
stressed their commitment to rapid implementation of the recently adopted structural agenda, with
a new Pension Act and Labor Law planned to be adopted by mid-2013, although they noted that
raising the retirement age to 67 is a task for the future. They also pointed out that Croatia’s inclusion
in EU economic governance mechanisms would spur further institutional and structural reforms.

Box 1. Obstacles to Croatia’s Export Performance
High wage level has been hurting export performance. Croatia’s world export market share
has remained stagnant over the past decade, in marked contrast with its peers. A detailed sectoral
assessment of Croatia’s export competitiveness suggests that Croatia has made limited strides in
increasing its presence in some markets but lost market share in major export products, despite

paper II).
In addition, there are substantial non-price competitiveness weaknesses. Many indicators
point to lack of labor market flexibility (notably high hiring and firing costs, numerous
administrative loops for dismissals, low flexibility to adjust the hours worked, as well as pervasive
and constraining collective agreements) as key obstacles for doing business in Croatia (Figure 8).
These, combined with generous social benefits, have led to a very low labor force participation
(57 percent). In addition, there are many obstacles for starting or conducting a business, including
the slow procedures for obtaining a construction permit or registering a property, local barriers to
investment, and an inefficient legal framework with slow resolution of insolvency. Finally, a slow
process of privatization and enterprise restructuring has led to low competition and productivity
levels and relatively high subsidies.

Box 2. What has Kept Croatia’s Growth Low and How to Boost it?
Croatia’s capital-flow-driven growth has lagged behind most of its peers in the last decade,
as capital went mainly in nontradable sectors. Croatia’s GDP growth per capita in 2000–11
averaged 2½ percent, below most middle-income countries and Croatia’s emerging Europe peers.
Croatia’s underperformance is particularly notable in 2009–11. Capital flows in the pre-crisis
period were mostly directed towards nontradable sectors (finance, construction, and public
services), which generally show lower productivity growth than tradables. Industrial investment
averaged only 20 percent, significantly less than in the rest of emerging Europe.

This shows that Croatia’s far-from-perfect pre-crisis growth model has run its course. The
borrow-and-invest-in-nontradables growth model did not generate significant productivity gains
and did not create many jobs, questioning its sustainability given the growing external debt.
Growth plummeted in 2009 and has not yet returned.

could boost growth by about 0.40.9 percentage point. If the investment to GDP ratio would as a result increase to 25 percent (the
average level in Slovakia, Slovenia, Czech Republic, Bosnia, and Latvia in 2000–08), growth would
rise by an additional 0.3 percentage point. While the quantification of the impact of structural
reforms on growth is subject to large uncertainties, this exercise nevertheless suggests that
Croatia could substantially boost growth via such reforms (Selected Issues paper I).

Policies targeted to women and older workers appear particularly useful in this regard (IMF Policy Paper, June 15,
2012). For instance, in New Zealand, the rapid increase in retirement age from 60 to 65 during the 1990s led to an
increase in the labor force participation of the 55-64 age group by over 15 percentage points (R. Duval, OECD, 2003).

STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
Croatia’s short and medium-term growth prospects are lackluster and threatened by
significant vulnerabilities. With unfavorable external conditions and subdued domestic demand,
GDP is set to contract once again in 2012, while structural impediments and weak competitiveness
hamper medium-term prospects. In addition, large external and foreign-currency debt imply high
vulnerability to external shocks, especially since a large part of the export and banking sectors is
exposed to vulnerable EU countries. The authorities need to act rapidly to reduce vulnerabilities and
spur growth.
40.
Significant and sustained fiscal consolidation is required to restore debt sustainability
and retain market confidence. Staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to fiscal consolidation
and the expenditure retrenchment in 2012 despite the suboptimal composition of the adjustment.
The additional expenditure adjustment that appears needed in 2013 can be achieved by preventing
a rise in subsidies from their 2012 level and strengthening pension and health care entitlement
reforms. Rebalancing the tax structure further away from labor in a revenue-neutral way would
support labor demand and competitiveness. The consolidation should be continued until the
structural deficit is brought to zero to lower debt, vulnerabilities, and borrowing costs to a
manageable level and create fiscal space for countercyclical policies.
41.
The authorities should continue allowing increased exchange rate flexibility and
gradually accumulate international reserves. Increased two-way exchange rate flexibility
improves the economy’s resilience to shocks. Moreover, accumulating international reserves would
build further an important buffer against external shocks.
42.
Strong regulation, supervision, and cooperation with other supervisory authorities
remain essential to preserve financial stability. The CNB should maintain high statutory capital
buffers, call for raising banks’ capital early on if needed, ensure adequate provisioning for NPLs, and
further strengthen cross-border supervisory cooperation. Obstacles to quick resolution of NPLs
should be swiftly removed as well.
43.
Rapid implementation of a broad and ambitious structural agenda is critical to boost
medium-term prospects. The government’s structural reform program, adopted in August, is a
good start, but many key reforms need further development in terms of specific policies and desired
effects. Priorities should be given to measures aiming to (i) raise labor force participation;
(ii) enhance labor market flexibility; (iii) improve the business environment and product market
competition.
44.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Croatia be held on the
standard 12-month cycle. Croatia is an Article VIII country, and data provision is adequate for
surveillance (Informational Annex).

variables in the baseline and scenario being presented. Ten-year historical average for the variable is also shown.
2/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and primary balance.
3/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent and 10 percent of GDP shock to contingent liabilities occur in 2013, with real
depreciation defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic

intermediate services indirectly measured (FISIM). National account data for 1995-2008 were revised in 2009 and data for 2008-2011 were
revised in 2012. Revised nominal GDP figure for 2011 is about 2.7 percent lower than the previous estimate.

rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation
(based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels of

Annex I. Croatia Risk Assessment Matrix1
(Scale―high, medium, or low)
Source of Risks
1. Strong intensification of
the euro area crisis

2. Slowdown of world
growth

3. Acute deleveraging by
euro area parent banks

4. Sharp increase in oil
prices

5. No progress on structural
reforms

6. Stalled fiscal
consolidation

Relative Likelihood2

Impact if Realized

Medium

High

Heightened financial stress could
adversely alter the outlook for the
euro area.
Medium
Slowing demand from EU and the
rest of the world.
Medium
Higher than expected capital
needs of euro area parent banks
could lead to a reduction or
closure of external credit lines of
Croatian subsidiaries.
Low
Geo-political risks could lead to a
sharp increase in oil prices.
Medium
Implementation of measures to
boost potential growth could be
delayed.

Lower export and tourism revenue plus
dearth or reversal of capital inflows
would induce a sharp recession,
exchange rate pressures, higher and
more difficult to finance fiscal deficit,
and rising NPLs.

High
Deleveraging could lead to a credit
crunch, with negative effects on activity.

Medium
Higher energy prices could depress
demand and raise inflation.
Medium
Potential growth would remain low in
the medium term and investors’
confidence could fall, adversely affecting
cost of and access to external financing.

Low

Medium

Social resistance and lower than
expected growth could slow fiscal
consolidation.

Debt sustainability would be
endangered with negative effects on
cost of and access to external financing.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path discussed in this
report (which is the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of the staff). The RAM reflects staff’s views on the
source of risks and overall level of concerns as of the time of discussions with the authorities. The relative likelihood
of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding this baseline.

Annex II. Authorities’ Response to Past IMF Policy Recommendations

IMF 2011 Article IV Recommendations

Authorities’ Response

Fiscal policy

Broadly consistent

Keep fiscal deficit at its 2010 level in percent of GDP.
Implement further expenditure cuts in public
employment, public wages and social expenditures to
reach the FRL targets.

Monetary policy
Gradually strengthen foreign currency buffers.

A large deterioration of the fiscal deficit was avoided,
with the 2011 fiscal deficit widening only by 0.1 percent
of GDP compared to 2010. Significant consolidation
measures were included in the 2012 budget with
expenditures cuts in wages, subsidies and health
spending, with partial success so far.
Broadly consistent
Despite foreign exchange sales, foreign reserves have
continued their pace of gradual increase.

Structural reforms

Marginally consistent

Implement comprehensive structural reforms to boost
growth potential.

Limited reforms have been launched to foster labor
market flexibility, improve business climate, and reduce
the size of the public sector.

VII.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
In December 1991, Croatia left the Yugoslav dinar area and adopted the Croatian dinar as its
sole legal tender. The Croatian dinar was replaced by the Croatian kuna on May 30, 1994.
The exchange rate of the kuna is determined by supply and demand in the interbank market,
with tight management by the CNB. Croatia’s de jure exchange rate is a managed float
without a predetermined path. Croatia’s de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as
“crawl like arrangement” from April 30, 2011. The CNB transacts only in euros, U.S. dollars,
and SDRs. On October 10, 2012 the official exchange rate was kuna 7,473547 per euro
(middle rate).

VIII.

Exchange Restrictions:
Croatia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Section 2–4 and maintains an exchange
system that is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international
transactions, except for restrictions that Croatia maintains solely for the preservation of
national or international security that have been notified to the Fund pursuant to Executive
Board Decision 144 (52/51).

IX.

Article IV Consultation:
The previous Article IV consultation with Croatia was concluded on June 8, 2011 (IMF
Country Report No. 11/159 available at: http://www.imf.org/external/country/hrv/index.htm).
Croatia is on the 12-month consultation cycle.

X.

FSAP:
An FSAP Update mission took place in October–November 2007. The FSSA

Update was

published (IMF Country Report No. 160 available
http://www.imf.org/external/country/hrv/index.htm).
The original FSAP was concluded with the completion of the 2002 Article IV consultation on
August 5, 2002 on the basis of missions that took place in April 2001 and September 2001.
The FSSA was published (IMF Country Report No. 02/180).

ANNEX II. STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.

Data provision is broadly adequate for effective surveillance, though some improvements

would be desirable. While remedial action has been taken to improve data coverage and reliability
in most cases, progress in some instances has been impeded by insufficient resources and issues
regarding coordination among government agencies. Croatia subscribes to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard.

A. National Accounts
2.

The national accounts have undergone substantial improvements in the last few years. The

Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) publishes constant and current price data compiled in accordance
with the 1995 ESA. Quarterly GDP estimates are disseminated at current prices and at constant
(2000) prices for the main categories of expenditure and main industry groupings. Nonetheless,
shortcomings remain. Significant discrepancies exist between expenditure-based and value-addedbased GDP data, stemming from: (i) problems of coordination between the CBS and the Croatian
National Bank (CNB) in reconciling tourism receipts estimates; (ii) incomplete coverage of
unincorporated businesses and the self-employed (farmers, traders, and craftsmen); (iii) inadequate
data for measuring changes in inventories; (iv) incomplete coverage of the informal sector; and (v) a
lack of quarterly data for the seasonally volatile agricultural sector.

B. Price
3.

The CBS produces a monthly consumer price index, with expenditure weights (updated every

five years) derived from a 2005 Household Budget Survey. Between rebasing, the weights are priceupdated annually to December of the previous year. Data are collected at different time periods in
the month for different product groups but in all cases between the thirteenth and the twenty-first
day of each month. The indices are released around the fifteenth day of the following month. The
price collection is confined to nine towns, but the weights are based on a sample of households in
the whole country. A harmonized index of consumer prices (HICP) is also calculated in line with
Eurostat methodology, but is not released for the time being to avoid confusion. A core CPI is also
calculated based on a methodology developed by the CNB. The CBS also releases a monthly
producer price index (PPI), usually on the eighth day of the following month. The weighting system
of the PPI is based on the 2000 Annual Report of Industry and is changed every five years, while
weights are partially corrected every year.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF CROATIA

C. Wages and Employment
4.

The CBS produces data on average net and gross earnings per person and employment by

sector. Earning data include bonuses, sick pay, and meal allowances, and are based on monthly
surveys covering 70 percent of workers in permanent employment in each industrial category. They
do not cover a significant part of the working population, including persons employed in trade and
crafts, contract workers, farmers, and the military and police.
5.

The number of registered unemployed overstates the actual level of unemployment. A

preliminary Labor Force Survey, which meets ILO standards, was conducted for the first time in 1996
on 7,200 households. The sample was subsequently expanded and the survey is now being
conducted on a regular basis. The CBS released semi-annual results from 1998, and began releasing
quarterly results in 2007 with a lag of about four months.

D. Government Finance Statistics
6.

The authorities have started presenting budget plans based on the ESA 95 framework, but

government finance statistics produced on a monthly basis on the GFSM framework (GFS) have
been available in the Monthly Statistical Review of the Ministry of Finance (MoF). Data normally
come with a lag of about one quarter. Revenue data are reliable, and expenditure data on a cash
basis are available according to GFS classifications (economic and functional) for the central budget
and the budgetary funds. The data on central government financing in the MoF reports are not
reconciled with those in the CNB’s monetary survey and balance of payments data, with substantial
discrepancies owing partly to different methodologies and definitions of government. Following the
recommendations of the October 2002 GFS mission, a task force, comprising staff from the MoF,
CNB, and CBS was formed to reconcile central government financing data produced by these
institutions.
7.

The detailed data on domestic public bonds published in the Monthly Statistical Review are

now augmented by a central government debt table in the CNB Monthly Bulletin, which also reports
stocks of central government guaranteed debt. The MoF prepared a database with government
guarantees in July 2003 that has been used to monitor developments in the stock and flows of
guarantees.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 7

8.

Data on the operations of local governments and consolidated general government are

available on a quarterly basis. Local government data are partial as they include the operations of
the 53 largest municipalities.

E. Monetary Data
9.

Compilation of monetary statistics published by the CNB is consistent with the

recommendations of the IMF’s 2000 Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). Data on the
monetary survey, including separate records for deposit money banks and the balance sheet of the
CNB, are published monthly with four- and two-week lags, respectively. The CNB is planning to
extend its statistical framework to balance sheet information of investment funds and insurance
companies. In March 2002, the CNB started collecting financial information (balance sheets and
investment structure) from investment and pension funds; the data are not yet published, but used
for internal purposes. According to the CNB, the inclusion of other financial corporations in
monetary statistics depends on the harmonization process of the monetary statistics with the
statistical reporting requirements of the European Central Bank. In November 2006, the CNB
reported monetary data in the format of Standardized Report Forms for December 2001 to the
present. These data accord with the concepts and definitions in MFSM and were published, along
with the corresponding metadata, in IFS and the IFS Supplement on Monetary and Financial Statistics.

F. External Sector Statistics
10.

Quarterly balance of payments data are compiled broadly in accordance with the fifth

edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual. Data are generally available with a lag of three
months and are subject to substantial revisions in subsequent releases; trade data are available with
a lag of one month and data on international reserves are available the next day on request. Travel
survey methodologies were modified in 2002, 2004, and again in 2005, while the method for
estimating the cost of insurance and freight was modified in early 2004. Net errors and omissions
have ranged from 2½ to 3¾ percent of GDP since 2003, and are negative. The coverage and quality
of portfolio investment data are reasonably complete and accurate.
11.

A large part of external debt was contracted prior to the dissolution of the former Socialist

Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Croatia’s share was agreed with Paris and London Club creditors
in 1995 and 1998, respectively. The CNB compiles external debt data according to the requirements
of External Debt Statistics: Guide for Compilers and Users, 2003, and began disseminating external

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF CROATIA

debt data in the second quarter of 2003. The inclusion of hybrid and subordinated debt instruments,
repos, late interest, and interest accruals and arrears has caused an upward adjustment in the
external debt series compared to previously released data. Quarterly data on the international
investment position are available on the CNB website up to 2012:Q2.

ANNEX III. WORLD BANK RELATIONS
1.

The World Bank’s Board endorsed the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Croatia for
FY09–12 in September 2008, just before the full onset of the global financial crisis. In 2012, it was
extended for a year to coincide with the Croatia’s pre-accession period. The goal of the CPS is to
support the completion of Croatia’s EU accession process, the rapid convergence of its income
level with that of current EU member states in a fiscally, socially and environmentally sustainable
fashion. This overarching goal is in line with the Government’s priorities expressed in various
government programs. In pursuing this goal, the Bank Group program aims at contributing in
the following four areas:

2.



sustaining macroeconomic stability;



strengthening private sector-led growth and accelerating convergence with the EU;



improving the quality and efficiency in the social sectors; and



increasing the sustainability of long-term development.

The EU accession agenda remains a cross-cutting theme in the design and implementation

of the Bank Group program. In the selection and design of operations, primary consideration is
given to the assessment of proposed projects’ support of Croatia’s EU accession agenda. In the case
of social sectors not covered under the EU acquis, consideration is also given to how projects
complement the EU accession efforts. Project components that enhance Croatia’s capacity to absorb
EU funds, especially following the accession, have high priority.
3.

The CPS envisages an indicative base-case lending envelope of about US$1.0–1.4 billion for

investment operations over the five-year period. The CPS also includes an upside scenario, with
possible development policy lending amounting to some US$1.4–1.8 billion. The lending program
has been based on and complemented by analytical work, particularly in the areas of public
expenditure reform, governance, investment climate, and climate change.
4.

In FY10, the Bank’s Board has approved three loans amounting to US$475 million, to help

mitigate the impact of the global economic crisis and provide funding for the private sector,
through a credit line of about EUR100 million for exporters, and through a Fiscal, Social and
Financial Sector Development Policy Loan of EUR200 million. In addition, an investment operation

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 11

for judicial sector of US$36.3 million has been approved. In FY11, the Bank’s Board approved two
loans amounting to USD242 million: (i) an Economic Recovery Development Policy Loan of
EUR150 million to support the authorities in implementing Economic Recovery Program from
April 2010 aiming to address the vulnerabilities and competitiveness issues of the economy; and
(ii) investment loan EU Natura 2000 Integration of US$28.8 million to support adjustment to EU
Species and Habitats Directives. In FY12, the Bank’s Board has approved Integrated Land
Administration project amounting to US$23.8 million. Projects under preparation for FY13 are the
Second Science and Technology (STP II), Export Finance Intermediation Loan Additional Financing
and the Second Economic Recovery DPL. Currently, the World Bank finances 13 operations in a wide
range of sectors with a net commitment of about US$1 billion. IFC’s portfolio amounts to about
US$273 million, and MIGA guarantees gross exposure amounts to US$330 million in the financial
sector.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
November 13, 2012

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes the 2012 Article IV Consultation
with the Republic of Croatia
On November 7, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Croatia.1
Background
Sustained recovery from the economic crisis in 2009 remains elusive. Growth stagnated
in 2011 after two years of contraction. With unfavorable external conditions and
subdued domestic demand, GDP is expected to contract further by 1½ percent in 2012,
only modestly picking up by ¾ percent in 2013. Further on, barriers to investment and
employment growth, if not forcefully addressed, will keep potential growth modest.
Despite a significant narrowing of the current account deficit, external vulnerabilities
remain high, with gross external debt above 100 percent and an external financing
requirement of about 30 percent of GDP. Competitiveness is hampered by substantial
non-price weaknesses, which have severely limited export growth performance.
To address these weaknesses and restart growth, the authorities adopted a
comprehensive structural reform program in August 2012. The program aims to improve
the business climate and competition and foster labor force participation by reducing
administrative barriers to investment, speeding up restructuring and privatization of
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings
up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
state-owned enterprises, and reforming pensions and health care systems. While some
measures have already been taken, many important reforms remain to be developed in
terms of specific policies and desired effects.
To restore fiscal sustainability, the authorities have launched a significant consolidation
in 2012, aimed at reducing the deficit from 5.2 percent of GDP in 2011 to 4 percent of
GDP in 2012 under staff’s macroeconomic projections. The adjustment has focused on
better targeting of subsidies, restraints on expenditures of goods and services, and
improved tax collection. Reforms in public sector workers’ remuneration and further
rationalization of health expenditures have also been initiated, with results expected
from 2013 on.
Within their framework centered on a broadly stable exchange rate, the Croatian
National Bank has allowed in recent years increased two-way exchange rate flexibility,
which has facilitated macroeconomic adjustment and limited speculation. Despite official
credit support schemes, credit growth slowed down markedly in 2012 reflecting weak
demand. The largely foreign-owned banking system remains well capitalized, although
growing non-performing loans have started eroding profitability.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that Croatia is experiencing a prolonged recession reflecting
subdued domestic demand, lackluster competitiveness, and a difficult external
environment. Short-term growth prospects remain weak and downside risks prevail,
while structural impediments hamper medium-term growth. Directors underscored the
importance of advancing with policies and structural reforms to boost growth and reduce
vulnerabilities.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to fiscal consolidation and the
expenditure retrenchment that has taken place in 2012. While they recognized that fiscal
consolidation is particularly challenging at the current juncture, they underscored its
necessity to restore debt sustainability, satisfy the requirements of the Fiscal
Responsibility Law, and retain market access. Directors therefore saw a need to
continue a gradual but steady expenditure-based consolidation in 2013 and well into the
medium term, while protecting capital spending. Directors also encouraged the
authorities to persevere with their efforts to rebalance the tax structure away from labor
in a revenue-neutral way.
Directors welcomed the recent adoption of the government’s structural reform program,
which makes a good start on the road to restore competitiveness and spur growth.
Strengthening EU funds absorption capacity would allow Croatia to take full advantage
of EU accession by supporting growth-enhancing investments. Directors encouraged
the authorities to develop specific policies and prioritize measures, focused on raising

3
labor force participation, enhancing labor market flexibility, reducing barriers to market
entry, and fostering competition.
Directors welcomed the increased exchange rate flexibility of recent years, as it has
improved the economy’s resilience to shocks and aided macroeconomic adjustment.
They generally agreed, however, that the broadly stable exchange rate framework has
served Croatia well and that excessive exchange movements would be harmful given
the high degree of euroization and the sizeable external debt. In order to build further an
important buffer against external shocks, Directors recommended that the central bank
continue to gradually accumulate international reserves.
Directors noted that the financial sector appears well-capitalized and resilient to shocks,
but faces risks related to potential further deterioration of asset quality, indirect credit
risk stemming from vulnerable borrowers, and sizeable dependence on parent banks for
funding. They stressed the importance of maintaining high statutory capital buffers,
ensuring adequate provisioning for non-performing loans, further strengthening financial
supervision and regulation and cross-border supervisory cooperation, and closely
monitoring liquidity and credit developments.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
Reader to view this pdf file) for the 2012 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Croatia is also
available.

Statement by Mr. Menno Snel and Ms. Ana Martinis on the Republic of Croatia
November 7, 2012
The Croatian authorities value the open and constructive discussions with staff during their
mission to Croatia. They broadly share the staff’s assessment and policy advice as presented in
the Article IV report and welcome insightful supplementary papers which are rightly focused on
two major issues for the Croatian economy – growth drivers and competitiveness.
Economic developments and outlook
Croatia’s economy continues to face complex challenges as the euro area crisis weighs on the
country’s export performance and investors’ confidence. After stagnation in 2011, this year
GDP growth turned negative again as a result of a drop in both domestic and external demand.
Foreign direct investment declined further and the private sector continued to deleverage amid
lower capital inflows. In the face of subdued import demand, the current account deficit
stabilized at around 1 percent of GDP. The external debt has stabilized too, albeit at a high level,
thus remaining a key vulnerable point of the economy.
Inflation has picked up as of March this year, pushed by an increase in the basic VAT rate and a
rise in locally regulated gas and electricity prices. As a result, the average annual consumer price
inflation could increase to around 3.3 percent in 2012, but is expected to slow down in 2013, as
weak personal consumption and adverse labor market conditions keep the inflation pressures
contained.
Quarterly developments suggest that the recession may have reached its turning point, as GDP
stabilized in the second quarter, mainly due to strong tourism performance. Looking ahead,
growth is expected to resume modestly towards the end of the year, driven mainly by the startup of the investment cycle of the public sector. Gradual recovery should continue through 2013
as exports and investment pick-up, supported also by the increase in confidence following
Croatia’s expected accession to the EU. Nevertheless, amid persistent high unemployment and
continued fiscal consolidation, the recovery is likely to be sluggish. Against this background, the
authorities broadly share staff’s assessment of the outlook. They also agree that the risks to this
outlook are clearly tilted to the downside, with the strong deterioration of the euro area crisis
being the major source of risks that could affect Croatia through trade and financial channels.
As for the medium-term prospects, the authorities are cognizant that the pre-crisis growth
drivers, namely the private and government consumption supported by debt-creating inflows,
have been exhausted, and that Croatia needs to develop a new growth model focused on exports
and competitiveness. Thus, the authorities aim to implement a combination of structural

2

reforms, restrictive fiscal policy and reasonably expansionary monetary policy to support
redistribution of limited funding from consumption to investment, and use this investment to
initiate sustainable economic growth aided by low inflation and exchange rate stability.
Fiscal policy
Since the last Article IV consultation, the authorities have initiated substantial fiscal
consolidation. The new government, elected in December of 2011, adopted a new budget in
February, envisaging significant changes both on the revenue and the expenditure side aimed at
stabilizing public finances.
An increase in the basic VAT rate from 23 to 25 percent was introduced in March, and was
followed by a reduction of the compulsory health insurance contributions from 15 to 13 percent.
Despite negative economic trends, the budget execution has been kept broadly on track.
Budgetary revenues exceeded forecasts, increasing by 3.6% in the first seven months of this
year, mainly thanks to changes in tax legislation and improved tax and contribution collection.
In particular, notwithstanding the cut in the rate of health insurance contributions, these
revenues grew marginally as the government stipulated that employers may not pay out
employee wages without first paying contributions to the government.
The budget expenditures have also been kept within with the planned framework. However, the
expenditure structure has been somewhat less favorable than initially planned, with higher
current spending broadly offset by underspending on capital investment. The current spending
overrun was mainly a result of higher compensations for public employees and the provisional
budget financing that was in effect in the first quarter of 2012. Notwithstanding the expenditure
structure, the 2012 targeted deficit reduction of 1.2 percent of GDP is likely to be met.
The government initiated several important measures to reduce the public wage bill. Most
temporary work contracts have been cancelled, overtime and other payments in addition to
salary have been cut and the rationalization of state agencies is ongoing. The Parliament adopted
the Law on Representation which allows the government to cancel collective agreements three
months after their expiration. This legislation enabled the government to cancel Christmas bonus
and reduce salaries for a part of the public sector already in this year.
Despite the achieved consolidation, public debt growth picked up considerably due to the
assumption of liabilities of shipyards. Going forward, the authorities are fully aware of the need

3

to continue the process of fiscal consolidation in order to put the public debt-to-GDP ratio on a
downward trajectory. The authorities’ commitment to fiscal consolidation has been recognized
by the financial markets and rating agencies, as reflected in the narrowing of sovereign spreads
and the recent revision of Croatia’s outlook from negative to stable by Fitch Ratings.
For 2013 the government already announced several measures aimed at further fiscal
consolidation, including the introduction of the value-based property tax, increase in excises and
introduction of a cash registry. The authorities agree with staff’s assessment of the need for
additional measures to achieve an expenditure cut of 1 percent of GDP (corrected by the costs of
ageing), as envisaged by the Fiscal Responsibility Law. To this end, the government will take
staff’s advice into account when designing the 2013 budget, which is currently being prepared.
However, unlike staff, the authorities are of the view that the increase of the zero VAT rate to 5
percent as of next year is appropriate given the sensitivity of the socially most vulnerable
population to the prices of products affected by this decision. As an offsetting measure, the
authorities would prefer starting with the adjustment of excises to the EU levels as of January
rather than July 2013.
Monetary policy and financial system
The monetary authorities continue to be firmly committed to the policy of maintaining exchange
rate stability. This policy has served the country well, as it anchored inflation expectations and
preserved confidence in the monetary and financial system in an environment of widespread
euroisation and high foreign currency exposure of both private and public sectors. That said, the
central bank allows for some intra-year volatility of the kuna in line with regular seasonal
developments and in order to limit speculation, but only to the extent that it does not affect
expectations of the broad stability of the currency. The authorities underscore that exchange rate
depreciation would be detrimental for financial stability, external debt sustainability, and hence
to overall macroeconomic stability, whereas its effects on export competitiveness are uncertain
given the low export base and large import component in exports.
While maintaining exchange rate stability, the Croatian National Bank has also supported high
domestic liquidity with the aim to spur the recovery of bank lending and stimulate domestic
economic activity. In this regard, in May the central bank contributed to establishing a new
credit scheme for supporting lending exporters by reducing the reserve requirement rate. Going
forward, the CNB will continue to support the liquidity in the banking system in order to help
improve domestic financing conditions. However, the expansionary orientation of monetary

4

policy will be continued only to the extent that it does not jeopardize the exchange rate and,
consequently, price and financial stability.
The specifics of the Croatian monetary environment, in particular the high euroization and
external indebtedness, require having adequate reserve buffers. In view of this, the central bank
has been steadily increasing international reserves over time, including during the past few years
despite significantly lower capital inflows. It is worth noting that reserves stood at €9.1 billion
(equivalent to 19 percent of GDP and 4.6 months of imports) at end-2008, while the current
level of reserves amounts to €11.4 billion, equivalent to 25.7 percent of GDP and 7.2 months of
imports. The CNB considers the level of reserves adequate, as they exceed by a large margin the
amount of reserve money and cover more than 7 months of imports. Although reserves cover
somewhat less than 100 percent of short-term debt (around 80 percent), one needs to be mindful
of the share of the external debt related to intra-industry debt (i.e. debt of daughter companies),
which accounts for more than 1/3 of the total. If at least a part of the intra-industry debt is
considered stable, then the coverage of short-term debt surpasses the threshold of 100 percent.
That said, the CNB policy will continue to be oriented to further gradual accumulation of
reserves, depending on capital flows dynamics and in a manner which does not collide with the
underlying exchange rate policy.
The Croatian banking system proved highly resilient throughout both the U.S. subprime crisis
and the euro area crisis, mainly thanks to sound fundamentals and macroprudential measures
implemented in the pre-crisis period. The banking system remains highly liquid, and with decent
profitability at close to 8 percent, despite increasing provisioning needs against the growth of
non-performing loans. The high capital adequacy of the banking sector (20.2 percent as of endJune) sufficiently ensures its resilience to potential shocks.
The deleveraging process in the euro area banks has so far affected the Croatian banking system
only modestly, thanks to the solid profitability of domestic banks and the strict macroprudential
policy which created substantial foreign liquidity reserves in banks. In addition, steady growth
of domestic deposits has so far been sufficient to finance the subdued credit demand. Going
forward, for the steady recovery of the economy it will be critical that banks bolster their credit
activity. One has to be aware, however, of the risks to such a credit recovery posed by the
introduction of (formal and informal) macroprudential measures by home countries targeting the
overall exposure of their banks and their subsidiaries. Hence, we have to make sure in a
cooperative manner that this risk does not materialize.

Structural reforms
Competitiveness remains a key challenge for boosting Croatia’s growth. To this end, the
recently adopted reduction in social security contributions has reduced the labor cost and shifted
the tax burden from labor to consumption. In addition, the recent decision to exclude investors’
reinvested profits from taxation and the cut of certain non-tax duties are seen as welcome signs
of the government’s intention to encourage foreign direct investment. Finally, in the coming
months the Government will initiate the reform of the labor law, which will facilitate temporary
and part-time work.
In August 2012 the Government adopted a new comprehensive structural reform program. The
program includes measures for a wide range of areas, including reforms of subsidies
distribution, restructuring of publicly owned enterprises, and reforms of the labor market, health
care, social security and the pension system. Significant part of the envisaged reforms is also
aimed at improving business climate, reduction of red tapes, and improving administrative
capacities for the absorption of EU funds.
In the transport sector, the restructuring of the state-owned railway company is well under way.
Cargo, passenger and infrastructure businesses of the company have been divided to separate
entities and the government is currently negotiating privatization of the cargo business, while
other parts are being prepared for EU funding. State-owned companies in the road transport are
also going through a restructuring process, including significant cuts in the number of
employees and monetization of the road business by offering concessions to private partners.
The restructuring process of the shipyard industry has reached the final phase in an effort to
meet EU demands that the shipyards must either be privatized or pay back the state funding they
had received so as to comply with EU competition law.
The new government has announced a more flexible approach to privatization, including the
sale of state-owned businesses that are not of strategic importance in the coming
years. Privatization of a state-owned bank and insurance company are planned to be finalized in
the first quarter of 2013. In addition, the government is preparing for privatization a number of
state-owned companies in the tourism and agriculture sectors.
To conclude, the Croatian authorities are mindful of the challenges ahead, but firmly believe
that the right policy mix, together with strengthened efforts to implement the envisaged reforms,
will enhance the economy’s competitiveness and growth potential.
