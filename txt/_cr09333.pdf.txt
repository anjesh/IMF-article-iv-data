INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
REPUBLIC OF BELARUS
Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation and Second Review
Under the Stand-By Arrangement
Prepared by the European Department in Consultation with Other Departments
Approved by Juha Kähkönen and Michele Shannon
October 5, 2009
Executive Summary
Economic background. Belarus has so far survived the global economic crisis with only limited
output loss, but its external position remains vulnerable. The difficult external position reflects the
severity of the global crisis, especially the decline in demand for and the price of Belarus’s main
exports. However, it also reflects delayed adjustment to the fall in exports and more recently the
effects of credit expansion under government programs, especially in construction and agriculture.
Program discussions. Fiscal, exchange rate and interest rate policies remain broadly appropriate.
The budget targets for 2009 were reaffirmed, and for 2010, the authorities will propose a budget
with a modest general government deficit (1.7 percent of GDP). Following the 20 percent
devaluation against the U.S. dollar in January 2009, and a subsequent depreciation of 5 percent
against a basket of currencies, the exchange rate level appears to be sustainable for the present.
Market interest rates are strongly positive in real terms. However, planned increases in credit under
government programs threatened the program targets. It was agreed that these plans should be
scaled down, and the program now includes a limit on net lending under government programs for
the remainder of 2009. Progress is being made on structural reforms agreed under the program. All
end-June performance criteria were met. The Belarusian authorities consulted with Fund staff
following a decline in reserves in mid-July below targeted levels, and remedial actions were agreed
during discussions of the second review. Available data show no clear evidence that any endSeptember performance criteria will be missed. Staff therefore recommends completion of the
second review under the SBA, with a waiver of applicability for end-September performance
criteria.
Article IV discussions. For the past decade Belarus has enjoyed high growth founded on high
investment levels. But the authorities are well aware that in future the external financing constraint
will bite harder, and sustainable growth will require productivity improvements. The staff proposed
a menu of reforms to liberalize the economy. The authorities were receptive, though also concerned
about the loss of control inherent in liberalization, and the possible social consequences of rapid
reform. There was agreement that more foreign direct investment, supported by the stepped up
privatization program, could improve productivity and ease the external financing constraint. The
authorities reiterated their interest in a successor arrangement to the SBA, incorporating a suitably
ambitious structural reform agenda.

I. CONTEXT: THE CRISIS AND THE PROGRAM
1.
At the outset of the global economic crisis, Belarus was in a highly vulnerable
position. The domestic economy was overheating, and the real effective exchange rate had
appreciated sharply during the second half of 2008. The current account deficit was already
high and reserves precariously low. Moreover, Belarus’s exports were highly concentrated—
dominated by exports of manufactured goods to Russia (for which demand fell fast) and oil
products to the European Union (for which the price was about to fall precipitously).
Households were losing confidence in the currency. Faced with rapidly declining reserves,
Belarus turned to the Fund for support.
2.
The Fund-supported program aimed to balance sufficient adjustment to correct
external imbalances with sufficient financing to avoid excessive contraction. The
centerpiece of the program was a 20 percent devaluation of the exchange rate and a shift in
the peg to a basket of currencies. The exchange rate adjustment was supported by tight
income and fiscal policies and increases in interest rates. Fund financing was substantial, and
was augmented when it became clear that the fall in Belarus’s exports was even larger than
had been projected. Recent economic developments suggest that the program has helped to
limit the damage from the crisis, but that external adjustment remains limited. The main
focus of the discussions on the second review of the SBA was therefore on policy tightening
to improve the external position. The main focus of the Article IV Consultation discussions
was on the longer term policies needed to produce sustainable growth in a post-crisis world.
II. PROGRESS SO FAR: RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Belarus has so far not experienced a significant fall in output, despite a sharp fall
in external demand. GDP declined 0.5 percent year-on-year in the first eight months
of 2009, as opposed to the 10.9 percent growth registered in the corresponding period
in 2008 but still by less than Belarus’s main trading partners. Economic activity has been
bolstered by strong domestic demand, especially fixed investment which expanded by
16.9 percent, due mainly to housing construction financed under government programs.
4.
Inflation has fallen. Twelve-month CPI fell to 12.5 percent in August, as the impact
of the negative output gap eclipsed the effects of exchange rate depreciation and utility price
adjustment early in the year.

5.
The current account deficit has widened, and international reserves remain low.
Export value contracted by 46 percent year-on-year during the first seven months of 2009,
reflecting a sharp reduction in demand, especially by Russia. Imports fell by 35 percent. The
energy balance also worsened, as export prices for oil products fell more than import prices
of crude oil. The resulting current account deficit ($3.7 billion in the first half of 2009) was
partially offset by net financial inflows, including privatization proceeds, trade credits, and
government borrowing. Disbursement of the final $500 million tranche of a $2 billion loan
from Russia has been delayed. However the Russian authorities expect to make the
disbursement later in the year. There will be a $200 million loan from the World Bank. The
European Commission will also propose a 200 million Euro loan under the EU’s macro
financial assistance policy. The rollover rate on debt of the banking system has been about
75 percent, and the risks are limited given the moderate size of scheduled repayments by the
banking system ($485 million in the second half of 2009). Currency substitution, which
accounted for large reserve loss at the beginning of the year, came to a halt in early June and
has been partially reversed since. Gross international reserves began to fall in early July, and
declined to below $3 billion in late August. Remedial actions were agreed with staff during
discussions on the second review and reserves have begun to recover. Gross reserves have
also been boosted by the recent SDR allocations amounting to about $570 million.

6.
The fiscal adjustment remains strong and on track, with further revenue
shortfalls being offset by spending restraint. The effects of the crisis continue to be felt,
especially through lower profit tax and excise revenue. The authorities have responded with
cuts in expenditures for goods and services and “other expenditures”. As agreed at the time
of the first review, local government deficits financed from accumulated surpluses and
foreign-financed net lending under projects approved before the program, do not need to be
offset by additional adjustment by the central government. As a result, the projected
consolidated budget deficit could reach 1.7 percent of GDP in 2009.
7.
The exchange rate has remained broadly stable since end-June. Following the
depreciation of the rubel during May and June, and the widening of the trading band from
5 percent to 10 percent in June, the exchange rate has varied little against the basket of
currencies.

Market interest rates remain high in real terms. The NBRB increased the interest
rate on overnight loans by two percentage points in June, while leaving the refinancing rate
unchanged, and interbank interest rates are usually over 20 percent. As inflation subsided,
market-determined interest rates increased sharply in real terms.

9.
However, lending under government programs has continued to increase at a
high rate (Box 1). In the first half of 2009, gross disbursements under government programs
were some 40 percent higher than in the corresponding period of 2008. The share of such
lending in overall credit to economy increased from 33 percent in December 2008 to
38 percent in July 2009. This lending helped propel high rates of investment and domestic
demand and therefore contributed to the loss of reserves.
10.
Financial soundness indicators remain broadly satisfactory except for
insufficient liquidity in some banks. The aggregate capital adequacy ratio has declined
slightly, but remains sufficiently high to cope with a variety of potential stress test scenarios
(Box 2). Nonperforming loans remain low, though they are expected to increase further.
Profitability has slightly decreased. Liquidity indicators are a source of concern, especially
for state-owned banks, some of which do not comply with the prudential liquidity ratios. The
persistent vulnerability of these banks to liquidity risk stems from their significant
involvement in lending under government programs.
III. RIDING OUT THE STORM: POLICY DISCUSSIONS ON THE PROGRAM
A. Macroeconomic Outlook
11.
So long as credit growth is contained, the program targets for 2009 remain
within reach. Based on tight fiscal and monetary policies in the period ahead, supported by
the imposition of a limit on credit under government programs, GDP is projected to decline
by about 1 percent in 2009. Significant import contraction in the last few months of the year
is expected to contain the current account deficit to around 9½ percent of GDP. This,
together with financial support from international donors, will help attain the gross reserve
target for 2009. For 2010, the aim should be to bring down the current account deficit further
to 7 percent of GDP and increase gross reserves to at least $7 billion (about 2½ months of
imports). With the expected recovery of external demand, which will facilitate a modest
rebound of output in the order of 2 percent, this can be achieved with a fiscal policy stance
similar to that of 2009 and a credit increase in line with nominal GDP. However, an
unrestrained credit policy would enlarge further the saving-investment gap, leading to a
current account deficit of 13 percent of GDP in 2009 and (if continued on a similar scale)
11 percent in 2010, and a cumulative shortfall of gross reserves by end-2010 of about
$4 billion compared with the target of the original program. The authorities broadly agreed
with this analysis, though they were more optimistic about export prospects and external
financing going forward, and favored a smaller reduction in credit growth.

7
Box 1. Lending Under Government Programs
The government is an active player in the financial system, and bank lending under various government programs
remains a distinctive feature in Belarus. Government programs are typically implemented via presidential decrees or
resolutions of the Council of Ministers which recommend lending to particular projects, sectors, or companies, often at
highly subsidized interest rates. Disbursements and repayments are done outside the regular budget process, but a part of the
interest payments is subsidized by the budget: borrowers typically pay a subsidized rate to the banks and the government
compensates the banks for the difference between the subsidized and the “market” rate which is typically set at a certain
margin over the NBRB’s refinancing rate. Many of recommended credits carry state guarantees (Box 1 in the 2009 FSAP
Update). There has been a sharp increase in lending under government programs over the period of 2005-09, with the bulk
of credits going to agriculture and construction.
State-influenced lending is generally distortive. It interferes with the development of a sound risk culture, precluding the
proper pricing and efficient allocation of credit in accordance with inherent risk. Such lending also blocks normal monetary
policy transmission mechanism by inducing credit expansion at non-market terms.
The Fund staff has consistently expressed concern about these lending programs. In December the authorities agreed
not to initiate new programs financed with government deposits and placed a ban on transferring additional government
deposits to commercial banks in order to set the stage for transforming state banks into more market-oriented entities.
Nevertheless, while overall monetary limits under the program framework were met, lending under government programs
continued in early 2009 using non-government deposit financing, prompting expressions of concern in the staff report in the
first review of the SBA that subsidized lending crowds out lending to the private sector. Since then, lending under
government programs has increased even more rapidly. The share of such lending in overall credit to economy increased
from 33 percent at end-2008 to 38 percent in July 2009.
At the same time, under pressure to meet the lending targets specified in decrees and resolutions, banks turned to
the NBRB for refinancing. The NBRB supported this lending using mechanisms outside its standard refinancing facilities
(via ad hoc decisions of NBRB Board), increasing the stock of such support by some 1.9 trillion rubels (1.4 percent of GDP)
in the first half of 2009 and by a similar amount in July-August 2009 (the average interest rate for refinancing of these
programs at the end of August averaged to 9.3 percent, negative on a real basis).

Box 2. Banking System Stress Tests
Stress tests based on the end-June 2009 data show that banks have sufficient capital buffers to withstand the
assumed shocks (see table) but are significantly vulnerable to liquidity risk.
Despite a small decrease in the aggregate capital adequacy ratio (CAR) since late 2008, banks would
remain sufficiently capitalized in the considered stress test scenarios. In the scenario of an increase in the
ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans by 15 percentage points, the aggregate CAR would drop
from 19.1 percent to 12.4 percent, which is sufficiently above the prudential minimum of 8 percent. The
direct effects of exchange rate or interest rate risk remain insignificant. Stress-tests based on macro scenarios,
which the NBRB has recently performed in the context of the region-wide stress testing exercise organized
by the IMF staff, also suggest that bank capital would stay above the prudential minimum even in the event
of a significant macroeconomic slowdown.
State-owned banks are significantly vulnerable to liquidity risk. As of end-June 2009, the actual current
liquidity ratio was 95 percent for the banking sector as a whole, but only 76 percent for state-owned banks,
which is only marginally above the prudential minimum of 70 percent. Under the considered stress test
assumptions (a 10 percent withdrawal of domestic liabilities or a 25 percent withdrawal of liabilities to
nonresidents), state-owned banks as well as the largest banks would end up with the current liquidity ratio
below the statutory minimum. The vulnerability of state-owned banks to liquidity risk, which had already
been emphasized by the results of stress tests in the past, stems from the significant involvement of these
banks in lending under government programs.

Medium-term prospects depend critically on the implementation of structural
reforms to improve the country’s growth potential and reduce external vulnerability.
Reforms aimed at fostering a dynamic private sector and increasing the role of market in
resource allocation would boost productivity and ease external financing constraints
(discussed in Section V), realizing a medium-term potential growth of 7 percent. Under this
scenario, which also envisages low fiscal deficits and a prudent monetary policy that contains
inflation to moderate single-digits, the current account deficit will gradually fall and stabilize
at around 3½ percent of GDP. The capital inflows associated with accelerated privatization
will help increase gross reserves to cover about three months of imports, providing a buffer
against external shocks. Under a more hesitant approach to reforms, the external financing
constraint would bite harder, putting constraints on a growth model reliant on high
investment. Medium-term growth would be expected to be 2 percentage points lower,
reflecting financing constraints and lower productivity growth. External vulnerability will
remain, reflected in high current account deficits and external debt. The authorities broadly
agreed but emphasized the strengths in their growth model and their ongoing efforts to
improve the business environment.
B. Credit, Monetary, and Exchange Rate Policies
13.
A tight credit policy is critical for external sustainability. Sharp expansion of
lending under government programs, mainly to agricultural and construction sectors, has

10
resulted in strong aggregate investment and domestic demand and has put substantial
pressure on the current account and international reserves. The authorities originally planned
to increase this lending even more in the second half of 2009 arguing that agriculture and
construction have low import intensity and therefore could be used as the means for pulling
the economy out of the recession. Staff disagreed, noting that such an expansion would have
direct and indirect effects on domestic demand, and hence on the balance of payments (see
paragraph 11). The authorities accepted these arguments and have agreed to limit lending
under government programs to 4 trillion rubels for the second half of 2009.1 This is necessary
to return NDA and NIR to a path consistent with the program objectives, and is also expected
to improve banks’ liquidity ratios. The limit will initially be implemented through NBRB
recommendations to commercial banks. The issues of limits for 2010 will be taken up in the
context of discussions of the third review.

The authorities will also contain domestic
demand in the remainder of 2009 by limiting credit
and imports by state enterprises with high levels of
inventories. State enterprises have been slow to
respond to the fall in domestic and external demand, in
part because they have tried to adhere to output targets
set before the crisis. As a result inventories have
increased sharply. The NBRB has now issued
recommendations to banks to restrict credit to
enterprises with high levels of inventories, to curtail
their demand for further imports, and the government
has required state enterprises to secure authorization for
additional imports from supervising ministries. These

Given loans already extended in July and August and expected repayments, this will have the effect of limiting
gross lending under government programs during September-December 2009 to about three trillion rubels, less

short-term measures are already bearing fruit and are expected reduce demand for imports by
about $400 million in the remainder of 2009, helping the authorities to meet the reserves
targets under the program.2
15.
The NBRB will continue to use interest rate policy to contain credit and
domestic demand. Market interest rates are now well above the expected rate of inflation,
and the authorities would like to begin reducing them. However, they accepted staff advice
that such a reduction should await clear evidence that they are on track to meet targets for
external reserves and that the process of de-dollarization is well established.
16.
The level of exchange rate appears to be appropriate based on agreed policies
(Box 3).3 Comparing the current account norm with the staff’s medium-term projections
implies only a marginal overvaluation of 2 to 4 percent. The external sustainability approach
also indicates that the net external asset position can be broadly sustained without a major
correction in the exchange rate. At present, given the importance of the nominal exchange
rate in shaping public expectations, staff agreed with the authorities that the current exchange
rate regime would serve the country well in the near term. However, the staff advised the
authorities to make use of flexibility available under the ±10 percent band, especially if
reserves targets appear to be at risk for reasons other than insufficiently tight credit policy.
C. Fiscal Policies
17.
The authorities remained committed to fiscal restraint, an important anchor of
the adjustment strategy. They planned to offset the estimated revenue shortfall (0.5 percent
of GDP) by savings on unallocated appropriations, goods and services, and investment of the
central government. They decided to further defer the wage increase and increase charges for
transportation and utilities (which will reduce the need for subsidies) to help rein in spending,
making room for a pension increase of up to 10 percent this year. Local budgets’ expenditure
will be monitored closely and, when possible, kept in line with revenue performance. The
authorities remain committed to shielding social sectors from spending cuts.
18.
The deficit limit of 1.7 percent of GDP in the draft 2010 budget is consistent with
program objectives. Under the proposed budget, the tax burden will be reduced by
2½ percent of GDP, mostly by eliminating the turnover tax and local sales taxes. Expenditure
on goods and services and investment spending will be reduced. Increases in charges for
transportation and utilities in early 2010 will rein in transfers, but interest rate subsidies and
those for oil refineries will continue to put pressure on the budget. The wage bill will

More details are provided in the accompanying Selected Issues Paper: “Is There a Need for Further
Adjustment in the Exchange Rate?”

12
Box 3. Is There a Need for Further Adjustment in the Exchange Rate Regime or Level?
Adopting the currency basket with flexibility around a central parity was well suited for riding out the
crisis. The substantial misalignment observed at the end of 2008 has been largely corrected and there is
no need for further significant exchange rate adjustment. Sustainability of the current rate, however, is
conditional on maintaining tight control of domestic demand.
The switch to the currency basket in January 2009 accompanied by a nominal correction reversed the
erosion of competitiveness. The basket preserved the function of a nominal anchor essential for
maintaining external stability, but at the same time safeguarded Belarus’ competitiveness in the
environment of significant volatility of major trading partners’ currencies. The band around a central
parity provided a cushion for responding to shocks. Until the institutional framework required for a
credible alternative nominal anchor is in place, the basket peg will serve to preserve stability.
The CPI-based REER suggests that Belarus experienced a substantial loss of competitiveness in the last
half of 2008 but regained it in the first half of 2009 on account of a step devaluation in January and
further depreciation in May-June 2009. The ULC-based REER suggests broadly the same conclusions.
To the extent that pressure on reserves continues, it comes from insufficiently tight credit policies.

The macroeconomic balance approach suggests only a marginal overvaluation, which, given inherent
uncertainty in equilibrium exchange rate assessments, does not provide sufficient ground for
recommending another substantial adjustment of the nominal exchange rate. The current account norm
(based on the CGER model with Belarus’ equilibrium values of regressors), is estimated at -2 to
-2.7 percent of GDP. The underlying current account deficit, which is likely to appear in the mediumterm if Belarus follows policies agreed under the second review of the program, is 3.5 percent of GDP.
This implies a marginal overvaluation of 2-4 percent. If, however, domestic demand policies fail to
adjust the underlying current account deficit would be much wider, implying a substantial misalignment
of the exchange rate.
The external sustainability approach leads to a similar qualitative conclusion. Policies outlined in the
Letter of Intent would be consistent with stabilizing Belarus’ net external asset position (NEAP) at its
present level (30 percent of GDP at the end of the first quarter of 2009). Without adjustment in domestic
policies, sustaining the present NEAP position would require a REER adjustment of about 15 percent.

increase in line with nominal GDP. A presidential decree to increase targeted assistance will
double subsidies and transfers to the poor. The Ministry of Finance will also propose
additional investment spending (1.3 percent of GDP), which would restore investment
spending to its 2009 level as a share of GDP, but the inclusion of this spending in the 2010
budget is contingent on securing revenue sufficient to offset the effects on the deficit. To this
end, a proposal to increase the VAT rate by 3 percentage points is under discussion.4
D. Financial Sector Policies
19.
In addition to limiting lending under government programs, discussions focused
on the need to reduce government involvement in other aspects of the financial sector.
In particular:


4

Staff emphasized that NBRB liquidity support to banks on non-market terms
should be phased out. The growth in lending under government programs (para 13)
has been significantly funded by the NBRB liquidity support to (state-owned) banks
outside standard refinancing facilities. This NBRB refinancing has been extended to
banks at the below market interest rates and on non-transparent terms and conditions.
The staff expressed concern that this

by end-December 2009 they will
agree with IMF staff a schedule for phasing out this support.

A proposal to increase VAT by 4 percentage points was rejected by the government earlier this year, due to
concerns about the effects on enterprises’ liquidity, consumers and inflation. The Ministry of Finance will rely
on technical assistance from the Fund to address some of these concerns, and also believes that a VAT increase
will be more politically palatable when linked to higher infrastructure spending.

14


There was agreement on the need to enhance NBRB independence. Following the
recommendations of the recent Safeguard Assessment and FSAP Update, the
authorities are preparing amendments to key financial sector legislation, including the
Statute of the NBRB. These institutional changes should help improve the
effectiveness of both banking supervision and monetary policy implementation.



There was also agreement that the NBRB should disengage from non-core
business. To this end, by end-December 2009, the authorities will develop an action
plan for sales to private investors of all NBRB non-financial subsidiaries and
associated companies.
E. Other Structural Reforms

20.
The authorities and staff agreed on the importance of accelerating the
privatization program. Tangible progress has been achieved in developing a legal
framework for privatization to become competitive, transparent, and professionally executed.
A draft Privatization Law and a draft decree on establishing a privatization agency will be
submitted to the President by September 30, 2009. A privatization agency is expected to
become operational shortly after the relevant decree is enacted, focusing on preparing several
large enterprises for privatization through an open, international, transparent, and competitive
tender by end-February 2010.
21.
Further steps in curtailing the government’s involvement in the economy are
planned. The authorities agreed to desist from setting quantitative targets, including for
output and employment, in enterprises where the government has only a minority
shareholding. The authorities plan to further liberalize prices this year by reducing the
number of products subject to price controls and trade margins, consistent with the World
Bank recommendations. However, more needs to be done in improving the flexibility in
setting wages, as the corporate sector remains subject to the unified pay grading system. The
authorities also need to refrain from taking protectionist measures in response to the current
crisis.5
IV. PROGRAM MODALITIES AND CAPACITY TO REPAY
22.
The attached Letter of Intent summarizes the progress in implementing the
economic program. All quantitative and continuous performance criteria for end-June were
met.6 As committed in the letter, the authorities suspended the adoption of new government

15
lending programs. They also eliminated all instructions that are not consistent with their
commitment not to impose a general ceiling on monthly price increases. The structural
benchmark to engage a consultant to assist in preparing state-owned banks for privatization
was partially met, as the authorities selected an international consultant to assist in the
privatization of one bank, and plan to engage consultants for other banks once strategic
investors for those banks are identified. The authorities are on track to submit to the Head of
State a draft Decree on establishing a Privatization Agency, and bring loan classification and
provisioning requirements in line with best international practices, two structural benchmarks
for end-September.
23.
The Letter also sets out policy commitments for the remainder of 2009. With data
yet to be released and assessed and no evidence that the performance criteria will not be met,
the authorities are requesting a waiver of applicability of the end-September quantitative
performance criteria, which is supported by staff. The end-December indicative targets,
adjusted upwards (NIR) and downward (NDA) by 100 percent of the equivalent of the
amount of the recent SDR allocations, are proposed to be established as the performance
criteria.7 The measures envisaged in the Letter, together with financing from international
donors, are expected to bring the gross reserves to targeted levels for the program period. A
financing gap of about $300 million had emerged in 2009, but this is now expected to be
filled by additional financing from the EU. Thus, the program is fully financed. With regard
to 2010 beyond the program period, additional adjustment or financing would still be
required to bring reserves up to a more comfortable level. To strengthen the program, an
additional structural benchmark is proposed to reflect the authorities’ commitment to refrain
from imposing quantitative targets on companies that do not benefit from government’s
financial support and in which the government has only a minority share.
24.
Belarus’s capacity to repay the Fund remains adequate. The level of Fund credit
outstanding is expected to reach 49 percent of gross international reserves at its peak in 2010,
and Fund repurchases and charges would amount to 37 percent of total debt service in 2013
(Table 9). The risks are manageable given the still moderate level of gross external debt
(expected to peak at 43 percent of GDP in 2010 and fall thereafter as the current account
deficit declines). Additional comfort stems from the fact that the public debt will remain
below 30 percent of GDP even at its peak in 2010, reflecting the government’s commitment
to sound fiscal policy (Appendix I).

7

The Technical Memorandum of Understanding accompanying the Letter of Intent updates the definition of
NIR by removing a requirement that securities counted towards reserve assets be issued by G-7 countries,
thereby bringing the definition closer to practice used in other Fund programs.

16
V. LOOKING BEYOND THE CRISIS: POLICIES TO SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE GROWTH
25.
Discussions for the 2009 Article IV Consultation were focused on policies that
could bring about sustainable growth, and form the basis for a follow-up program. The
starting point in this analysis for the staff is that the world after the crisis will be different.
Constrained access to capital markets, as well as the phasing out of energy subsidies from
Russia, implies that Belarus should shift its growth model from one based on high capital
investment to one based on productivity increases, supported by strong macroeconomic
policies. The authorities broadly shared this view, but stressed that the social costs of
structural reforms should be minimized, and cautioned against overly rapid change. The
staff’s views are summarized below, and developed in more detail in the Selected Issues
Paper “Belarus: Sources of Recent Growth and Prospects for Future Growth”. A rich
exchange of views with the authorities also came in a joint NBRB/IMF Seminar held on
August 25.8 It was agreed that an agenda for structural reform that could form the basis for a
follow-up Fund program beginning in 2010 would be discussed further during subsequent
review missions.
A. Reinventing Belarus’s Growth Model
26.
Belarus achieved an average 7.5 percent annual growth in the ten years up
to 2008, benefiting from its inherent strengths and favorable external conditions. High
investment-to-GDP ratios and productivity gains from a well-educated and disciplined labor
force were the main contributors to growth. Some aspects of the Belarusian economic model
are discussed in Box 4. The favorable external environment—including strong growth in
Russia and the rest of the world, easy access to the Russian market, and low-cost energy
imports from Russia—also allowed the economy to grow rapidly.
27.
However, the global economic crisis has exposed the economy’s vulnerability.
The external current account has registered a sizable deficit for most of the past decade as
savings fell short of investment, leading to precariously low international reserves.
Concentrated exports, destined mainly to the Western European market for oil products and
the Russian market for non-energy products, were hard hit when demand in both markets fell
drastically as a result of the global financial crisis. The situation was exacerbated by lower
world oil prices and reduced subsidies on energy imports.

17
Box 4. Belarus’s Economic Model
Almost two decades after independence, Belarus achieved impressive growth while displaying
many features of a planned economy. After a 40 percent decline in output during 1992–95, the
government sought stability and to protect jobs and wages by wielding wide administrative controls,
including on prices, trade margins, and the exchange rate. Thereafter, Belarus achieved the highest
growth and lowest poverty rates of the CIS.
The pro-poor economic model provided ample social benefits, but proved difficult to finance and
sustain in the long-run. Growth resumed in 1996 and remained high until 2008, permitting large
investments in physical and social

budget.
Wage policies. The policy of setting large wage increases (with dollar-denominated wage targets) has
had a positive impact on poverty reduction in Belarus. However, real wage growth has outstripped
productivity growth, undermining competitiveness and economic stability.
Social protection. Poor households (with a smaller share of wage income) receive large social
protection transfers (child allowances, housing assistance, etc.) and pensions. Social protection transfers
averaged about 14 percent of GDP during 2002–09. Quasi-fiscal transfers are also important, with SOEs
financing social assets (housing, utilities, schools). Large transfers to loss-making companies and active
labor market programs kept unemployment low.
Education and health policies. The social sectors in Belarus are overwhelmingly state financed and use
more than a quarter of budget resources (11 percent of GDP). The share of education outlays relative to
GDP hovers around 6½, significantly more than in OECD countries. This helped form a well trained
labor force. With a publicly provided health care system and generous benefits, health indicators also
rank among the best in Europe and Central Asia. Belarus has one of the lowest infant and under 5
mortality rates, lowest maternal mortality rates, and almost universal immunization rates.

18
28.
In the longer run, several external constraints are likely to hinder a return to the
growth path prior to the current crisis. Both the GDP levels and potential growth rates of
Belarus’s main trading partners are likely to be lower in the aftermath of the crisis, reducing
external demand for Belarus’s products. Belarus would not benefit to the same extent as in
the past from preferential prices on oil and gas imports from Russia. Meanwhile, the
investment-driven growth model will face pressure as external financing is likely to be less
accessible and more costly following the global crisis. There are also indications that the
returns from investment have declined, not only because the level of investment is already
very high, but because much of recent investment has been in residential construction.
29.
Potential growth is likely to be significantly lower than the pace observed in the
recent past. A study based on the production function approach shows that capital
accumulation explained about 70 percent of the growth during 2001–08, while productivity
gains contributed 23 percent9. However, the growth of both the capital stock and productivity
has been declining in recent years. Extrapolation of the recent trends of capital and
productivity growth yields a medium-term potential growth rate 2½ percentage points lower
than the average for 2001–08. As discussed in the section on the medium-term outlook,
external financing constraints following the current crisis would reduce investment growth
further, depressing potential growth to around 5 percent. To achieve a medium-term growth
of 7 percent, productivity increases averaging 3 percent annually would be required.

The staff argued that Belarus could strengthen its growth factors by carrying
out structural reforms. Experience in other countries that have undergone economic
transition shows that better allocation of resources, a larger and more dynamic private sector,
and increased use of foreign capital can help boost productivity growth. Belarus has much to
gain from market-oriented reforms given that Belarus is still in its early stage of transition,
and its structural reforms should focus on yielding state control to market forces, and pushing
ahead with privatization. A menu for structural reforms is set out in Box 5.
9

See Selected Issues Paper “Belarus: Sources of Recent Growth and Prospects for Future Growth”.

19
Box 5. A Menu for Structural Reforms
Reduction in state intervention in the economy will allow market forces to play a major role in the
allocation of resources. Specific reforms could include:


Minimizing price controls so that price signals can direct the flow of resources and help adjust
excesses and shortages in the economy;



Abolishing most retail trade margins in line with the government’s agreement with the World
Bank;



Liberalizing wages to reward high productivity, and developing the labor market so that
workers can move to jobs where they are most productive;



Abolishing mandatory quantitative targets at the macroeconomic and enterprise levels as it has
become more difficult to manage an increasingly sophisticated economy through central
planning; and



Allowing the banking system to make lending decisions based on the profitability and risks of
projects rather than government recommendations.

Productivity growth could also benefit from the emergence of a strong private sector through:


Simplifying conditions for setting up new private businesses, as experience in other countries
indicates that jobs created by the private sector can provide employment opportunities for
workers laid off as a result of state enterprise reforms. New businesses might be created by
spinning off parts of existing state enterprises;



Further reducing the regulatory burden on the private sector, and allowing greater flexibility in
setting prices, wages and margins;



Increasing the private sector’s access to credit resources by fostering a more competitive
financial sector.

An ambitious and transparent privatization agenda that is open to foreign investors would help
bring capital, technology, and management and marketing skills. The following measures would
facilitate this process:


Reducing conditions attached to new investment, such as requiring retention of current
employees and wage scales;



Enacting a modern Privatization Law, and establishing a Privatization Agency with powers to
prepare enterprises for privatization and hire professionals from the market.

20
31.
Providing social security can help reduce the negative impact of, and sustain
popular support for, structural reforms. The authorities were concerned about the social
impact of structural reform, in particular the risk of high unemployment. The staff accepted
the validity of this concern, agreeing that transition had often been painful, but noted that
some countries had been able to minimize the social impact, notably China (through
promotion of new private enterprises to absorb laid-off workers and development of a social
security system)10 and the Czech Republic (through active labor market policies). The staff
also stressed the need to strengthen the social safety net to give subsistence and vocational
assistance to the temporary dislocated labor force, until they are re-absorbed by the labor
market. Privatization proceeds and fiscal savings from reduced subsidies to inefficient
production could help finance the safety net.
32.
While agreeing that structural reforms could improve growth potential, the
authorities were cautious about the pace of reform. The authorities agreed that structural
reforms should be the focus of the economic program to lay a solid foundation for mediumterm development. However, they were also worried about potential loss of control over the
economy, and concerned that the benefits of their current economic model should not be
jeopardized by overly rapid change. They also pointed to progress already made, including
their recent achievements in improving business climate.11 They also underlined the need to
upgrade technology and raise energy efficiency to increase productivity. The staff noted the
authorities’ concerns, but also warned that overly gradual approaches to reform had costs. In
particular, it will be important to demonstrate to foreign and domestic investors the
authorities’ commitment to reform, and to realize quickly the macroeconomic benefits
associated with transition. To this end, macroeconomic policies should be designed with a
view to reducing external vulnerabilities as well as improving growth prospects.
B. Supporting Macroeconomic and Financial Sector Policies
33.
Continuation of a prudent fiscal policy will be important in supporting
structural reforms. The authorities viewed an annual deficit of 1.5 percent of GDP as
appropriate, given Belarus’s relatively low public debt. A modest deficit would allow the
authorities to improve social and physical infrastructure, which would help to attract private
investment. Staff stressed that medium-term fiscal policy should support the transition to a
more market-oriented economy. Efforts to reduce the tax burden and provide a level playing
field for potential investors should be pursued. On the spending side, resources will be
needed to pay for unemployment benefits and to retrain laid-off employees and adapt their

21
skills to new demands. Staff also emphasized the need to cut untargeted subsidies, including
to loss-making enterprises.
34.
Over the long term, a move toward a more flexible exchange rate regime is
warranted. At present, the peg to a basket of currencies with flexibility around a central
parity offers the best prospect of maintaining external stability, due to the lack of an
alternative anchor and the importance of the nominal exchange rate in shaping expectations.
However, over time, a more flexible exchange rate regime could better enable the economy
to handle the mostly real sector shocks to which it is subject. Such a move would require
developing a supporting institutional framework, most notably central bank independence.
The authorities agreed with this analysis, but also stressed that removing the exchange rate
anchor in the environment of pressure on the rate could result in a loss of macroeconomic
stability. The NBRB also emphasized the need for further financial market development and
improvement of models designed to analyze and forecast monetary and macroeconomic
indicators as necessary conditions for development of an alternative nominal anchor, such as
an inflation targeting framework.
35.
Increasing the commercial orientation of banks is essential for more efficient
allocation of resources. Currently, loan decisions in the state-dominated banking sector are
often subject to explicit or implicit government direction. As a result, banks have limited
incentives to innovate or to control costs and risks. Lending under government programs also
crowds out other potentially profitable lending. The authorities noted that they were currently
considering the modalities of a dedicated agency to address these issues. Initially, such an
agency could accumulate existing government program loans that banks would be willing to
transfer to it and associated funding in the form of government deposits. Going forward, the
modalities of the agency should be discussed with IMF staff. The staff stressed that if such an
agency undertook lending, it should be scored as net lending on the budget. The staff also
emphasized that lending by such an agency should replace (rather than add to) lending under
government programs by commercial banks.
36.
There is also scope for stimulating development of nonbank financial
institutions. As discussed in the FSSA Update (IMF Country Report 09/30, January 2009),
capital market development in Belarus could be stimulated by strengthening the legal and
regulatory framework covering the protection of minority investor rights, accelerating the
existing program of privatization of state-owned enterprises, thereby increasing the supply of
traded shares, and enhancing public debt management, thereby establishing a domestic
government bond yield curve. A more diversified financial sector would also contribute to a
successful business environment and to economic development.

22
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
37.
Belarus has so far survived the crisis with very modest output losses, in part
because of the strategy of expanding credit for construction and agriculture. Belarus has
experienced a lower output fall than most countries hit by the crisis, despite a huge fall in its
exports. In part this is because exchange rate adjustment has reduced the impact of the crisis
on the external accounts. But it is also because the authorities have aggressively expanded
credit under government programs to sectors they believe are not import intensive.
38.
However, this has come at a price: the current account deficit remains high and
reserves low. The authorities have adhered to a balanced budget and have increased policy
interest rates to support the rubel, but credit under government programs is either explicitly
subsidized or extended at rates below market interest rates. This credit has increased
domestic demand, and hence demand for imports, and resulted in heavy reserves losses in
July and August. Consultations on this began in July and continued during the mission for the
second review for the SBA.
39.
The main modification of the program is to tighten credit policy. The authorities
now accept that credit policy has to be tightened, and the objectives of building reserves and
supporting the exchange rate regime given priority over that of maintaining output. However,
the realization has come late, and the authorities’ delay in reacting means that a sharp
adjustment in credit policies is now required to meet program performance criteria. This
should be accompanied by the unwinding of distortionary and non-transparent liquidity
support measures.
40.
Credit tightening should be accompanied by strong fiscal and monetary policies
and, if needed, flexibility under the exchange rate peg. The authorities’ continuation of a
tight fiscal policy is welcome, as is the NBRB’s intention to keep interest rates high until
there is clear evidence of a turnaround in reserves. The authorities should also be prepared to
permit more flexibility in the exchange rate within the widened band during the remainder
of 2009, especially if reserves targets are at risk for reasons other than insufficiently tight
credit policy.
41.
The proposed 2010 budget can be the foundation for a prudent macroeconomic
framework, which will need to involve continued credit restraint. The authorities plan to
limit the consolidated budget deficit for 2009 to the equivalent of 1.7 percent of GDP, which
will permit an expansion of credit to the rest of the economy in line with projected nominal
GDP growth. To avoid crowding out other lending, the authorities will need to exercise
restraint in lending under government programs in 2010.
42.
The Article IV Consultation provided an opportunity to look beyond the crisis
and also to get past disagreements on the viability of the authorities’ growth model. The
authorities understand well that financing high growth through high investment will be much
more difficult after the global crisis, and that past differences of view on the sustainability of

23
their growth model have now been overtaken by events. A consensus is emerging on the
elements of a reform strategy. There is broad agreement that privatization will play an
important part in easing the external financing constraint and promoting technological
development. There is also growing acceptance of the need for liberalization of the economy,
beginning with reducing the burden of regulation and quantitative targets on the private
sector. However, this acceptance will compete with the instinct to maintain or add controls,
especially in response to a crisis.
43.
The success of reform will ultimately depend on political judgments by the
authorities. There is increasing recognition that an increasingly sophisticated economy and
growing links with other economies will require new methods of economic management.
This opens the door for development of a detailed reform agenda. The authorities are
understandably cautious about the social costs of reform, and protective of their
achievements in avoiding some of the pitfalls of transition. Nevertheless, the prospects for
high and sustainable growth depend critically on the willingness of the authorities to try new
approaches, even if it involves loosening administrative controls on the economy.
44.
A new Fund arrangement could play a supporting role in program design and in
easing the financial burden of adjustment. The improving dialogue between the Fund and
Belarus under the program, in collaboration with other international players—especially the
World Bank, EBRD and EU—offers an opportunity to shape the reform agenda. International
financial support can also ease some of the inevitable costs of transition. Assuming that the
current program remains on track, discussions on a successor arrangement could begin

Sources: Belarus authorities; and IMF staff estimations.
1/ Includes projections of unaccounted flows of $250 million for 2009 onwards. Previously, recorded under errors and omissions.
2/ Disbursements and repayments are based on the schedule agreed at the time of the first review.
3/ In 2009, Russia's remaining budget support of $500 million is included as government loan in the program column, but as other donors' financing in the projection column. Other
donors' financing in the projection column also includes $200 million from the World Bank and the equivalent of about $290 million from the EU.
4/ Projected overperformance in 2009 is due to the SDR allocations.

in percent of GDP) remain at their levels of the last projection year.

APPENDIX I

1/ Derived as [r - g - (1+g) + (1+r)]/(1+g++g) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; = change in domestic GDP deflator in U.S. dollar
terms, g = real GNP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-(1+g(1+r1+g++g) times previous period debt stock. increases with an appreciating domestic currency (> 0) and rising inflation
(based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period. Differs slightly from external financing requirement in Staff Report because
includes official transfers and IMF repurchases but excludes increase in portfolio and other investment assets.

APPENDIX II: BELARUS: LETTER OF INTENT
Minsk, September 30, 2009
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, DC, 20431 U.S.A.
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
1.
This letter describes the economic policies and objectives of the authorities of the
Republic of Belarus for the remainder of 2009 and for 2010. The current letter supplements
and amends the commitments made during the first review under the Stand-By Arrangement
(SBA) with the International Monetary Fund. Based on the policies we have pursued since
the initiation of the SBA, we request the completion of the second review under the SBA.
2.
Since the completion of the first review we honored our commitments outlined in our
Letter of Intent of June 19, 2009, meeting all end-June program targets.


We made greater use of the flexibility in our exchange rate policy to facilitate external
adjustment. To this end during June 2009 the NBRB allowed the rubel to depreciate by
about 5 percent against the central parity and widened the exchange rate band from
±5 percent to ±10 percent. We met the end-June net international reserves (NIR) target.



We further tightened monetary policy which helped us achieve the end-June quantitative
target on net domestic assets (NDA). To support the exchange rate regime and to keep
inflation low we raised the overnight credit rate by 2 percentage points and also
recommended commercial banks to increase interest rates on new rubel term deposits of
households by 2 percentage points, compared with their March 2009 level.



We maintained tight fiscal policy by containing government expenditure, and met the
adjusted performance criterion for cash deficit at end June 2009.



We are making good progress in meeting structural benchmarks under the program.



In the future, we intend to strictly adhere to our commitments under the program.

3.
Modifications of the end-September performance criteria are not proposed. However,
as the Executive Board will only meet to consider our request for completion of the second
review under the SBA in October, we request a waiver of applicability for all end-September
performance criteria. The performance criteria for end-December will be set under the
second review of the program. The performance criteria, prior action and structural
benchmarks are summarized in Tables 2 and 3. The third review will be held after
November 15, 2009.

40
4.
We believe that the policies set out in this letter are adequate to achieve the objectives
of the program, but will take any further measures that may become appropriate for this
purpose. As is standard under all IMF arrangements, we will continue to consult with the
IMF on adoption of new measures, and in advance of revisions to the policies described in
this letter. We will consult with Fund staff about the appropriate policy response if gross
reserves fall below $4.8 billion before end-December 2009. We will also continue to provide
the Fund with information as required to monitor progress on program implementation. We
will consult with the Fund on our economic policies after the expiration of the arrangement,
in line with the Fund’s policies on such consultations. Finally, we consent to the publication
of this letter and the accompanying Executive Board documents on the IMF’s website.
I. PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK
5.
Achieving macroeconomic stabilization and economic recovery while minimizing
social costs remain our key objectives. To achieve these objectives macroeconomic policies
would have to be strengthened by additional structural reforms. Our current exchange rate
and fiscal policies are consistent with program objectives. Policy rates were increased in June
and deposit rates are now strongly positive in real terms. However, to moderate domestic
demand pressures and alleviate external imbalances we are tightening our credit policies.
Structural reforms will be aiming at creating new opportunities for the economically active
population, while ensuring that adequate social safety net is in place to protect the most
vulnerable people.
6.
The macroeconomic framework agreed during the first review of the program
remains largely valid. We expect output and the current account deficit to be slightly higher
than programmed. GDP is projected to decline by 1¼ percent, compared with 3 percent
expected at the time of the first review. The current account deficit would widen to
9¾ percent of GDP, against an earlier projection of 7¾ percent of GDP. Inflation has
subsided, consistent with economic slowdown and declining international prices, and is now
expected to reach 11 percent at end-2009 on a year-on-year basis.
7.
The external position remains vulnerable, as the trade deficit has been widening and
international reserves declining. With exports still weak, further measures to contain
domestic demand will be needed to arrest the decline in reserves. Further economic
liberalization and privatization would stimulate foreign direct investment, strengthening the
external position in 2010. Barring further deterioration of external conditions, these measures
would allow us to narrow the current account deficit to 7 percent of GDP in 2010 and bring
international reserves to 2½ months of imports of goods and services.
II. MONETARY AND EXCHANGE RATE POLICIES
8.
Our monetary and exchange rate policies aim to strengthen the credibility of the
exchange rate regime, while limiting the adverse effects of the global economic crisis on the
Belarusian economy. Recently NIR and NDA have deviated from the path specified in the

41
program, in part because monetary policy has not been sufficiently tight. While market
interest rates have been strongly positive in real terms, following an increase in policy rates
in June, credit expansion has continued, mostly due to an increase in lending under
government programs which is not interest sensitive.
9.
We believe that the increase in interest rates in June will have continuing effects
which will facilitate meeting the NIR and NDA targets under the program. We intend to keep
interest rates unchanged for the present, and will consider a possibility of reducing policy
interest rates only if NIR and NDA trends are consistent with meeting program targets and
the process of de-dollarization indicated by an increase in the rubel share of time deposits
continues.
10.
We will also tighten credit policy by keeping liquidity support provided by the NBRB
to banks to levels consistent with the targeted path of NDA (quantitative performance
criterion). To this end, no new government lending programs for 2009 will be adopted
through end-December 2009 (prior action) and any new lending programs for 2010 will be
discussed with IMF staff in the context of the third review of the SBA. We will impose a
limit on net lending under government programs at no more than 4 trillion rubels between
end-June and end-December 2009. This limit could be raised in consultation with the IMF
staff if additional foreign financing is received during 2009. We have also recommended that
banks limit credit to state-owned enterprises with high levels of inventories. These measures
would allow us to limit credit, while avoiding crowding out of market-based lending and will
also mitigate budgetary risks.
11.
Tightening credit policy will help us meet targeted levels of reserves, which would
continue to be reflected in NIR floors (quantitative performance criterion). In addition, we
will continue working with our bilateral and multilateral creditors to ensure timely
disbursements of all committed funds, while also exploring prospects for new financing. If it
appears that there are risks of missing the NIR targets for reasons other than insufficiently
tight monetary policy, we will make further use of exchange rate flexibility within the
±10 percent band.
III. FISCAL POLICY
12.
We remain committed to the balanced general government budget—including local
governments’ budgets and the Social Protection Fund, and excluding bank recapitalization
operations (up to minimum regulatory capital adequacy norms)—in 2009. Fiscal policy will
remain tight in 2010. The general government budget deficit will be kept within 2.7 trillion
rubels (1.7 percent of GDP). Fiscal performance will continue to be monitored by a ceiling
on the cash deficit of the general government (quantitative performance criterion).
13.
To ensure that we meet the end-September and end-December fiscal targets, we will
restrain spending, including on investment, while maintaining spending on health and
education and ensuring that arrears are not accumulated. We will also advise local

42
governments to contain their spending in line with the program. Any local spending in excess
of programmed levels would be offset by additional spending cuts by the central government.
If revenues exceed spending appropriations for line ministries, they will be allocated to the
Presidential Reserve Fund, and will be used to restore cuts in the originally approved budget,
primarily in public investment.
14.
We are also undertaking the following key steps to meet our target of zero-deficit
budget in 2009:


Maintaining tight wage policies. We decided to postpone a 5 percent increase of
budget sector wages from September 1 to November 1, 2009. We will increase
pensions in line with pension legislation, with an increase of up to 10 percent in 2009.



Reducing subsidies. We will reduce spending on subsidies and transfers—the largest
expenditure item in the budget—by cutting untargeted subsidies and transfers to
households and, more generally, subsidies to the economy.


Beginning from November 1 we will reduce fiscal subsidies by increasing
tariffs on household utilities by the equivalent of $5, or 9 percent, compared
with their current level.



We will also increase transportation tariffs by 18 percent from
November 1, 2009.

15.
The government will present for consideration of the President of the Republic of
Belarus a draft 2010 budget with a deficit of 2.7 trillion rubels (1.7 percent of GDP). The
government will also propose additional public investment for infrastructure and priority
projects, to be financed by an increase in the VAT rate from 18 to 21 percent.
16.

These proposals will allow us to pursue several fiscal priorities for 2010:



Keeping debt sustainable. A modest 2010 budget deficit, partly financed by
privatization proceeds, would add little to Belarus’s debt. We have begun reducing
government guarantees of commercial banks’ credit to alleviate contingent credit
risks.



Supporting economic recovery. We will revisit our spending priorities to create fiscal
space that would ensure adequate financing of our priorities, including investment in
human capital and infrastructure. To this end, in the first half of 2010 we will further
reduce fiscal subsidies on household utilities by increasing the communal service
tariffs by the equivalent of $10. We will enact the recently proposed decree
improving the targeting of selected social benefits, raising their level from
January 1, 2010. We will continue working with the World Bank on better targeting

43
of the social safety net which would allow us to further reduce untargeted subsidies
and transfers.


Continuing tax reforms. In the context of the 2010 budget we will eliminate the
turnover tax and the local tax on sales of goods in retail trade. We will continue
improving the tax system and develop the tax reform strategy based on the
recommendations of the FAD Technical Assistance mission on Tax Policy scheduled
for October 2009.

17.
We are planning to establish an agency that would facilitate leasing of equipment by
our exporters. We plan an initial capital injection of 400 billion rubels to set up this agency.
In accordance with internationally established practice, the initial capital injection will be
treated as a financing operation that will not increase the government deficit. To account for
the potential fiscal costs of default, we will appropriate as a contingency line in each year’s
budget an amount equivalent to the expected repayment of the agency’s leases in that year,
with the contingency line being reduced as payments are received.
IV. FINANCIAL SECTOR POLICIES
18.

We have been implementing measures to strengthen the financial system:



We have recently adopted a Memorandum of Understanding between the Ministry of
Finance, the Ministry of Economy, the NBRB and the new Agency for Deposit
Guarantee which formalized the institutional framework for dealing with a potential
financial crisis.



We have been working on bringing our loan classification and provisioning
requirements in line with best international practices (structural benchmark). We
have prepared amendments to the Instruction on the Procedures of Formation and
Use by Banks and Nonbank Credit and Financial Institutions of Reserves to Cover
Potential Losses for On- and Off-Balance Sheet Transactions which will be passed by
end-September 2009. The amendments will be enacted from the moment of their
publication, but the NBRB may grant some banks a transitional period to fully
implement these amendments until December 31, 2010. We will also address the
classification of loans with government guarantees issued before January 2009 by
either amending the NBRB instruction on these loans or by transferring these loans to
the agency (Para. 20).

19.
We have been working on reducing the government’s involvement in the financial
system by implementing measures already identified in the program, including the following:


Disengaging the NBRB from non-core business. In line with earlier program
commitments, NBRB’s direct or equity financing of non-financial organizations will
remain within the ceiling of 350 billion rubels in 2009. We will not extend new loans

44
to, or make equity investment in, non-financial organizations in 2010. Furthermore,
by end-December 2009 we will develop an action plan for sales to private investors of
all NBRB non-financial subsidiaries and associated companies.


Curbing directed lending function of the government. In line with our legislation
prohibiting the central and local governments from making any additional transfers to
their deposit accounts with commercial banks, we will transfer the existing stock of
these deposits back to NBRB accounts in line with the schedule for repayment of
corresponding loans. An exception will be made for certain central and local
government demand deposits held for operational purposes. We will continue to
refrain from approving any new directed lending programs financed with budget
deposits (structural benchmark).



Bank privatization. We identified a strategic investor for one bank, and selected an
international consultant to assist in preparing this bank for privatization. We will
continue to look for strategic investors to buy the majority shareholding in OJSC
Belinvestbank and minority holdings in JSSB Belarusbank and OJSC
Belagroprombank as soon as market conditions permit. We will engage qualified,
experienced and reputable consultants, on a competitive basis, to assist us in
preparing state-owned banks for partial or full privatization after strategic investors
have been identified (structural benchmark).

20.
We intend to establish an agency which would help clean up banks’ balance sheets.
The agency would take over government-directed loans which are classified as problem loans
and associated state funding from commercial banks, and eventually could supplement and
replace commercial banks as the source of financing government programs, with its new
lending included in the budget above the line. A draft decree on establishing the agency will
be submitted to the Head of State by end-November 2009. The draft decree envisages that
initially its activities will be limited to managing existing loans and the agency would not
engage in new lending. To capitalize the agency, we will transfer to agency government
deposits used to finance the transferred loans. This transfer and any residual capitalization
costs of the agency will be reflected below the line in the budget.
21.
We have no plans to further recapitalize state banks in 2009. The limit on credit under
government programs specified in paragraph 10 should prevent deterioration of liquidity
ratios at state-owned banks. The NBRB will ensure that state banks remain liquid by further
curtailing their ability to extend new loans if their liquidity ratios fall below the statutory
norms. Decisions on additional recapitalization on these banks shall be taken only in cases if
indicators of their safe functioning would fail to meet regulatory requirements and after
consultations with IMF staff. Should private banks become undercapitalized, we will use our
existing framework, including negotiations with shareholders, liquidation and nationalization
(supported by government resources), as appropriate, to rapidly resolve the issues.

45
22.
We have been striving towards maintaining independence of the NBRB. We will
ensure that no provisions are included that impair the independence of the NBRB in the draft
decree “On Improving Control (Supervisory) Activity in the Republic of Belarus” or in any
other legislation. Building on recommendations of the FSAP update and the Safeguards
Assessments, we will, by the end of 2009, prepare draft amendments and supplements to the
Statute of the NBRB approved by Decree of the President of the Republic of Belarus #320
dated June 13, 2001 with further amendments being introduced into the Banking Code to
ensure operational and financial independence of the NBRB (structural benchmark). In this
context we intend to seek assistance from the IMF.
23.
We recognize that the NBRB liquidity support to banks outside standard refinancing
facilities based on ad hoc decisions of the NBRB Board is distortionary and should be
provided only in exceptional circumstances. We will not extend new loans to banks at
interest rates below rates on standard refinancing facilities (e.g. Lombard auctions) except
credits for housing construction in the remainder of 2009 which are issued at the NBRB
refinancing rate under existing government programs. The NBRB will agree with the IMF by
end-December 2009 a schedule for phasing out refinancing of existing loans. In line with the
recommendations of the 2008 FSAP Update, we will adopt a formalized framework for the
provision of NBRB emergency liquidity assistance to banks, possibly using technical
assistance from the IMF's Monetary and Capital Markets Department.
24.
In line with the recommendations of the safeguards assessment the end-June
quantitative PCs relating to NIR and NDA have been audited by international accountants
and we will continue this practice until the end of the program.
V. POLICIES TO IMPROVE BUSINESS CLIMATE
25.
We have developed a legal framework for privatization to become competitive,
transparent and professionally executed. A draft Privatization Law incorporating comments
from the World Bank staff will be submitted to Parliament by September 30, 2009. A draft
decree on establishing a privatization agency has been prepared by the government and
taking into account comments from the World Bank and IMF staffs will be submitted to the
Head of State by September 30, 2009 (structural benchmark). To accelerate the process of
privatization we will identify five large SOEs as candidates for privatization by
November 30, 2009. After consultations with the World Bank staff this list will be submitted
to the Head of State for approval. We will work towards preparing controlling equity stakes
of these enterprises for sale through an open, international, transparent, and competitive
tender by February 28, 2010.
26.
We will step up our efforts to promote market-based economic growth. The Council
of Ministers will issue by end-December 2009, a recommendation to the line ministries and,
other government agencies in charge of economic activity, including local governments, not
to set any quantitative targets for 2010, such as output and employment targets, for the

46
companies that do not benefit from government’s financial support and in which the
government has a minority share (structural benchmark). We will refrain from the
application of mandatory wage policy to companies in which the government does not have
majority control. The government’s right in such companies will not extend beyond the rights
of all minority shareholders. We reaffirm our commitment to reduce the state regulation of
wages and prices. We have eliminated all instructions that are not consistent with our
commitment not to impose a general ceiling on monthly price increases. We will further
reduce the number of products subject to price controls and trade margins, consistent with
our understandings with the World Bank, and also refrain from announcing medium-term
wage targets.
Sincerely yours,

/s/
S.S. Sidorsky
Prime Minister
of the Republic of Belarus

BELARUS—TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING (TMU)
September 30, 2009
1.
This memorandum sets out the understandings between Belarus’s authorities and the
IMF staff regarding the definitions of performance criteria and prior action. The performance
criteria are reported in Table 2 of the Letter of Intent (LOI) dated September 30, 2009.
2.
The definitions of the performance criteria and the adjustment mechanisms, as well as
of the prior action, are described in Section I below. Reporting requirements are specified in
Section II.
3.
The exchange rates and the price of gold to be used for the purpose of monitoring the
program are in Table 1 of this attachment, and benchmarks for calculating the adjustors in
Table 2.
I. QUANTITATIVE TARGETS
A. Floor on Net International Reserves of the National Bank of the Republic of
Belarus (NBRB)
Definition
4.
Net international reserves (NIR) of the NBRB are defined as the difference between
gross international reserve assets and reserve liabilities, evaluated in U.S. dollars at the
program exchange rates (Table 1). Gross international reserve assets are defined as readily
available claims on nonresidents, denominated in foreign convertible currencies. They
include the NBRB’s holdings of monetary gold, SDRs, foreign currency cash, foreign
currency securities, deposits abroad, and the country’s reserve position at the Fund. Excluded
from gross international reserve assets are:


any assets denominated in foreign currencies held at, or which are claims on,
domestic institutions (i.e., institutions headquartered domestically, but located either
domestically or abroad, or institutions headquartered abroad, but located
domestically);



any precious metals or metal deposits, other than monetary gold, held by the NBRB;



any reserve assets that are: (i) encumbered; or (ii) pledged as collateral (in so far as
not already included in foreign liabilities); or (iii) frozen; and



any reserve assets that are not readily available for intervention in the foreign
exchange market, inter alia, because of lack of quality or lack of liquidity that limits
marketability at the book price.
For the purpose of this program, reserve liabilities comprise:

5.

51


all short-term liabilities of the NBRB vis-à-vis nonresidents with an original maturity
of one year or less;



all foreign exchange liabilities to resident entities (e.g. claims in foreign exchange of
domestic banks on the NBRB) excluding (i) foreign exchange liabilities to the general
government, to the Agency for Deposit Guarantee, and (ii) the NBRB’s foreign
exchange transitory accounts;



the stock of IMF credit outstanding; and



the nominal value of all derivative positions1 of the NBRB and government, implying
the sale of foreign currency or other reserve assets against domestic currency.

6.
For program monitoring purposes, the stock of foreign assets and foreign liabilities of
the NBRB shall be valued at program exchange rates, as described in paragraph 3 above.
On this basis, and consistent with the definition above, the stock of NIR amounted to
$2,541 million on November 30, 2008. In addition, a purchase from the IMF will be reflected
in the stock of IMF credit outstanding on the same day when the purchase is reflected in the
gross international reserves.
Adjustment mechanism
1.
The floor on the NIR of the NBRB is subject to an automatic adjustor, based on
deviations of external balance of payments support (defined as disbursements from bilateral
and multilateral creditors to the NBRB), or external Republican government2 budget support
and privatization proceeds from program projections (Table 2 of the LOI).
A. If the proceeds from external balance of payments support to the NBRB (in U.S. dollars
evaluated at program exchange rates):
a) cumulatively exceeds program projections, the floor on the NIR of the NBRB will be
adjusted upward by 100 percent of the excess in external balance of payments support;
and
b) in any quarter falls short of program projections, the floor on the NIR of the NBRB will
be adjusted downward by 100 percent of the shortfall in that quarter, 50 percent of the
shortfall in the previous quarter. Disbursements in excess of its programmed level in any
quarter, will be fully applied to reduce the shortfall for the previous quarter in calculating
the adjusted target.

1

This refers to the notional value of the commitments, not the market value.

2

As defined in paragraph 12 below.

52
B. If the proceeds from external Republican government budget support and external
privatization proceeds (valued in U.S. dollars at program exchange rates):
cumulatively exceed program projections, the floor on the NIR of the NBRB will be
adjusted upwards by 50 percent of the excess in external budget support and privatization
proceeds; and
in any quarter falls short of program projections, the floor on the NIR of the NBRB will
be adjusted downward by 100 percent of the shortfall in that quarter, and 50 percent of the
shortfall in the previous quarter. Disbursements in excess of its programmed level in any
quarter, will be fully applied to reduce the shortfall for the previous quarter in calculating
the adjusted target.
2.
If Belarus participates in any SDR allocation(s) between March 31, 2009 and any
subsequent test dates, the NIR target will be adjusted upwards by 100 percent of the
equivalent of the amount of the cumulative additional SDR allocation(s) up to the test date,
measured at program exchange rates.
B. Ceiling on Net Domestic Assets of the NBRB
Definition
9.
Net domestic assets (NDA) of the NBRB is defined as the difference between the
NBRB’s monetary base, as defined by the NBRB’s methodology as of March 31, 2009, and
NIR. The NIR of the NBRB is defined as in paragraph 4 above.
10.
Performance against the NDA target will be measured at program exchange rates. On
this basis, and consistent with the definition above, the NBRB’s NDA amounted to RBL
2,112 billion on November 30, 2008.
Adjustment mechanism
11.
The ceiling on the NDA of the NBRB is subject to an automatic adjustor, based on
adjustment of the NIR of the NBRB, as stipulated in paragraphs 7 and 8 above.

53
C. Ceiling on the Cash Deficit of the General Government
Definitions
12.
The general government includes the Republican government and local governments.
The Republican government is defined as the central government ministries, the funds
included in the Republican budget, including the National Development Fund and the Social
Protection Fund. In case the government establishes new extrabudgetary funds, they will be
integrated into the Republican government.
13.
The cash deficit of the general government will be measured from the financing side
as the sum of (i) net domestic financing from banks and nonbanks, (ii) net external financing,
and (iii) privatization receipts.
(i) Net domestic financing consists of bank and nonbank financing to the general
government and will be defined as follows:
i.

The change in the claims on the general government of commercial banks minus the
change in deposits held by the general government in commercial banks, net of
revaluation effect for foreign currency deposits.

ii.

The change in the claims on the general government of the NBRB minus the change
in deposits of the general government held at the NBRB in RBLs and foreign
currency, net of revaluation effect for foreign currency deposits.

iii.

Net claims on the general government of the commercial banks and the NBRB will be
monitored based on the monetary survey prepared by the NBRB.

iv.

Also included are any other liability instruments issued by the general government,
for example, promissory notes, any other increase in liability of the general
government to domestic nonbank institutions.

v.

Net sales of Treasury bills, bonds, or other government securities to nonbank
institutions and households (including nonresidents and nonresident financial
institutions), plus any other increase in liability of the general government to
domestic nonbank institutions.

(ii) Net external financing is defined as:
i.

Total of loans disbursed to the general government for general budget support and
project financing, the change in the stock of outstanding international bonds, net
change in external arrears, change in the accounts of the Republican government

54
abroad, minus amortization. Amortization includes all external debt-related payments
of principal by the general government.
ii.

Amortization to external creditors via third parties is accounted for at the time and in
the amount of payment by the budget to the third party, rather than at the time of
recognition of amortization by the external creditor.

(iii) Privatization receipts:
i.

The privatization receipts of the general government consist of all transfers of monies
received by the Ministry of Finance in connection with the sale of general
government assets, including privatization proceeds, which were transferred to the
National Development Fund.

ii.

This includes receipts from the sales of shares, the sale of assets and the sale of
licenses with duration of 10 years and longer.

14.
For the purposes of measuring the deficit of the general government, all flows to/from
the budget in foreign currency will be converted into RBLs at the official exchange rate
prevailing at close of business on the date of the transaction. On this basis, and consistent
with the definition above, the cash deficit of the general government in the first half of 2009
amounted to 961 billion rubels.
Adjustment mechanism
15.
The ceilings on the cash deficit of the general government for end-September and
end-December are subject to automatic adjustors, based on deviations of external budget and
project support from program projections (Table 2 of the LOI). If the total proceeds from
external budget and project support (excluding from international financial institutions and
projects initiated before the original program) to the general government budget (in RBLs
converted at the official exchange rate on the days of its receipt):


Cumulatively exceed program projections, the ceiling on the cash deficit of the
general government will be adjusted upwards by 50 percent of the excess in budget
and project support to the government.



Cumulatively falls short of program projections, the ceiling on the cash deficit of the
general government will be adjusted downward by 50 percent of the shortfall in the
previous quarter, if any. Disbursements in excess of its programmed level in any
quarter, will be fully applied to reduce the shortfall, if any, for the previous quarter in
calculating the adjusted target.

55


For project support from international financial institutions, if disbursements in
foreign currency exceed (fall short of) program projections, the ceiling on the cash
deficit of the general government will be adjusted upwards (down) by 100 percent of
the excess (shortfall) in project support.



For project support for projects initiated before the original program was approved,
the ceiling on the cash deficit of the general government will be adjusted upwards by
100 percent of the excess in project support. The adjustor for such projects is capped
at $353 million.

16.
The ceiling on the cash deficit of the general government is also subject to an
automatic adjustor for recapitalization of banks. Specifically, the ceiling on the deficit will be
adjusted upward for the amount of funds provided by the Republican budget to banks to
bring their regulatory capital to minimum statutory levels.
17.
Total annual adjustor for higher-than-programmed international financial assistance,
including project support for projects initiated before the original program was approved, is
capped at 1.8 percent of GDP.
18.
The ceiling on the cash deficit of the general government is also subject to an
automatic adjustor for local governments’ deficit financed with surpluses accumulated
in 2008. Total annual adjustor for the deficits of local governments is capped at RBL
1.4 trillion.
D. Continuous Performance Criteria on Nonaccumulation of External Arrears
19.
During the period of arrangement, the Republican government and the NBRB will not
accumulate any new external payments arrears on debt service obligations to official
creditors. Official external payment arrears are defined as unpaid debt service by the
Republican government and the NBRB beyond 30 days after the due date. The performance
criterion on nonaccumulation of external arrears is continuous.
E. Prior Action on Suspension of New Lending under Government Programs
20.
The prior action on suspension of new government lending programs for 2009 will be
deemed to be satisfied after the Presidium of the Council of Ministers makes a relevant
decision confirmed by the minutes of its meeting.

Safeguards Assessments:

Voluntary (non-program related) assessment of the NBRB was completed in April 2004. The
assessment concluded that significant vulnerabilities existed in the safeguards framework,
especially in the areas of the legal structure and independence, external and internal audit, and
in financial reporting. The assessment made specific recommendations to correct the identified
shortcomings.
An update assessment of the NBRB, which was completed in May 2009 in connection with the
Stand-By Arrangement approved on January 12, 2009, found little progress in addressing
previously identified vulnerabilities. The assessment determined that risks have increased
since the voluntary 2004 assessment and recommended the following measures:






Adopting a new law that provides operational and financial independence for the
NBRB to ensure the effectiveness of the NBRB’s internal and external audit
mechanisms and the control systems,
Conducting special audits of NIR and NDA data to reduce the risk of misreporting,
Divesting the NBRB’s investment in non-financial subsidiaries, and
Publishing the audited IFRS financial statements.

The NBRB is taking steps to address the weaknesses. Special audits of NIR and NDA data for
March and June 2009 test dates were completed.
VIII.

Exchange Arrangements:

As of August 20, 1994, the rubel became the unit of account replacing the Belarusian ruble,
which was formally recognized as the sole legal tender only on May 18, 1994. The conversion
took place at the rate of 10 Belarusian rubles = 1 rubel. The authorities decided to drop three
zeroes from the rubel denomination as of January 1, 2000. The exchange rate for the
U.S. dollar was BYR 2,200 on December 31, 2008.
In mid-September 2000, the official exchange rate was unified with the market-determined
rate resulting from daily auctions at the Belarus Currency and Stock Exchange. Since then, the
official rate on any day is equal to the closing rate of the previous trading day. On
January 1, 2008 the exchange rate was set in the framework of horizontal corridor for the
U.S. dollar around central parity. The earlier arrangement, introduced in 2006, entailed
reference to two horizontal corridors around central parity for the Russian ruble (±4 percent)
and U.S. dollar (±2.5 percent).
On January 2, 2009, the rubel was pegged to a basket of currencies including the U.S. dollar,
the euro, and the Russian ruble (equal weights), with fluctuation margins of ±5 percent. The
margins were widened to ±10 percent in June 2009. The current regime is classified as pegged

4
exchange rate within horizontal band.
On November 5, 2001, Belarus accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of
the IMF’s Articles of Agreement. During the same month, the NBB suspended all ad hoc
exemptions from the 30 percent surrender requirement. Based on currently available
information, Belarus does not maintain exchange restrictions or multiple currency practices.
IX.

UFR/Article IV Consultation:

Belarus is on a 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation was concluded
on June 4, 2007.
Stand-By Arrangement. A 15-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) in the amount of
SDR 1.6 billion (US$2.5 billion, 418.8 percent of quota) was approved by the Executive Board
(IMF Country Report 09/109) on January 12, 2009. An augmentation of the SBA was
approved on June 29, 2009 in conjunction with the completion of the first review (IMF
Country Report 09/260), bringing the Fund’s financial support to SDR 2.3 billion
(US$3.5 billion, 587.3 percent of quota). Total disbursements under the program so far amount
to SDR 955.7 million (about US$1.5 billion).
Article IV consultation and 2nd review of the SBA mission. A staff team comprising
Messrs. Jarvis (head), Ding, and Kovtun (all EUR), Ms. Mitra (SPR), Mr. Prokopenko (MCM)
and Mr. Wane (FAD) visited Minsk during August 18–September 2. The team met with the
Prime Minister, Mr. Sidorsky; the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr. Kobyakov; the Governor of the
National Bank of the Republic of Belarus, Mr. Prokopovich; the Minister of Finance,
Mr. Kharkovec; the Deputy Minister of Economy, Mrs. Starchenko, and other senior officials.
Mr. Belka (EUR) and Mr. Kiekens (OED) participated in the policy meetings for the
Article IV Consultation discussions. Ms. Koliadina, the Resident Representative, assisted the
mission.

ANNEX II. BELARUS: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
The World Bank Group Strategy
1.
The recent WBG Country Assistance Strategy for Belarus for FY 2008-2011 was
approved on December 4, 2007. The FY08-11 CAS envisioned a modest but a scaled-up
engagement with Belarus, including up to USD 100 million in annual lending volumes to
support the country in addressing global environment and energy challenges, enhancing the
competitiveness of its economy to assure rising incomes, and protecting the welfare of the
most vulnerable. Analytic and advisory work comprised a core element of the program. To
date, the Bank’s lending commitments in Belarus total US$443 million, with US$18 million
provided as grants.
2.
The IFC strategy aimed at providing advisory services and investment operations to
foster private sector development. The IFC advisory services focus on reforms of business
registration, permits, and the system of inspections, while retaining flexibility to respond to
other government requests to improve the business environment. Outstanding IFC
investments in Belarus total approximately US$200 million; divided almost equally between
financial markets and the real sector.
3.
The economic and political developments over the past two years, however, have
provided the opportunity to enter into a much deeper engagement and reform dialogue with
the Belarusian authorities. Given the impact of the global financial crisis, and the
commitment of the government to deepen and accelerate structural reforms to improve
competitiveness and growth, the CAS Progress Report (CASPR) has been prepared (planned
for Board presentation in November 2009), proposing to double annual lending volumes for
the two remaining fiscal years of the CAS and to include development policy lending
together with investment lending to support the following three pillars of the revised CAS
structure: Delivering Global and Local Public Goods; Entry, Regulatory Reform and
Competitiveness; and Public Sector Efficiency and Fiscal Discipline. IFC’s investments will
continue to focus on financial markets, general manufacturing, and agribusiness sectors and
expected to reach about US$80 million per year.
IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
4.
The Bank and the Fund teams work closely in calibrating and delivering their
assistance. The IMF plays a key role at the macro level, while the World Bank focuses on the
structural agenda, energy efficiency, social and environmental issues. The Bank and the Fund
teams carry out various joint activities. The joint work on the Public Expenditure Review
(PER), Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), and the Country Economic
Memorandum (CEM) are examples of excellent cooperation between the two institutions.
Discussions under the IMF SBA and preparation of the first EBRD Development policy loan
are the most recent examples of close cooperation and coordination between the Bank and
the Fund.
Areas in Which the World Bank Leads
5.
Structural and social issues, private business development. The Bank focuses its
analytical work on structural reforms and on those issues that are most critical to reducing
risks to the population posed by transition and external shocks. The Belarus Economic Policy

7
Notes (forthcoming in FY10) focuses on new/potential sources of recovery and sustained
growth, particularly evaluating the drivers of productivity growth, product diversification,
export sophistication, and labor market issues. The Bank completed recently the Agriculture
Competitiveness Study, which analyzes the impact of state control on competitiveness,
productivity and growth in the agriculture sector. The Bank provided TA and advice in the
area of social assistance and social protection during FY08-09 and will continue doing so in
FY10. The Bank also provided TA to support the Government’s privatization efforts. Other
planned ESW include a review of energy and heating tariff reform; a study of environmental
standards and pricing reform in water and sanitation, providing recommendations on
institutional reform in this sector; and a Transport Sector Review. The IFC delivers an active
advisory program around challenges facing the private sector and international “best
practices” for improving the business regulatory environment.
6.
Energy sector. Currently, two energy efficiency projects are being implemented in
Belarus with the World Bank’s financial support: the Post Chernobyl Recovery Project
(US$50 million) and the Additional Financing for the Social Infrastructure Retrofitting
Project (SIRP) (US$15 million). A new energy sector project (US$125 million) was
approved in May 2009.
7.
Environment. The Bank supports Belarus’ efforts in strengthening its environment
institutions, addressing key public health challenges, and complying with its international
commitments. Two TA projects are currently under implementation: (i) the IDF Grant for
Enhancing Institutional and Legal Framework for Environmental Permitting in Belarus
(US$440,000); and (ii) the GEF Grant (US$285,000) for preparation of the full-size
Persistent Organic Pollutant (POPs) Stockpile Management and Technical/Institutional
Capacity Upgrading Project. The Water Supply and Sanitation Project (US$60 million) to
finance investments in well field development and rehabilitation, water treatment,
distribution network rehabilitation, and wastewater treatment was approved in FY09 and
Solid Waste Management Project (US$60 million) is expected to be approved in FY10.
Areas of Shared Responsibility
8.
Macroeconomic development. The Bank’s team cooperated closely with the IMF
during preparation of the 2005 Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) and jointly prepared
the chapter “Macroeconomic Policies and Risks”. The Bank experts took an active part in the
seminar on the Sources of Belarus’ Long-Term Growth in August 2009 (organized jointly by
the NBRB and the IMF) and agreed on the continuation of this practice in the future.
9.
Public expenditure management. The IMF and the Bank provide continuous
technical assistance to Belarus in public expenditure management. In 2007 the Bank prepared
two policy notes in selected issues in public finance, which covered major issues in
intergovernmental fiscal relations and capital budgeting. Belarus became a member of the
Public Expenditure Management Peer Learning Program (PEMPAL) in 2006 and has
benefited from participation in various events for practitioners in budget policy, treasury, and
audit. IMF technical assistance missions support PFM improvement, ranging from treasury,
budget classification, fiscal ROSC, tax policy to MTEF and program budgeting. In FY 09
the Bank completed the first Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA)
assessment for Belarus. Moving forward, and with the aim to tackle the vast fiscal and

8
structural challenges, which are fully intertwined in the reform agenda in Belarus, a
Programmatic Public Expenditure Review has been initiated in FY10.
10.
Debt management. A Bank diagnostic mission to identify the needs of the Ministry
of Finance in debt management and debt market development, to evaluate the current debt
management strategy and practices, and to assist in designing a plan for their upgrading took
place in FY09. The mission findings were built on the findings of the IMF TA earlier
missions in debt management and in access to capital markets.
11.
Financial sector. The FSAP Update was prepared jointly by the Bank and the Fund
in 2008. It provided valuable insights on the key vulnerabilities in the financial sector and
reforms needed, which form the basis of the follow-up dialogue under the IMF SBA
program. In FY10, the Bank will continue financial sector monitoring jointly with the IMF.
Areas in Which the IMF Leads
12.
The IMF is actively engaged with the authorities in discussing the macroeconomic
framework, providing technical assistance and related support, including support on
economic and financial statistics, tax policy, monetary operations, and fiscal transparency.
The IMF is leading the dialogue on setting the objectives for monetary and exchange rate
policies, public debt management, overall budget envelope, and tax policy. However, the
IMF and Bank staffs collaborate extensively in the preparation of the macroeconomic
framework and prepare the debt sustainability analysis jointly.
13.
The IMF analysis in these areas serves as an input to the Bank policy advice. The
Bank and the IMF teams have regular consultations, and the Bank staff takes part in the IMF
Article IV Consultations and the SBA review missions. This helps to ensure consistency of
policy recommendations by the two institutions.

ANNEX III. BELARUS— STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of October 2, 2009
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General:
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance, although
macroeconomic analysis is encumbered in some areas. The authorities have continued to
make improvements over the past several years in a number of key areas, with technical
assistance from the Fund.
National Accounts:
Quarterly national accounts are compiled in accordance with the System of National Accounts
of 1993 (1993SNA), using the production, expenditure and income approaches, covering the
entire economic territory of the Republic of Belarus. GDP estimates are likely to be
underestimated due to underreporting of newly emerging sectors—particularly services—and
an active informal sector.
Government finance statistics:
Government finance statistics are compiled in broad compliance with the recommendations
of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). In FY2010, a STA
technical assistance mission is planned to assist the authorities in improving the collection of
primary fiscal data, and processing in line with the GSFM 2001 methodology.
Monetary statistics:
Following STA technical assistance mission in October 2005, the NBRB compiles monetary
statistics according to the methodology of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. The
NBRB reports monetary data to STA using the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs)
framework.
External sector statistics:
The NBRB publishes quarterly balance of payments and international investment position
statements in the BPM5 format. Overall the timeliness and serviceability of external sector
data is satisfactory.

Statement by the Staff Representative on the Republic of Belarus
October 21, 2009

1.
This statement reports on key developments since the staff report was
finalized. The new information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
On the basis of preliminary data, the performance criteria for end-September
appear to have been met. Based on preliminary data, NIR exceeded the adjusted target by
$150 million, and NDA was 494 billion rubels below the adjusted target. The adjusted target
for the fiscal deficit is also likely to have been met based on the revenue and expenditure
pattern in recent months.
3.
The authorities took several actions in recent weeks in accordance with their
Letter of Intent:


The Presidium of the Council of Ministers decided on October 14 to suspend the
adoption of new government lending programs through end-2009 (prior action).



The Board of the NBRB adopted a resolution on September 23 to bring loan
classification and provisioning requirements in line with the FSAP recommendations
(end-September structural benchmark).



The draft decree on establishing a Privatization Agency was submitted to the Head of
State on September 30 (end-September structural benchmark). The draft Privatization
Law incorporating comments from the World Bank staff was sent to the Parliament
on the same day.



The Presidium of the Council of Ministers approved on September 27 the draft 2010
budget with a deficit capped at 2.7 trillion rubels. The draft budget proposes an
increase in the VAT rate from 18 to 20 percent.

4.
World Bank and EU financing for 2009 is proceeding as expected, with a change
proposed in the composition of other official financing.


The authorities are on track to receive $200 million from the World Bank. They
adopted the draft decree on control (supervision) on October 16, thereby meeting a
prior action under the World Bank’s policy Development Loan.

2


Discussions on the authorities’ request for Macro-Financial Assistance from the EU
in the amount of about $290 million are proceeding as planned.



The Russian authorities recently proposed to replace the final $500 million tranche of
a $2 billion bilateral loan with a loan of the same amount from the Eurasian
Economic Community’s anti-crisis fund. Parliamentary ratification of Belarus’s
participation in this fund is expected in early November. The Belarusian authorities
have indicated that if at the time of discussions on the third review of the SBA in
early November there is evidence that securing a loan from the anti-crisis fund is
likely to be delayed beyond the end of 2009 they would be prepared to take
contingency measures beyond those identified in the Letter of Intent to close the
financing gap during the remainder of the program. The authorities have indicated
that they are prepared to take a package of measures including selling national assets
to increase official reserves and realizing fiscal savings (the authorities have used
both of these measures already to meet the end-September performance criteria
notwithstanding the delay in disbursement of the Russian loan) and allowing greater
exchange rate flexibility within the current band. The staff estimates that these
measures could produce savings of about $500 million over the remainder of the
program period, though as not all of these would materialize by end-December a
small modification of the end-December NIR and NDA performance criteria might
also be proposed at the time of the next review.

5.
Recent economic data are consistent with the analysis in the staff report. GDP
declined by 0.3 percent year-on-year in the first nine months. Twelve-month CPI inflation
fell further to 11.7 percent in September. Incoming data suggest an improvement in the
export volume, providing support that could result in slightly higher output than projected in
the staff report. However, the external current account will remain weak, reflecting a further
fall in export prices, as well as other developments elaborated in the staff report. The outlook
for 2010 is broadly unchanged from the projection in the staff report.

Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 09/135
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 15, 2009

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009
Article IV Consultation with Belarus
On October 21, 2009 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Belarus.1
Background
Belarus had experienced rapid growth in the ten years up to 2008, benefiting from export
price gains, strong growth in trading partners, and large energy subsidies from Russia. The
reversal of these factors in the course of 2008 put Belarus in a highly vulnerable position at
the outset of the global economic crisis, and an IMF-supported program was approved in
early 2009 to facilitate adjustment to external shocks and reduce vulnerability.
Belarus has so far escaped a significant fall in output, despite a sharp fall in external
demand. GDP declined 0.5 percent year-on-year in the first eight months of 2009,
comparing favorably to Belarus’s main trading partners. Economic activity has been
bolstered by strong domestic demand, especially housing construction financed under
government programs. Twelve-month CPI inflation fell to 12.5 percent in August, as the
impact of the negative output gap eclipsed the effects of exchange rate depreciation and
utility price adjustment early in the year.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2

The current account deficit has widened, reflecting weak external demand as well as terms
of trade losses. The deficit was partially offset by net financial inflows, including privatization
proceeds, trade credits, and government borrowing. Currency substitution, which accounted
for large reserve loss at the beginning of the year, came to a halt in early June and has
been partially reversed since. Gross international reserves have begun to recover after
falling below $3 billion in late August, boosted by the recent SDR allocations.
Fiscal adjustment remains strong and on track, with further revenue shortfalls being offset
by spending restraint. The effects of the crisis continue to be felt, especially through lower
profit tax and excise revenue. The authorities have responded with cuts in expenditures for
goods and services and “other expenditures”.
However, lending under government programs continued to increase at a high rate. In the
first half of 2009, gross disbursements under government programs were some 40 percent
higher than in the corresponding period of 2008. The share of such lending in overall credit
to economy increased from 33 percent in December 2008 to 38 percent in July 2009. This
lending helped propel high rates of investment and domestic demand and therefore
contributed to the loss of reserves. Banks’ involvement in such lending increased their
vulnerability to liquidity risks although financial soundness indicators remain broadly
satisfactory.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors observed that Belarus had managed to avoid a severe output
contraction, with real GDP declining only marginally despite a sharp fall in external demand
for its exports. The Fund-supported program has contributed to this cushioning of the output
decline. The prospects for high, sustainable growth over the long term will depend critically
on the depth and the pace of market-oriented structural reforms.
Directors noted with concern the continued high current account deficit and the lower
reserve level, which were due in part to the aggressive expansion of credit under
government programs. They encouraged the authorities to phase out gradually central bank
liquidity support to banks on non-market terms under these programs and to address
vulnerabilities in state-owned banks. Directors agreed that priority should be given to the
objectives of building reserves and supporting the exchange rate regime, and therefore
endorsed the authorities’ plan to restrain credit for the remainder of the year, accompanied
by strong fiscal and monetary policies. In this context, Directors supported the intention to
maintain high interest rates until there is clear evidence of a turnaround in reserves and a
well-established process of de-dollarization.

3

Directors applauded the authorities’ commitment to a tight fiscal policy, with revenue
shortfalls being offset by spending restraint while protecting priority social spending. The
decision to postpone the increase in public sector wages and to increase charges for
transportation and utilities would help rein in spending. Directors considered that limiting the
consolidated budget deficit to the equivalent of 1.7 percent of GDP in 2010 provides a
strong basis for a macroeconomic framework consistent with the objectives of increasing
reserves and containing inflation.
Directors noted the staff assessment that the real effective exchange rate and exchange
rate regime appear to be broadly appropriate based on agreed tight domestic policies. They
generally supported the recommendation to permit more flexibility within the widened band
as needed to ensure that the target for international reserves is met. Over the medium term,
consideration could be given to moving toward a more flexible exchange rate regime.
Directors welcomed progress on financial sector reforms, including bringing loan
classification and provisioning requirements in line with international practice, and improving
the framework for crisis preparedness. They encouraged further efforts to increase the
commercial orientation of banks and to develop nonbank financial institutions, thereby
promoting efficient allocation of resources. Directors welcomed plans to disengage the
central bank from non-core business and to enhance its independence more broadly.
Directors noted several external constraints that are likely to hinder a return to precrisis high
growth rates. It will therefore be important that Belarus pursue an ambitious structural
reform strategy aimed at generating new sources of growth and improving the business
climate. Privatization would play an important part in easing external financing constraints
and promoting technological development. Further measures are also needed to reduce the
burden of regulation and quantitative targets on the private sector. Directors encouraged the
authorities to avoid recourse to additional administrative controls in response to the crisis.
Directors emphasized the importance of securing sufficient financial resources from the
international community in support of Belarus’ reform efforts. They welcomed the
authorities’ commitment to implement contingency measures to avoid having a financing
gap.

Press Release No.09/363
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
October 21, 2009

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Completes Second Review Under Stand-By Arrangement,
Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with Belarus
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the second
review of Belarus’s performance under an economic program supported by a Stand-By
Arrangement (SBA). This decision enables the disbursement of SDR 437.93 million (about
US$699.5 million), bringing total disbursements under the program so far to about SDR 1.4
billion (about US$2.23 billion).
The original 15-month SBA was approved on January 12, 2009 (see Press Release No.
09/05). Financial support was subsequently increased to SDR 2.27 billion (about US$3.63
billion) on June 29, 2009 (see Press Release 09/241).
The Executive Board also concluded the 2009 Article IV consultation with Belarus. A Public
Information Notice and the staff report will be published in due course.
Following the Executive Board's discussion on Belarus, Mr. Takatoshi Kato, Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“Belarus has made good progress in adjusting its policies in response to the global crisis.
Despite a substantial decline in exports, the economic contraction has been modest relative to
other crisis-hit countries. Exchange rate adjustment has helped reduce external
vulnerabilities, with the present exchange regime providing a buffer against external shocks.
The adjustment has been supported by a tight fiscal policy, with revenue shortfalls offset by
spending cuts, and by an interest rate policy that has kept market rates high in real terms.
“Nevertheless, the strategy of expanding credit under various government programs, while
helping to cushion the impact of the crisis on output, put pressure on the external position.
The authorities are committed to a tight credit policy, with a view to reducing the current
account deficit and pressure on international reserves. The decision to limit lending under

2

government programs in the remainder of 2009 will help contain domestic demand and
support the stabilization efforts.
“The authorities have made important progress in their structural reform agenda aimed at
improving the business climate and facilitating private sector development. Privatization will
play an important part in easing external financing constraints and promoting technological
development. The planned setting-up of a Privatization Agency is on track. Reducing the
burden of regulation and quantitative targets on the private sector, as well as increasing the
commercial orientation of banks, will promote more efficient allocation of resources. It will
be important to protect vulnerable groups and enhance the effectiveness of the social safety
net.
“The authorities have also progressed well on financial sector reforms, including bringing
loan classification and provisioning requirements in line with international practice and
improving the framework for crisis preparedness. The commitments to disengage the central
bank from non-core business and to enhance its independence are welcome.
“Securing sufficient financial resources from the international community is essential for
Belarus’ reform efforts. In this context, the authorities stand ready to implement contingency
measures should a financing gap emerge.”
