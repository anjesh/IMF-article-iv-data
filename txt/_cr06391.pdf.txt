REPUBLIC OF POLAND
Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the
2006 Consultation with the Republic of Poland
Approved by Michael Deppler and Adnan Mazarei
August 23, 2006

The discussions for the 2006 Article IV consultation were held in Warsaw during
May 8–22, 2006. The mission met the Ministers of Finance, Labor and Social Policy,
and Regional Development, the chairperson of Parliament’s Public Finance
Commission, the President of the National Bank of Poland (NBP), members of the
Monetary Policy Council (MPC), other senior officials, and private sector
representatives and academics.
The staff team comprised Ms. Schadler (head), Mr. Klingen, Mr. Lissovolik,
Ms. Tamirisa, and Ms. Allard (all EUR). Messrs. Raczko (Alternate Executive
Director), Piątkowski (Advisor to the Executive Director), Rosenberg (Senior Regional
Representative), and Sierhej (Regional Representative’s office) participated in some of
the discussions.
The mission overlapped with an FSAP update mission, the findings of which were
discussed with the authorities during the Article IV consultation.
The authorities released the mission’s concluding statement and intend to publish this
staff report. Last year’s Article IV staff report was published as IMF Country
Report No. 05/263 following the IMF Executive Board Meeting on July 22, 2005.
Poland’s statistical database is adequate for surveillance. The quality of quarterly
national accounts and general government statistics needs improvement.
Poland has accepted the obligations of Article VIII and maintains an exchange system
free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. In
accordance with UN Security Council resolutions and EU Regulations, Poland
maintains exchange restrictions for purposes of national and international security
specified in Appendix I.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background: In the last five years, economic performance failed to live up to the promise of
Poland’s early reform record. This reflected a second wave of enterprise restructuring, a
large government sector, lagging openness to trade—along with less measurable factors such
as insufficient competition, a relatively large farming sector, poor infrastructure, and ructious
policies. Nonetheless, since mid-2005, cyclical factors, the benefits of EU membership, and
the impetus from earlier enterprise restructuring have been producing an economic upswing.
Outlook: Barring policy missteps or a change in the global economic outlook, prospects for
this year and next are strong, with growth projected at 5 and 4½ percent, respectively. The
improved outlook for western Europe, reduced labor shedding from enterprise restructuring,
strong profits, and the many benefits from EU membership should maintain the momentum
of the economy. Resource constraints are not binding with inflation at around 1 percent, still
high unemployment, and the current account deficit hovering around 2 percent of GDP.
However, it is unclear whether there is political support for an economic reform agenda that
would lock in strong economic performance for the medium term.
Policy Discussions
Public finances remain a challenge in many regards (vulnerabilities from high and rising
public debt, large fiscal deficits clouding euro adoption prospects, and high tax rates
distorting incentives). The authorities intend to meet the challenge by capping the headline
state budget deficit at PLN 30 billion while reducing tax rates. Staff pushed for more
ambitious consolidation—a goal that can be achieved sustainably only if social entitlements
and administrative costs are tackled, revenue losses from tax reform contained, and populist
spending pressures resisted.
Monetary policy needs no tightening well into the upswing, since inflation is projected to
continue to run below target until end-2007, staff and most Monetary Policy Council (MPC)
members agreed. Some, however, were concerned about a possibly quicker rebound of
inflation as one-off factors dissipate and wage pressures build.
Structural reforms and improvements of Poland’s poor business environment are key to
underwrite strong medium-term performance. The authorities and staff agreed that full and
efficient use of increasingly available EU funds, reductions of payroll taxes, and lowering tax
compliance costs were priorities. Staff pushed for broadening the agenda to also include
privatization, steps toward enhancing product market competition, and improving incentives
to work through targeting social benefits better. The authorities expressed some reluctance
about diminishing the state’s role in the economy or cutting benefits.
The financial sector was found in good health by the overlapping FSAP update mission,
although rapid growth of foreign currency mortgages required monitoring. Staff expressed
grave concern about the planned reorganization of financial sector supervision that risked
politicizing its operations. The government pressed ahead regardless, with severely deficient
draft legislation meanwhile passed by the Lower House of Parliament.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Benefiting from EU accession and improving growth prospects for western
Europe, Poland is rebounding from a half decade of subpar growth. Barring policy
missteps or a change in the global economic environment, the near-term outlook for growth,
inflation, and the external position is favorable. Beyond 2006-07, however, a decisive break
with past underperformance is likely to hinge on the government’s ability to maximize gains
from EU membership (particularly to use EU transfers fully and efficiently and attract
complementary private investment) and move ahead with macroeconomic, structural, and
institutional reforms. Early euro adoption, with strong supporting policies, could also
significantly bolster growth prospects.
2.
The political support for such an agenda is unclear. The Law and Justice Party
that won last fall’s parliamentary and presidential elections campaigned on a platform of
social justice, anticorruption, traditional Polish values, and skepticism about free-market
efficiency. Following a short-lived attempt to run a minority government, it formed a
coalition in April with two smaller parties—Self-Defense and League of Polish Families.
Economic policy and prospects for reform remain uncertain, as the government tries to
straddle conflicting objectives amid high turnover of key policy makers. A major reshuffle of
government, in which the Prime Minister and Finance Minister changed, occurred after the
mission. The new authorities have committed to the existing policy program.
II. BACKGROUND
3.
From 2001 to 2005, economic performance has not lived up to the promise of
Poland’s early reform record. In the 1990s, growth surpassed that in other transition
countries, but since then has disappointed. In part, this has reflected the costs of a second
wave of restructuring, particularly in the export-oriented manufacturing sector, and attendant
job destruction and wage moderation. But lagging openness to foreign trade, slow growth in

trading partners, and a large government also held back performance.1 Less measurable
features—policies that stifle competition (especially sizable state ownership and a stilldeveloping legal system), a large, low-productivity farming sector, poor infrastructure, and
ructious politics—probably also played a role. Thus, while benefiting from successful
disinflation and protected from key external vulnerabilities by small current account deficits,
a floating exchange rate, and sizable external reserves, Poland trailed most other NMS in
income convergence, investment (including FDI), and employment.
4.
Nevertheless, by mid-2005, cyclical influences alongside the benefits from EU
accession and impetus from the restructured manufacturing sector produced an
economic upswing. Output has expanded at an annualized rate of almost 6 percent since
mid-2005 despite restrictive macroeconomic policies. Following a pickup in investment
growth in early 2004, export growth has strengthened on the back of solid competitiveness
and improving prospects in the euro area and in countries to the east. And, as prolonged net
labor shedding ended, private consumption picked up with a short lag. Supply-side
developments have been particularly strong in the externally exposed manufacturing sector.
There, employment is rising strongly, profitability is robust, and exports are steadily
climbing the technology ladder.2

During March 2005-March 2006, the
MPC cut policy rates by 250 bps, to
4 percent. Nonetheless, overall
monetary conditions tightened during
2005 as the zloty appreciated and falling
inflation added to real interest rates.
With the weakening of the zloty in
2006, monetary conditions have
stabilized.

policy has been neutral so far this year.

6.
Resource constraints have not been tested. Domestic savings are low by regional
standards, but investment, even with the recent pickup, is lower still, and the current account
deficit hovers around 2 percent of GDP. Labor market slack still appears substantial: only
53 percent of the working age population is employed, a sizable share of the approximately
one million Poles working abroad could return as employment opportunities arise, and the
working-age population is growing by about ½ percent annually. Thus, although the fall in
ULCs during 2002-04 has ended, wage costs remain contained. The threats to watch are
sector specific—workers in the state-controlled mining sector negotiated sizable bonus
payments and conditions in health and construction may be tightening. Also, measures of
physical capacity utilization are reaching high levels but in a changing economic structure
may not be very accurate.
7.
Vulnerability indicators are generally favorable. The biggest risk stems from high
and rising public debt (48 percent of GDP, or 42 percent of GDP according to ESA95) with
an annual rollover rate of 22 percent.4 The authorities, however, improved the structure of
debt in 2005, lengthening the average maturity by one year, repaying the Paris Club early,
and increasing the share of euro-denominated foreign debt. Other vulnerabilities are modest
by regional standards. The moderate current account deficit is more than fully financed by
FDI, and, helped by zloty appreciation, the external debt ratio fell to 43 percent of GDP in
2005. Standard indicators of competitiveness put the zloty in an equilibrium range, given
structural features of the economy and the macro policy mix. Official reserves are equivalent
to short-term debt (by remaining maturity), a satisfactory coverage given the generally clean
float. Although rapid expansion of foreign currency mortgages is a concern, overall growth
of bank credit to the private sector, at 13 percent in 2005, is modest by regional standards,
and banks—largely foreign owned—are well capitalized. EU membership appears to impart
a substantial degree of confidence to markets, reflected in low measures of risk premiums.

3

Under Eurostat rules, Poland is allowed to report deficits excluding the costs of pension reform until March
2007. For purposes of the Excessive Deficit Procedure, pension reform cost can be partially excluded until 2010
if the European Commission considers the deficit close to 3 percent of GDP and falling.

8.
Nevertheless, after a smooth ride in 2005, Poland has been buffeted recently by
turmoil in emerging markets (Figure 1). During 2005, equity markets surged, the zloty
appreciated by about 5 percent in nominal effective terms, and zloty yields fell by 75 basis
points to below 5 percent. Issuing US$12 billion in sovereign debt last year (almost half for
early Paris Club repayment), Poland was the largest emerging market issuer. The two
subsequent waves of emerging market turmoil—in March and June 2006—affected Poland
far less than emerging markets on average, but rather strongly by regional standards. Since
March, the zloty has fallen by 4 percent, bond yields are up by 70 bps, and credit default
swap spreads rose by over 10 bps before falling back. As most of these changes were partial
reversals of run-ups in 2005, they do not threaten economic performance. They indicate,
however, that good vulnerability indicators and EU membership do not insulate Poland from
market unrest.

Implementation of IMF policy recommendations has been uneven (Box 1).
Box 1. Implementation of Past IMF Recommendations
Last year’s macroeconomic forecast for a gradual revival of growth through 2005 alongside
low inflation and a small external deficit was on the mark. Interest rate cuts since early 2005
have been consonant with staff’s inflation projections and views.
In the fiscal area, the authorities engaged staff in efforts to build support for a fiscal
responsibility law and ambitious deficit and debt reduction based on entitlement reform.
However, political support for such reforms could not be garnered. Unexpected tax buoyancy,
rather than entitlement reform, produced sizable consolidation last year. Tax reform efforts are
now moving in the recommended direction with government proposals to cut payroll taxes and
flatten the income tax schedule.
The new government is keeping the question of the timing of euro adoption under review and
is reserved toward bringing privatization to a rapid conclusion, two issues on which the staff
has urged stronger commitment.

III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
10.
The authorities’ confidence was buoyed by the economic upswing. They were
confident that the economy would expand strongly at rates above official forecasts over the
policy horizon. They saw robust profits, rising investment supported by anticipation of a
sharp increase in absorption of EU transfers, and competitive wages as sources of near- and
medium-term strength. In their view, the immediate outlook for strong growth, low inflation,
and modest current account deficits was solid. They recognized, however, the importance of
improving public finances and addressing impediments to business.
11.
Nevertheless, economic policies face conflicting objectives. The government’s
commitment to a nominal ceiling on the state budget deficit will be hard to square with
promised tax cuts and continued pressure on social spending. The objective of strengthening
business conditions and investment may clash with reservations about privatization, unease
about foreign control of companies, and proposals that could weaken banking supervision.
The desire to reduce interest rates is complicated by lingering unease over euro adoption.
The economic upswing and unexpected buoyancy of tax revenues have gone some way
toward easing the trade-offs, but difficult choices still lie ahead.
12.
The discussions focused on the tensions between these objectives in seeking a
lasting renewal of growth and protection from any further deterioration in emerging
market conditions. The authorities and staff agreed that efficient use of the forthcoming
substantial transfers from the EU was critical. They also agreed on the importance of
reforming public finances, improving the business environment, and making the economy
more flexible, but debated how to achieve these goals. This year’s FSAP update facilitated
in-depth analysis of financial sector developments, including a controversial proposal to
reorganize financial sector supervision. The mission emphasized the benefits of euro
adoption for trade, investment, and growth.

The economic outlook for 2006-07 is strong. Staff projections for a pickup in
growth, to almost 5 percent this year and 4½ percent next, are in line with government and

In the medium term, the goal of rapid income convergence will pose several
tests. The authorities and staff agreed that higher investment and employment would be key.
The authorities viewed the wage differential with western Europe as a virtual guarantee of
reasonably rapid convergence, but also pointed to the importance of structural reforms such
as reducing payroll taxes and simplifying access to EU funds. The mission felt that broader
structural reform including downsizing the public sector, lowering disincentives to work
from poorly targeted social benefits, increasing competition in product markets, and
clarifying a timetable for euro adoption would also be important. Staff agreed that the large
forthcoming transfers from the EU—up to 4 percent of GDP on average per year under the
2007-13 Financial Perspectives—will be a significant impetus to growth if efficiently used.
The prospect of reasonably efficient absorption warranted an upward revision of potential
growth, to 4 percent relative to the 3¾ percent envisaged in previous staff reports (Box 2).
15.
Staff’s medium-term scenario occupies a middle ground in the range of possible
outcomes. With improvements in conditions for investment and efficiency gains, growth
could move to a substantially higher plateau; a retreat to fiscal populism and failure to
address structural weaknesses, however, could lower growth and increase vulnerabilities to a
less favorable external environment. The central scenario assumes unchanged fiscal policy
and structural reform that provides modest support for growth. Substantially higher

10
investment would be financed by increased national savings (bolstered by growing transfers
from the EU) and higher recourse to foreign savings (Table 5). The increase in the current
account deficit to about 4½ percent of GDP would be easily covered by FDI and portfolio
inflows, with external debt remaining at about 40 percent of GDP (Table 3). Stress tests on
external debt indicate that, barring a sharp depreciation of the exchange rate, external debt is
reasonably robust to most shocks of plausible size (Table 7).
Box 2. Implications of EU Transfers
Sizable EU transfers offer an opportunity to accelerate income convergence with minimal
strain on competitiveness, the balance of payments, or public finances. Staff’s medium-term
scenario assumes that EU transfers (net of Poland’s contribution to the EU budget) rise from
½ percent of GDP in 2005 to 2½ percent by 2011. This is conservative, implying substantial
back-loading in absorption.
•

Economic growth. In the short term, given existing unutilized capacity, the direct
demand effect of increased spending on nontraded goods would boost GDP by about
1/8 percentage point per year. In the longer term, supply-side effects would be
stronger, considering Poland’s underdeveloped infrastructure. Potential output could
well rise in excess of ¼ percentage point a year. Model-based projections calibrated by
the Ministry of Regional Development suggest larger gains.

•

Exchange rate. Using empirical estimates from the aid literature, appreciation is likely
to be modest—about 2 percent within a year and 13 percent cumulatively over a fiveyear period.1 This could well be within the margins of productivity gains resulting
from efficient use of transfers.

•

Current account. EU funds are recorded in the balance of payments partly above the
line (current transfers) and partly below (capital grants). Assuming that the transfers
are eventually fully reflected in imports, the current account deficit should widen by
the amount of capital transfers.

•

Public finances. Growing EU transfers worsen the fiscal balance only through the
higher cofinancing requirements for projects carried out by public entities. The fiscal
burden will be mitigated by smaller cofinancing shares required under the 2007-13
Financial Perspective.

B. Fiscal Policy
16.
Reform of public finances remains a prime challenge. Although public finances
have lately benefited from tax buoyancy, the underlying deficit is still excessive: on
unchanged revenue and expenditure policies, general government deficits would rise to
5 percent of GDP and public debt to 55 percent of GDP over the next five years. This leaves
debt dynamics vulnerable to a growth slowdown—a repeat of the 2001-02 slowdown would
add more than 10 percentage points of GDP to the debt stock after five years. Public
finances, however, would weather shocks to the exchange rate or interest rate relatively well
(Table 6).

11
17.
The authorities intend to meet the challenge by capping the state budget deficit
at PLN 30 billion while reforming the tax system. The 2006 budget, already subject to this
cap, had been formulated on the assumption of continued tax buoyancy and general
expenditure compression without any specific policy initiatives. With the reversal of one-off
improvements in fiscal positions in 2005 at other levels of government, the 2006 general
government deficit is expected to rise to about 4½ percent of GDP. While revenues had
indeed been close to budget projections in the first half of the year, staff pressed for efforts to
contain expenditure below budgeted levels to provide a cushion should revenues prove less
buoyant than budgeted later.
18.
The authorities agreed that adhering to the cap in 2007 and beyond would be
difficult. Plans for administrative reform were under discussion, but no significant savings
were expected. Reform of social transfers and subsidies was not under consideration; indeed,
pressures were in the other direction. Staff cautioned against building optimistic assumptions
about tax buoyancy into the 2007 budget. Buoyancy could peter out as the effects of the large
increase in profits during the past few years subside. The authorities suggested that buoyancy
might also reflect increasing formalization of the economy. Staff saw this as a possibility, but
noted the absence of such buoyancy elsewhere in the region despite similar formalization.
19.
Staff advocated more front-loaded adjustment and ambitious medium-term
consolidation. Reiterating its message of recent years, staff advocated a medium-term deficit
target of no more than 2 percent of GDP—consistent with a gradual reduction of public debt
ratios. This could be achieved, even allowing for some revenue loss from tax reform, if real
expenditure growth were slowed to 3½ percent (against 5½ percent in staff’s no-policychange scenario). Large and poorly targeted social transfers, high spending on state aid, and
overlaps in public administration were prime areas for rationalization. Targeting a deficit of
4 percent of GDP in 2007 (rather than the 4.3 percent implied by the PLN 30 billion cap)
would be a good first step, given the strong economy.

The authorities were eager to finalize a tax reform package, which subsequently
went to Parliament. The reform, which the authorities viewed as revenue neutral, would
ease tax compliance costs, reduce

21.
Poland’s public finances are set to weather aging better than those of most other
EU countries. The 1999 pension reform was key to this favorable outlook, but commitment
to two aspects of reform—maintaining the indexing of pensions to inflation and moving
benefits of occupational groups with hitherto preferential treatment to the treatment
prescribed in the reform—will be tested in the next year. Serious challenges on both these
issues are in train: miners have already secured wholesale exemption from the pension
reform, and the government has pledged to reintroduce a wage component into pension
indexation.
C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
22.
A combination of one-off and more permanent factors has kept inflation below
the central target over the past year. The monetary authorities saw several factors as
having played a role: import bans by Russia and Ukraine on Polish agricultural products, a
limited pass-through of rising global energy prices due to excise cuts and margin
compression by distributors, exchange rate appreciation, integration with the EU, and
globalization. The consensus view was that the current level of interest rates, at 4 percent,
was appropriate. Inflation would return to the central target rate by end-2007, considering the
economic upswing, waning scope for easy productivity gains, and diminished prospects for
zloty appreciation in the global monetary tightening cycle. Nevertheless, views varied: some
MPC members underscored the importance of one-off factors in holding inflation down and
saw mainly upside risks to the inflation projection; others thought there was ample time to
assess the permanence of the various factors before changing interest rates, especially since
low ULCs and high profits created space for some pickup in wages before effects on inflation
would be a problem.
23.
In the mission’s view, risks were skewed toward undershooting the inflation
target. One-off factors had indeed dampened inflation in recent months but core inflation
had also remained below the target for headline inflation for five years running, reflecting
falling unit labor costs in a high-unemployment setting and effects of globalization (Box 3).
Various forecasting approaches of staff consistently conclude that it is likely to take over
20 months for inflation to return to target. They incorporate staff’s growth projections and
assume a pickup in ULC growth to 2 percent annually, a constant nominal effective exchange

rate, and further sizable increases in domestic energy prices. Moreover, staff’s structural
model suggests that it would take

until well into the upswing.
Box 3. Inflation in Poland—How Much Can Globalization Explain?
Poland’s inflation rate is currently one of the lowest in the EU. Extending recent IMF research
on globalization for industrialized countries (WEO, April 2006), Chapter I of the Selected
Issues paper analyzes how much globalization contributed to declining inflation and relative
manufacturing prices in the NMS since the mid-1990s.
Disinflation in NMS over 1997-2005 is evident in all components of the CPI, pointing to the
influence of monetary policy and productivity gains. But the relatively more pronounced
disinflation of highly tradable goods, such as textiles and housing equipment, suggests that
globalization was also a factor.
At the aggregate level, estimation of an “augmented” Phillips curve during 1996-2004 for the
eight NMS finds that inflation has become less sensitive to economic shocks. Due to increased
trade penetration, the output elasticity of inflation declined to 0.7, from 0.9 ten years ago. Thus,
globalization has indirectly affected inflation, through better consumption smoothing,
increasingly severe sanctioning of imprudent policies, and the consequent shift of monetary
policy targets toward lower inflation.
At the micro level, increasing trade openness is likely to have curbed domestic production
prices because of tougher global competition. Using disaggregated data in the manufacturing
sector, panel data analysis over 1996-2003 for the four central European NMS suggests that
globalization could have shaved off between ½ and 1 percentage point annually from Polish
inflation since the middle of the 1990s, as firms cut markups.
With trade openness likely to advance more slowly going forward, the sectoral effects of
globalization seem set to diminish somewhat. However, the larger role of foreign determinants
exhibited in the augmented Phillips curve should endure and hold inflation down.

A better anchoring of inflation expectations at the central target is a challenge
for the MPC. Despite successful disinflation, inflation expectations remain highly adaptive.
Staff encouraged the monetary authorities to 16

25.
The NBP accumulated significant foreign exchange reserves last year, in contrast
with recent years. The authorities explained that the increase mainly reflected receipts of EU
transfers and other smaller factors—not discretionary intervention, which the NBP continued
to eschew. Unlike in 2004, contributions to the EU budget were made in zlotys rather than
euros in 2005 and therefore did not offset inflows of EU funds. However, even with the
return to normal practice, the possibility of sizable reserve accumulation called for a
reconsideration of the reserve accumulation policy. The NBP will consider this issue in the
broader context of reserve needs for ERM2 and eventual euro adoption. For now when the
zloty would continue to float, staff and the authorities agreed that reserves were at
comfortable levels.
26.
Staff (using model-based and heuristic indicators) and the authorities saw the
exchange rate as within an appropriate range. Nevertheless some officials felt that it was
at the strong end of this range, and others that it was at a very competitive level. Staff noted
that large exporters were highly profitable, and overall export market share was growing.

The effects of the 2004 appreciation had been mitigated by productivity gains and, for largescale exporters, offsetting savings on imported inputs. Only some small-scale exporters—
who did not use imported inputs—were seen as moderately affected, and for them the recent
zloty depreciation should have provided relief.
27.
The government wanted to make more progress toward meeting the Maastricht
criteria before setting a target date for euro adoption. Ministry of Finance officials were
discouraged by the EU Commission’s decision not to endorse Lithuania’s request for entry
(because of a small breach of the inflation criterion) and by the extra fiscal adjustment that
would be required, relative to their expectation before Eurostat’s decision to phase in an
exclusion of second-pillar pension funds (which are in surplus) from the deficit calculation.
Nevertheless, while not seeing great urgency in setting a schedule for application, the
government intends to meet the fiscal requirements by 2009. Staff stressed the parallel steps
needed to make the economy more flexible. It urged the authorities to set a schedule for
adoption to reinforce the resolve for reform and to take the earliest advantage possible of the
opportunities in euro adoption for reducing exchange risk, lowering interest rates, and
boosting trade and growth.
D. Financial Sector

Poland’s financial sector is generally in good health. The joint IMF-World Bank
FSAP update mission and the authorities agreed that banks were well capitalized, resilient to
shocks, and profitable. Banks’ capital adequacy and ROE are above the EU average. Credit

growth is picking up, following many years when weak domestic demand and a rise in nonperforming loans had slowed financial deepening.5 The FSAP update noted progress in
supervision: newly-gained authority to conduct consolidated supervision; a shift toward riskfocused supervision; better cooperation with foreign supervisors; and modernization of the
legal framework with the adoption of the acquis communautaire (Box 4).
Box 4. FSAP Update
This follow-up of the 2001 FSAP focused on stress testing, banks’ preparedness for a pickup of
credit growth, and nonbank financial institutions. It found good progress in implementing
previous recommendations. Most remaining issues are developmental.
A set of stress tests found the banking system resilient to shocks, confirming strong soundness
indicators. A 30 percent deprecation of the zloty, a 4 percent contraction of aggregate demand,
or classification of 10 percent of housing loans would leave the system capital adequacy ratio
above the regulatory minimum. Only a few nonsystemic banks would dip below the minimum
in some scenarios. Bank resilience benefited from sharply improved profitability in 2004-05,
although room remains for further reduction of operating costs.
Banks and supervisors are generally well positioned to handle the recent pickup of credit
growth from the modest pace of the past few years. But early warning indicators and foreign
currency lending need to be closely monitored, as risk management is inherently difficult in
banks with short lending histories. Information systems on credit histories and real estate prices
still have room for improvement, and the enforcement of creditor rights needs strengthening.
Private pension funds, which hold assets worth 9 percent of GDP, have generated high returns
at costs that are low compared to systems at a similar stage of development in other countries.
The main challenges are to move to more risk-based supervision, ensure greater portfolio
diversification, and prepare the regulatory framework for the payout phase, to commence in
2009.
Many companies in the small insurance sector are not profitable and rely on support from
stakeholders. However, solvency and capital levels of the sector are satisfactory. Consolidation
seems likely, and loss-making companies require supervisor’s continued attention.
Growth of the equity market has been impressive, both in terms of market capitalization and
IPOs. The corporate bond market remains in its infancy.

29.
Banking supervisors were concerned about the rapid growth of foreign currency
mortgages. In response, they had hiked capital charges for housing loans in 2005 and issued
guidance in 2006 with a view to strengthening risk management practices and to improving
risk disclosure to customers. They were leaning toward following up with more direct
lending controls later in the year. Staff welcomed the market-based measures but stressed
that more direct intervention was prone to circumvention and would be heavy-handed in the
circumstances. Mortgages correspond to less than 6 percent of GDP and 20 percent of private
credit. Total credit growth of 13 percent is moderate by regional standards.

Staff and the FSAP update mission warned against weakening the governance
structure of banking supervision. A draft law on financial supervision under consideration
during the mission would unify financial-sector supervision in a new agency, replacing the
roles of the NBP vis-à-vis banks, and separate supervisors for capital markets and insurance
companies/pension funds. The agency’s independence is not guaranteed in the law, and the
appointment and dismissal procedures for its management risk politicizing its operations.
The authorities argued that unification was in line with what they perceived as an
international trend and would save administrative costs. Since the mission, a little-improved
version of the draft law was passed by the Sejm and awaits discussion in the Senate.
E. Structural Policies
31.
There was broad agreement that structural reform was key to improving
economic performance. The authorities plan to cut red tape in tax administration, lower the
tax wedge, and ease onerous requirements for using EU funds. They did not envisage
reforms in other key areas, as they would conflict with campaign promises to maintain a
strong government presence in the economy and generous social transfers.

18
32.
Social benefit reform to spur labor force participation is not under
consideration. Staff noted studies showing poorly targeted benefits contributed to low
employment. Previous governments had tightened vetting procedures and eligibility under
the disability and early retirement schemes;
Poland: Beneficiaries Under Disability and Pre-Retirement Schemes, 2001-05
this had curtailed inflows but was reducing
(In thousands) 1/
the number of beneficiaries only gradually.
Some 2½ million people (9½ percent of the
working-age population) are still covered
by these schemes. The authorities do not
intend to take further steps in this area—on
the contrary, the momentum is for
increasing the generosity of family benefits,
pension indexation, and access to early
retirement schemes. Improvement of work
incentives could, however, come from the planned cut of payroll taxes.

The government expressed reservations about further large privatization.
Ministry of Treasury officials supported the objective of privatization but wished to proceed
cautiously to ensure the integrity of the process. With concerns about privatized firms
tending to come under foreign control, the state failing to maximize proceeds when
privatizing unrestructured firms, and union opposition, they had put many large-scale
privatizations on hold, most notably in the coal sector and, pending the creation of vertically
integrated larger entities, the energy sector. They do not intend to relinquish state control of
bank PKO BP, copper giant KGHM, or insurance company PZU (the outcome of the legal
proceedings with a foreign shareholder allowing). The 2006 target for privatization proceeds
had been lowered to PLN 3.1 billion (0.3 percent of GDP) from PLN 5.5 billion. Staff
questioned whether even this level could be achieved, as four medium-sized chemical
companies seem to be the only larger items on the agenda. It also pointed out that the rather
large share of value-added produced by state-controlled enterprises (some 20 percent)
detracted from product market flexibility.

surveys. The authorities did not share this view and felt that the mission’s assessment sat
oddly with the upbeat mood in the business community. They pointed to some recent surveys
by business consultancies that identified Poland as an attractive destination for global
outsourcing and investment.
Box 5. Openness of the Polish Economy
Poland has the lowest ratio of trade to GDP among central and eastern European countries
(63 percent during 2003-05). This would not be a concern so long as it were explained by the
relative bigger size of its economy and population. However, a cross-country regression,
controlling for size, along with distance to trading partners, per-capita GDP, etc., shows that
actual trade falls some 20 percentage points of GDP short of model predictions.

35.
Staff noted that these views are not necessarily contradictory. Poland’s
reemerging attractiveness could be grounded in low labor costs and the availability of lowpriced land, rather than a supportive environment for business. From this perspective, several
priorities for boosting potential growth

exist: (i) simplifying regulation,

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
The current cyclical upswing underscores the potential of the Polish economy in
the wake of EU accession and in the face of favorable global growth prospects. After
five years of underperformance relative to many regional peers, the upswing reflects
balanced growth across consumption, investment, and exports alongside a pickup in
employment and strong competitiveness in the export-oriented manufacturing sector. These
are the fruits of recent restructuring in the open parts of the economy, which have positioned
Poland to take advantage of EU accession and the strength of global demand. Also, resource
constraints are not yet binding, and the economy has absorbed energy price increases without
second-round effects. The MPC appropriately cut interest rates during the past year and is
now positioned to delay a tightening cycle until prospects for reaching the inflation target
over the policy horizon are clear. Overall, the underpinnings for near-term growth are strong.

20
37.
The current juncture offers good opportunities to lock in improved economic
performance. The global outlook is strong, EU grants will be a boon to the economy, and a
base of rising employment and incomes is being established. External vulnerabilities, though
tested in the recent episode of financial market turbulence, remain low, helped by the strong
reputation of the NBP and a solid record of low inflation. But these favorable conditions
could be fleeting without efforts to address several key impediments to sustained high
growth.
38.
Perhaps most important in the near term is allaying uncertainties about the
commitment to reducing the deficit and stabilizing public debt. Despite beneficial effects
of recent tax buoyancy on the deficit, public debt remains on an upward trajectory and public
spending, at 43 percent of GDP, is too high. The government’s tax reduction plans are
commendable but unfinanceable unless expenditure savings can be found by better targeting
social transfer programs and tackling high administrative costs. As a first step, the
government should present a strong 2007 budget ideally reducing the deficit by at least
½ percent of GDP—a solid step toward consolidation during the upswing. This could be
achieved under the government’s PLN 30 billion deficit target for the state budget only if
deficits in the rest of the general government remain contained and the state budget
overperforms. Beyond 2007, the authorities should move toward a sustainable general
government deficit of about 2 percent of GDP while pressing ahead with tax reforms and
adhering to the long-term goals of the 1999 pension reform.
39.
Looking further out, the restructuring over the past few years in industries
exposed to foreign competition needs to be expanded to the economy more generally.
The productivity gains in manufacturing have been impressive and, having turned the corner
on employment growth, the sector will increasingly contribute to higher incomes. But with
Poland’s openness to trade and foreign competition still lagging its income level and
economic size, further efficiency gains from increased competition should be within reach.
This will require pressing ahead with privatization and institutional reform to lower the costs
of doing business and attract investment.
40.
Increasing labor usage will be another prerequisite for higher output. At just
over 50 percent of the working-age population, employment is too low, with obvious effects
on both aggregate supply and demand. Proposals to cut payroll taxes will help but need to be
supplemented by strengthening incentives to work through better targeting of social benefits.
Improving the business environment and ensuring full and efficient use of EU funds will be
critical to increasing labor demand.
41.
In the financial sector, strong and independent supervision needs to be
protected. The conclusions of the FSAP update—that the resiliency, capitalization, and
profitability of banks are solid, financial supervision is sound, and the main issues in the
financial sector are developmental—attest to the accomplishments of the supervisory system.
In this context, the draft law to create a unified financial supervisor is a concern because of
deficiencies in laying out a governance structure protected against politization. Supervisors
will face increased challenges if, as seems likely, bank credit growth rises to rates in regional
peers. The consequences of any weakening of supervision could therefore be severe.
Already, a pickup in foreign currency lending to households subjects banks to growing credit

21
risk, although stress tests indicate that banks could absorb the direct effects of even rather
large shocks to exchange and interest rates. While this assessment should be kept under
review, it argues for continued reliance on careful bank-by-bank supervision of risk
assessment systems rather than a move to direct controls, which anyway have not had lasting
effects in other countries.
42.
With a reform agenda in place, euro adoption would be an additional impetus
for trade, investment, and growth. In developing its strategy for euro adoption, the
government should bear in mind that Poland already benefits from markets’ anticipation of
euro adoption—reflected in reduced risk premiums, some insulation from financial market
turbulence, and expanding trade and growth. Should markets’ perceptions of the
government’s intentions on euro adoption slip significantly, Poland would not only lose an
important anchor for policies, but might even forgo these anticipatory benefits. Indeed, the
somewhat larger spillovers to Poland than to some regional peers from recent financial
market turbulence are a reminder of the risks of delaying action to address policy weaknesses
and eliminate impediments to euro adoption.
43.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

3/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
4/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
5/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
8/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
9/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).

1/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth,
and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels of the last projection year.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
3/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.

B1. Nominal interest rate is at baseline plus one-half standard deviation
B2. Real GDP growth is at baseline minus one-half standard deviations
B3. Non-interest current account is at baseline minus one-half standard deviations

Poland accepted the obligation of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 on June 1, 1995. The
exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions.
Since April 12, 2000, the zloty has floated freely.
Prior to that, the zloty had been pegged to a currency composite made up of the U.S. dollar,
deutsche mark, pound sterling, French franc, and the Swiss franc. As of January 1, 1999, the
currency composite was changed to a basket comprised of 55 percent Euro and 45 percent
U.S. dollar. From January 1, 1995, the zloty was redenominated, with new Zl 1 equaling old
Zl 10,000. The central parity of the zloty was adjusted under a crawling peg policy at a preannounced monthly rate. On May 16, 1995, a band of ±7 percent was introduced around the

31
central rate. Following the implementation of the new system, the zloty initially appreciated
by about 5 percent above the central rate. In September 1995, the exchange rate was allowed
to appreciate a further 1 percent within the band. In December 1995, the central parity was
raised by 6 percent, and at the same time the authorities allowed the actual exchange rate to
appreciate by 22 percentage points. On January 8, 1996 the monthly rate of crawl was
reduced to one percent. On February 26, 1998, with the zloty pushing towards its upper limit,
the newly-formed Monetary Policy Council (RPP) widened the fluctuation band from
±7 percent to ±10 percent. At the same time, the rate of crawl was reduced from one percent
to 0.8 percent per month. On July 17, 1998, the crawling peg’s monthly rate of depreciation
was cut from 0.8 percent to 0.65 percent. On September 9, 1998, the monthly rate of
depreciation was reduced further to 0.50 percent. On October 29, 1998, the zlotys trading
band was widened to 12.5 percent. On March 1, 1999, the zloty’s trading band was widened
to ±15 percent, and the rate of crawl was lowered to 0.3 percent per month. On
December 31, 1999, the official rate was PLN 4.08 per US$1. On April 12, 2000, the
crawling band regime was abolished and the zloty has since floated freely.
Poland maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions, except for the exchange restrictions imposed
by Poland solely for the preservation of national or international security that have been
notified to the Fund pursuant to Executive Board Decision No. 144–(52/51). Those exchange
restrictions are contained in the following legal instruments:
•

Council Regulation (EC) No. 2488/2000 of November 14, 2000, as amended
(freezing of funds and economic resources of former Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and certain other natural persons).

VIII.

Article IV Consultation

The last Article IV consultation was concluded on July 12, 2005 (Country Report
No. 05/263). In concluding the consultation, Directors congratulated the Polish authorities on
a successful first year in the European Union, but urged them to implement further fiscal and
structural reforms to ensure long-term sustainability of public finances, enhance the
flexibility of the economy, particularly in the labor market, and improve the business climate.
They concluded that these steps should help secure a favorable setting for Euro adoption.

Appendix II
POLAND—World Bank Activity
44.
Poland rejoined the World Bank in 1986 and World Bank lending to Poland started in
1990. Since then the Bank has committed loans totaling US$5.4 billion equivalent. Total
loans outstanding and disbursed amount to US$1.9 billion as of the end of 2004. At the end
of 2005 eleven projects are under implementation, with an undisbursed balance of
US$180 million.
45.
Since 1990, the Bank has financed projects in a variety of areas including in
agriculture, coal sector restructuring, enterprise and financial restructuring, environment,
energy, forestry development, health, housing, railway sector restructuring, ports, roads, and
rural development. These include the Krakow Energy Efficiency project (US$15 million,
also co-financed by the Global Environmental Facility (GEF)), which aims at improving
energy efficiency of the city's district heating systems and end-users; a Railway
Restructuring loan (US$101 million), which is financing restructuring of the Polish State
Railways' (PKP) to increase efficiency, improve finances, and privatize selected activities
within a sound regulatory framework; a Rural Development Project (US$120 million), which
has the objective of rural restructuring and employment creations through promotion of nonfarm rural activities, strengthening of local governments and other institutions, financing
infrastructure investments, and improving rural education; and the Szczecin-Swinoujscie
Seaway and Port Modernization Project (US$38.5 million), which aims to promote Poland's
trade by developing an efficient administrative/managerial structure and improving physical
facilities. Other ongoing projects being financed by the World Bank are for flood
management, roads, Gdynia and Gdansk ports, water supply and development of geothermal
resources. More recent loans include the Hard Coal Social Mitigation Loan
(US$200 million), and a companion Coal Mine Closure Loan (US$100 million) which aim at
supporting the government’s Coal Reform Program (2003–06), specifically by mitigating the
negative effects associated with the further reduction of employment levels, and supporting
closure of uneconomic production capacity in a safe and environmentally sound manner,
respectively; a EUR 100 million loan for Rehabilitation and Maintenance of Roads , fully
implemented in calendar year 2004, a follow-up loan signed in 2005 (EUR 100 million) and
the Post Accession Rural Support Loan for the amount of US$ 88 signed on April 7, 2006.
Smaller institutional development grants are currently financing activities to strengthen the
processes of land administration and registration and accounting and auditing.
46.
The World Bank in consultation with the Polish government prepared in 2005 a
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) with three key priority areas; promoting fiscal adjustment
and reversing negative debt dynamics through restructuring of expenditures; promoting
convergence through an improved investment climate and enhanced competitiveness; and
reducing poverty, encouraging social inclusion and bringing employment closer to the
Lisbon targets.
47.
The Bank’s Executive Directors discussed the Country Partnership Strategy in March
2005. The CPS is open-ended in terms of duration, and flexible in terms of its lending and

37
non-lending program, which is defined in annual business plans. As indicated in the CPS,
yearly lending is expected to be in the US$350–400 million range in the earlier years of the
strategy with amounts to be determined in the above mentioned annual business plans. Areas
for potential lending during FY06 and FY07 include support for road infrastructure and flood
prevention in the Odra river basin.
48.
In addition to its lending program, over the years of its involvement in Poland the
Bank has prepared a series of economic and sector work reports and policy notes that provide
advice on various poverty-related, institutional and structural reform issues. In 2004 World
Bank staff prepared with Government and non-Government counterparts a Living Standards
Assessment, a Knowledge Economy Assessment and an Investment Climate Assessment.
Preparation of Quarterly Economic Reports for the 8 new EU members in Central and
Eastern Europe (EU8) started in March 2004. The World Bank was also cooperating with
Polish authorities in the process of review and consultation of the National Development
Plan 2007–13. Other work which has been completed in the past three of years includes a
Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (2003), development policy assessment (2001),
health and social sector reviews and policy notes (1999–2001), a labor market review (2001);
rural land, labor and capital markets (2001), and a study on trade and foreign direct
investment (2000). In 2000, a Financial Sector Assessment on the Poland financial system
was carried out under the joint IMF/World Bank Financial Sector Assessment Program.
49.

Appendix III
POLAND—Statistical Issues
50.
Poland has a comprehensive macroeconomic database that has been improving in
recent years. The authorities publish a full range of economic and financial statistics, and
cooperate fully in providing data to the Fund that are adequate for surveillance. Data on the
core indicators are available on a timely basis (see the attached Table of Common Indicators
Required for Surveillance). Consistent with its commitment to provide a comprehensive set
of high quality data, in an open manner, Poland subscribes to the IMF’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and its metadata are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board.
Real sector statistics
51.
The Central Statistical Office (GUS) compiles a wide range of real sector statistics,
most of which are published promptly in the monthly Statistical Bulletin. The main problems
for users include (i) the short span of comparable Polish data series, reflecting the upheavals
associated with transition to a market economy; (ii) inconsistencies between annual and
higher frequency data, reflecting differences in weights and in coverage; and (iii) lack of
easy electronic retrieval of these data.
52.
The national accounts follow the concepts and definitions of the European System of
Accounts 1995 (ESA 95), which is based on the System of National Accounts 1993 (SNA
1993). The GUS compiles annual and quarterly GDP estimates by the production and
expenditure approaches in current and constant prices, a full sequence of accounts by
institutional sectors, supply and use tables, input/output tables, annual financial accounts, and
regional accounts. The statistical techniques are basically sound. The constant price estimates
are compiled in average prices of the previous year, using deflation techniques that generally
follow international standards. However, national accounts data still have some problems—
the subannual data are collected on a cumulative rather than on a discrete basis, and plans to
introduce proper benchmarking have been delayed. In addition, seasonal adjustment on
relatively short period leads to frequent and large backward revisions.
53.
The concepts and definitions of the CPI follow the ESA 95 standards and Eurostat’s
requirements for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index. The CPI does not cover the shelter
prices faced by household owner-occupants. The weights for the index are obtained from the
average annual expenditures primarily taken from the national Household Budget Survey
(HBS) of the previous calendar year, and are updated annually. From 1999 onwards, the
national classification is based on the Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose
(COICOP). The scope of the index covers all resident households, except those in some rural
areas. Historical series are constructed using a chain method. Time series data are available
for the index with reference periods of 1990 and 1998.
54.
The producer price index (PPI) is based on the 1993 SNA concepts and definitions for
recording and valuation of product prices and weights. Its scope includes mining and
quarrying, manufacturing and electricity, gas and water supply. Output price indices are also

39
calculated for agriculture, construction, and business services such as transport, storage, and
communication. Since 2000, the index is classified by the Polish Classification of Activities
based on the General Industrial Classification of Economic Activities within the European
Communities, first revision (NACE, Rev.1), the Classification of Products by Activity, and
the List of Products of the European Communities. The PPI does not include any estimation
for missing prices or quality and seasonal adjustments.
Government finance statistics
55.
The Ministry of Finance provides detailed monthly state budget data on its website,
compiled on a cash basis. Fiscal data for other levels of government are published or
provided to IMF missions on a less frequent basis. Consolidated general government data are
published only on an annual basis, at the time of the budget, as an estimated outturn at the
time of the preparation of the next budget, and as the final outturn in late spring of the
following year. The limited breakdown of expenditure by category hinders fiscal analysis
and identification of priority areas for fiscal consolidation; consequently they play a very
limited role in the public policy debate, although non-state budget expenditure accounts for a
large share of general government expenditure.
56.
Data for inclusion in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook are reported to the
Fund on a regular basis and, since 2004, according to the framework of GFSM 2001. The
authorities provided comparable data, compiled on an accrual basis, for 2001–03. Monthly
data on consolidated core operations of the central government are reported in IFS. The
Central Statistical Office also produces fiscal data according to the ESA95 methodology for
submission to the EU and use in Poland’s Stability Programs. However, GFS and ESA95
data, while providing a superior classification of revenues and expenditure, traditionally
became available with long lags and only on an annual basis, diminishing their value for
surveillance purposes. Detailed bridge tables between high-frequency cash data and ESA95
data are not yet available.7
Monetary statistics
57.
The National Bank of Poland (NBP) regularly reports analytically useful data to the
Fund with minimal delay. High-frequency data (every ten days) on the central bank balance
sheet and the monetary survey are also available with minimal delay. As a member of the
European Union, Poland is in the process of adopting the recommendations of the European
Central Bank (ECB) for the compilation of monetary statistics; data compiled from March
2002 onward are generally consistent with the ECB framework, and previously released data
have been revised back to December 1996.

7

STA and Eurostat are working on bridging ESA and GFS data for all EU countries.

40
58.
The mission that prepared the data module of the Report on the Observance of
Standards and Codes (ROSC) in January 2003 found that the concepts and definitions used
by the NBP to compile monetary statistics were in broad conformity with the guidelines
outlined in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). Nevertheless, the
following concepts and principles underlying valuation and classification of financial
instruments deviate from the MFSM: (i) financial derivatives are indistinguishably recorded
under other assets/other liabilities; (ii) accrued interest on loans and deposits are included as
part of other assets/other liabilities, but not with the respective underlying instruments;
(iii) similarly accrued interest on securities other than shares issued by the depository
corporations are included as part of other liabilities; (iv) loan-loss provisions are classified as
special reserves under capital accounts and reserves; and (v) valuation of shares and other
equity on the asset side of the balance sheets of the NBP and other depository corporations is
not at market prices. The first three practices differ from the MFSM guidelines, but are in
conformity with the ECB framework.
59.
In addition, the data presented on the balance sheets of the NBP and other depository
corporations provide insufficient breakdown of the claims on, and liabilities to, the
government and other resident sectors. It is impossible to derive net claims on general
government or central government on a consistent basis from the published data. Similarly,
interbank positions between the NBP and other depository corporations cannot be identified.
There are material differences between government finance statistics, financing data and the
corresponding monetary data. The data ROSC mission recommended that the NBP, in
cooperation with the Ministry of Finance, reconcile monetary and government finance
statistics and carry out the reconciliation exercise on a regular basis.
External sector statistics
60.
While improvements have been made in the balance of payments data, some issues
need to be addressed. While there are valid differences in definitions between the customs
(GUS) and payment-based trade data compiled by the NBP, the two data sources need to be
further cross-checked for broad consistency. The NBP now reports net foreign assets (NFA)
rather than the net international reserves (NIR) previously shown in the monetary survey. In
contrast to NIR, NFA includes less liquid foreign assets and liabilities. Also, the coverage
and reporting of the stock of external debt, especially at maturities up to one year, could be
improved.
61.
The 2003 data ROSC mission recommended that Poland include interest on an
accrual basis, make explicit the legal requirement that the NBP disseminate balance of
payments statistics, separate insurance from transportation when making the c.i.f./f.o.b.
adjustment, publish on a regular basis a reconciliation table between international
merchandise trade statistics and “goods” in the balance of payments, and undertake periodic
revision studies.

POLAND: TABLE OF COMMON INDICATORS REQUIRED FOR SURVEILLANCE

42
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
REPUBLIC OF POLAND
Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the European Department
Approved by Alessandro Leipold and Adnan Mazarei
September 29, 2006
1.
This supplement reviews political and economic developments since the preparation
of the staff report for the 2006 Article IV consultation and provides a brief staff assessment.
It also updates the PIN. The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged.
V. POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS
2.
Political uncertainty has increased. On September 22, Prime Minister Kaczynski
ended the coalition with Samoobrona, one of the junior partners in government for the last
five months, leaving this government short of a parliamentary majority. Among other issues,
disagreements over the 2007 budget seem to have triggered this decision. The Prime Minister
is now trying to secure a new majority with parliamentarians from a number of small parties
and Samoobrona defectors. The outcome is hard to predict at this stage.
VI. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
3.
Recent data releases underscore the strong cyclical momentum of the economy.
According to newly available national accounts for the second quarter, the economy
expanded at a year-on-year real rate of 5.4 percent in the first half of 2006, around
½ percentage point faster than anticipated in the staff report. Strong growth of private
consumption, underpinned by a pickup of year-on-year enterprise employment growth to
3½ percent in August, and briskly expanding investment augur well for a continuation of the
upswing. High-frequency indicators also remain strong, with growth of retail sales, industrial
sales, and export volumes all in the double digits.
4.
Consequently, staff now expects somewhat faster growth than at the time of the
staff report—5.2 percent in 2006 and 4.7 percent in 2007, compared to 4.9 and 4.5 percent,
respectively, in the staff report. The strength of domestic demand, and particularly
investment, entail higher imports. However, as export prospects have also improved,
projected current account deficits remain moderate. At 1.9 percent of GDP in 2006 and
2.3 percent of GDP in 2007, they are 0.2 percentage point wider than anticipated in the staff
report.

43
5.
Inflation is picking up somewhat faster than expected from the very low levels
early this year. In August twelve-month inflation was 1.6 percent, compared to rates of
below one percent throughout the first half of this year. Part of the pickup is due to a
drought-related spike of food prices, which should be largely transitory and offset as easing
oil prices are reflected in the CPI. More importantly, core inflation has been running at
somewhat higher rates than anticipated, prompting staff to raise its inflation projection to 1.8
percent for end-2006, compared to 1.5 percent in the staff report, and to 2½ percent for end2007. Nonetheless, core inflation (1.4 percent in August) remains well below the inflation
target of 2½ ±1 percent, and productivity growth in industry still exceeds the rise in real
wages. Staff therefore remains of the view that present interest rates are appropriate pending
evidence that the economy will close in on resource constraints over the policy horizon.
6.
Public finances are also benefiting from the strong economy. Buoyant tax
collections through August suggest that the government’s ambitious revenue target for 2006
is within reach. Also, expenditures are below plan so far, partly reflecting investment delays
related to amendments of the public procurement law in May. But the government expects a
full catch-up to meet budgetary allocations in the remainder of the year. Staff now projects
the 2006 general government deficit at 4.3 percent of GDP (including pension reform costs),
against 4.5 percent of GDP in the staff report.
7.
The preliminary 2007 draft budget suggests a small consolidation and no
significant change in the structure of expenditure. The budget is due for submission to
Parliament by end-September. In line with the government’s long-standing pledge, the
preliminary draft keeps the central government deficit constant in nominal terms, implying a
reduction of the deficit relative to GDP of 0.2 percentage point. Key elements of the
government’s earlier tax reform plans—payroll tax cuts and excise tax harmonization—have
been dropped, although the indexation of personal income tax brackets, the restoration of
gasoline excises to pre-September 2005 levels, and a number of other measures remain under
consideration. Cyclically robust revenues are envisaged to fund expenditure growth of
6½ percent in real terms. EU-related expenditure, social benefits, and discretionary spending
are the principal drivers.
8.
Financial markets have calmed since the emerging market sell-off in spring, and
have taken the recent political developments in stride. Between the trough in June and
late September financial market indicators have improved substantially. Foreign currency
interest spreads and credit default swap spreads, which had spiked during the emerging
market turmoil, have fallen back to the levels of the beginning of the year. The stock market
index has gained some 15 percent and is now up 10 percent year-to-date. The nominal
effective value of the zloty has appreciated by some 3 percent and is now roughly back to its
level at the beginning of the year. However, the 5 year–5 year interest spread seems to have

44
settled on a higher level8. This might be a first indication that Poland’s waning enthusiasm
for early euro adoption is starting to affect interest rate differentials.
9.
The new law on financial sector supervision took effect in September. The
governance provisions for the new unified supervisory agency were little improved in the
legislative process and continue to fall short of best practice. With the independence of the
agency insufficiently anchored in the legislation itself, implementation of the law will be key
to determining the effectiveness of the new body.
VII. STAFF ASSESSMENT
10.
The government’s resistance of pressures to raise the deficit in 2007 is
commendable, but the improving economic outlook strengthens staff’s view that more
ambitious consolidation should be targeted. It is also regrettable that expenditure savings
have not been found to accommodate earlier government plans to reduce taxes. While the
remaining tax reform measures for 2007 are a step forward, they fail to address the key
problem of Poland’s excessively high payroll taxes. Looking ahead, efforts to rein in
excessive administrative spending and poorly targeted social transfers should be a priority.
This would make room for more aggressive deficit reduction and cuts in the tax wedge.
11.
Under the new legal framework for financial sector supervision, the scope for
political interference remains a major concern. It will now be critical that implementation
of the law dispel any concerns in this regard from the outset, and that the early work of the
agency send a strong signal of commitment to the high standards for supervision that have
characterized the experience of recent years.

It measures market expectations about the interest spread of zloty-denominated 5-year bonds over bunds in
five years time. It thus reflects expectations about interest rate convergence, and by extension, euro adoption
prospects.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with
the Republic of Poland
On October 4, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Poland.9
Background
In the last five years, economic performance has not lived up to the promise of Poland’s
early reform record. In the 1990s, growth surpassed that in other transition countries, but
since then has disappointed, in part reflecting a second wave of restructuring,
particularly in the export-oriented manufacturing sector, lagging openness to foreign
trade, slow growth in trading partners, and a large government sector. Less measurable
features—policies that stifle competition, a large, low-productivity farming sector, poor
infrastructure, and political tensions—probably also played a role. Thus, while benefiting
from successful disinflation and protected from key external vulnerabilities by small
current account deficits, a floating exchange rate, and sizable external reserves, Poland
trails most other new member states of the EU in per capita GDP, investment, and
employment.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions
with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and
financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments
and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the
basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. This PIN
summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the October 4, 2006
Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

47
Nevertheless, by mid-2005, cyclical influences alongside the benefits from EU
membership and the impetus from manufacturing sector restructuring produced an
economic upswing. Output has expanded at an annualized rate of almost 6 percent
since mid-2005 despite restrictive macroeconomic policies. Following a pickup in
investment growth in early 2004, export growth has strengthened on the back of solid
competitiveness and improving prospects in the Euro Area and in countries to the east.
As prolonged net labor shedding ended, private consumption picked up with a short lag.
Supply-side developments have been particularly strong in the externally exposed
manufacturing sector. There, employment is rising strongly, profitability is robust, and
exports are steadily climbing the technology ladder.
Monetary and fiscal conditions were contractionary last year and have been broadly
neutral thus far in 2006. During March 2005-March 2006, the MPC cut policy rates by
250 bps, to 4 percent. Nonetheless, overall monetary conditions tightened during 2005
as the zloty appreciated and falling inflation added to real interest rates. With the value of
the zloty little changed since end-2005, monetary conditions have now stabilized. Public
finances were a positive surprise. The general government deficit fell to 3.9 percent of
GDP in 2005 (2.4 percent of GDP according to ESA95 and excluding pension reform
costs), two percentage points less than in 2004. Deficit reduction was driven by buoyant
taxes, partly reflecting strong profit growth, while expenditure growth was contained
marginally below GDP growth. Revenue strength extends into 2006, and, with spending
so far below plan, fiscal policy was contractionary in the first eight months of the year.
The upswing has not tested resource constraints. Although domestic savings are low by
regional standards, investment, even with the recent pickup, is lower still, and the current
account deficit hovers around 2 percent of GDP. Labor market slack appears substantial
with only 54 percent of the working-age population employed. Wage costs thus remain
contained, although the fall in unit labor costs during 2002-04 has ended and sectorspecific threats are to be watched (in state-controlled mining, health care, and
construction).
Vulnerability indicators are generally favorable. The modest current account deficit is
more than fully financed by FDI, and, helped by zloty appreciation, the external debt ratio
fell to 43 percent of GDP in 2005. Official reserves fully cover short-term debt. Overall
growth of bank credit to the private sector is modest by regional standards (13 percent in
2005) and banks are well capitalized, although rapidly expanding foreign currency
mortgages require close monitoring. Poland’s weak spot remains high and rising public
debt (48 percent of GDP or 42 percent of GDP according to ESA95 and excluding
government debt held by second-pillar pension funds) with a sizable rollover rate of
22 percent, despite recent improvements of public debt management. More generally,
EU membership appears to impart a substantial degree of confidence to markets,
reflected in low measures of risk premiums. Nevertheless, after a smooth ride in 2005,
Poland has been buffeted recently by turmoil in emerging markets.

48

Executive Board Assessment
Directors welcomed the upswing in the Polish economy that has been developing since
mid-2005, and noted that prospects for this year and next are broadly favorable. The
upswing has been well-balanced between consumption, investment, and exports, and
underpinned by strong employment growth and enterprise profitability. Directors called
on the Polish authorities to secure the momentum of the recent strong growth and
maximize the benefits from EU membership by pressing ahead with fiscal and structural
reforms.
Directors noted that the upswing is unlikely to run into resource constraints in the near
term, as inflation remains subdued, the current account deficit is moderate, and the labor
market still has substantial slack. In these circumstances, they considered that past
monetary policy decisions had been appropriate and felt that rates could be kept on hold
longer, pending evidence that the economy is closing in on resource constraints over the
policy horizon. Nevertheless, it will be important for the central bank to remain vigilant
against possible emerging inflationary pressures. Directors noted the volatility of
inflation. They urged the Monetary Policy Council to make further efforts to anchor
expectations at the central target rate by clearly communicating their aim of targeting this
rate with symmetric deviations. Overall, they considered the monetary policy framework
to be sound, and pointed to the vital role an independent central bank has played in
maintaining stability.
Directors saw the exchange rate as within a range appropriate to ensure external
competitiveness. Exports are gaining market share, relative unit labor costs are not
rising, and exports have moved up the technology ladder.
Directors regretted that the general government outturn for 2006 is unlikely to improve
over 2005, despite strong growth and buoyant revenue collections. With respect to the
2007 budget, they acknowledged that spending pressure has been resisted by sticking
to the PLN 30 billion anchor for the central government deficit. They regretted, however,
that because of insufficient expenditure savings, earlier tax reform plans could not be
financed and had to be largely abandoned. In Directors’ view this underscores the need
to tackle poorly-targeted and high social spending as well as large administrative
expenditures to reduce the deficit, while also making room for tax cuts, particularly on
labor. They therefore felt that a more ambitious fiscal target, possibly supplemented by
an expenditure ceiling, would help focus attention on the critical need for stronger
expenditure based adjustment to stabilize the government debt and meet the Maastricht
criteria. They also emphasized that adhering to the objectives of the 1999 pension
reform would be critical for long-term fiscal sustainability.
Directors encouraged the authorities to move decisively to increase the flexibility of the
economy. They stressed that improvements in Poland’s low-rated business environment
would be critical for extending the strong performance of the competitive export sector to
the economy more generally. In this context, Directors expressed concern about the
stalling privatization process. They underscored that Poland’s still-low employment rate
points to the need to make labor markets more flexible, especially by lowering the tax

49
wedge and strengthening incentives to work. Moreover, Directors saw full and efficient
use of EU funds as a priority and a welcome opportunity to raise productivity.
Directors agreed with the conclusions of the Financial System Stability Assessment
(FSSA). They welcomed the finding that the banking system is well-capitalized,
profitable, resilient to shocks, and soundly supervised. Noting Poland’s limited progress
in financial deepening in previous years, Directors viewed the recent pickup of credit
growth as a generally positive development. However, the potential risks of a high
concentration of credit growth in foreign currency housing loans require careful
monitoring by supervisors, and Directors welcomed recent market-based steps that
supervisors had taken in response.
Directors expressed concern about the new law on financial sector supervision. They
noted that the governance provisions in the legislation for the establishment of a new
unified financial sector supervisory agency fall short of best practice, providing
insufficient assurances of the agency’s independence and leaving scope for a
politicization of its operations. Directors emphasized that it will be essential for the
authorities—through effective implementation of the legislation—to send a strong signal
of their commitment to the high standards of supervision that have characterized the
experience of recent years.
Directors stressed that euro adoption will be an important opportunity to provide an
impetus to trade, investment, and growth. They expressed concern that a slippage in the
timeline for measures supporting euro adoption could result in a weakening of an
important anchor for domestic reform and adversely affect market confidence. Directors
agreed, however, that careful preparation for this important step, especially by reducing
the fiscal deficit, increasing the flexibility of the economy, and ensuring broad political
support, is essential for its success.

Statement by Andrzej Raczko, Alternate Executive Director for the Republic of Poland
October 4, 2006

We are grateful to the staff for its insightful report and constructive
recommendations. Our authorities highly value the quality of the staff’s analysis and its
contribution to the domestic economic debate.
Recent Economic Developments and Prospects
Poland’s accession to the European Union in May 2004 substantially improved the
economy’s long-term fundamentals and increased the potential growth rate. This is due to the
fully gained access to the EU market in line with the principles of free movement of goods,
capital, and—increasingly—labor, institutional convergence, increased credibility, and rising
inflows of EU funds. After a temporary slowdown, caused by a delayed investment
expansion, the economy in mid-2005 entered a period of economic upswing characterized by
booming foreign trade, fast growth in private fixed investment, increasing FDI, burgeoning
inflows of EU funds, robust productivity growth, and growing employment.
The long-awaited spurt in fixed investment (14.4 percent growth rate in the second
quarter of this year), driven by high utilization of production capacity, cyclical rebound, high
corporate profits, falling interest rates, stable unit labor costs in the industrial sector and
strong investors’ confidence is particularly promising. The growth in fixed investment should
be increasingly supported by the absorption of EU cohesion and structural funds (estimated
at up to 13 billion euro in 2004–06 and up to 91 billion euro in 2007–13). According to
model-based estimates of the Ministry of Regional Development, EU funds contributed
0.86 percent of GDP in 2005. Their contribution to growth is projected to exceed
1 percentage point in 2006 and thereafter.
Given that the current expansion takes place in an unusually auspicious environment
of low inflation (projected at 1.1 percent y-o-y in 2006), low external imbalances, a
satisfactory fiscal situation, and an improved outlook for western Europe, the prospects for
sustained growth in the medium term seem to be well grounded. Broadly in line with the
staff, our authorities project GDP growth to reach 5.2 percent in 2006, 4.6 percent in 2007
and roughly 5 percent onwards.
The external position is comfortable. Owing to robust growth in exports, the current
account in 2006 is expected to stabilize at the level of 1.7 percent of GDP. It will be fully
financed by inflows of portfolio capital, FDI and EU funds. The current account deficit is
projected to remain below 3 percent of GDP in the medium term.
My authorities were intrigued by the staff’s scenario of increasing the potential
growth rate by accelerating the absorption of foreign savings. We agree with the staff that a

52
higher current account deficit of roughly 4.5 percent of GDP would be easily financed by
FDI, stable portfolio investment, and EU capital transfers. However, use of additional foreign
savings would depend not only on the improvement of the business climate, but also on the
appropriate policy mix. This is not always easy to achieve. In the late 1990s, booming
domestic investment widened the current account deficit to over 7 percent of GDP. To curb
the deficit—in absence of fiscal measures—monetary policy was significantly tightened.
Such a policy mix halted growth and increased unemployment for a number of years. That
costly and painful maneuver had to be implemented because fiscal policy was not flexible
enough, mostly due to the fixed structure of budgetary expenditures. More intensive use of
foreign savings can thus be considered only if the flexibility of the fiscal policy improves.
Fiscal Policy
Since Poland implemented a fundamental pension reform in 1999, the staff needs to
provide two sets of data on deficit and public debt with pension funds placed inside and
outside of the general government. The general government deficit with pension funds
classified outside the government’s sector is some 1.8–2.0 percentage points higher than the
one based on the common EU’s methodology ESA-95 (the difference reflects the
government’s transfers to open pension funds (OFE) and exclusion of income from pension
funds’ assets). According to the Fund’s estimates, the general budget deficit amounted to
4.6 percent of GDP in 2005; according to ESA-95, the deficit was much lower and amounted
to only 2.5 percent of GDP. If the former measure of deficit is used to analyze the
macroeconomic impact, i.e. the one with pension funds outside the general government, it is
hard to explain how in 2005 such a high deficit (4.6 percent) may co-exist with 0.7 percent
inflation. This misleading interpretation may be avoided if the latter is used. Since budgetary
transfers to pension funds increase savings rather than expand consumption, the fiscal
stimulus is limited and does not contribute to additional inflationary pressures. Thus, from a
macroeconomic standpoint, any analysis of deficits should take into account the impact of
the pension reform. The European Council partially shared this view since it decided to
consider the impact of the pension reform on the general government deficit in five
consecutive years.
My authorities believe that the level of inflation and the size of the public debt do not
require any drastic fiscal adjustment, as it could undermine the ongoing economic expansion.
The current political situation does not allow for any significant cuts in social expenditure.
Nonetheless, the government is committed to reducing the budget deficit to below 3 percent,
in line with Poland’s commitments under the EU’s Stability and Growth Pact.
To achieve this goal, the government established a simple fiscal rule based on a PLN
30 billion nominal cap on the state budget deficit in 2006, 2007 and onwards. It also
committed itself to base the budget projections on conservative assumptions and—when tax
revenues overperform—save the surplus. This was already the case in the past years. Robust

53
growth also improved the financial position of local governments. As a result, they achieved
a small fiscal deficit in 2005 and are likely to have roughly balanced budgets in 2006.
My authorities continue to gradually implement the agenda of structural reforms in
the fiscal sector. The new minister of finance reiterated her commitment to enacting a new
Public Finance Law, which would liquidate a number of extra-budgetary funds, incorporate
the EU funds into the budget, and increase overall transparency of the public sector. The
government is also working on the introduction of a performance-based budgeting aimed at
enhancing the effectiveness of public spending and improving absorption of EU funds.
The deficit and public debt are easily financed both domestically and internationally.
The public debt-to-GDP ratio remained stable between 2004 and now, and at the end of 2005
reached 41.9 percent (OFE within the general government sector), 47.3 percent (OFE outside
the general government sector), owing to faster growth, lower yields, and the appreciating
zloty. At the end of 2006, the public debt-to-GDP ratio shall reach 49.3 percent of GDP
(OFE outside the general government sector). During the next three years, the pace of growth
of public debt-to-GDP ratio should be lower and at the end of 2009, the ratio is expected to
stabilize at the level of 52 percent (42 percent—OFE within the general government sector).
My authorities also took advantage of the favorable external environment to
substantially lengthen the average maturity and duration of debt. During 2005, Poland also
partially prepaid its Paris Club debt and is considering further early repayments and other
active debt management measures.
While risks to the public debt seem to be contained, we nonetheless agree with the
staff that the last temporary turmoil in emerging markets shows that Poland is better
insulated from market turbulence than before. The impact of the turmoil was significantly
lower than in emerging markets. Given that Poland’s debt market is by far the largest and
most liquid in the region, it is hard to compare Poland with other Central European countries,
except perhaps Hungary. JP Morgan’s Emerging Market Bond Index (EMBI) shows that
during May–June the change in spreads on Polish and Hungarian debt was similar (spreads
rose by 12 and 16 basis points, respectively). The increase in spreads was lower than in all
emerging markets (38 basis points change) and European emerging market (36 basis points
change).
As regards tax reforms, the government is considering the reduction of the high tax
wedge by lowering contributions to the Labor Fund. The government is committed to
implement this reform as a package with additional measures which allows to ensure budget
neutrality.
Monetary Policy

54
In 2005, headline inflation reached only 0.7 percent (end-year) and was one of the
lowest in the EU. This was due to lagged effects of the interest rates increases in 2004 aimed
at preventing the emergence of second-round effects of the post-accession price shock and
high oil prices, strong credibility of the central bank, slow growth in wages, an appreciating
zloty and the effects of globalization.
A low growth rate of inflation continued in 2006. This allowed the central bank to
lower the reference interest rates in the first quarter of the year to 4 percent, the lowest level
in the history of modern Poland. Although inflation has currently reached the lower band of
the continuous inflation target of 2.5 percent +/- 1, our authorities agree with the staff that for
now they should refrain from further monetary easing, as risks to inflation are on the upside.
This is mostly due to the future consequences of the accelerating wage growth, driven by fast
GDP growth, and robust mortgage credit growth. The National Bank of Poland (NBP)
projects that inflation will return to the target by the end of 2007.
My authorities agree with the staff that they should target the central rate with
symmetric risks around it to better anchor expectations and further increase the credibility of
monetary policy. The NBP is currently working on a communication strategy aimed at
further improving the quality of information on its assessment of inflation risks provided to
financial markets and to the public.
As regards the euro adoption, my authorities are convinced of its potential positive
effects on growth through lower transaction costs, lower interest rates, and higher trade and
investment. However, they are also aware of the risks of entering the euro zone without
sufficient preparation in terms of fiscal and structural reforms. While the authorities have
never officially announced a target date for the euro adoption, this date should be set while
being on the sustainable path towards meeting the relevant Maastricht criteria, which are
supposed to be fulfilled in 2009 at the latest according to the Convergence Program agreed
with the EU. Meanwhile, the government wants to place emphasis on strong economic
growth facilitating job creation and ensuring stable public finance. The decision on the date
of Poland’s entry into the Euro zone needs to be preceded by detailed analyses and should be
taken after the achievement of an appropriate degree of real convergence of the Polish
economy with the euro area. The process to fulfill the Maastricht criteria therefore should
take place gradually and with respect to the government’s priorities in the field of economic
growth and social solidarity.

Structural Reforms

55
Since fundamental reforms have largely been completed in the run-up to the EU
accession, in the past year the government has focused on areas where Poland lags behind its
peers. The government continued the reform of the judiciary system by streamlining
procedures, improving management of case flow, and implementing information systems.
This should help improve the enforcement of bank collateral, which the staff pinpointed as
one of the main barriers to wider access to bank financing. The re-established
telecommunications regulator was substantially strengthened. Access to legal professions has
been made much easier. In order to simplify access to EU funds, the government reformed
the procurement law and cut red tape. The authorities also initiated collaboration with the
World Bank on improving corporate governance. Last, but not least, the parliament
established a new institution - the Central Anti-Corruption Bureau - to combat corruption.
My authorities also strongly supported structural reforms within the EU, including
those concerning the financial and services markets. As to the latter, my authorities
contributed to the adoption of the new Services Directive, even though its final shape fell
short of our expectations.
We welcome the interesting staff paper on the flexibility of the Polish economy. We
note, however, that most of the presented source data dates back to before EU accession and
thus seems to be less relevant. For instance, product market flexibility has significantly
improved upon entering the EU (the OECD data cited by the staff is for 1998 and 2003)
thanks to the removal of barriers to trade and cross-border investment, converged legislation,
strengthened EU-wide competition watch and elimination of unauthorized discretionary
public subsidies to enterprises. In a similar vein, since the EU accession, the economy’s
openness increased by almost 10 percentage points of GDP thus closing a large part of the
gap relative to its peers, when adjusted for size. Lastly, the fact that wage growth continues
to substantially lag productivity growth seems to imply that the labor market is much more
flexible than what the staff’s paper suggests.
Continued structural reforms, fast GDP growth, and emigration to Western Europe
contributed to a faster-than-expected decrease in unemployment. As of the end of August, the
unemployment rate went down to 15.5 percent, 2.2 percentage points lower than a year
earlier. The government estimates that unemployment will decrease further to about
14 percent by the end of 2007.
Despite falling unemployment, wage growth continues to be moderate (5.3 percent
yoy in the corporate sector in August 2006). Given the dynamic labor productivity growth in
manufacturing (10.1 percent yoy in August 2006), moderate wage growth (5.9 percent yoy in
August 2006) led to lower unit labor costs and stronger competitiveness. The latter was
reflected in double-digit growth rates in exports and continued increase in the global export
share.

Financial Sector and FSSA
My authorities welcome the FSSA report. We broadly share the staff’s opinion and
appreciate the positive assessment of the soundness of the financial sector and of the progress
in implementing recommendations from the 2001 FSAP. While detailed remarks to FSSA
recommendations were delivered directly to the staff, additional comments clarifying my
authorities’ position vis à vis the staff’s recommendations are needed.
EU accession has recently been the key driving force behind the financial sector’s
development, as it enhanced competition, spurred the emergence of new products, and
contributed to improvements in the regulatory framework. EU accession has also led to a
growth in the level of sophistication of financial products and a growing number or
cross-border operations. To face the new challenges and contain increasing risk, the domestic
financial supervision needed to be strengthened. My authorities decided to consolidate all
supervisory institutions into one integrated financial sector regulator. Although the
government’s decision was not supported by the central bank, the new bill amending
supervision law was approved by the parliament and signed by the president. In the
government’s view, the new law guarantees the new regulator’s independence and
professionalism. To ensure a smooth transition period and uninterrupted preparations for the
introduction of the Basel II regulations, the integration of banking supervision into the new
regulator is planned only for 2008. Until then the newly established Financial Supervision
Authority will supervise the securities market, insurance sector and pension funds.
My authorities share the staff’s view that the collateral and insolvency regimes are
the key elements to reduce credit risk. In 2004, the new Financial Collateral Act provided a
flexible non-judiciary mechanism for collateral enforcement. At the same time, the mortgage
registry was reorganized and transferred to an electronic database to accelerate enforcement
of property rights.
As regards the staff view’s that the current list of financial instruments available to
pension funds is not sufficient, the government believes that the degree of diversification of
pension funds’ assets is not a direct consequence of limitations imposed by regulators but it
depends on the level of competition and development of the financial market.
Finally, the problem of voting rights and board representation for minority
shareholders, like other corporate governance issues, will be addressed by the new EU
directive on shareholders’ rights—currently under consideration.
