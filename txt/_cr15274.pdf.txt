IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Australia

On September 14, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
2015 Article IV consultation1 with Australia.
Australia has enjoyed exceptionally strong income growth for the past two decades, supported by
the boom in global demand for Australia’s natural resources and strong policy frameworks.
However, the economy is now facing a large transition as the mining investment boom winds
down and the terms of trade has fallen back. Growth has been below trend for two years.
Annualized GDP growth was around 2.2 percent in the first half of 2015, with particularly weak
final domestic demand, and declining public and private investment. Capacity utilization and a
soft labor market point to a sizeable output gap. Nominal wage growth is weak, contributing to
low inflation.
The terms of trade has fallen sharply over the past year. Iron ore prices have fallen by more than
a third and Australia’s commodities prices are down by around a quarter since mid-2014. The
exchange rate has depreciated further in recent months following news about economic and
financial market developments in China. This has significantly reduced the likely degree of
exchange rate overvaluation and should help support activity. Although the current account
deficit narrowed to 2.8 percent of GDP in 2014 as mining-related imports declined, it is expected
to widen somewhat in 2015.
With subdued inflation pressure, and a weaker outlook, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut
its policy rate by a further 50bps in the first half of 2015 to 2 percent. While housing investment
has picked up strongly, consumer confidence indicators and investment expectations remain
muted. Consumption growth has also been moderate reflecting weak income growth. But low
interest rates have pushed up asset prices. Overall house price inflation is close to 10 percent, but
is around 18 percent in Sydney. Buoyant housing investor lending has recently prompted
regulatory action to reinforce sound residential mortgage lending practices.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
Fiscal consolidation has become more difficult and public debt is rising, albeit from a low level.
Lower export prices and weak wage growth are denting nominal tax revenues; unemployment is
adding to expenditures. The national fiscal deficit remained at 3 percent in fiscal year (FY, JulyJune) 2014/15, broadly unchanged from the previous year. The FY 2015/16 Budget projects a
return to surplus in 2019-20. The combination of tightening by the States and the commonwealth
implies an improvement in the national cyclically-adjusted balance by some 0.7 of a percent of
GDP on average over the next three years.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended Australia’s strong economic performance over the past two
decades, which has been underpinned by sound policies, the flexible exchange rate regime,
earlier structural reforms, and a boom in the global demand for resources. They noted, however,
that declining investment in mining and a sharp fall in the terms of trade are posing
macroeconomic challenges, while potential growth is likely to slow in the period ahead.
Accordingly, Directors agreed that continued efforts to support aggregate demand and raise
productivity will be critical in transitioning to a broader-based and high growth path.
Directors noted that a supportive policy mix is needed to facilitate the structural changes
underway. With a still sizeable output gap and subdued inflation, most Directors agreed that
monetary policy is appropriately accommodative and could be eased further if the cyclical
rebound disappoints, provided financial risks remain contained. Directors also noted that the
floating exchange rate provides an important buffer for the economy.
Directors broadly agreed that a small surplus should remain a longer-term anchor of fiscal
policy. In this regard, many Directors supported the authorities’ planned pace of adjustment,
which they viewed as striking the right balance between supporting near-term activity and
addressing longer-term spending commitments. Some Directors, however, considered that
consolidation could be somewhat less frontloaded, given ample fiscal space. Directors broadly
concurred that boosting public investment would support demand, take pressure off monetary
policy, and insure against downside risks. In this context, they welcomed the authorities’
continuing to establish a pipeline of high-quality projects.
Directors highlighted that maintaining income growth at past rates and boosting potential growth
would require higher productivity growth. They expressed confidence that this could be
achieved, given Australia’s strong institutions, flexible economy, track record of undertaking
comprehensive structural reforms, and the opportunities created by Asia’s rapid growth.
Nonetheless, further reforms in a variety of areas will be required. In this regard, Directors noted
the findings of the Competition Policy Review and looked forward to their implementation.
Furthermore, addressing infrastructure needs will relieve bottlenecks and housing supply
constraints. Directors also encouraged a shift toward more efficient taxes, while ensuring
fairness.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors supported the recommendations of the Financial System Inquiry. They noted that while
banks are sound and profitable, significantly higher capital would be needed in a severe adverse
scenario to ensure a fully-functioning system. Accordingly, they welcomed the authorities’
commitment to make banks’ capital “unquestionably strong” over time. To address risks in the
housing market, Directors supported targeted action by the regulator. They cautioned that if
investor lending and house price inflation do not slow appreciably, these policies may need to be
intensified.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
August 3, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Context: Outperformance fading

 Australia has enjoyed exceptionally strong income growth for the past two decades. But
the waning resource investment boom and sharp fall in the terms of trade have brought
this to a halt. A cyclical recovery is likely in the near term, but over the medium term,
income growth is likely to slow to a rate in line with other advanced economies.
Policy agenda: Re-energizing growth by…
…sustaining demand through the resource boom transition…

 Monetary policy should remain accommodative given the sizeable output gap and
subdued inflation, and stand ready to ease further should the recovery fall short of
expectations and provided financial stability risks remain contained.
 A small surplus should remain a longer-term anchor of fiscal policy. But the planned
consolidation is somewhat more frontloaded than desirable. Increasing public investment
would support demand and insure against downside growth risks.
…lifting productivity to sustain strong income growth…

 Maintaining income growth at past rates requires higher productivity growth. There are
few low-hanging fruit, but a range of reforms have been identified. Addressing
infrastructure needs would relieve bottlenecks and housing supply constraints.
 The tax system should shift towards more efficient taxes, while ensuring fairness, including
by preventing personal income tax bracket creep and reducing the corporate tax rate, paid
for by higher GST revenue—while compensating those on lower incomes.
…and building resilience

 While sound and profitable, banks would require significantly higher capital in a severe
adverse scenario to ensure a fully-functioning system. Raising mortgage risk weights will
help, but capital ratios need to be increased substantially to ensure banks are
“unquestionably” strong.
 The regulator has taken appropriately targeted action to address areas of risk in the
housing market. If investor lending and house price inflation do not slow appreciably in
the second half of the year, these policies may need to be intensified.

AUSTRALIA

CONTEXT: THE LONG BOOM WINDS DOWN
After years of rapid growth, Australia’s outperformance is fading with a soft real economy, a maturing
financial cycle and slowing potential growth.

A strong track record…
1.

Australia has outperformed its peers for the past two decades:



GDP has grown twice as fast as its peers (averaging 3¼ percent since 1998), without a technical
recession for 25 years.



Per capita income has grown rapidly and stood at U.S. $61,000 in 2014—among the highest in
the world.



The fiscal position compares well to advanced economy peers with net debt only 15 percent of
GDP compared to 79 percent on average for G20 advanced economies.

2.
A boom in global demand for resources and migration have supported growth. From
the early 2000s, strong growth in China led to an unprecedented rise in Australia’s terms of trade
and a resources investment boom. The resources sector expanded to around 10 percent of GDP, and
accounted for close to half of GDP growth in the past three years. Net migration has contributed to
a rapidly growing population, at 1½ percent a year, among the highest in the OECD.
3.
The strong performance is also the product of sound policies and frameworks. The
flexible exchange rate facilitated the shift in resource allocation to the resource sector and contained
import price inflation during the investment boom. A flexible labor market helped accommodate the
shift in employment to resource and related sectors without undue pressure on wage or price
inflation. Credible monetary policy, strong institutions, sound financial sector supervision, and
prudent and transparent fiscal frameworks fostered a strong business environment.

…but the real economy has hit a soft patch and is facing a large transition…
4.
Growth has been below trend for two years. GDP grew by 2½ percent in the year to 2015
Q1, with particularly weak final domestic demand, and declining public and private investment. And
a recovery in non-resource investment is only gradually coming through. Capacity utilization and a
soft labor market point to a sizeable output gap.
5.
The economy is facing the largest swing in the terms of trade for 150 years. The
anticipated increase in the supply of resource commodities has been accompanied by sharper than
expected falls in prices, in part reflecting slowing growth in China. Resource export volumes have
continued to ramp up despite tumbling prices as Australian producers (especially iron ore) are very
competitive with low marginal costs. Resource equity prices have fallen back, but since the mining
companies have globally distributed shareholdings, the effect on profits is spread between Australia
and abroad.
6.
With lower terms of trade, the economy has suffered falling incomes and
unemployment has risen. Real net national disposable income per capita has been flat or falling in
the past four quarters. Unemployment has settled at a decade high of 6 percent (now above major
advanced economy peers such as the US and the UK). Employment though has held up better than
might have been expected, resulting in weak nominal wage growth, and contributing to low

7.
Recent interest rate cuts have yet to fully feed through to the broader economy. With
subdued inflation pressure and weakening outlook, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has cut its
already accommodative policy rate by a further 50bps since February. While housing investment has
picked up strongly, consumer confidence indicators are around average and investment
expectations remain muted. Business conditions and capacity utilization have begun to pick up in
recent months. Consumption growth has been moderate, reflecting weak income growth, although
the household saving rate has begun to fall back from a high level.

8.
The exchange rate has depreciated but is still on the strong side. While iron ore prices
have fallen by more than a third and Australia’s commodities prices are down 25 percent since mid2014, the real effective exchange rate was only 6
percent lower in June. Recent movements appear
Commodity prices fall more than AUS$
to be driven by shifts in the global economy—U.S.
dollar appreciation, euro/yen depreciation and market
volatility due to developments in China and Greece
(see Box 1), coupled with still attractive Australian
yields. Although the current account deficit narrowed
to 2.8 percent of GDP in 2014 as mining-related
imports declined, it is expected to widen in 2015 as
export prices fall, and the net international liabilities
position widens (Box 2 and Annex II).

Since the summer of 2014 a confluence of large external
shocks have affected the current account outlook—
(1) sharply falling commodity export prices and terms of
trade, (2) a decline in oil prices, and (3) large bilateral
exchange rate movements for the U.S. dollar, euro and Yen,
all with different effects on the current account:



Lower commodity export prices are partly offset by the continued ramp up in export volumes resulting
in a moderate decline in export values. Since the profits from Australian resource companies are globally
distributed, the net income deficit stays at around 2 percent of GDP.



Lower oil prices have a mild positive effect on the trade balance (net oil imports of 2 percent of GDP). But
LNG prices have also declined as they are linked to the oil price with a lag. Over the medium term as
Australia becomes a larger exporter of LNG, this effect will begin to dominate.



Bilateral exchange rate movements. The Australian dollar has depreciated sharply against the U.S. dollar
but by a smaller amount in nominal and real effective terms (down 9 percent from a recent peak). While
this should help boost the competitiveness of non-resource exports—and there are signs that services
exports are picking up—the real exchange rate still looks high relative to the decline in the terms of trade.



Lower mining investment is contributing to a fall in capital goods imports and together with the
depreciation should moderate import growth.

In 2015 the current account deficit is expected to widen to 3½ percent of GDP as the fall in resource
exports outweighs the other developments. Over the medium term the current account deficit should
remain contained at around 3½ percent of GDP as the trade balance narrows and the income deficit widens as
global interest rates normalize and mining income accruing to foreign investors rises. The main effects on the
domestic economy are reflected in the increase in the net exports contribution and the positive effect on
rebalancing of growth from the lower exchange rate (see Outlook).
Staff assess that the external sector position remains moderately weaker and the real exchange rate
moderately stronger than warranted by fundamentals. Model-based approaches in the IMF’s External
Balance Assessment for 2014 together with the trends through to May 2015 suggest that the real exchange
rate appears overvalued by 0-15 percent and the current account is sustainable and looks around 0-1½
percent weaker than implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies globally and domestically.
The depreciation since June has narrowed the exchange rate gap a little. The strength of the Australian dollar
may reflect the attractiveness of Australian assets with continued strong capital inflows, likely related to a
global search for yield, and extraordinary monetary easing in the major advanced economies. Policy tightening
in other advanced economies or monetary easing in Australia could result in a further depreciation, which
would narrow the external imbalance and support the transition to non-resource based growth.

…and the financial cycle is maturing
10.
The financial and real sectors are at different stages of the cycle. The output gap and
the financial cycle have diverged since the peak of the mining investment boom in 2012. Low
interest rates have helped push up asset prices and more interest sensitive sectors whereas the real
economy has softened.

There are no signs of a generalized credit boom. Overall credit growth has continued at a
moderate pace, picking up to 5.9 percent (y/y) in June. While credit to GDP is rising, this reflects
weak nominal growth rather than rapid credit growth. However, housing credit is rising at a faster
pace, 7.3 percent in June, led by investor credit at 10.9 percent, and accounting for almost half of all
housing credit growth.

Box 3. Are Australian House Prices Overvalued?
International comparisons persistently signal warnings. The level of real house prices and the house price to
income ratio is high relative to the OECD average (though similar to other buoyant markets). House price inflation
picked up to 7-10 percent in 2014-15—driven by rapid increases in Sydney and to a lesser extent Melbourne (prices
in the resource states have fallen back in recent months). While foreign investment in real estate has increased, the
main driver has been local investor lending and interest-only loans. Sydney house price to income ratios are much
higher than for other cities at around 7—similar to Auckland, London, Stockholm and Vancouver.

Are high and rising prices a problem? There has been no

appreciation since 1955 (Fox and Tulip, 2014). However, this estimate is highly sensitive to interest rates and
expectations of future house price appreciation. Using a plausibly lower expected appreciation term results in an
overvaluation of 10-19 percent.
Bottom line: House prices are moderately overvalued, probably around 10 percent. The problem is concentrated in
Sydney and is fuelled by investor credit and interest only loans. Current rates of house price inflation imply rising
overvaluation.

Buoyant housing investor lending has prompted regulatory action. The Australian
Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) adopted a gradual and targeted approach and advised
banks in December 2014 that it would focus on higher risk mortgage lending (interest only and high
loan to income or value ratios), reining in growth of investor lending above 10 percent a year, and
strengthening loan serviceability tests (by increasing interest rate buffers and floors). Failure by
banks to take action would trigger more intense supervisory action, potentially including additional
capital requirements. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) is reviewing
whether mortgage lenders’ interest-only lending complies with their responsible lending
obligations. Banks have responded since mid-2015 by reducing discounts on investor lending,
curtailing high loan to value ratio loans and tightening interest only lending, though these are yet to
be reflected in lending data given preapproval lags of 2-3 months. Separately, in response to the
findings of the Financial System Inquiry, APRA announced that capital adequacy requirements for
large banks using the internal risk based ratings approach would be increased (see Box 7).

Political setting. The Liberal-National coalition is more than half way through its term in
office with the next federal election due by January 2017. The coalition has a majority in House of

further, residential investment continues to grow and business investment gradually turns
around as improvements in business confidence and rising capacity utilization feed through. The
recovery is supported by strong corporate balance sheets, the weaker exchange rate, historically
low interest rates and contained wages pressure .


Consumption growth remains restrained in the near term with low wage growth, and more
muted income expectations—as the financial cycle matures and house price inflation slows. But
it improves further ahead, underpinned by rising confidence, a drawdown of the savings ratio
from high levels, and a pickup in income growth following the stabilization of the terms of trade.

15.
Inflation stays in line with the RBA’s target of 2-3 percent. Inflation expectations are
well anchored. Tradables inflation rises as the effects of the exchange rate depreciation pass through
and oil prices stabilize. But non tradables inflation remains relatively contained, dampened by weak
wages growth.
16.
But Australia’s outperformance is likely to fade in the medium term. Medium-term
potential growth is likely to be around 2½ percent rather than the 3¼ percent of the past, bringing
per capita GDP growth back to the advanced economy average of around 1 percent.
17.
The financial cycle is likely to decelerate. The policy rate is expected by markets to
eventually begin rising, while inflation remains well anchored in line with the target of 2-3 percent.
Banks are likely to raise capital ratios (Box 4). Growth of lending for housing, the bulk of total
lending, is likely to slow as house price inflation moderates partly in response to higher interest
rates. This, combined with high household debt, and fiscal consolidation picking up, may all slow the
closing of the output gap.

moderation of the current high household savings rate.

• Growth down

Financial System
• Negative (ratings down grade ,funding pressure, eats into

• Occurs while banks are aiming to raise capital ratios
• Credit conditions tighten



Persistently weak domestic demand. Non-resource demand could be slower to pick up (for
example, due to a weak transmission of monetary policy to consumer demand and business
investment) and further terms of trade falls could entrench slower growth, higher
unemployment and fiscal deficits, especially if there is reform inertia, and in a scenario where
there are global deflationary forces and/or falling house prices.



Housing market hard landing. Current efforts to rein in riskier property lending might not be
sufficiently effective. Against a backdrop of already high house prices and household debt, this
could give rise to price overshooting and excessive risk taking. A sharp correction in house
prices, possibly driven by Sydney, could be triggered by external conditions (e.g., a sharper
slowdown in China or a rise in global risk premia, Box 5) or a domestic shock to employment.
This might have wider ramifications if it affects confidence. The house price cycle could be
amplified by leveraged investors looking to exit the market and a turning commercial property
cycle. Though currently small, investors in self managed superannuation funds that have added
geared property to their fund portfolios would also be adversely affected in a downturn. In a tail
scenario, APRA’s stress tests (Box 8) suggest banks would probably face ratings
downgrades/higher offshore funding costs and would likely resist capital ratios falling into

capital conservation territory by sharply tightening credit conditions, thus transmitting and
amplifying the shock to the rest of the economy.

Box 5. Balance Sheet Risks—Housing and Foreign Borrowing
The composition of an economy’s assets and liabilities can help to illustrate likely resilience to financial shocks
and identify vulnerabilities. It can also highlight the main transmission channels of risk. For Australia the key
issue is:



Net liability position with the rest of the world. Throughout its history Australia has been a capital
importer with an overall net liability position with the rest of the world. This reflects very high private
investment relative to a savings rate that is already high by international standards. As a result, the net
liability position has ranged from 50 to around 60 percent of GDP since 1994. This could give rise to
vulnerabilities were the rest of the world to become much less willing or able to lend to Australia.
However, these vulnerabilities are substantially mitigated as most liabilities are Australian dollar
denominated whereas the majority of foreign assets are in foreign currency, leaving Australia with a net
foreign currency asset position. The banking sector, which has a net foreign currency liability position, is
fully hedged. The balance sheet would thus improve rather than worsen in the face of a sudden Australian
dollar depreciation.

The main transmission channels are:



Banks’ use of external funding. Households could be vulnerable in the face of a foreign funding induced
shock; especially given a high level of household debt, much of which is at a floating interest rate—higher
funding costs would likely be passed on by banks to households which may stretch the capacity to repay
though currently households have mortgage buffers (two years debt service).



Other financial institutions. The growth of superannuation funds is increasing households’ exposure to
changes in equity wealth, and away from other, possibly more stable, forms of saving (e.g. bank deposits).



Non financial corporate sector has a net liability position with other sectors and with the external sector
but has a small net foreign currency asset position. Large private non financial corporations (global
resource sector conglomerates) typically finance themselves abroad and profits are globally distributed.



Strong public balance sheet with a small negative net financial worth. The government is a AAA
borrower, and borrows in domestic currency. The public sector, RBA and the Future Fund have net foreign
currency asset positions.



Two key external risks could trigger or amplify these risks.


China. A sharp growth slowdown accompanied by market volatility, and/or fall in property
investment, could lead to a further large fall in demand for Australia’s commodity exports.
Over half of Australia’s exports go to emerging Asia and nearly two thirds are non-rural
commodity exports. An unexpectedly sharp fall in iron ore prices could reduce prices below
production costs, and further dent incomes and growth. It would also likely dent foreign
investment in Australian property and other markets, adversely affecting prices.



Tighter or more volatile global financial conditions. An orderly QE exit in the United
States would likely have a positive impact on Australia by weakening the exchange rate and
fostering the recovery of the non-resource sector. However, a bumpy exit, or Euro Area
turbulence could raise volatility and wholesale funding costs, and this could be amplified by
low market liquidity. This could be passed on to mortgage lending costs, resulting in a real
estate downturn.

19.
These are partly offset by upside risks. With supportive monetary policy, possibly
accompanied by productivity-enhancing reforms, business investment and domestic demand could
pick up more than in the baseline, creating virtuous feedback loops with the labor market,
household confidence and spending. A sharper decline in the real exchange rate could boost export
competitiveness and improve investment prospects. Growth in middle-income Asia could also turn
out stronger than expected, adding to demand for Australian services exports.
20.
There is policy space to cushion downside risks. Targeted prudential actions could
potentially help to engineer a soft landing of the housing market similar to in the early 2000s.
Should downside risks materialize, the RBA has scope to ease policy further and low government
debt allows more supportive fiscal policy, including through discretionary recurrent stimulus if
needed. Foreign exchange intervention could also be employed in times of market dysfunction as it
was during the global financial crisis.

Spillovers
21.
Risks could potentially spillover to neighboring economies. New Zealand is Australia’s
most important trade and financial partner, and is vulnerable to a sharp slowdown in Australia’s
economic prospects. Australian bank subsidiaries make up 90 percent of New Zealand’s banking
system. As subsidiaries rather than branches however, New Zealand banks are ring fenced, do not
rely on their parents for funding, and are well capitalized with substantial liquidity buffers, although
they would likely suffer indirect reputational effects from financial stress in the parent which could
affect access to offshore wholesale funding. Statutory obligations underpin cross-border
cooperation between the two countries, strengthening regulatory and supervisory oversight. With a
common labor market, net migration between the two countries is also important—and as Australia
has slowed, net migration to New Zealand has turned positive.
22.
Trade and financial linkages would also result in spillovers to the Pacific Island
Countries (PICs). Spillover channels vary across the PICs. Australia accounts, on average, for
20 percent of PICs’ trade, while tourist arrivals from Australia account for about 50 percent of total
arrivals in Fiji and Vanuatu. Remittances from Australia represent around 35 percent of the total in
Fiji, Samoa, and Vanuatu. Financial linkages are also important with the PICs’ banking sector
dominated by Australian banks. Australia is also by far the largest aid donor—and its aid budget has
been reduced—as well as the largest foreign investor.

Authorities’ Views
23.
Economic conditions were in place to generate a gradual strengthening of growth
supported by highly accommodative monetary policy settings. The economy was considered to
have performed solidly in the context of an unprecedented fall in the terms of trade and the
associated waning of the resources investment boom. The recent decline in the exchange rate would
help the transition to stronger and more balanced growth although a further depreciation would
assist. Weak income growth was weighing on domestic demand, although moderate wages growth
was also supporting employment and the economy’s growth transition. The timing of the
anticipated strengthening of growth in the non-mining economy was uncertain and the authorities
viewed the possibility of a sharper than expected slowdown in China as the main external risk, while
noting that the floating exchange rate plays a key role in cushioning the economy against such
shocks.
24.
Housing prices were rising but the risks should not be overstated. Accommodative
monetary policy had supported strong demand for housing, raising house prices and increasing
dwelling construction, contributing to the economy’s transition to broader-based growth. Rapid
house price growth was concentrated in Sydney and only limited market segments of Melbourne,
but there was no evidence of widespread oversupply and most mortgage holders had accumulated
sizeable repayment buffers. The coordinated policy actions announced by APRA in December 2014
were taking effect (see paragraph 50). There remained policy space to respond to risks that
materialize—and it would be used actively if needed to contain the likelihood of an adverse event.

POLICIES TO RE-ENERGIZE GROWTH
Reinvigorating the outlook requires policymakers being on the front foot to enable
Australia to make the most of its considerable potential. This means:


Sustaining aggregate demand in the shorter term through the resource cycle transition



Lifting productivity in the longer term to sustain strong income growth



Building resilience and reducing the macroeconomic and financial vulnerabilities that could
throw the transition to broader-based growth off course

A. Sustaining Aggregate Demand Through The Resource Cycle Transition
“Monetary policy alone can't deliver everything we need and expecting too much from it can lead, in
time, to much bigger problems”
RBA Governor Stevens June 2015

Context
25.
The sizeable output gap and the large structural transition of the economy call for
supportive aggregate demand policies. Inflation pressures are weak and the demand outlook is
subdued against a backdrop of higher unemployment and lower income growth. The exchange rate
also appears still on the strong side when compared with the steep fall in the terms of trade.

Real Policy Rate

Monetary policy is accommodative, and could become more so. While the policy rate is
at an historic low at 2 percent, it remains high in real terms compared to peer countries with similar

Staff Views
28.
Monetary policy should remain accommodative and could loosen further if the
recovery falls short of expectations, provided financial stability risks remain contained.


Asymmetric risks for monetary policy—inflation expectations are well anchored and core
inflation and growth appear more likely to under- rather than over-shoot. A weaker exchange
rate would also help the recovery and the external position.



Housing market risks should be firmly addressed by prudential policy. While credit growth
and the housing market overall do not appear substantially overheated, there are clearly specific
areas of concern relating to the Sydney housing market, and to investor and interest-only
lending. This calls for a targeted prudential rather than a blunt monetary policy response.
Indeed, APRA is already taking targeted measures which could be built upon if needed (see
Building Resilience).



Policy tradeoffs. Cutting rates if the recovery disappoints would provide insurance against a
sharper slowdown, though it may require a steeper tightening once the economy gathers steam.
By contrast, keeping rates higher than warranted by output and inflation should only be
considered if financial stability risks become broad based—with overheating of both credit and
housing indicators—and if prudential policy is insufficient to contain risks. Then “leaning against
the wind’ might be appropriate as part of a broader prudential strategy to rein in financial
stability risks. The benefits would need to be weighed against the output costs and the risk of
policy reversals. Similarly, prudential measures aimed at building the resilience of the financial
system should be implemented in a gradual manner to minimize the effects on growth.



Timely high frequency data are important for policy to be able to react quickly to changing
conditions. The quality of the labor market data could be enhanced and the lack of monthly
consumer price inflation data is a key gap that the Australian Bureau of Statistics should fill.

29.
Slowing the pace of fiscal consolidation. A small surplus should remain a longer-term
anchor of fiscal policy and a credible, though gradual medium-term consolidation path should be
maintained. But, staff assesses the planned pace of consolidation nationally (Commonwealth and

monetary policy, and insure against downside growth risks. It would employ resources released by
the mining sector, catalyze private investment, boost productivity, could ease housing supply
bottlenecks and would take advantage of record low interest rates. Net public investment in
Australia is higher than in advanced OECD peers, but has subtracted from growth in recent years,
and the public capital stock is projected to fall as a percentage of GDP over the medium term. At the
same time, Australia is well positioned to benefit from public infrastructure investment—with
efficient processes, an output gap, accommodative monetary policy and fiscal space allowing debt
financing. These are key factors for maximizing the short- and long-run benefits with little effect on
the debt to GDP ratio, as outlined in the WEO (October 2014).
31.
Careful coordination would be needed. Boosting public investment in the short term is
difficult given inherent lags, and thus calls for strong governance to ensure there is no waste. As
most public investment is carried out by states and territories who face borrowing constraints, this
requires coordination between different levels of government and broader federal support. Greater
focus in budgeting on the national fiscal stance, on strengthening the operating balance (which
excludes capital spending) rather than the overall balance, and on increasing the public capital
stock, could help frame the debate. A strategy could include:


Small as well as large projects. Broadening the scope of investments supported by the
Commonwealth, for example, to a wider range of projects, including repairs and maintenance.



A pipeline. Continuing to establish a pipeline of quality larger projects with transparent costbenefit analysis, such as that being prepared by Infrastructure Australia. Broad political support
for such a pipeline would reduce uncertainty and boost confidence.



Guarantees. In addition to direct funding arrangements, the Commonwealth could consider
guaranteeing states’ borrowing for additional investment—this would keep the accountability
with the states, but reduce their concerns about credit ratings and would not affect the
Commonwealth’s deficit.

32.
Nonetheless, restoring a small budget surplus in the longer term is appropriate and
should remain a fiscal anchor. Australia’s low public debt is a critical buffer against potential
external and domestic shocks and helps sustain the country’s AAA rating, and the strong ratings of
its banks. Indeed, additional measures may be required to ensure the envisaged consolidation of the
recurrent budget stays on track.

Authorities’ Views
33.
The authorities agreed that growth was likely to continue at a below trend pace in the
near term but improve as the economy rebalances.


The RBA noted that with an output gap, subdued labor costs and inflation expected to remain in
line with the target of 2-3 percent on average, there was scope for further policy easing in the
period ahead if required. But there was also a limit to the extent to which monetary policy could
fine tune growth prospects. Exchange rate developments would also be key; a lower real
effective exchange rate was likely to be needed to achieve balanced growth. An exit from

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

unconventional monetary policies in the U.S. could contribute to a lower Australian dollar and
help facilitate adjustment.


The government emphasized that a return to a budget surplus remained a priority to preserve
its favorable standing with external creditors. The 2015/16 budget already planned a slower
withdrawal of fiscal stimulus than the previous budget. They were also mindful that challenges
were looming in light of social spending commitments over the longer term which could limit
the scope for easing the pace of consolidation. They concurred that addressing infrastructure
bottlenecks was a key priority and funding of high quality infrastructure projects was a key
focus. They also pointed to substantial existing planned investments, including the national
broadband network, with total general government investment over coming years expected to
remain above levels of the 1990s and early 2000s. The authorities’ Asset Recycling Initiative and
Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility provided scope for additional investment in high
priority infrastructure projects as they are identified, while meeting the government’s mediumterm fiscal strategy.

Slower productivity growth partly reflects the long investment lags for mining. Since the
early 2000s, mining investment, the impact of drought on agriculture and utilities, and high
profits in mining which led to the mining of marginal deposits, resulted in a slowdown in total
factor productivity growth. Productivity in the mining sector is rising as exports come on stream.
But this is likely insufficient to maintain per capita income growth—productivity growth in other
sectors will need to rise (Box 6).
Box 6. Income Growth Likely to Slow

Australia’s potential growth is likely to be lower than in the past. Based on a standard production function
framework, potential growth is estimated to slow to 2.8 percent over 2016-17, further declining to 2.6 percent over
2018-2020, driven by moderate input and slowing TFP growth (see Selected Issues Paper “Sustaining Income Growth
in Australia” for details). This is slower than the estimated historical average of around 3.2 percent over 1990-2014.
As a result, income growth will be weaker. Gross domestic income growth (adjusting for terms of trade
movements) is projected to slow from an average of

Though politically challenging, fiscal reforms can help raise potential growth
substantially and generate revenue. A recent IMF study estimated the per capita growth impact of
previous fiscal reform episodes could be around ¾ percentage points on average, though it is
difficult to disentangle the effects of fiscal from other types of reform initiated at the same time. The
Tax and Federation Reviews provide the opportunity to craft a package to boost labor supply and
investment which should include the following interconnected elements:


Shifting toward more efficient and simple taxes. Key goals would be to prevent a large share
of individual taxpayers from facing higher tax rates through unchecked bracket creep (which

estate tax and excises.



Reducing incentives for potentially excessive financial investment in housing. As the
Financial System Inquiry notes, the concessional treatment of capital gains tax in real estate and
the exemption of owner-occupied housing for the calculation of the Age Pension incentivizes
overinvestment in housing and negative gearing, significantly pushing up demand and real
estate prices. This is reinforced by the deductibility of interest payments and maintenance
expenses for rental properties from taxable income from other sources (though rental income is
taxed). Reducing the concessional treatment of capital gains and the deductibility of housing

Aligning tax rates on contributions closer to personal income tax rates would reduce

and financial stability. Adjusting pension policies in particular would need careful calibration and

38.
Adjusting federal-fiscal relations. Federal-state fiscal relations will likely need to be
adjusted to facilitate the tax reform. There are many options—one could be for states to receive
higher GST revenue and autonomy in return for greater spending responsibilities. This could also
help increase spending efficiency. More generally, greater coordination of the fiscal policy stance
between the Commonwealth and States could facilitate macroeconomic management.

Authorities’ Views
39.
Achieving a return to strong nominal income growth would require continued focus
on productivity enhancing reforms. The Treasury projected potential growth at close to
3¼ percent a year, supported by strong population growth, a rising participation rate, and an
assumption that labor productivity growth in line with historical experience. Total factor productivity
growth was likely to pick up now that the export phase of the mining boom had been reached.
However ongoing effort to deliver productivity enhancing reforms would be required to achieve the
growth rates in national income achieved in the past. The comprehensive reforms of the 1980s-early
2000s made a major contribution to Australia’s past productivity performance and, the productivity
gap in some sectors relative to the global frontier offered scope for catch up. Over the longer term,
external demand for goods and services from a rising middle class in Asia would help boost
potential growth. Recently concluded free trade agreements with China, Japan and Korea would
help as well. Unlike other economies, where multifactor productivity growth was inhibited following
financial system dislocation, this was not the case for Australia. Nonetheless, declines in global
productivity growth would have implications for Australia, further highlighting the importance of
domestic reform efforts to sustain growth in living standards.
40.
The authorities thought that competition, tax, workplace relations and federal
relations reforms could play an important role in raising economic efficiency. There were
review processes currently underway examining these issues. Any changes to the tax and

superannuation system would also need to have regard to Australia’s already highly-progressive tax
and welfare arrangements and ensure that they take account of investment decisions people have
already made in good faith on the basis of existing policy.

C. Building Resilience
“[Banks’] capital levels should be raised to ensure they are unquestionably strong. Evidence from
banks, regulators and others suggests that Australian banks are not in the top quartile of large
internationally active banks. Regulatory changes in other countries may further weaken the relative
position of Australian banks.”
Financial System Inquiry final report, November 2014

Context
41.
Australia’s financial system weathered the global financial crisis well, aided by flexible
monetary policy, a strong fiscal position, and prudent supervision. The major banks are highly
rated and profitable compared with peers. Recent performance has been strong with a low level of
non-performing loans, a decline in funding costs and reliance on external borrowing, and higher
capital ratios.
42.
But the financial system faces long-standing structural vulnerabilities. The four major
banks are systemic with broadly similar business models. As a capital importer, exposed to terms of
trade shocks and with a still relatively high proportion of offshore wholesale funding (though
significantly reduced since the GFC and at extended maturities), the economy is vulnerable to
changes in international investor sentiment. Residential mortgages account for a large proportion of
banks’ assets and household leverage is high.
43.
The rise in capital ratios of the major four
banks may not be a reflection of lower financial
stability risks. Since 2008, as in many other countries,
much the improvement in capital ratios for large
banks (with internal risk based ratings) has been
driven by a shift in banks’ loan books toward housing
and a lowering of mortgage risks weights. This has led
to a wide divergence between the risk weights
attached to mortgages between the big and smaller
banks. It may also encourage lending for housing
rather than to business.

The Financial System Inquiry (FSI) concluded that more should be done to strengthen
the system’s resilience. The Inquiry (Box 7) argued that Australia needed to be better placed than
other economies given its structural vulnerabilities, with a strong public balance sheet remaining a
critical backstop, and the banks should have unquestionably strong capital levels and sufficient loss
absorbing capacity to mitigate risks.

Box 7. The Financial System Inquiry
The Inquiry published its findings in December 2014. Key recommendations included:



Set capital ratios such that Australian banks are “unquestionably strong”. The Inquiry argued that this
would be equivalent to aiming for bank capital ratios that are in the top quartile internationally. While
acknowledging that comparisons are difficult, given differences in both capital measurement and risk
weighted assets, the Inquiry used a schematic to demonstrate a range which estimates where
Australian banks current CET1 ratios lie on an internationally comparable basis (10-11.6 percent) and
where they would need to be to be in the top quartile internationally (12.2 percent and upwards) .



Raise average mortgage risk weights for banks using internal ratings based models. In July, APRA
announced an increase in average mortgage risk weights for these banks from around 16 to at least
25 percent by July 2016. This is equivalent to an 80 basis point change in the CET1 ratio. The increase
is an interim step pending the finalization of the Basel Committee’s review. The change narrows the
difference in capital adequacy requirements between banks using IRB and standardized approaches.



Report transparently on capital ratios against Basel minimum capital framework.



Introduce a leverage ratio that acts as a backstop to banks’ risk-weighted capital positions.

APRA’s subsequent study confirmed that, on an internationally comparable basis, Australian banks’ CET1
ratios would be around 300 basis points higher on average—this would place them above the median of
international peers, but not in the top quartile as proposed by the Inquiry. Furthermore, to achieve a
position in the top quartile for a range of capital adequacy measures, Australian banks would require
significantly higher capital ratios. To be comfortably positioned in the top quartile, APRA noted that the
major banks would need to increase their capital ratios by at least 200 bps relative to the June 2014
position.

Staff Views
45.
To strengthen financial system resilience, building “unquestionably strong“ bank
buffers is a welcome goal. The particular vulnerabilities—housing, concentration and offshore
funding—can transmit shocks from the financial system to the wider economy with spillback effects
on the financial system. The housing and commercial property markets are prone to cycles and a
large house price decline would hit the real economy hard. APRA’s stress tests (Box 8) note that

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

AUSTRALIA

while bank capital remains above the 4½ percent solvency ratio in an adverse scenario “it is unlikely
that Australia would have the fully functioning banking system it would like in such an environment.”
Avoiding this scenario with a high degree of certainty would likely require capital ratios substantially
higher than 9 percent currently.
Box 8. APRA Stress Tests
In November 2014, APRA conducted a stress test of the
Australian banking system, focused on housing. APRA
considered two severe tail macroeconomic stress scenarios,
developed in collaboration with the Reserve Bank of Australia
(RBA) and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ).

1/ Capital conservation buffer reflects D-SIB surcharge effective
January 1, 2016.

Scenario B: Higher interest rates. In the face of strong growth and emerging inflation, the RBA raises
the cash rate significantly. Global growth weakens and a sharp drop in commodity prices leads to
increased uncertainty and volatility in financial markets. This leads to higher unemployment and
higher borrowing in Australia and a significant fall in house prices.

Results. In each scenario banks face higher funding costs and credit losses, with a significant adverse
impact on profitability and capital ratios. Losses on residential mortgages account for around one-third of
total credit losses. The aggregate Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio falls by around 3 percentage points
from 8.9 percent (though all banks remain above the minimum CET1 capital requirement of 4.5 per cent).
Losses are greater than the capital held for housing for the internal ratings based risk weight (IRB) banks
and almost all banks would use capital conservation buffers and face constraints on dividend and bonus
payouts. Even though CET1 requirements are not breached, the head of APRA concluded that “it is unlikely
that Australia would have the fully-functioning banking system it would like in such an environment. Banks
with substantially reduced capital ratios would be severely constrained in their ability to raise funding (both
in availability and pricing), and hence in their ability to advance credit. In short, we would have survived the
stress, but the aftermath might not be entirely comfortable”

46.
Gradually building higher capital and loss-absorbing capacity would reduce the risks
from a highly concentrated banking system. Even after taking into account the strengths of
Australia’s prudential system (and conservative measurement of capital), banks appear to have
capital above the median internationally but not in the top quartile of banks. Other economies
facing similar risks are taking a variety of different measures to boost capital and tighten risk
weights (Hong Kong, Sweden and Switzerland)—the global trend is towards higher capital. Options
to increase capital include:


26

Higher risk weights. Risk weights on mortgages are at historically low levels. Other jurisdictions
(such as Sweden) have introduced risk weight floors for residential mortgages. APRA’s move to

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

AUSTRALIA

raise average risk weights for IRB banks is
therefore welcome. Australia’s relatively
conservative loss given default of 20 percent
should be retained.


Pillar 2. APRA can require adjustments to
capital above the minimum level after
reviewing an institution’s risk profile,
management and mitigation strategies to
address systemic and concentration risks.
Such Pillar 2 adjustments could be used to
raise capital ratios for the major banks (and
could be reduced in an adverse scenario).

Other jurisdictions have higher capital and risk weights

1/ Includes systemic buffer of 3 percent.



Counter-cyclical capital buffer. Use of the
countercyclical buffer could help both slow excessive risk buildup in an upswing and cushion the
impact on the real economy in the downswing. From 2016 APRA could set a countercyclical
buffer at a rate of 0-2.5 percent (others such as Norway and Switzerland have already imposed a
positive rate). Application of the buffer could be warranted in the current conditions of a mature
financial cycle, though the decision to activate it would need to go beyond the strict credit-gap
approach and should include scope for discretion and judgment.



Higher D-SIB surcharge. This would provide higher loss absorbency. The minimum D-SIB
surcharge of 1 percent seems on the low side, especially as a number of other countries with
similar banking sector characteristics (Norway, Sweden) have applied much higher surcharges.
However, a drawback of using the D-SIB surcharge is that since the minimum requirement rises,
the capital conservation buffers would be quickly reached in an adverse scenario and banks may
restrain lending before they hit these buffers, as they may be concerned about the market
reaction if they use them.



A higher leverage ratio should complement higher capital requirements. It would serve as
backstop, consistent with the substantially higher capital ratio thresholds and it would be useful
in containing both ratings drift and the potential for lending to shift to lower-risk weighted
housing loans. A leverage ratio at the upper end of the 3-5 percent suggested by the FSI would
seem be appropriate.

47.
The benefits of raising capital gradually over time are likely to outweigh the costs
which are low. The major Australian banks are exceptionally profitable, enjoy a funding cost
advantage derived partly from implicit government support, earn larger net interest margins than
smaller domestic banks and international peers, have high price-to-book ratios, pay out high
dividends, and are not balance-sheet constrained in providing credit. Lowering dividend payout
ratios to international norms would comfortably allow building substantially stronger buffers over
time at little or no cost to the economy, especially if done at a gradual pace.

48.
Addressing emerging housing market risks. While investor lending is still rising strongly
some months after APRA flagged its program of enhanced attention, staff expects APRA’s measures
to begin to take effect and be reflected in slower credit growth in the second half of 2015. However,
should investor lending growth or house price inflation fail to slow appreciably, the authorities
would likely need to intensify their targeted approach with options including:


Higher risk weights for investor/interest-only lending, perhaps targeted by geography (e.g.,
just Sydney, similar to those recently introduced in New Zealand), could also be considered.



Capital. While APRA elevated its intensity of supervision with the measures adopted in
December 2014, additional Pillar 2 capital requirements should be considered for large players
that are still expanding their investor lending portfolios rapidly.



Interest only loans. A maximum interest only period could be considered to reduce the
repayment risk from these types of loans.



Tax system. In the context of a broader reform of the tax system, incentives that give rise to the
high degree of household and bank exposure to housing should be reduced.

Authorities’ Views
49.
The authorities agreed that higher capital would be beneficial to increase the
resilience of the financial system. They supported the findings of the FSI to make banks
“unquestionably strong” and APRA was taking this forward. Any changes would need to be line with
evolving international standards and commensurate with the risks. Regulatory changes would need
to be gradual and the stability of policy settings was also an important goal to minimize
unnecessary costs. Capital raising actions needed to take into account that APRA already imposes
more conservative requirements compared to most other countries and that they also adopt an
intensive supervisory approach. Nonetheless, recent stress tests and the FSI suggested that more
needed to be done to strengthen banks’ capital ratios to ensure they were unquestionably strong
and so that they could withstand severe economic stress and maintain their supply of new credit to
the economy. APRA is currently considering what action to take, they are monitoring the calibration
of the D-SIB surcharge in the context of industry and international developments.
50.
The key areas of risk from investor lending, particularly in Sydney, were being
addressed and contained. The authorities’ emphasized that the acceleration in investor lending
had led to a gradual and targeted response, and that the effects of this were beginning to show with
banks reducing or eliminating discounts for some borrowers. Banks have also tightened mortgage
serviceability tests in response to increased supervisory focus on this aspect of their lending
practices. As a result, investor credit growth was expected to slow in the second half of 2015, but
this also did not rule out Pillar 2 actions if individual banks failed to rein in investor lending. They
also pointed to a wide range of legal powers that enable direct action where there are threats to
financial stability. APRA generally prefers to adopt a suasion approach when it identifies weaknesses
in lending standards, with communication with the management and boards central to the

28

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

AUSTRALIA

approach. Coordination is conducted through the Council of Financial Regulators which includes the
Treasury and ASIC as well as APRA and the RBA. The authorities highlighted this framework’s success
in helping cool the housing market following the large run up in house prices in the early 2000s.

STAFF APPRAISAL
51.
Outlook. Australia has outperformed its peers for the past two decades driven by a boom in
the global demand for resources and supported by sound policies and frameworks. But the waning
resource investment boom and sharp fall in the terms of trade have brought this outperformance to
an end. A cyclical recovery is likely in the near term as net exports improve and accommodative
monetary policy supports investment. But potential growth is likely to fall over the medium term,
reflecting weak productivity growth.
52.
Risks. While Australia’s vulnerabilities are low, the risks are skewed downwards. Domestic
demand could pick up more slowly than expected, a house price correction could knock confidence
and demand, and external risks—a sharper China slowdown or more volatile global financial
conditions—could trigger or amplify these risks. But on the upside, domestic demand could respond
more quickly to recent monetary policy stimulus, and the exchange rate could depreciate further,
stimulating the tradable sector. There is also policy space to cushion downside risks.
53.
Policy agenda. The weaker outlook can be avoided. Australia has strong institutions, a
flexible economy, and is well placed to seize opportunities created by Asia’s rapid growth.
Reinvigorating the outlook requires policymakers being on the front foot to enable Australia to
make the most of its considerable potential.
54.
Sustaining demand through the resource boom transition. The output gap and large
structural transition of the economy call for supportive aggregate demand policies.


Monetary policy. Given the sizeable output gap and subdued inflation, monetary policy should
remain accommodative and stand ready to ease further should the recovery fall short of
expectations and provided financial stability risks remain contained.



Fiscal policy. A small surplus should remain a longer-term anchor of fiscal policy. But staff
assesses the planned consolidation as somewhat more frontloaded than desirable. Boosting
public investment would support demand, take the pressure off monetary policy, and insure
against downside growth risks. This would need careful coordination between different levels of
government and broader federal support.

55.
Lifting productivity to sustain strong income growth. Maintaining income growth at past
rates requires higher productivity growth. This could be achieved with an ambitious reform agenda.
 Many targets, no silver bullets. There are few low-hanging fruit, but a range of reforms have
been identified. The Competition Policy Review recommended reforms to strengthen
competition and improve efficiency in the human services and retail sector. Addressing

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

29

AUSTRALIA

infrastructure needs would relieve bottlenecks and housing supply constraints. The recent trade
agreements should also help.
 Though politically challenging, fiscal reforms can help. The tax system should shift towards
more efficient taxes, while ensuring fairness, including by preventing personal income tax bracket
creep and reducing the corporate tax rate, paid for by higher GST revenue.
56.
Building resilience. Implementing the recommendations of the Financial System Inquiry
should be a priority and prudential policies should continue to aim at addressing housing market
risks.
 Raising bank capital. While sound and profitable, Australian banks do not appear to have
particularly high capital ratios, and they would require significantly higher capital in a severe
adverse scenario to ensure a fully-functioning system. Raising mortgage risk weights will help,
but capital ratios need to be increased substantially to ensure banks are “unquestionably” strong.
The benefits of raising capital over time are likely to outweigh the costs, which are low.
 Housing market risks. The regulator has taken appropriately targeted action to address areas of
risk in the housing market. But if investor lending and house price inflation do not slow
appreciably in the second half of the year, these policies may need to be intensified.

1. Persistently weak demand, perhaps resulting from a further decline in the terms of trade or a weaker monetary
policy transmission. Australian Treasury estimates suggest a US$ 10 per ton reduction in iron ore spot prices results in a
3 percent fall in the terms of trade and a 0.8 percent reduction in nominal GDP which by rules of thumb could reduce tax
receipts by up to AU$ 4.4 billion (about 0.3 percent of GDP) in a full year. The effects would be bigger if prices fall to
levels below production costs.
High
2. Hard landing in the housing market. APRA’s stress tests suggests that although banks could absorb as severe shock
(house price fall of 40%, unemployment of 13% and an output fall of 4%), but they may face ratings downgrades, higher
funding costs and could tighten credit conditions. RBA work shows household financial resilience is relatively high; but in
a severe scenario the sector’s vulnerability to macroeconomic shocks may have increased a little since the early 2000s.
High
3. Structurally weak growth in China over the medium term or sharp slowdown in 2015/16. Previous IMF work
suggested that a one percent slowdown in China’s investment growth can lower growth in Australia by 0.2 percent. The
driver of a slowdown in China matters for Australian exports. Recent weakness in China’s residential real estate market
has reduced demand for steel and iron ore. IMF work shows that, based on a variety of datasets, there is oversupply of
real estate nationwide and growth could be negative in 2015. A sharp adjustment in the Chinese real estate market
would likely result in falling iron ore prices, denting Australia’s terms of trade.
Medium
4. Tighter or more volatile global financial conditions. Previous IMF work illustrates that a simultaneous reassessment
of sovereign risk in the United States, Euro Area and Japan which raises bond yields by 200 basis points in the first year
and leaves yields 100 basis points higher for a prolonged period could reduce world growth by 1.2 percent compared to
the WEO baseline and by 0.5 to 1 percentage point for Australia.

 These scenarios would reduce pressure

for monetary policy to ease further and
would enable the envisaged gradual
fiscal consolidation to stay on track.

 The floating exchange rate provides an
important cushion against terms of
trade shocks.

 For housing market risks, pre emptive

early targeted prudential actions and
strengthening banks’ capital positions
over time could help engineer a soft
landing in the housing market similar to
2002-2003.

 If downside risks materialize from any of
these shocks there is room to ease
monetary policy further.

 The modest public debt level leaves

scope for the automatic stabilizers to
operate in full, for additional
discretionary recurrent spending, and
for a return to surplus to be delayed.

 In the event of a severe shock the

authorities could react as they did at the
onset of the global financial crisis
including considering a government
guarantee if banks lose access to
wholesale funding.

Caveat: It is difficult to quantify shocks as they may not occur in isolation, together the effects could amplify and their severity could vary widely. Policy responses in Australia and abroad would have an important
bearing on outcomes. Bearing this in mind for illustrative purposes, the sections summarize stylized estimates based on IMF or Australian authorities work.
The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective
assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50
percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.
“Short term” and “medium term” are meant to indicate that the risk could materialize within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

2. Iron ore prices recover from current lows and raise the terms of trade. A higher iron ore price would improve the
terms of trade, boost nominal incomes and help improve the fiscal position. A rise in prices―if expected to be sustained
could also re-energize further investments and could boost exports. (See below for sensitivity estimates).
Medium
3. Middle-income Asia boosts demand for services exports. Australia’s service exports to China and India have
increased threefold over the past decade. As Asia’s middle class expands, the demand for a range of services—higher
education, healthcare, business services tourism and financial services—will likely increase. Some economies have large
infrastructure needs which could also bolster demand for resource exports.

Background
Notes

Overall Assessment:
In 2014 the external position was
assessed to be moderately weaker than
the level consistent with medium term
fundamentals and desirable policies.
Since then a sharp decline in the terms
of trade has been partly offset by a
depreciation of the Australian dollar
against the U.S. dollar. If these trends
are sustained through 2015 our
assessment would be that the external
position remains moderately weak,
however there is uncertainty
surrounding this assessment. The gap
appears to be partly driven by the
strength of the exchange rate related to
ample global liquidity, the relative
attractiveness of highly-rated Australian
assets. The depreciation of the
Australian dollar over the past six
months has been driven by overseas
developments such as U.S. dollar
appreciation (partly offset by
movements in the euro and Yen), and
the sharp fall in the terms of trade, as
well as some domestic monetary policy
easing.
Potential policy responses:
If growth remains on the weak side,
further monetary accommodation
could be warranted. A faster than
expected exit from unconventional
monetary policies by major advanced
economies, could result in a further
exchange rate depreciation which
would help support the transition of
the economy towards more balanced
growth.
The government’s planned gradual
fiscal consolidation over the longer
term should help improve the current
account by boosting national savings.

Annex II. External Sector Assessment

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Current
account

Background. Australia has a high negative net international investment position (NIIP) of 54-percent of GDP. The ratio has
varied in a range between -45 and -60 percent of GDP since 1992. Liabilities are largely denominated in Australian dollars
but assets are in foreign currency. Liabilities are split with around one quarter FDI, one half portfolio investment (principally
banks borrowing abroad and foreign holdings of government bonds) and one quarter other investment and derivatives.
The current account deficit is expected to remain at 3-4 percent of GDP over the medium term, resulting in a gently rising
NIIP to GDP ratio reaching around 60 percent of GDP in 2020.
Assessment. The structure of Australia’s balance sheet reduces the vulnerability associated with a large negative NIIP. Since
Australia’s NIIP liabilities are mainly in Australian dollars and there is a net foreign currency asset position, a nominal
depreciation would strengthen the external balance sheet. The banking sector has a net foreign currency liability position
but it is fully hedged. The NIIP level and trajectory are sustainable. The maturity of banks’ external funding has improved
since the global financial crisis, and even in a tail risk event where domestic banks suffer a major loss, the government’s
strong balance sheet position allows it to offer credible support.
Background. Australia has run current account (CA) deficits for most of its history, with deficits averaging around 4 percent
of GDP in the last three decades, The deficit narrowed to 2.8 percent of GDP in 2014 but is likely to widen in 2015 following
a sharp fall in the terms of trade (iron ore prices have fallen by over 35 percent in the past year). To an extent, the effect on
the current account is cushioned by the depreciation of the Australian dollar. Also, resource export volumes are increasing
sharply as mining capacity comes on stream, mining related imports are falling back, and lower oil prices will improve the
oil balance—overall the current accounts widened by 0.6 percent of GDP. Over the medium term, the deficit is expected to
be below 4 percent of GDP with a smaller trade deficit partly offset by a larger income deficit as global interest rates
normalize and mining income accruing to foreign investors rises. With over half of Australia’s exports going to emerging
Asia, a key risk is a sharper than expected slowdown in China which could result in a further sharp decline in commodities
prices.
Assessment. Australia’s persistent CA deficits reflect a structural saving-investment imbalance with very high private
investment relative to a saving rate which is already high by advanced country standards. After accounting for Australiaspecific factors driving investment, the staff assessment is that the cyclically-adjusted current account is about 0-1½
percent of GDP below the level implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings but this assessment is
subject to uncertainty, given that it depends on how non-oil commodity prices evolve. 1/
Background. As of May 2015, the real effective exchange rate (REER) has depreciated by 10 and 5 percent compared to its
2013 and 2014 averages respectively and is 9 percent down from a recent peak. But it is 15 percent above its average over
the last 30 years and looks relatively high when set against the fall in the terms of trade. A number of factors appear to
contribute to an elevated Australian dollar, including, continued substantial capital inflows (possibly related to
extraordinary monetary easing in major advanced countries), and domestic/foreign interest rate differentials.
Assessment. Taking into account factors, including the attractiveness of highly-rated Australian assets, staff assesses the
REER to be 0 to15 percent above the level implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings with the
depreciation since June closing the gap a little. 2/
Background. The mining investment boom has been funded predominantly offshore. Net FDI inflows into this sector have
partially offset the reduced need for the banking sector to borrow abroad. As investment in new mining projects winds
down, related demand for imports will decrease, buffering the impact on the overall balance of payments. Australia also
received large inflows in recent years into bond markets given its sound fiscal position relative to other advanced
economies, owing to relatively high interest rate differentials.
Assessment. Credible commitment to a floating exchange rate and strong fiscal position limit the vulnerabilities.
Background. A free-floater since 1983. The central bank did brief but large intervention in 2007–08 when the market for
Australian dollars became illiquid (bid-ask spreads widened) following banking sector disruptions in the U.S. The authorities
are strongly committed to a floating regime which reduces the need for reserve holding.
Assessment. Although domestic banks’ external liabilities are sizable, they are either in local currency or hedged with little
or no counterparty risks, so reserve needs for prudential reasons are also limited.
1/ The EBA CA regression approach for 2014 estimates a CA gap of -1.6 percent of GDP but widens to around 2 percent of
GDP when based on 2015 projections this partly reflects changes in the estimated current account norm (from -1.2
to -0.8 percent of GDP) and a widening of the projected deficit in 2015. Using estimated elasticities these would be
consistent with an exchange rate overvaluation of around 6-12 percent in 2014 and around 9-15 percent currently, however
these estimates may not capture Australia-specific factors such as the sharp increase over the past decade in miningrelated investment. Our assessment is that the current account gap is in the range of 0-1½ percent of GDP.
2/ The EBA REER regression approach, the EBA level REER regression and ES approaches provide estimates of a gap
encompassing a wide range from 7 to 17 percent in 2014. Taking into account that the current REER is now around
5 percent lower than the average for 2014but part of this reflects a decline in the terms of trade, staff assess the extent of
overvaluation to be in a range from 0 to 15 percent.

Annex IV. High-Priority FSAP Recommendations
Recommendations

Implementation

Financial Stability
1

Develop a top down stress testing
framework and publish top down stress test
results in the Financial Stability Review (RBA)

On track. The RBA is developing a top down stress testing framework for
banks, to complement APRA’s stress tests. Practices at other central banks
have been assessed and the RBA is consulting stakeholders. Research papers
on Australian credit loss models have been published.

2

Devote more resources to stress testing
(APRA)

Implemented. APRA has increased resources for stress testing and is
implementing an internal stress testing strategy.

3

Introduce higher loss absorbency (HLA) for
systemic banks (APRA)

On track. APRA released an information paper setting out its framework for
identifying and imposing higher loss absorbency on domestic systemically
important banks. The framework will come into effect from January 1, 2016.

Financial Sector Oversight
4

Intensify on-site supervision of bank liquidity
and upgrade daily liquidity reporting
requirements to ensure consistency (APRA)

Implemented. The daily liquidity reporting requirement took effect on April
1, 2015. APRA is in the process of testing each ADI’s ability to produce the
report. This process will continue until March 2016.

5

Improve the effectiveness of conduct of
business supervision for insurance
companies (note recommendation 6 )
(Treasury)

Implementation in progress. In October 2014, ASIC published a Review of
retail life insurance advice, which considers the advice provided to consumers
on life insurance.

Ensure sufficiency and stability of ASIC core
funding (Treasury)

Further consideration required. ASIC has received new funding of $20.1
million over four years as part of Budget 2015-16.

6

Further consideration of the financial services regime and remuneration for
life insurance advisers will be undertaken in the context of the Government’s
response to the Financial System Inquiry.

ASIC’s funding will be further considered in the context of the Government’s
response to the Financial System Inquiry.

7

Extend risk based capital requirements, large
exposure rules, and reporting requirements
to ensure that AFSL holders are
appropriately covered (Treasury/ASIC)

Further consideration required. ASIC has introduced increased risk based
capital adequacy requirements and periodic reporting for additional classes
of licensees e.g., custodians. ASIC is undertaking preliminary work to gauge
the extent to which there are significant potential risks from large exposures
in Australia.

Crisis Management
8

Re-evaluate the merits of ex-ante funding
for the FCS with a view to converting it to an
ex-ante funded scheme (Treasury/CFR)

On track. In August 2013 the previous Government committed to
establishing a dedicated Financial Stability Fund, from January 2016.
Implementation will be subject to the outcomes of the Financial System
Inquiry.

9

Introduce HLA for systemic banks (APRA)

See recommendation 3 above.

10

Ensure ADI implementation of single
customer view (SCV) on, or where possible,
ahead of the agreed timetable (APRA)

On track. Under the Prudential Standard, ADIs were required to have
implemented the SCV by January 1, 2014. A number of ADIs received an
extension to this deadline due to the complexity and size of the IT system
changes. Only two ADIs are currently outstanding with their SCV
implementation.

11

Conduct frequent and focused crisis
simulations and other forms of resolution
testing (APRA/CFR)

Implemented. APRA had adopted a new internal framework for crisis
simulations which includes more frequent simulations of various scopes. The
CFR has also adopted a new framework for cross-agency simulations,
including Trans-Tasman involvement.

12

Continue recovery planning and introduce
resolution planning (APRA)

On track. APRA has completed a recovery planning pilot exercise which
included the six largest ADIs, and has since extended the requirement to a
number of medium-sized ADIs. APRA is continuing to develop a formal
framework and updated guidance for recovery planning.
In regard to resolution planning, APRA continues to operationalize the FCS
and to consider the development of entity-specific resolution plans, where
appropriate working with the other CFR agencies.

Exchange Rate Arrangement. Australia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3,
and 4 of the Articles of Agreement, and maintains an exchange system that is free from restrictions
on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions, except for exchange
restrictions that are maintained solely for the preservation of national or international security and
which have been notified to the Fund pursuant to Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51). The
exchange rate is free floating, but the Reserve Bank of Australia retains discretionary power to
intervene. There are no taxes or subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange.
Restrictions on Capital Transactions. Australia maintains a capital transactions regime that is virtually
free of restrictions. Two main restrictions on foreigners require: authorization for significant ownership
of Australian corporations; and approval for acquisition of real estate.
Article IV Consultation. Australia is on the 12-month consultation cycle. The 2015 Article IV
consultation discussions were held during June 11-24, 2015; the Executive Board discussed the staff
report and concluded the consultation on September 14, 2015.
FSAP Participation. The last FSAP Update involved two missions: April 23-May 15 and July 9-24,
2012; the Executive Board discussed the assessment (IMF Country Report No. 12/308) on November
12, 2012.
Fourth Amendment. Australia has accepted the Fourth Amendment to the Articles of Agreement.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. Australia has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS) since April 1996, and its metadata are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards
Bulletin Board (DSBB). Australia also participates in the G-20 Data Gaps Initiative and has implemented
all the recommendations of the first phase of the DGI, with the exception of semi-annual Coordinated
Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) data. Australia has no plans to adhere to the SDDS Plus. In recent
years, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has taken several initiatives to further improve the
quality of the data, such as issues relating to seasonal adjustment of unemployment and employment
statistics. Adding monthly inflation data to the suite of statistics would assist surveillance.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION—
September 8, 2015

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Approved By

Asia and Pacific Department

1.
This supplement contains information that has become available since the
Staff Report was circulated to the Executive Board on August 6, 2015. It does not
alter the staff’s broad assessment of policy issues and recommendations contained in
the report.
2.
Global financial market
volatility has increased since July
with commodity prices and stock
markets weakening in response to
economic and financial market
developments in China. The
Australian dollar has depreciated
further against the US dollar and on
a trade weighted basis. This has
significantly reduced the likely
degree of exchange rate
overvaluation and should help
support activity. However, equities
have lost ground and iron ore prices
have traded in a weak U.S.$45-50
range.
3.
GDP data for Q2 came in at
the weak end of market
expectations but broadly in line
with staff projections. Weatherrelated effects weighed on net
exports and dampened growth in
Q2 after a stronger outturn in Q1.
The continued decline in mining
investment also exerted a drag on

AUSTRALIA

growth. Annualized growth in H1 was 2.2 percent, somewhat below trend. However,
recent indicators of business conditions and consumer confidence have been more
positive, pointing to a continued gradual pick up in non-mining activity and services
exports are benefiting from the lower exchange rate. In response to these developments,
staff has shaved down growth projections for 2015 and 2016 to 2.4 percent and
2.9 percent respectively (from 2.5 percent and 3.0 percent respectively).
4.
A slower rise in population may be a slight downside risk to potential
growth. Recent data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows population
growth slowed to 1.4 percent in 2014 (compared to 1.6 percent in 2013) which, if it
persists, could pose a modest downside risk to potential growth estimates.
5.
Labor market conditions have remained steady. While the unemployment rate
rose to 6.3 percent in July, employment held up and the participation rate rose.
6.
The Reserve Bank of Australia left interest rates on hold at the August and
September meetings. Latest RBA forecasts reduced projected growth to 2-3 percent in
2016 (down from 2½-3½ percent) and left 2015 unchanged at 2¼ percent; inflation is
expected to remain consistent with the 2-3 percent target.

Statement by Barry Sterland, Executive Director for Australia
and Christopher Stewart, Advisor to Executive Director
September 14, 2015
We thank the staff for the set of papers, the high quality of engagement with our authorities
and the congruence of views.
The Australian economy is currently performing well in the face of one of the largest terms of
trade adjustments in its history. Such a shock will inevitably affect growth, though the
economy is proving resilient and flexible in the circumstances. Growth has remained around
2½ per cent, unemployment around 6 per cent, inflation and inflation expectations appear
well anchored, and public debt remains low by international standards.
The Australian authorities are determined to continue to build upon the policy approaches
that have stood the Australian economy in good stead as it enters its 25th year of economic
growth. These include medium term macroeconomic policy frameworks that continue to
emphasize prudence with a capacity to respond flexibly to economic conditions; a flexible
exchange rate; flexible and competitive product and labor markets and other measures to
build productivity and participation; strong economic engagement with our region; and
sound financial regulatory arrangements.
Outlook and risks
My authorities agree with staff that activity is likely to gradually strengthen. The transition
from mining-led growth to broader-based growth is underway. While the fall in commodity
prices from their peak in 2011 has contributed to the largest fall in the terms of trade in more
than 50 years, the trade-weighted exchange rate has provided a buffer for the real economy,
depreciating by about 20 per cent over the same period. Apart from recent temporary
weather-related factors in the June quarter, mining export production is continuing to ramp
up in response to the extraordinarily strong growth in investment over the preceding decade.
Service exports are also growing strongly, partly in response to the lower exchange rate.
Accommodative monetary policy settings are working to underpin a gradual improvement in
growth, including through support for dwelling construction. Private consumption remains
firm, and the conditions are in place for a pick-up in non-mining business investment.
Subdued wage growth is also supporting employment and the economy’s growth transition.
Inflation is expected to remain in line with the Reserve Bank of Australia’s target of 2 to
3 per cent, on average, over the business cycle, and expectations appear well anchored.
Authorities consider risks to be reasonably well balanced, though they are carefully
monitoring their evolution. Domestically, the key uncertainty is around the anticipated
strengthening of growth in the non-mining economy, specifically whether the pick-up in nonmining investment will be sustained in 2015-16 and offset falls in mining investment. This
poses both upside and downside risks as noted in the report. In relation to the outlook for
China, authorities note that the Australian Budget has been based on relatively conservative
forecasts of Chinese growth for some time, that commodity prices remain in line with Budget
forecasts, and that the Chinese authorities have numerous policy tools at their disposal and

2
have shown a willingness to use these instruments to manage growth and financial
conditions.
The authorities are particularly appreciative of the analytical work done by staff on
Australian house prices and consider that this more nuanced and thorough approach should
be used more widely in surveillance. This work highlights that the risks arising from the
housing market should not be overstated, with rapid price growth being concentrated in
particular markets, few generalized signs of oversupply or mortgage overextension by
households, and coordinated policy actions by regulators starting to take effect.
There remains policy space to respond to downside risks if they materialize, while also
recognizing that the economy will continue to benefit from the flexibility built over the past
couple of decades, including the key role played by the exchange rate in cushioning the
economy against external shocks.
Authorities agree with staff that risks associated with the macro-financial outlook are not
prominent. The discussion benefited from a focus on macro-financial linkages, and Box 4
serves as a useful check on the overall soundness of Australian credit and sectoral balance
sheet positions. The current account deficit continues to reflect Australia’s strong investment
opportunities not being fully met by Australia’s higher-than-average domestic savings, and is
close to that estimated by the External Balance Assessment. As staff indicate, while Australia
has a net foreign liability position, the country has a net foreign currency asset position,
given that the bulk of foreign liabilities are denominated in, or hedged back into, Australian
dollars. The banking sector has a diversified funding mix including, for example, a sizeable
share of its wholesale funding is sourced through instruments with maturities of greater than
a year, and the corporate sector more generally is well hedged against exchange rate
movements. We note also that the current account deficit is expected to remain towards the
low end of the range in which it has fluctuated over recent decades, and that net foreign
liabilities have been stable as a share of GDP over the past decade.
Monetary policy
The RBA is largely in agreement with staff on monetary policy. Monetary policy is
supporting economic growth, with the interest sensitive parts of the economy responding to
this stimulus. In particular, monetary policy has ensured that finance remains readily
available to creditworthy borrowers, supporting housing activity and dwelling construction,
and providing a platform for business investment. The Australian dollar is adjusting to
significant declines in key commodity prices. At the same time, the authorities recognize that
monetary policy cannot be the driver of medium-term growth, and note that the cost of credit
is not holding back investment.
Fiscal policy
Fiscal policy is anchored by the policy of returning to surplus over the medium term.
Returning to a budget surplus remains a priority given challenges from social spending
commitments over the long term (including those associated with ageing), as well as the
importance of retaining Australia’s favorable standing with external creditors (it is one of

3
only eight sovereigns with the highest credit rating with all agencies). It demonstrates
adherence to the longstanding medium-term fiscal framework of achieving budget surpluses,
on average, over the course of the economic cycle. The Australian Government has set out a
clear and credible fiscal consolidation path. Within this sound approach, the Government has
implemented its fiscal strategy to provide support for jobs and growth, with the 2015/16
Budget prioritizing spending in areas that will build a stronger economy and including
measures to boost infrastructure (see below) and business investment, including by SMEs.
Against this background, the authorities do not agree with the staff characterization of the
aggregate fiscal consolidation as ‘somewhat more frontloaded than desirable’. Authorities
consider that the current relatively gradual consolidation strikes the right balance between
short- and medium-term considerations. There is limited scope for easing the rate of
consolidation in structural terms given the importance of adhering to fiscal frameworks and
anchors that have served Australia well. The chart on Page 8 demonstrates the significant
extent to which revenue weakness, including that associated with commodity price writedowns, has been allowed to flow through to a more gradual fiscal consolidation. Moreover,
the planned gradual consolidation is in line with the staff’s estimates of a gradual closing of
the output gap after this year. In addition, recent state budgets imply less aggregate
consolidation in 2015/16 than was expected at the time of the May Federal Budget, with the
combined state and local government deficit expected to increase this year.
Within its medium-term fiscal strategy, the Australian Government remains committed to
addressing infrastructure bottlenecks. Funding infrastructure has been a key focus of recent
budgets, with key spending both added and brought forward. Substantial investments are
planned in transport infrastructure and the Government’s national broadband network in the
next few years. The Government’s Asset Recycling Initiative and the Northern Australia
Infrastructure Facility will provide scope for additional investment in high priority
infrastructure projects as they are identified. This builds on the biggest infrastructure
program in Australia’s history, which is expected to permanently boost the size of the
economy by one percent over the longer term.
The Australian Government is developing a pipeline of high-quality projects supported by
transparent cost-benefit analysis. For example, Infrastructure Australia is charged with
helping all levels of government and the private sector to prioritize and progress nationally
significant infrastructure through its independent advice on the projects and reforms needed
to fill Australia’s infrastructure gap. Following a recent comprehensive review of Australia’s
infrastructure needs, it is now formulating a 15-year plan based on national and state
priorities. Australia also works on an international level to encourage quality infrastructure
development, and is hosting the G20’s Global Infrastructure Hub to enhance information
about opportunities and build links between private sector investment and public
infrastructure projects.
Potential growth and structural reforms
The authorities recognize the need for continued action to secure Australia’s future
prosperity. In particular, they recognize that future income growth requires a continued focus
on productivity-enhancing reforms. Review processes are currently underway examining the

4
reform in labor markets, competition, taxation, and federal-state relations that could play an
important role in raising economic efficiency. Given Australia is near the productivity
frontier in numerous sectors, there is no single lever that can be pulled to produce a large
impact, rather a range of approaches is required. Australian authorities are conscious of the
need to balance the impact of specific reforms on individual groups and to explore
complementary reforms that can reinforce positive impacts on growth while ensuring
fairness. At the same time, the authorities consider that any changes to tax and
superannuation need to have regard to Australia’s already highly progressive tax and welfare
arrangements and ensure that they take account of investment decisions people have already
made in good faith on the basis of existing policy, and take into account the potential
complexities arising from undertaking such changes in a low-return environment. The
authorities also note the costs associated with the impacts of continued tax bracket creep on
labor supply.
The authorities recognize that the rate of potential output growth is uncertain and will depend
on many factors. The increasing diversification of the Australian economy and integration
with Asia represents a key opportunity to underpin medium- to long-term growth prospects.
In particular, a growing middle class in Asian emerging economies is likely to increase
demand for goods and services produced in Australia. Recently concluded free trade
agreements with Japan, Korea and China will also assist, including through opening trade
and investment in the service sectors. Nevertheless, authorities recognize that the key to
ensuring continued strong growth in Australia’s economy remains pushing ahead with
policies that will improve innovation, productivity, and participation as outlined above.
Financial Stability
The Australian financial system continues to perform strongly and near-term risks to
financial stability from households, businesses and the financial sector appear low. APRA’s
intensive and risk-based approach to financial sector regulation and supervision, along with
the strong capital position and broadly prudent practices of Australia’s banking system, has
helped the financial system withstand shocks. Over recent years authorities have been
undertaking targeted responses to developments in segments of the property sector by
reinforcing sound lending practices, including focusing on the heightened level of investor
activity in the housing market. This has been supplemented by ASIC’s review into interestonly lending practices and the RBA’s work assessing and publicly noting the need for
prudent risk taking by both lenders and borrowers. There are signs this approach is having
some effect, as evidenced by changes in banks’ loan pricing, loan serviceability standards
and product offerings. Growth in investor credit is expected to slow in the second half of
2015. The overall effectiveness of these actions is subject to ongoing monitoring, and
regulators will consider whether additional steps are needed depending upon the evolution of
risks in the housing and mortgage markets, including Pillar 2 actions if individual banks fail
to rein in investor lending. Actions are coordinated through the Council of Financial
Regulators which includes the RBA, Treasury, APRA and ASIC.
The authorities are also building upon the existing strength of the financial sector by
increasing over time the capital position of banks and other authorized deposit-taking
institutions (ADIs). APRA has already announced plans to increase the amount of capital

5
held by the largest banks against housing loans. The major banks have recently issued, or are
in the process of issuing, a significant amount of additional capital, and appear well placed to
accumulate capital in the period ahead. More generally, the authorities fully support the
findings of the recent Financial System Inquiry (FSI) that the capital ratios of ADIs should be
‘unquestionably strong’. APRA’s final response to the FSI will require further consideration,
and changes will need to be in line with evolving international standards, commensurate to
risks, and gradual so as to minimize unnecessary costs. Nevertheless, APRA has indicated
publicly that it is likely that the major banks will need to increase their capital ratios further
over the next couple of years. This will further reinforce the conservative requirements
already imposed by APRA on the basis that banks should be able to support the economy in
the aftermath of any severe recession rather than just survive such a scenario.
