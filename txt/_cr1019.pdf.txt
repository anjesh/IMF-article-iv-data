INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA
Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the 2009 Consultation with
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
Approved by Adam Bennett and Michele Shannon
November 24, 2009

Discussions. Skopje, October 15−27, 2009. The mission met with Finance Minister and
Deputy Prime Minister Stavreski; Deputy Prime Minister Peshevski; Economy
Minister Besimi; NBRM Governor Goshev; other officials; members of the opposition
parties; the private sector; and others. At the conclusion of the mission a joint press
conference was held with the finance minister and NBRM governor.
Team: Mr. McGrew (head), Ms. Chen (EUR), Mr. Gottlieb (EUR),
Ms. Dobrescu (FAD), Mr. Salman (SPR), and Mr. Tieman (Resident Representative).
Consultation focus: The discussions focused on the impact of the global crisis and the
policy mix needed to support economic stability and a resumption of growth in the
context of the exchange rate peg.
Political developments and EU accession: The government holds a majority in
parliament and the next elections are not due until 2012. The ruling VMRO party won
the presidency and most municipal elections in March−April 2009. FYR Macedonia is
an EU candidate country, and in October 2009 the European Commission
recommended the start of accession talks. However, the opening of negotiations
requires a unanimous decision by EU members, and Greece is seen as unlikely to agree
until a long-standing dispute on the country’s name is resolved.
Publication intentions: The authorities have not yet indicated whether they will agree
to publication.
Exchange rate arrangement and Article VIII status: The de jure exchange rate regime
is managed floating; the de facto regime is a stabilized arrangement against the euro.
Macedonia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, sections 2, 3, and 4.

I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND STAFF APPRAISAL
1.
Macedonia’s main vulnerability at the outset of the global crisis was its large
current account deficit in the context of the exchange rate peg to the euro. At the same
time it benefited from a small fiscal deficit, modest public debt, significant international
reserve buffers, and a small banking system with limited reliance on external financing—
which provided room for maneuver and limited its exposure to global financial conditions.
2.
The crisis hit Macedonia at the end of 2008 through a collapse in export demand
and loss of external financing. These factors caused a sharp slowdown in the economy and
a decline in tax revenues. They also forced a rapid sell-off of central bank foreign exchange
reserves, and raised uncertainties about the sustainability of the exchange rate peg. Currency
substitution and cash outflows by residents added to pressures on reserves, while elections in
spring 2009 created additional uncertainties. By May 2009 central bank reserves had fallen
below €1.2 billion (75 percent of short-term debt), 30 percent down from the October 2008
peak.
3.
The National Bank of Macedonia (NBRM) responded to reserve outflows by
raising its policy rate from 7 to 9 percent (even as inflation fell to zero) and tightening
bank reserve and liquidity requirements. These actions helped to slow credit growth and
contain the loss of reserves.
4.
The government curtailed planned spending increases under the 2009 budget to
preserve its 2.8 percent of GDP deficit target in the face of declining revenues. It also
issued an €175 million Eurobond (at 9⅞ percent) in July, which bolstered reserves and
ensured sufficient budget financing.
5.
By the second half of 2009 the situation had stabilized and confidence had
improved. Indicators of activity flattened out or turned positive, external financing pressures
eased, and by November reserves had recouped 70 percent of their earlier losses. In the
banking sector nonperforming loans rose and profits fell, but capital adequacy ratios
remained high and no significant liquidity pressures emerged. For the year as a whole, staff
expect GDP to decline 1.3 percent, less than most countries in the region, and slight
deflation.
6.
Looking ahead, the slow pace of recovery in trading partners and continued
tightness in external financing conditions will weigh on the economy. As a result, staff
and the authorities expect only a moderate recovery to 2 percent growth in 2010. The current
account deficit is expected to narrow from 13 percent of GDP in 2008 to 9½ percent in 2009
and 8 percent in 2010, while reserves are expected to finish 2009 at 90 percent of short-term
debt and remain near that ratio over the medium term.
7.
The NBRM’s response to the crisis has been appropriate in light of its
commitment to protect the exchange rate peg. The pegged regime has served Macedonia

5
well by providing a stable policy framework that is supportive of steady growth and low
inflation. Moreover, staff analysis does not show significant exchange rate misalignment.
Nonetheless, maintaining policies supportive of the exchange rate anchor is critical and the
high interest rates currently prevailing are one of the tradeoffs associated with the exchange
rate anchor. At this stage, further tightening does not appear warranted, given the underlying
improvement in the balance of payments, weak credit growth and economic activity, and
modest deflation. On the other hand, an easing of monetary conditions, which would translate
into faster growth and less current account adjustment, should await greater certainty that
reserves are on an underlying upward path.
8.
The government’s 2009 fiscal stance is appropriate in the current circumstances.
The targeted deficit (equivalent to 2.8 percent of GDP) reflects the operation of automatic
stabilizers, is fully financed, and is consistent with medium-term sustainability. While a
tighter stance would have helped contain the current account deficit and protect reserves and
the peg, it would likely have been at the cost of lost output and employment.
9.
The government has set a target of 2.5 percent of GDP for the fiscal deficit in
2010 and 2 percent of GDP or lower for the medium term. Staff view the 2010 target,
which is modestly contractionary in cyclically adjusted terms, as appropriate in light of
financing constraints and the need to strike a balance between supporting growth and
containing external imbalances. Over the medium term, staff advise a fiscal deficit of below
1.5 percent of GDP in order to maintain debt at moderate levels that will support policy
flexibility under the peg.
10.
Looking forward, Macedonia’s key risks arise from its still sizable current
account deficit, in the context of the exchange rate peg. The failure of exports and FDI to
recover as expected, or persistent global financial strains, could put renewed pressures on
foreign exchange reserves. On the upside, progress towards EU accession could bolster
foreign investment and ease external financing pressures.
11.
The authorities have indicated that they do not intend to seek Fund support at
this time but are prepared to do so if needed in the future. The government has said it
views the Fund as a possible option for financing in the event of future balance of payments
pressures.
12.

It is proposed to hold the next Article IV consultation on a 12-month cycle.

sound banking system, a low level of public
debt, and a significant foreign exchange reserve buffer. The banking system was
relatively small and well capitalized, and relied on domestic deposits rather than external
sources for funding. Public debt was a little over 20 percent of GDP, half of which was longterm loans from official lenders. Meanwhile, €1.7 billion of foreign exchange reserves
(115 percent of short-term debt) at end-September 2008 provided a significant buffer.

B. Impact of Global Crisis
15.
Growth, which had already been slowing, turned negative in the last quarter of
2008, driven by an abrupt fall in exports and industrial production.1 However, by the second
quarter of 2009 initial signs of stabilization were evident in production, exports and retail sales,
and quarterly GDP growth (seasonally adjusted) turned positive. Compared to other countries in
the region, the recession was shallower and appeared to have bottomed out more quickly.

International reserves fell 30 percent through mid-year before subsequently

Cash exchange houses are small shops where individuals can buy and sell foreign currency. They account for
a large share of private transfers. Part of their transactions are thought to be remittances and another part reflects
households’ cash management and risk hedging activities (often referred to as “mattress money”).

11

Box 1. Banking Sector Stability
Macedonia experienced a considerable credit boom prior to the global crisis, similar to other European
emerging markets although somewhat later and on a smaller scale. Bank loan growth averaged
30 percent annually between 2004−08. Nonetheless, the sector remains relatively small with assets at
62 percent of GDP. The sector’s small size, substantial liquidity, and high capital adequacy have
allowed it to absorb the effects of the global economic crisis well.
A key strength of the sector is a reasonably conservative business model. Bank assets are primarily
loans (62 percent of total) and highly liquid assets like Central Bank bills, accounts with foreign banks
and short term Treasury bills (15 percent of total), rather than riskier (and potentially illiquid) trading
securities. On the liability side, funding sources are stable: resident deposits account for 76 percent of
total liabilities versus foreign liabilities at 9 percent, a third of which is subordinated debt.
The recession and tighter monetary policy nonetheless weighed on the banking system. Between
September 2008 and September 2009, deposit growth fell from 25 percent yoy to 0 percent and lending
growth fell from 29 percent to 6 percent. From June 2008 to June 2009, nonperforming loans rose from
6.9 percent to 8.6 percent of total loans, return on equity fell from 19.1 to 4.3 percent (on the back of
higher provisioning), and foreign exchange deposits rose from 53 percent to 61 percent of total deposits.
Despite these adverse development, risks appear contained.


Liquidity Risk – The loan to deposit ratio is 97 percent as of June 2009, suggesting a stable
source of funding. Ample liquidity means that, in aggregate, banks could cover a sudden loss of
23 percent of short-term liabilities with highly liquid assets.



Interest Rate Risk – Direct exposure to rate risk via higher funding costs is low because
87 percent of bank loans to households are adjustable rate as of end-2008. However, there is
indirect credit risk via the impact of higher rates on borrower capacity to repay.



Exchange Rate Risk – The aggregate banking sector has a net neutral foreign exchange
position (and each bank’s net open foreign exchange position is limited to 30 percent of own
funds). However, indirect credit risk arises because 57 percent of loans as of June 2009 are
foreign exchange denominated or indexed, most of which appears to be unhedged.



Buffers. The system’s capital adequacy ratio remained stable at 16 percent in June 2009,
compared to the legal minimum of 8 percent and the NBRM’s recommended 12 percent.
Nonperforming loans are 67 percent provisioned as of June 2009. Meanwhile, required reserves
at the NBRM are 10 percent on denar deposits, 13 percent on foreign exchange deposits, and 20
percent on foreign exchange indexed deposits, providing another buffer.

The central bank conducts quarterly stress tests and the system remains solvent even under extreme
adverse scenarios (an increase in NPLs of 50 percent, a 20 percent depreciation, and a 5 percentage
point rise in interest rates). The NBRM also conducts on-site examination of asset quality and lending
practices at the three largest banks, which account for 66 percent of assets.

12
19.
The banking system absorbed the crisis without significant pressures on capital
or liquidity, despite a rise in non-performing loans and lower profitability. Due to their
relative insulation from the global financial system, banks were affected by the crisis mainly
through its impact on the real economy, and through the NBRM’s tightening measures in
response to the crisis, rather than directly from external funding pressures. Overall, risks in
the banking sector appear to be contained (Box 1).

C. Policy Response
20.
The Government curtailed planned spending increases to achieve its 2.8 percent
fiscal target for 2009 in the face of revenue shortfalls resulting from the economic
slowdown (Box 2). Overall real expenditure is expected to decline 0.8 percent relative to 2008.
Compared to other countries in the region, the spending cuts in Macedonia are relatively
modest. Staff believe the revised revenue projections remain optimistic. However, the
government is committed to underexecution of spending as necessary to achieve the deficit
target of 2.8 percent of GDP for 2009.
Box 2. Macedonia’s Response to Past IMF Advice
At the time of the 2008 Article IV consultations (concluded in December 2008), Directors welcomed Macedonia’s
strong economic growth and improved business climate. But they expressed concern about increasing
macroeconomic and external vulnerabilities, highlighting the widening current account deficit and the increase in
public sector wages. In this context they expressed concerns about plans to increase the fiscal deficit from
1.1 percent of GDP in 2008 to 2.8 percent in 2009 and stressed that the priority of monetary policy should be to
protect the exchange rate. At the time of these recommendations, 2009 growth was expected to be 4 percent and
the current account deficit to be 13.3 percent of GDP.
Events unfolded differently than anticipated in December 2008, as the global crisis spilled onto Macedonia’s
economy, leading to a mild recession. Meanwhile, the current account began to adjust and is projected to fall to
9.5 percent of GDP in 2009 and to be on a downward path over the medium term.
The government largely allowed automatic stabilizers to work, while cutting public spending in response to
declining revenues, including a freeze on public sector wages and employment. The end result was a budget that
staff expect to be roughly neutral in cyclically adjusted terms. Meanwhile, the central bank tightened monetary
policy through higher interest rates and tighter prudential requirements in order to arrest the loss of foreign
exchange deposits and protect the exchange rate peg. In light of the economic downturn, these policy responses
appear to be broadly consistent with the underlying advice of Directors.

13
21.
The budget deficit is expected to be financed fully from external sources (mainly
the Eurobond). There will be no net domestic financing, as expected net issuance of T-bills
and T-bonds of some denar 5.4 billion (1.4 percent of GDP) is offset by repayment of
structural bonds.3 In mid-2009 the Treasury began to issue foreign exchange linked T-bills to
reduce its financing costs, and these now account for close to 90 percent of the T-bill stock
(which totals some 3 percent of GDP). This likely contributed to the recovery of reserves by
providing banks with liquid domestic foreign exchange assets. It also shifted foreign
exchange risk to the government.

The NBRM took several steps to stop the outflow of foreign exchange reserves
by tightening credit conditions. First, it imposed liquidity requirements in January, with
banks given a timetable for coming into compliance. Second, it hiked its policy rate (onemonth central bank bills) by 200 basis points in April. Third, it raised reserve requirements
on bank deposits in June. These measures helped to rebuild reserves both directly (banks
brought back assets held abroad to meet higher reserve requirements) and indirectly by
slowing bank lending. Macedonia’s monetary tightening stood out among the countries in the
region, which generally reduced interest rates and relaxed reserve requirements. This tighter
stance was required due to the need to protect the peg in the face of declining reserves, and it
was feasible because bank balance sheets were sufficiently healthy to absorb these measures.

Structural bonds, which amount to 5 percent of GDP, are long-term bonds issued to cover historic liabilities
(primarily related to denationalization, pre-independence frozen currency deposits, and Stopanska Bank
privatization).

The government expects a smaller contraction of 0.6 percent in 2009, while the
NBRM expects a 1.6 percent contraction. The government shares the staff’s outlook
for 2010.

24.
Inflation is expected to be -0.8 percent in 2009. Core inflation (excluding food and
energy) is expected to be close to zero. Prices are expected to rise somewhat over 1 percent
in 2010 as the effects of food and energy fade and economic growth resumes.

15
25.
The current account deficit is expected to narrow in 2009 and continue to do so
over the medium term. FDI should recover towards pre-crisis levels, and foreign exchange
reserves are expected to stabilize near 90 percent of short-term debt.


The current account deficit appears on track to fall from 13 percent of GDP in 2008 to
9½ percent of GDP in 2009, on the back of declining trade deficits and stable private
remittances and other transfers. For 2010 and over the medium term exports are
expected to recover further, supported by resumed growth in trading partners, a
rebound in metals prices from the lows of early 2009, and ongoing structural reforms
that are improving the business climate. Meanwhile import growth is expected to be
contained due to modest growth of output and credit in Macedonia, and to restrained
fiscal policies. The current account deficit is projected to narrow to 8 percent of GDP
in 2010 and to 5 percent by 2014.



Foreign direct investment is projected to fall by more than 50 percent this year, in line
with other countries in the region. This is partly compensated by portfolio inflows
(the Eurobond) and the SDR allocation, but net financial inflows are still expected to

Together with disbursement
of an €100 million EIB loan and further adjustment of the current account, this is
expected to support a modest increase in reserves, which would remain near 90
percent of short-term debt in 2010 and over the medium term.

IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Fiscal Policy
26.
Staff viewed the authorities’ fiscal targets for 2009 (2.8 percent of GDP) and
2010 (2.5 percent of GDP) as appropriate. The authorities felt that such deficits were
needed to support growth and protect public investment. Staff’s view that these deficit targets
are appropriate is based on the following considerations.




These deficits mainly reflect the operation of automatic stabilizers. The moderate

in 2009 to 24.7 percent in 2010 (and 22 percent in 2011). The government announced in November that it
would implement the cuts over a longer period, with a smaller reduction to 26.5 percent in 2010.

29.
Staff recommended that fiscal deficits be limited to below 1.5 percent of GDP in
the medium term. A 1.5 percent ceiling would maintain debt ratios at moderate levels (well
below the median for emerging markets and near the median of emerging market countries
with exchange rate pegs) and provide flexibility to follow countercyclical policy over the
business cycle (Box 3). The government agreed with the need to reduce deficits over the
medium term, but felt a ceiling of 2 percent of GDP would be more feasible in light of the
need to increase investment spending.

Box 3. Debt-Sustainability Guidance for Medium-Term Fiscal Targets
This box assesses the appropriate public debt ratio for Macedonia and the associated annual fiscal targets (Selected
Issues Paper, Chapter 3). Medium-term fiscal targets should be consistent with a sustainable debt path. One approach
to assessing an appropriate public debt ratio is to look at the empirical relationship between debt ratios and the
vulnerability of countries to crisis. Another approach is to view debt as sustainable if sufficient future primary
surpluses can feasibly be generated to service it.
These approaches suggest a prudent public debt ratio for Macedonia would be around 25 percent of GDP
based on the following considerations:


While there is no consensus in the academic literature on the appropriate debt target for emerging markets, it is
generally accepted that emerging markets can sustain lower levels of debt than advanced economies. IMF
Vulnerability Studies find a higher probability of a debt crisis in emerging economies when the public debt
ratio surpasses a threshold of around 25 percent of GDP.



Although Macedonia’s projected end-2009 debt ratio (24 percent of GDP) is low compared to its regional
peers, it is at the median among emerging markets with fixed exchange rate regimes. Constrained policies and
increased vulnerability to sudden stops suggest lower debt ratios are prudent in fixed exchange rate regime
countries.



A model-based approach to debt sustainability indicates that debt levels much above 20 percent of GDP would
be imprudent in Macedonia’s case. This model imposes the requirement that the government can credibly
service its debt in all circumstances and therefore that it should contain debt to the level it can sustain in the
case of a negative shock to revenues.



The prudent level of debt also depends on interest costs. The average interest rate paid on Macedonian public
debt is likely to increase from the historical 3.4 percent as the share of market financing in overall borrowing
increases. The chart below shows that for a given primary balance, higher financing costs can lead to
unsustainable debt dynamics. Alternatively, for a given debt level, higher interest payments raise the debtstabilizing primary balance. (The average financing costs line assumes 30 percent of new debt is at historical
costs of 3.4 percent and 70 percent is at the EM average of 7 percent. The high cost line assumes 30 percent at
historical costs and 70 percent at a 9 percent rate.)

Stabilizing debt at 25 percent of GDP in the medium-term implies running annual primary fiscal deficits of
around 0.4 percent of GDP (overall fiscal deficits of around 1.5 percent of GDP) from 2012 onwards, given
baseline growth and interest rate projections.

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
30.
The NBRM measures to tighten monetary policy in the first half of 2009 were
driven by its commitment to ensure the stability of the exchange rate peg. In its view, it
is necessary to protect reserve buffers, and it is too early to relax its stance in light of the still
large current account deficit and the potential for further reserve losses. Staff share this
assessment and believe that more evidence of external stabilization would be desirable before
easing. Once external adjustment progresses and reserves approach desired levels, there will
be room to begin loosening policy (Boxes 4 and 5).
31.
The government believes that the NBRM stance is too cautious and that it should
begin easing now. It acknowledges the risk of future reserve losses but believes current
reserve levels provide an adequate buffer against that contingency. In its view, the present
stance will not allow the resumption in bank lending required to stimulate a return to growth.
Further, monetary policy acts with a lag, so incremental easing should begin now to support
growth in 2010. Moreover, if risks materialize, both monetary and fiscal policies can respond
to protect exchange rate stability. Nonetheless, the government affirmed that it respects the
autonomy of the NBRM in setting monetary policy. Staff noted that maintenance of the
exchange rate peg involved tensions between the goal of protecting reserves through tighter
monetary policy, and the goal of supporting growth and employment through easier credit
policies. Premature easing might need to be reversed, which could harm NBRM credibility as
well as damage confidence.
32.
The authorities remain fully committed to the exchange rate peg, which they
believe has served Macedonia well, including during the crisis, and which has deep
public support. They recognize the tradeoffs and reduced flexibility associated with the peg
but believe it is an essential anchor for monetary policy and for safeguarding stability. Staff
agreed that the exchange rate system should, with supportive policies, anchor the authorities’
objectives of stable growth and low inflation, as it has in the past. In staff’s view policies
have been supportive of the exchange rate and the costs of the policies needed to protect the
peg do not appear to have been excessive to date. In particular, despite high interest rates and
tight monetary conditions, the economic downturn has been modest compared to other
countries in the region, and the banking sector seems to have weathered the crisis in overall
healthy shape. Further, the exchange rate does not appear significantly overvalued (Box 6).

21
Box 4. FYR Macedonia: Assessment of Reserve Adequacy
This box seeks to assess the desired level of foreign exchange reserves in Macedonia (based on Selected Issues Paper,
Chapter 1). The adequacy of reserves is a key consideration in setting the stance of monetary policy. A variety of methods
including popular rules of thumb, comparisons with other emerging countries (EMs), and model based estimates suggest a
target range of €1.5–2 billion.
Popular benchmarks:

Maintaining reserves at 3 months of imports would require €1.1 billion.

The Greenspan-Guidotti rule of 100 percent cover of short-term debt (remaining maturity) would require
€1.6 billion.
Comparison with the medians of 51 EM countries (a comparison with 22 EM pegged regimes gives similar results).

To be at the median of the broad money to GDP ratio would require €1.1 billion.

To be at the median in term of months of imports would require €2.0 billion.

To be at the median reserve to short-term debt ratio would require €2.6 billion.
Model-based approach:
Based on Jean and Ranciere’s (2006) model, the optimal level of reserves for Macedonia is calibrated to be €1.8 billion. In
this model, the economy is vulnerable to sudden stops of capital flows; reserves are used to smooth domestic absorption in
case of a sudden stop; and reserves yield a lower return than other assets in the economy.

Box 4. FYR Macedonia: Assessment of Reserve Adequacy (concluded)
In addition to the above estimates of reserve adequacy, the recent experience is illustrative. Entering the crisis
in the fall of 2008, Macedonia had reserves of €1.7 billion. By May 2009 reserves had fallen to a low point of below
€1.2 billion as the central bank sold €500 million to defend the peg. If the NBRM had not entered the crisis with
such a buffer, reserves would have fallen below the 3 months of imports benchmark, which may have intensified
uncertainties and put greater pressure on the peg.

Box 5. Framework for Assessing Monetary Policy
This box (drawn from Selected Issues Paper, Chapter 2) seeks to provide a framework for assessing the appropriate
stance of monetary policy in Macedonia given its de facto peg to the euro (formally the peg serves as an intermediate
target to help the NBRM meet its primary goal of price stability). The peg ultimately constrains monetary policy
through the flow of international reserves. However, a range of policies could be sustainable in the short term, even if
not in the longer run, due to imperfect capital market integration and lags between monetary policy actions and the
balance of payments. This creates uncertainty in the near term about the appropriate policy stance.

This degree of latitude in the short term can be seen in two ways. First, base money growth tends to grow relatively
smoothly despite foreign exchange intervention purchases and sales—i.e., such intervention is sterilized rather than
allowing money to move with foreign exchange intervention as might be expected in a “pure” peg. Second, domestic
interest rates move independently of foreign interest rates in ways that do not appear to be fully accounted for by risk
premia.

peg. Thus both the level of reserves and their underlying trend need to

be supportive of the peg. For example, if reserves are low and falling,
policy needs to be tightened in order to 1) limit import demand,

supporting a correction in the current account; and 2) attract financial
inflows via arbitrage to support an improvement in the capital account.
At the other extreme, if reserves are high and rising, there is room for
"MKD"
easing monetary policy.
Low, Rising
High, Rising
In staff’s view, it remains early to loosen. First, staff would advise
reserve levels between €1.5 and €2 billion (Box 4), and the current
level is at the bottom of that range. Second, the recent reserve increase
was due in part to one-off factors and the underlying balance of payments flows are not yet clearly positive. And third,
a current account deficit near 10 percent of GDP leaves the country exposed to changes in external conditions,
suggesting extra caution. However, as the external adjustment process progresses and reserves approach desired
levels, there will be room to begin loosening policy.

24

Box 6. Exchange Rate Assessment
Staff analysis does not show significant exchange rate misalignment. This conclusion is consistent
with that of the December 2008 Article IV report. Standard CGER analysis estimates overvaluation in
the range of 6-11 percent, albeit with wide uncertainty bands in these estimates. The weak historical
relationship between the real exchange rate and the current account complicates assessment of the
exchange rate in the case of Macedonia. A significant current account adjustment, reversing the rapid
build-up in deficits in the past two years, is now underway, albeit at a slower pace than regional
comparators. While external developments are subject to substantial uncertainty in the current context,
the competitiveness benefits of ongoing structural reforms and prospective EU accession, supported
by the resumption of foreign direct investment (albeit at lower levels than the pre-crisis period), are
expected to result in a further moderation of current account deficits.

the assumptions used for elasticity
of the current account with respect to the REER (real exchange rate), the REER needs to
adjust by 6 to 7 percent to close the gap between the norm and the underlying current account
in the medium run.



The equilibrium real effective exchange rate (ERER) approach suggests overvaluation of
11 percent.



The external sustainability (ES) approach points to similar overvaluation as the MB
approach. In ES, the current account norm is estimated to be 2.6 percent deficit, with a real
exchange rate depreciation of 7−9 percent needed to stabilize NFA.

The macro balance and external sustainability approaches both rely on a projected
improvement in the current account based on export growth. This is subject to risks on both sides.
On the positive side, the improvements in the business climate and the high FDI of recent years should
help boost competitiveness. Further, progress towards EU accession would likely attract more foreign
investment as well as improve competitiveness through regulatory harmonization. On the negative
side, continued efforts are needed to address a shortage of skilled workers, infrastructure needs in
roads, railroads and electricity, and regulatory and judicial shortcomings.

25
C. Financial Sector and Structural Reform
33.
The quality of banking supervision and regulation has contributed to the
stability of the banking sector. Regular on-site examinations of bank credit portfolios and
stress tests have played an important role in this regard. Recent progress in implementing
arrangements for crisis coordination between relevant agencies (as recommended in the 2008
FSAP update) is welcome. The NBRM agreed with the FSAP recommendations to undertake
legal changes to allow it to intervene troubled banks without being subject to court challenge
and to remove bank management who do not meet appropriate standards of integrity. The
NBRM is working with the justice and finance ministries on the necessary legislation. Staff
also encouraged the NBRM and finance ministry to find a solution that will enhance lender
of last resort facilities through acceptance of a broader set of collateral, with appropriate
Treasury indemnities. The creation of an insurance supervisory body is a positive
development, and the authorities should move forward swiftly to make it fully operational.
34.
Macedonia has made significant progress in improving its business climate,
improving property rights through development of the cadastre, and reducing the labor tax
burden.6 The authorities’ priority areas for reform in the future include further improvement
in property rights; investment in the electricity sector; administrative reform aimed at
streamlining and improving efficiency; and judicial reform to improve the speed, consistency
and predictability of judicial processes.
V. RISKS
35.
Macedonia’s large current account deficit, in the context of the exchange rate
peg, makes it dependent on continued external financing. The failure of export demand to
recover as expected, renewed weakness of metals prices, or stronger than expected domestic
demand and imports could cause the current account deficit to widen once more. Moreover,
financial inflows could be lower than anticipated if global financial conditions fail to
normalize. Such developments would put renewed pressures on foreign exchange reserves
and the exchange rate peg and would also weigh on the banking sector. On the upside, rapid
progress towards EU accession would improve prospects for foreign investment, which
would likely ease external financing pressures and bolster reserves and the peg.

6

As a result of reforms in the business environment, Macedonia climbed from 69th to 32nd place in the Ease of
Doing Business category of the most recent World Bank Doing Business ranking. It made particular progress in
conditions for starting a business, where it climbed to 6th place, although it lagged behind at 115th place in
closing a business.

1/ Until 2007Q3 Tier I Capital includes common shares, non-cumulative preference shares, general reserves and undistributed profits, net of uncovered loss from previous years,
current loss and goodwill. Starting from 2007Q4, Tier I Capital includes nominal value of common and noncumulative preference shares, premiums from common and noncumulative
preference shares, general reserves and distributed profits, positions as a result of consolidation, net of uncovered loss from previous years, current loss and intangible goods, owned
common and noncumulative preference shares and the difference between the amount of necessary and the amount of allocated reserves for potential losses.
2/ Includes only loans to nonfinancial sector.
3/ Adjusted for unallocated provisions for potential loan losses. Since 31.03.2009 these items have been adjusted for unrecognized impairment.
4/ Interest margin is interest income less interest expense. Gross income includes net interest income, fees and commissions income (gross, not net), dividends, net income
regarding securities, net capital income, net FX income and other income excluding extraordinary income.
5/ Noninterest expenses include fees and commissions expenses, operating expenses and other expenses excluding extraordinary expenses.
6/ Highly liquid assets are defined as cash and balance with the NBRM, treasury bills, NBRM bills, and correspondent accounts with foreign banks.
7/ Short-term liabilities are defined as deposits and other liabilities with a maturity of one year or less (without deposits and borrowings from domestic banks).
8/ FX indexed deposits include deposits and other FX indexed liabilities. However FX indexed deposits comprise the majority of these items. Since 31.03.2009 the figure refers only
to foreign exchange indexed deposits.
9/ The increase in 2006 is due to loans channeled through NBRM, not NBRM credit to banks.

B4. Combination of B1-B3 using one-quarter standard deviation shocks
B5. One time 30 percent real depreciation in 2006 8/
B6. 10 percent of GDP increase in other debt-creating flows in 2006
Sources: MoF and IMF Staff estimates.
1/ Consolidated central government gross debt.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of euro).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Annex I—FYR Macedonia: Statistical Issues
As of November 12, 2009
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
Areas that would benefit most from further improvement are national accounts, government
finance statistics, and the balance of payments.
National accounts: National accounts statistics are available on an annual basis and
quarterly data are available from the first quarter of 2006. Despite recent improvements,
GDP statistics continue to have large discrepancies between the official quarterly and annual
GDP estimates, the lack of official levels of GDP according to the expenditure side,
inconsistencies between the production and the expenditure approaches to GDP, and
inconsistencies between GDP subcomponents and the behavior of a variety of indirect
economic indicators. Employment data from the company survey continue to be unreliable,
and wage data suffer from inconsistencies in definitions as a result of the recent social
insurance reform.
Price statistics: The CPI series are rebased every year and this has caused small
discrepancies in historical data.
Government finance statistics: The consolidated central government data are affected by
unreliable source data on extra-budgetary funds, hospital arrears, and special revenue
accounts, including foreign financed projects. The has resulted in sometimes large
discrepancies between the above-the-line and below-the-line items. Data on state enterprises
are limited. Macedonia does not report government finance statistics to the Fund for
publication in either the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSMY) or the
International Financial Statistics (IFS).
Monetary sector: EUR receives a monthly electronic report of monetary statistics, covering
the balance sheet of the central bank, the commercial banks and other depository
corporations. The foreign currency shares of the loans and deposits do not accurately reflect
the foreign exchange risk as the bank data do not identify the foreign currency indexed loans
or deposits.
External sector: The compilation and coverage of balance of payments statistics have
improved in recent years and most of the recommendations from the 2004 ROSC mission
and the late 2006 STA mission were implemented. Some areas for improvement remain,
including trade credit data which tend not to be consistent with relevant indirect economic
indicators. Balance of payments data are compiled on a monthly basis.

Annex III—Coordination of IMF and World Bank with Programs on FYR Macedonia
1.
IMF and World Bank country teams for FYR Macedonia agreed that FYR
Macedonia faces an environment of significant difficulties including balance of
payments pressures, recession, and falling tax revenues. Against this background
Macedonia’s main macroeconomic challenges are to achieve balance of payments adjustment
without an exchange rate or banking crisis; and to avoid excessively procyclical fiscal or
monetary policies while ensuring medium-term fiscal and external sustainability. To meet
these challenges will require fiscal and monetary policies that are adequate to maintain the
current account deficit at levels that will prevent loss of reserves, and to ensure the fiscal
deficit is consistent with near-term financing constraints and medium-term public debt
sustainability; and close monitoring of the financial sector.
2.
Based on this shared assessment, the teams identified six areas of structural
reform as macrocritical in light of their importance for fiscal sustainability and financial
sector stability.


Tax administration. Continued reforms in this area will help to improve compliance
and reduce informality, contributing to a broader and more stable tax base that allows
lower tax rates and adequate fiscal financing. Macedonia has already achieved major
gains in unifying the collection of social contributions (pension, health, and
unemployment) and integrating them with personal income tax collection, resulting in
significant improvement in compliance.



Pension reform. Reforms to the system in recent years put the system on a
sustainable financial basis, but recently contribution rates were lowered, the pension
indexation formula was made more generous, and a discretionary element was added
to the rules-based system.



Social safety net. The social safety net is complex, with a large number of
overlapping programs that are not well-targeted and fail to reach some of most
vulnerable elements in society. Efforts are needed to ensure spending cuts do not
weaken the social safety net.



Budget planning. Accurate revenue and expenditure forecasts are needed to ensure
realistic budgets and avoid supplementary budgets and under-execution of the budget
that result from revenue underperformance or underestimation of spending.
Moreover, further expanding the medium-term elements of the fiscal framework
would help to anchor fiscal policy around the goal of public debt sustainability.



Financial sector. Stronger financial sector supervision and contingency planning will
help to ensure the authorities are able to monitor the health of the system carefully

10
and respond appropriately to problems that emerge. This includes powers of the
banking regulator to impose fit and proper requirements on bank owners and to
intervene banks that are not viable. A framework for cooperation between the NBRM,
the Finance Ministry, and other agencies, along the lines recommended by the
February 2009 IMF technical assistance mission, is also important to provide for a
quick response to threats.


Electricity sector. It will be important over time to revise the tariff structure to better
reflect the costs of service delivery. This will help eliminate hidden and crosssubsidies that are poorly targeted, encourage inefficient patterns of consumption,
damage incentives for investment, and impose fiscal or quasi-fiscal costs. New
investment in generation capacity is also needed in light of inadequate domestic
supplies and the high price of energy imports. In view of financial and environmental
considerations, use of PPPs and renewable energy sources should be promoted.
Privatization of power generation and reforms to create a more modern and
transparent regulatory framework will be helpful in this regard.

3.

The teams agreed on the following division of labor.



The Fund, which has a full-time resident advisor in place (funded by the Dutch
government) as well as a full program of technical assistance missions, will retain the
lead in tax administration reform. Priorities for the coming year include reviewing the
progress in modernizing revenue administration and addressing compliance problems
that have emerged with the economic slowdown, and coordinating technical
assistance with other donors.



The Bank will support the Government in undertaking an analysis of the recent
changes to the pension system and their implications for its financial sustainability
and will work with the authorities to make needed adjustments to preserve the
system’s sustainability and prevent a drain on general tax revenues.



Social safety net. The Bank will continue to advise the government on measures to
consolidate various programs and improve targeting through its Social Protection
Implementation Loan (SPIL) and Conditional Cash Transfers (CCT) operations.
Future priorities include introduction of a registry of programs and beneficiaries,
initiating a conditional cash transfer system to ensure compliance with requirements
for mandatory secondary school enrollment, consolidation of benefits, etc. Once
implemented, these activities should result in better administration and targeting of
social programs.



Both the Fund and the Bank will encourage the authorities to implement realistic,
predictable, and transparent budget procedures. The Fund will also encourage the

11
authorities to anchor fiscal policies in a credible medium-term fiscal framework and
are prepared to offer technical assistance for that purpose.


The Fund and Bank have both been involved in financial sector reform, most recently
through the November 2008 FSAA update. The Fund has also provided technical
assistance in the area of contingency planning and will provide further assistance in
this area as well as in stress testing bank balance sheets. The Bank is also
administering a Dutch trust fund providing technical assistance for the
implementation of the Supervisory Development Plan, which is supporting the
introduction of risk-based bank supervision.



The Bank has the lead on electricity sector reform. It will continue to encourage the
adoption over time of realistic prices of electricity and elimination of subsidized rates
for consumers. It is also supporting the preparation of the Energy Sector Strategy and
advising the government on promoting use of alternative ways of financing energy
sector investments (PPPs) as well as diversifying energy sources (use of gas,
renewables, wind etc.). The Bank is also providing technical assistance to strengthen
the capacities of the Energy Regulatory Commission, The Bank’s Energy Community
of South East Europe Adaptable Programmatic Loan 3 (ECSEE APL3) supports
improvements of interconnectivity and the transmission grid. Finally, the GEF project
support activities that promote energy efficiency and greater use of renewable sources
of energy.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
Executive Board Meeting
December 11, 2009
1.
This statement provides information that has become available since the staff report
for the 2009 Article IV Consultation was issued. The thrust of the staff appraisal remains
unchanged.
2.
On November 30 the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia (NBRM)
announced a reduction in its reference rate from 9 to 8½ percent. In explaining this decision,
Governor Goshev cited favorable developments in international reserves and faster than
expected external adjustment. Reserves were €1.6 billion on December 2, up from
€1.55 billion at end-October, while the NBRM now expects the 2009 current account deficit
to be 8 percent of GDP, compared to its projection in October of 9.1 percent of GDP.
3.
The staff report advised that further evidence of external stabilization would be
desirable before easing. Based on the most recent data, reserves are likely to be higher at end2009 than the €1.4 billion projected in the staff report, which suggests more favorable
balance of payments developments over the past two months than projected by staff. In staff's
view, the 50 basis point cut by the NBRM is justified based on the improved outlook.
However, in light of continued uncertainties, staff would recommend that further easing
should be cautious and conditioned on the continuation of favorable trends in reserves and
the balance of payments.
4.
The NBRM also announced on November 30 that the mandatory reserve requirement
imposed when a bank’s consumer loan portfolio grows by more than a prescribed rate would
be allowed to expire on January 1, 2010. This requirement, which the 2008 Article IV staff
report had recommended eliminating, had limited impact in light of the slow credit growth
over the past year.

Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 09/140
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 28, 2009

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with
FYR Macedonia
On December 11, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation with the Former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia (FYR).1
Background
FYR Macedonia’s main vulnerability at the outset of the global crisis was its large
current account deficit in the context of the exchange rate peg to the euro. At the
same time, it benefited from a small fiscal deficit, modest public debt, significant
international reserve buffers, and a small banking system with limited reliance on
external financing. These factors provided room for maneuver and limited the
country’s exposure to global financial conditions.
The crisis hit Macedonia at the end of 2008 through a collapse in export demand
and decline in external financing. These factors led to a sharp slowdown in the
economy, reduced tax revenues, and a significant loss of central bank foreign
exchange reserves.
The National Bank of Macedonia (NBRM) responded to reserve outflows by
tightening bank liquidity and reserve requirements and raising its policy rate from 7
to 9 percent. These actions helped to slow credit growth and contain the loss of
reserves. The government curtailed planned spending increases to preserve its 2.8
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities.

2
percent fiscal deficit target in the face of declining tax revenues. It also issued an
€175 million Eurobond (at 9⅞ percent) in July, which bolstered reserves and
ensured sufficient budget financing.
By the second half of 2009 the situation had stabilized, confidence had improved,
and reserve losses from earlier in the year had been recouped. In the banking
sector, nonperforming loans rose, but capital adequacy ratios remained high and no
significant liquidity pressures emerged. For the year as a whole, GDP is expected to
decline 1.3 percent, less than most countries in the region, before returning to
2 percent growth in 2010.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors praised the Macedonian authorities for the conduct of
macroeconomic policies, which contributed to a modest downturn in Macedonia’s
economy relative to other countries in the region. They welcomed the prospect of a
return to growth in 2010. Nevertheless, the large—albeit reduced—current account
deficit in the context of an exchange rate peg is a source of vulnerability and limits
the room for policy maneuver. In the near term, supporting growth while reducing
external imbalances will remain a key challenge.
Directors agreed that the exchange rate peg, supported by prudent fiscal and
monetary policies, has served Macedonia well. They took note of the staff
assessment that there is no significant exchange rate misalignment. They
encouraged the authorities to press ahead with structural reforms to boost
competitiveness and foster foreign direct investment, particularly administrative and
judicial reforms.
Directors observed that the tightening of monetary policy in the first half of 2009 had
helped to rebuild international reserves and provided critical support to the exchange
rate peg. They supported the recent cut in the policy rate, given more conducive
conditions. Going forward, Directors called for cautious monetary easing that should
await clear signs of lasting favorable trends in the balance of payments and
international reserves.
Directors supported the fiscal stance in 2009 and 2010, which aims to accommodate
automatic stabilizers and protect spending from the cyclical shortfall in revenues.
Noting that revenue assumptions for 2010 may prove somewhat optimistic, they
welcomed the authorities’ readiness to take all the necessary measures to meet the
deficit target for 2010. They were also reassured by the authorities’ commitment to
fiscal consolidation over the medium term, and recommended that fiscal targets be
guided by debt sustainability considerations.

3

Directors were encouraged by the broadly healthy condition of the banking system
and its low reliance on external funding. They welcomed the authorities’ intentions to
move forward on the recommendations in the Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP) Update, including strengthening crisis response mechanisms, and legal
changes enabling the authorities to intervene in troubled banks without being subject
to court challenge. They looked forward to early operation of the recently created
supervisory body for the insurance sector.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or countries)
concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with member
countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex
post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued
after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive
Board in a particular case.

1/ Contribution to growth.

Statement by Age Bakker, Executive Director for Former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia, and Mihai Tanasescu, Advisor to the Executive Director
December 11, 2009
On behalf of the authorities we thank staff for their report and contribution to the policy
dialogue and their analysis and recommendations. They appreciate the Fund’s advice and the
presentation of the topics covered in the Selected Issues report. The authorities value their
cooperation with the Fund, and are of the view that the consultation process has worked well
and has focused on topics of importance to the Macedonian economy. There is broad
agreement between the authorities and staff on fiscal and monetary policies. Some nuances in
views remain with regard to fiscal policy in the medium term, but the authorities are of the
opinion that the consultations provided a good opportunity to focus on the economic aspects
aimed at strengthening macroeconomic stability and intensifying efforts for recovery.
Economic performance and outlook
The current economic crisis hit Macedonia at the end of 2008, but the activity in the domestic
economy proved to be relatively resistant to the global shock. For 2009 the authorities expect
a moderate contraction of 0.6 percent of GDP, after 1.2 percent of GDP decline in the first
half of the year, and a more stable situation in the second half of 2009. This contraction is
significantly lower than the economic decline in most of the other economies in the region.
The main factors behind the slowdown in the economy were a collapse in export demand and
industrial production, and loss of external financing. The latter eased in the second part of
2009 and international reserves have recouped 80 percent of their earlier losses.
For 2010 a moderate recovery to 2 percent growth is expected, which would be triggered
primarily by exports and revitalization of investment demand. At the same time, the
authorities expect a moderate increase in private consumption, and a slight increase in
imports, conditioned by exports recovery and new investments. Risks related to growth
projections still exist, however, especially in case of failure of export demand to recover as
expected, or renewed weakness of metal prices. On the upside, progress towards EU
accession will improve prospects for attracting foreign investment.
Inflation started falling in late 2008 due to decline in import prices, including food and
energy, and reduced pressures of domestic demand due to a sharp decline in industrial
production. By October 2009 headline inflation was -2.4 percent and core inflation was near
zero; by the end of the year inflation is expected to be around -1 percent (y-o-y). In 2010
prices are expected to rise by 1.2 percent due to supply-side factors. However, the
administrated prices could be a risk factor, and contribute to an increasing inflation rate at the
end of 2010.
The current account deficit initially widened in the first quarter, due to a massive decline in
exports, and delayed downward adjustment on imports, but started to adjust in the second
quarter, when imports began to contract sharply at the same time as the decline in exports
leveled off. Private transfers started to grow on an annual basis, and both the trade and
current account deficits began to decrease. The current account deficit is expected to narrow

-2-

in 2009 at around 9 percent of GDP from 13 percent of GDP in 2008, and continue to do so
over the medium term. For 2010 the current account deficit is projected to decrease to 8
percent of GDP and to 5 percent by 2014. The large current account deficit, in the context of
the exchange rate peg, makes Macedonia dependent on continued external financing, and the
authorities are committed to strengthening both fiscal and monetary policies, if needed, to
keep the exchange rate peg, which has served the country well.
Fiscal policy
In recent years the authorities have successfully pursued fiscal consolidation, and this
provided room in the current economic crisis to implement some fiscal stimulus in 2009 and
to move ahead with improving the infrastructure and to create a positive impact on the output
of the private sector in the long run. The fiscal deficit in 2009 would reach 2.8 percent of
GDP and both the authorities and staff agreed that this target is appropriate given the modest
levels of public debt, and secured financing through an Eurobond issue. The authorities are
committed to improving the fiscal stance, and they approved the 2010 budget with a smaller
fiscal deficit than in 2009. Staff consider the 2010 budget to be appropriate, although they
view its revenue assumptions as somewhat optimistic, due to factors including the cut in
social contribution rates and changes in the corporate income tax. Against this background,
the authorities are fully committed to keeping the budget deficit under control and will take
all necessary measures in order to meet the 2.5 percent of GDP 2010 deficit target, and
agreed with staff’s recommendations for adjusting the fiscal policy, if needed.
Consistent with their commitment to fiscal consolidation, the authorities agreed with the need
to reduce the fiscal deficit over the medium term to 2 percent of GDP, in light of the need to
increase investment spending and improve infrastructure. Staff recommended that the fiscal
deficit should be limited to a somewhat lower level of 1.5 percent of GDP to keep a prudent
public debt ratio which would be around 25 percent of GDP. The authorities acknowledge
staff’s concerns regarding the fiscal deficit target over the medium term, but are committed
to continuing fiscal consolidation which would help contain the current account deficit and
protect reserves and the peg.
Monetary policy and financial sector
The National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia (NBRM) continues to play an important
role in ensuring the stability of the exchange rate peg. In 2009 the NBRM responded well to
reserve outflows by increasing its policy rate by 2 percent from 7 to 9 percent. These
measures significantly decelerated both monetary and credit growth and helped to tighten
international reserves and keep them at 3 months of imports. After a sharp decline in the first
part of the year, reserves recouped much of their losses and had reached the level of 1.6
billion euros at the beginning of December. In response to the recent more favorable external
sector developments and more stable prospects for 2010, the NBRM reduced its policy rate
by 0.5 percent to 8.5 percent, which signals a more stable environment and a return to
growth.

At the same time, with credit growth being subdued and expectations moderate, the NBRM
decided not to extend the decision on compulsory deposits that expires at the end of 2009.
Moreover, the NBRM is committed to tightening its monetary policy, if needed, in order to
protect reserve buffers and to keep a stable exchange rate peg which would continue to be the
main nominal anchor for stabilizing market expectations and prices.
The banking sector seems to have weathered the crisis in an overall healthy shape, and the
banks are well capitalized and still profitable. At the end of September the capital adequacy
ratio was 16.5 percent, higher than the legally prescribed minimum of 8 percent. At the same
time, the NBRM agreed to implementing the FSAP recommendations, including undertaking
legal changes to allow it to intervene in troubled banks without being subject to court
challenge and to remove bank management who do not meet appropriate standards of
integrity. At the same time, the quality of banking supervision has improved and contributed
to the stability of the banking sector.
Structural reforms
Macedonia has made significant progress on structural reforms, attracting greenfield foreign
direct investment, privatizing and restructuring the railway system, liberalizing the
telecommunications, and improving the business climate. The recent measures approved by
the government to reduce the social contributions rate over the medium term will stimulate
employment and encourage lower paid workers to enter the formal economy. The authorities
are committed to accelerating the electricity sector reform, by gradually eliminating the
existing distortions and improving the companies’ capacity to cover their costs, and to focus
on the administrative reform, aimed at streamlining and improving efficiency.
Finally, we would like to express the authorities’ commitment to continuing to work with the
Fund, in pursuing reforms and maintaining a strong policy framework that will help the
country to strengthen macroeconomic stability.
