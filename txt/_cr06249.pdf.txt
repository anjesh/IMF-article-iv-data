EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
Slovenia is on the verge of joining the euro area. Favorable initial conditions and generally
sound macroeconomic and incomes policies over the past decade have allowed Slovenia to
sustain robust growth with gradually lower inflation. With the Maastricht criteria met at end2005 and the tolar’s two successful years in ERM2, the EU has ruled that Slovenia can adopt
the euro on January 1, 2007.
Structural reform has trailed progress with macroeconomic policies, leaving the
economy with many rigidities. Generous social benefits have led to low labor participation
rates. Slow privatization, labor market rigidities, and regulatory constraints have been
reflected in FDI flows and productivity growth lagging behind those of regional peers. An
inflexible budget and one of the fastest aging populations in Europe also pose challenges to
Slovenia’s success in the euro zone.
Policy Discussions
With immediate prospects largely favorable, the discussions focused on the policy
requirements for maintaining a balanced expansion, increasing the economy’s
flexibility, and supporting long-term growth:
•

Near-term policies. In 2006–07, the economy is expected to stay close to capacity,
with growth around 4 percent and inflation moderate. The authorities and staff agreed
that a neutral fiscal stance is appropriate in 2006, and that policy rates should be kept
unchanged until euro adoption, market conditions permitting. In the context of a
generally sound banking system but rising pressures on profitability, bank supervision
needs to guard against market and credit risks.

•

Fiscal policy in the medium term. The authorities envisage major tax and
expenditure reforms to achieve structural balance by 2010. The staff welcomed this
goal while urging advancing the target date and front loading the consolidation, to
support balanced growth and address aging-related sustainability concerns. The tax
reform is aimed at improving incentives to work, whereas plans on spending reform
have yet to be firmed. However, the authorities agreed on the need for expenditure
flexibility in the euro zone, and shared the staff’s concern about longer-term
budgetary pressures from population aging. Better targeting of benefits and linking
them to activation policies, parametric reform of the public pension system, and
measures to boost private savings are key in this regard.

•

Reducing structural obstacles to growth. The authorities are actively considering
other ways to increase labor market participation and flexibility. They also agree on
the need to improve the regulatory environment to attract FDI and raise productivity.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Slovenia is set to become the first among the new EU member states to adopt the
euro. Aided by broadly favorable initial conditions and generally sound macroeconomic and
incomes policies, Slovenia has over the past
decade sustained robust growth with small
external imbalances, while gradually lowering
inflation to euro-area levels. Long-term interest
rates, the fiscal deficit, the public debt ratio, and
inflation were all within the Maastricht Treaty
limits at end-2005. This, combined with the tolar’s
two successful years within the ERM2, has set the
stage for euro adoption in January 2007.
Growth has been strong over the past decade.

2.
The achievements notwithstanding,
Slovenia faces structural challenges that need
to be addressed to ensure success in the euro
zone. Although Slovenia’s gradualist approach to
reform has contributed to macroeconomic
stability, it has left the country with many
structural rigidities—notably an inflexible budget,
a welfare system that discourages labor
participation, and a restrictive business
environment. The loss of the exchange rate
instrument puts a premium on softening these
rigidities. Over the longer horizon, Slovenia’s
population aging is expected to be among the
most rapid in Europe, creating strong fiscal
pressure through higher pension and health
spending. Combined with a productivity growth
lagging behind that of the other new Central
European EU members (NM-8), this demographic
trend could also weaken the growth potential.
With the near-term outlook largely benign, the
Article IV consultation focused on how to deal
with these medium- and longer-term challenges.

II. BACKGROUND
3.
Strong growth continued in 2005, bringing output close to potential (Table 1,
Figures 1 and 2). In 2004, GDP growth reached a five-year peak of 4¼ percent, fueled by
EU-accession-related investment, including inventory accumulation. Although the
subsequent unwinding of inventories slowed domestic demand, growth in 2005 at 3.9 percent
remained above the estimated potential of 3¾ percent, driven by strong exports.
Consumption continued to contribute to growth, buoyed by real wage increases (of around

6

2 percent) and booming consumer loans. The strong activity boosted job creation, especially
in services, and unemployment remained low at 6½ percent even as participation rates
improved slightly. These trends, and the increase of the capacity utilization rate to the highest
level in a decade, suggest that the output gap has been closed almost fully.
4.
In keeping with its record of fiscal prudence, Slovenia maintained a tight fiscal
stance in 2005 (Table 2). In a
performance setting it apart from its

5.
With limited scope for independent central bank action, monetary conditions
tightened only marginally in 2005 (Table 3 and Figure 3). Having set its key policy interest
rate at 4 percent upon entering ERM2 in 2004, the BoS maintained the rate at that level
through 2005. However, a surge in short-term capital inflows prompted reductions in
February and March 2006 by 25 basis points each. Together with the recent increases in
European Central Bank (ECB) rates, this narrowed the tolar–euro interest rate differential
from 2 to 1 percent. Yet, the tolar-euro exchange rate has remained stable, aided by BoS
swap operations.2 With a broadly unchanged REER and lower inflation, the BoS stance
implied a slight tightening of monetary conditions in 2005.
6.
In the context of broadly neutral macroeconomic policies, wage discipline has
supported disinflation (Figures 4 and 5). Despite the diminished slack in activity, core
inflation more than halved—to less than 1 percent—during 2005, owing to lower tolar
depreciation expectations, increased competition following EU accession, and prudent
macroeconomic and incomes policies. In particular, guidelines setting wage growth below

(Ratio)

Slovenia’s competitive position in the hightech industries of the EU-15 is eroding as
regional competitors gain markets at a faster
pace. Revealed comparative advantage
indicators—Slovenia’s high-tech export share
relative to that of the world—show that, although
Slovenia had a strong initial competitive
position, other NM-8s are catching up fast.

The pace of quality improvement has also
been slower than in the other NM-8s. The
change in unit value ratios (UVRs) of
Slovene exports —a proxy for quality—has
been lagging behind that of NM-8 exports.
This is linked to Slovenia’s small gains in
market share in EU-15. A possible
explanation is Slovenia’s relatively favorable
initial position, which reduces the scope for
catch-up. But, given the low FDI, Slovenia
may have missed opportunities to gain from
technological spillovers and market linkages.

Cross-border flows increased in 2005, signaling closer integration with global
financial markets in the run-up to euro adoption (Table 5). With domestic interest rates
declining toward EU levels and the local stock market underperforming, investors sought to
diversify their portfolios to higher yielding markets abroad. In particular, households’
appetite for foreign-oriented mutual funds and firms’ direct investment abroad increased.
Also, as deposits were declining as a source of funding, banks resorted to longer-term foreign
borrowing—mostly at variable rates and with higher liquidity risk—to meet the strong
demand for credit. Although gross external debt increased rapidly as a result, net debt
remains at 20 percent of GDP, which together with the imminent euro adoption and a one-to-

conditions.

The banking system remains sound and stable, but pressures on profitability
and market risks are increasing (Table 6, Figures 10 and 11). On the positive side, bank
profitability improved slightly in 2005 despite a drop in interest income and increased
competitive pressures. Also, the non-performing loan ratio declined, although this partly
reflected a rapid expansion of new credit. But there were also indications of a relaxation of
credit standards in the competition for market share, which combined with the increasing
recourse to variable rate contracts has increased interest rate risks and the associated credit
risks. This is increasingly straining bank profitability, which is already low by regional
standards.

III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
12.
With immediate prospects largely favorable but longer-term structural
challenges looming, the discussions focused on the policy requirements for maintaining
a balanced expansion, increasing the economy’s flexibility, and supporting long-term
growth in the face of population aging. The mission also discussed the prospects for the
financial sector after euro adoption. In line with previous consultations (Box 2), there was
much agreement on the direction of policies, although the authorities stressed that substantive
reforms are likely to take time in a consensus-driven society.
Box 2. Implementation of Past IMF Policy Recommendations
Fiscal policy. Slovenia has maintained an overall prudent fiscal policy, which the staff has
supported. The fiscal stance has also been adjusted to cyclical conditions in line with staff
recommendations. The authorities have been less successful in undertaking needed expenditure
rationalization.
Monetary policy and financial sector issues. Over the years, the BoS followed a gradual
approach to disinflation based on declining currency depreciation. While not disagreeing with
the strategy, the staff argued for slower nominal depreciation of the currency and slower
decline in tolar interest rates to achieve faster disinflation. After entering the ERM2 in June
2004, the BoS kept policy interest rates unchanged as long as possible in a cyclical upswing—
as advocated by staff—until a surge in short-term capital inflows recently forced a reduction.
Slovenia has also implemented most of the recommendations of the 2001 FSAP and of the
2004 FSSA update.
Structural reforms. Over the years, the authorities have generally resisted staff’s
recommendations to deepen and accelerate structural reforms. This reflects the slow decisionmaking process in a consensus-driven society. The government in power since December 2004
has expressed a strong commitment to reforms, which the staff supports. However, progress
since last year has been slow.

A. Outlook
13.
The authorities and staff expected the economy to stay close to capacity, with
growth around 4 percent in 2006 and 2007, and inflation to remain moderate. Domestic
demand would be the main driver, as investment is expected to recover, led by construction
activity. Household consumption should remain moderate, provided real wage growth
continues to lag behind productivity growth. Although export growth is likely to be sustained
given strong external demand, net exports would be flat owing to a pick up in capital imports.
This assessment is supported by indicators of consumer and business confidence, and is in
line with private sector forecasts. Assuming oil prices of $70 per barrel in 2006 and wages
trailing productivity growth, the staff projects average inflation at 2½ and 2¼ percent in 2006
and 2007, respectively, slightly above the authorities’ projections. The government’s Institute
for Macroeconomic Analysis and Development (IMAD), in particular, projected inflation at
2.1 percent in both years, mainly because it assumes lower wage, oil price, and domestic
demand pressures.

11

14.
The short-term risks to both growth and inflation were jointly seen as mainly on
the upside. The staff assumes nominal wage growth to accelerate to 5 percent in 2006–07
from an estimated 4¾ percent in 2005, still consistent with average wage growth lagging
productivity growth by ½-1 percentage points. This baseline takes into account the recent
reversal of the trend of declining unemployment owing to an increase in participation. But so
far there has been no wage agreement for 2006–07, and larger wage settlements than those
assumed would have knock-on effects on pensions and household demand. Furthermore,
higher energy prices would result in second-round effects in the absence of countervailing
policies that had helped offset the impact of oil prices in recent years. On the downside, a
sharp appreciation of the euro, or a sluggish euro-area recovery could slow demand.
15.
Turning to the medium term, the authorities concurred that a loss of
competitiveness following euro adoption was a key risk facing Slovenia. In particular,
strong wage growth could lead to real exchange rate appreciation and loss of export
competitiveness. To mitigate this risk, the authorities saw the need to focus structural reforms
on productivity-enhancing measures to reduce the rigidities that remained an obstacle to
growth. Greater flexibility was also needed to deal with possible external shocks from
changes in international interest rates and euro appreciation in the context of unwinding
global imbalances. The DSA (Appendices 3 and 4) indicates that a combination of these
factors would also affect external debt dynamics. Under a baseline that assumes continued
strong appetite for foreign loans by banks, the gross external debt-to-GDP ratio would rise to
over 90 percent by 2010. Despite this increase, risks are contained as net debt remains
resilient to standard shocks to interest rates, growth, or exchange rate changes, owing to the
large shares of long-term debt and gross foreign assets.
B. Near-Term Policies: How to Maintain a Balanced Expansion?
16.
While recognizing the limited scope for independent monetary policy, the staff
agreed with the authorities that policy rates should be kept unchanged as long as
market conditions permit. With the economy in no need for additional stimulus, policy
rates should ideally be equalized with the ECB just ahead of euro adoption in January 2007.
But the authorities recognized that if Slovenia’s risk premium falls rapidly and capital
inflows surge, they may be forced to equalize rates earlier than that. Moreover, the remaining
interest rate differential may narrow even faster if the ECB continues to raise interest rates.
The authorities and staff therefore concurred that the onus of moderating domestic demand
and inflationary pressures fell largely on fiscal policy.
17.
While agreeing that a neutral fiscal stance would be appropriate in 2006, the
authorities saw this challenging to achieve, given existing commitments and
overperformance in 2005. Implementing the approved 2006 budget would imply a fiscal
impulse of ½ percent of GDP (text table). Additional expenditure for highway construction

by a public enterprise could boost it further by ⅓ percent of GDP, while election-year
spending by municipalities out of their surplus funds provided further risks. Against this
background, the authorities agreed to take measures to maintain the deficit at about 1 percent
of GDP, but highlighted the difficulties with securing short-term expenditure savings in a
rigid budget.
18.
The staff noted that wage restraint and strong productivity growth were also
essential to sustaining non-inflationary growth. The consensus among social partners that
has allowed wage growth to lag behind productivity growth has been critical for preventing

cost-push pressures. The staff pointed out that inability to contain unit labor costs has often
been the distinguishing factor among countries that have underperformed in the Euro zone.3
In this regard, current pent-up wage pressures posed a risk, especially following euro
adoption. While acknowledging the risk, officials were confident that prudent wage
settlements could be reached, given the social consensus about the need to maintain
competitiveness in the euro zone.
C. Containing Financial Vulnerabilities

The authorities concurred that, with rising pressures on bank profitability, bank
supervision needed to be vigilant to prevent credit standards from weakening and
balance sheet vulnerabilities from emerging. Bank profitability is under increasing strain

the longer run the combination of these
factors could weaken balance sheets in some banks. The authorities concurred, and noted that
they are stepping up risk-based supervision of banks’ credit assessment standards to reduce
credit risks. Nevertheless, these risks are contained—the authorities’ stress tests indicate that
a one percentage point decline in interest margins leads only to a 0.6 percentage point decline
in capital adequacy ratios.
20.
Both sides also agreed that while euro adoption will eliminate most exchange
rate risks, the banking sector is becoming increasingly susceptible to market risks. A
substantial share of new loans carry variable interest rates, exposing borrowers and banks to
increases in euro-area interest rates. Also, the increased interest-rate sensitivity of lending
can rapidly translate into credit risks. With borrowers having seen interest rates only decline
over the past decade, the staff recommended increasing public awareness of interest rate
risks, and that supervisors collect more comprehensive data on household indebtedness,
including indicators of debt concentration and debt-servicing capacity. The rapid growth of
mortgages suggests that the housing market is a related risk, and a database of residential real

estate transactions should be established to monitor developments in prices and turnover.
BoS officials agreed, but noted that expanding the credit registry to cover households is
hampered by the unwillingness of some large banks to share data to protect their market
positions. They also noted that the increase in the foreign assets of Slovenian residents has
reduced the vulnerability of Slovenian banks to foreign interest rate shocks.
21.
The authorities emphasized that, in an environment of strong cross-border
financial linkages, they are increasingly cooperating with foreign supervisors to better
detect regional vulnerabilities and limit contagion risks. Slovenian banks—about one
third of whose equity is foreign owned—rely heavily on borrowing from foreign institutions
that have a high exposure to the region (most of the increase in liabilities in 2005 was to

increased concentration of risks as foreign banks lent through subsidiaries specializing in the
region. They also expressed concern that under the new EU directives national authorities
would not have supervisory control over majority foreign owned-banks, but would remain
responsible for guaranteeing their deposits. The staff noted that this concern would need to
be weighed against the considerable potential for increased profitability and technological
upgrading that divestment of the state’s large remaining share in banks would bring.
D.

Fiscal Policy in the Medium Term: Enhancing Flexibility, Efficiency, and
Sustainability

22.
The government envisages significant tax and expenditure reforms to achieve
structural balance over the medium term. Under the current budget forecast, the
authorities aim for a 1 percent of GDP general government deficit in 2008 and structural
balance in 2010. To lower the tax wedge and the high marginal tax rates, a gradual
elimination of the payroll tax is planned through 2008. To further increase supply-side
incentives, the authorities are also considering reducing the progressivity of personal and
corporate income taxation, with an increase in indirect taxes as the offset. The most radical of
these proposals, a flat tax, is facing opposition from unions and parts of the government,
mainly on equity grounds. Expenditure reductions, mainly in the wage bill and discretionary
and social outlays, have yet to be identified.

15

23.
While concurring on the need for fiscal consolidation, the staff noted that
cyclical and long-term sustainability considerations call for frontloading the
adjustment. Under the authorities' plan, the structural deficit would decline only marginally
over the next three years. To contain demand pressures with output close to potential, the
staff argued for early achievement of at least structural balance. Specifically, the staff
recommended that structural balance, or even a small surplus, should be reached in 2009,
implying an annual adjustment of some ⅓-½ percent of GDP. While the public debt outlook
remains favorable and resilient to shocks, longer-term aging considerations also support the
case for faster consolidation. The staff pointed out that, under current policies, the long-run
fiscal sustainability gap—the permanent adjustment needed to restore inter-temporal
balance—is 10 percent of GDP in net present value terms (SIP). Moreover, each year of
delay in reform increases the needed adjustment by ⅛ percent of GDP. Accordingly, the staff
urged the authorities to move rapidly from plans to action with the envisaged tax and
expenditure measures. The authorities agreed on the economic merits of faster adjustment,
but noted that reaching political consensus on any change in social entitlements could be
slow and difficult.
24.
While supporting the tax reform plans, the staff stressed the importance of
focusing expenditure reform to reduce structural rigidities. The planned tax reforms
would reduce marginal effective tax rates, which are among the highest in Europe, and
improve supply-side incentives to work, especially for high-skilled workers. But these
needed to be supplemented by benefit reform, so as to improve incentives for labor
participation, remove welfare traps that discourage the unemployed from re-entering the
labor market, offset lower tax revenues, and make room for higher spending for an ageing
population. The authorities noted that discussions on spending reform were ongoing. The
staff welcomed the creation of a central registry of social benefits to prevent abuse and the
draft law in parliament linking unemployment benefits to activation policies. Looking
forward, the authorities were considering plans to unify various benefit indexation formulae,
implement more flexible work arrangements in the public sector, trim public employment by
one percent annually over the next three years, and adopt performance-based budgeting on a
pilot basis.

could be enhanced by reviewing rigid
social sector funding and institutional
arrangements, giving priority to reforms
in areas where Slovenia's performance
falls most short of comparator countries
(text table). The authorities were well
aware of the need for fiscal flexibility in
adjusting to shocks, and welcomed the
staff’s analysis as a useful input into
their expenditure policy discussions.

26.
The authorities shared staff concerns about longer-term budgetary pressures
from population aging. Slovenia's pension problem is particularly severe: the country has
one of the most rapidly aging populations in Europe, one of the lowest average retirement
ages in Europe, and one of the highest ratios of pensions to wages among the NM-8 (Box 3
and SIP). The substantial parametric reforms initiated in 2000, which among other things
provided for a gradual increase in the retirement age, were subsequently set back by a shift to
wage-based indexation. With the reforms therefore insufficient to restore sustainability,
pension spending is projected to rise by over 7 percent of GDP by 2050. The authorities were
well aware of these challenges and were looking for ways to enhance sustainability of the
system, but noted that radical reform in the near term is unlikely. Measures are, however,
envisaged to boost private saving for pensions, including the removal of the minimum return
requirement on voluntary pensions and the establishment of employer-funded retirement
accounts. The authorities are also reviewing the number and indexation methods of the
numerous non-contribution based pension benefits. To deal more decisively with the aging
pressures, the staff recommended strengthening the link between benefits and contributions;
raising the statutory and effective retirement ages; revising the costly wage-based indexation
formula; and improving incentives for private saving for retirement.
E. Reducing Structural Obstacles to Growth
27.
The staff stressed the need for reforms to improve labor market participation
and flexibility. Despite Slovenia’s solid economic performance, productivity growth has not
shown the dynamism seen among regional competitors, and labor force participation has
fallen in relative terms (Box 4 and SIP). Trailing productivity performance compared with
other Central European countries appears closely linked to weak investment, labor market
rigidities, and regulatory constraints—factors that are slowing convergence to euro area
income levels.
28.
The authorities were actively considering ways to improve the functioning of the
labor market. Discussions were underway within the government and social partners on

Box 3. The Pension System and Early Retirement
Slovenia has one of the lowest retirement ages in Europe. The statutory retirement age—
currently at 61 years and 6 months for men, and 55 years and 4 months for women—will
remain among the lowest in Europe even after a recently-approved increase over the next
decade for employees with minimum pension-qualifying years. Combined with other
generous features of the pension system, Slovenia also has one of the lowest effective
retirement ages in Europe.

The current system encourages early retirement, especially for low-income male
workers. With the use of the accrual method, even under the newly approved higher
compulsory retirement age, the system of penalties and bonuses is not strong enough to
provide incentives to delay retirement. For example, a man earning the average wage who
qualifies for a pension with 35 years of service at age 58 has an incentive to retire almost two
years ahead of the full pensionable age of 63. These incentives are even stronger for lowincome earners.

The personal income tax is highly progressive (rates ranging from 16 to 50 percent), and in addition wages are
affected by a social security contribution of 22.1 percent and a progressive payroll tax (paid by the employer,
with rates ranging from 6 to 14.8 percent). The welfare system is among the most generous in the EU (IMF
Country Report No. 05/253, Table 8). In particular, net replacement rates exceed or equal OECD averages,
leading to high marginal effective tax rates (METRs), particularly for individuals seeking to move from
joblessness to work.

A simultaneous reform of the tax and welfare systems would boost labor participation. For example, less
progressive taxes, such as a flat tax, while improving work incentives for high-income workers, would not on
their own reduce METRs for low-income ones. Tax reform should therefore be accompanied by welfare reform
to increase participation rates among the latter. In particular, a reform of the unemployment assistance that
ensures a smooth transition in terms of lost benefits and increased taxation for lower-income workers would
increase their incentives to work.

19

further measures to link payment of social benefits with activation policies, in line with the
“flexicurity” and “work ability” models applied in the Nordic countries.4 These measures,
along with the reduction of marginal effective tax rates, would increase the incentives for
labor participation. The source of some youth unemployment may also lie with the education
system, which has weak links to private sector skill demands. Measures to ensure that
graduates enter the labor market with sufficient and marketable skills, and to create adequate
possibilities for life-long learning, would also help improve Slovenia’s competitive edge.
Concurrently, relaxing labor market regulations, including through lower costs of hiring and
firing and a wage-setting mechanism that allows an opt-out for distressed companies, would
be needed to increase labor demand. Labor market regulations have already become more
decentralized and flexible, although in practice wages still followed centrally-set guidelines.

Both sides saw room to improve the regulatory environment so as to reduce the
cost of doing business and attract investment. The Slovene economy is still heavily state
dominated, as evidenced by the lowest private sector share in the economy among the NM-8.

The relatively slow growth in productivity suggests that Slovenia is not climbing
up the technology ladder as fast as its regional peers. While there is evidence of
increasing specialization into high-tech sectors, export quality upgrading appears slower than
in regional competitors. This could be a factor in Slovenia's difficulty in increasing export
market shares. While noting that Slovenia's higher

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
Slovenia’s imminent entry into the euro area marks the culmination of a
successful economic transformation since independence in 1991. A skilled work force and
open trade regime have encouraged the development of a manufacturing and service base
that has generated solid economic growth. Inflation—after declining sharply in recent
years—is low, public and net external debt have stayed at moderate levels, and interest rates
are converging rapidly to euro area levels. The banking sector is sound. These achievements
testify that years of prudent macroeconomic and incomes policies have paid off. A benign
global economic environment should entrench these favorable developments in the near term.
32.
The task ahead is to translate these achievements into becoming a success within
the euro area. In recent years, the authorities’ policies have been driven mainly by the goals
of meeting the Maastricht criteria and a minimum stay in ERM2. To sustain income
convergence in the future, more attention will now be needed on improving economic
flexibility and long-term growth prospects. This will require policies that raise productivity,
improve sustainability of public finances, and create an efficient business environment and a
flexible labor market.
33.
Fiscal policy in the near term should be geared to containing the deficit to its
2005 level. Interest rate convergence to the lower euro area interest rates provides monetary
stimulus to an economy operating near capacity. Support to disinflation from incomes policy,
which has been crucial is sustaining balanced growth in the past, is still uncertain as wage
negotiations for 2006–07 have yet to be concluded. These factors and the loss of the
exchange rate instrument put a premium on prudent fiscal policy. To contain the inflation

21

risks and counterbalance the monetary stimulus, a neutral fiscal stance is called for. This
requires achieving expenditure savings to keep the fiscal deficit in 2006 to 1 percent of GDP,
½ percent of GDP below the budget.
34.
Over the medium term, fiscal policy will need to deal with the challenges of a
rapidly aging population, while improving the flexibility and efficiency of public
spending. The authorities’ commitment to achieving a structural balance over the medium
term is commendable, but the target date of 2010 could be advanced and the consolidation
made more front loaded than currently planned. This would both support balanced growth
and help address long-term debt sustainability concerns, as the impending growth in agerelated outlays provides a limited window of opportunity to create fiscal space. As regards
tax reform, implementing the plans to reduce the steeply progressive income taxes should
enhance incentives for more work and growth. These measures should be accompanied by
expenditure reforms that address fiscal rigidities and deal with age-related spending
pressures. Revision of the level and indexation mechanisms of the social benefits, parametric
reform of the public pension system, and measures to boost private savings for old-age
income are priorities in this regard. Together with better targeting and linking of social
benefits to activation policies, these measures should help increase budgetary flexibility,
incentives for work, and fiscal sustainability.
35.
While competitiveness appears adequate, challenges remain. Market expectations
are firmly anchored at the current level of the exchange rate for euro adoption, as was evident
when short-term capital inflows surged earlier this year on account of the interest rate
differential. Indicators of price competitiveness have been stable, studies on the equilibrium
exchange rate do not point to misalignment, and export growth remains strong. Nevertheless,
Slovenia trails other new EU member states in gaining export market shares, which could
pose a challenge after Slovenia enters the euro zone.
36.
To maintain competitiveness and ensure faster convergence, the authorities need
to speed up the implementation of policies to boost productivity growth and increase
labor flexibility and participation. Slovenia’s productivity growth and technological
progress have lagged behind regional peers, and labor participation among older and younger
workers is low. Slovenia also remains vulnerable to a persistent increase in unit labor costs.
Together with one of the fastest aging population in Europe, these trends pose significant
constraints on long-run growth. To address these challenges, Slovenia needs to redouble its
efforts toward raising labor utilization and upgrading technology. To increase labor input,
lower marginal tax rates, better targeting of social benefits and training, and reduced
incentives to retire early are key. Reducing regulatory constraints that hinder the business
environment and create labor market rigidities would help improve efficiency and promote
FDI. Flexibility in labor markets would also be enhanced by lowering the costs of firing and
hiring and establishing wage-setting mechanisms that allow distressed companies to opt out
of minimum increases. Enhancing productivity growth will in addition require higher
investment and a conducive environment for private-sector led growth, through privatization,
simplified business regulations, and R&D promotion.

22

37.
Although the banking system remains sound, supervision should be enhanced to
guard against market and credit risks. Borrowers will face higher interest rates in the
period ahead as euro-zone rates rise. This could translate into higher credit risk, particularly
for those banks that have lent aggressively to riskier borrowers to gain market share.
Although banks are expected to be resilient enough to withstand these shocks in the near
term, their profitability is coming under increasing stress from competition, yield
convergence, and loss of foreign exchange related income upon euro adoption. Supervisory
scrutiny of credit assessment standards should be strengthened to ensure that the balance
sheet transformation upon euro adoption does not lead to distress for some banks. The BoS
has already taken steps to ensure adequate liquidity standards in the euro changeover process.
These prudential measures should be complemented by strengthened coordination with
foreign supervisors to limit contagion risks deriving from the regional concentration of
funding. Surviving in this open, competitive, and rapidly changing international environment
will require increasingly efficient and dynamic institutions, which calls for an increased role
of the private sector in the banking system.
38.
It is recommended that the Article IV consultation with Slovenia remain on the 12month cycle.

APPENDIX II

SLOVENIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.

Data provision is adequate for surveillance purposes.

2.
Special Data Dissemination Standard: Slovenia has subscribed to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS), meets SDDS specifications, and its metadata are posted on
the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board on the Internet.
http://dsbb.imf.org/Applications/web/sddscountrycategorylist/?strcode=SVN
3.
Real Sector Statistics: The Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia (SORS)
follows the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA95). Quarterly GDP estimates by
industry and expenditure categories are compiled in both current and constant prices, and are
published within 80 days after the reference quarter. In September 2005, the SORS changed
the base year for compiling constant prices GDP from 2000 to the previous year’s prices and
started using the chain-link index methodology.
4.
The SORS compiles the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for
monitoring compliance with the Maastricht inflation criterion. However, price collection is
restricted to four cities and their surrounding rural areas. The weights are based on the threeyear average of expenditure data for consumer goods from continuous Household Budget
Surveys for 2002, 2003, and 2004. It also compiles a retail price index (RPI), which differs
from the consumer price index in weights only.
5.
Government Finance Statistics: Slovenian fiscal statistics are timely and of a high
quality. The ministry of finance publishes a comprehensive monthly Bulletin of Government
Finance, which presents monthly data on the operations of the “state budget” (Budgetary
Central Government), local governments, social security (Pension and Health funds), and the
consolidated general government. The coverage of general government excludes the
operations of extrabudgetary funds and own revenues of general government agencies
(zavods). However, these operations are small in size. Monthly fiscal indicators are reported
for publication in IFS on a timely basis and annual statistics covering general government
operations, including the operations of the extrabudgetary funds are reported for publication
in the Government Finance Statistic Yearbook (GFS Yearbook).
6.
The data published in the Bulletin of Government Finance are on a cash basis and
broadly use the analytical framework and classification system of the IMF’s 1986
government finance statistics methodology. The data reported for publication in the GFS
Yearbook are also on a cash basis but are recast in the analytical framework and
classifications of the Manual on Government Finance Statistics 2001(GFSM 2001).
7.
The Slovenian authorities wish to adopt the GFSM 2001 methodology, which could
then be used as a building block for the compilation of the ESA 95-based data jointly by the

Balance of Payments Statistics: Balance of payments data are comprehensive and of
high quality. The data have been published in the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook
since 1993 (with estimates of the international investment position published since 1994). In
2002, the Bank of Slovenia revised the balance of payments statistics going back to 1994; the
most significant revisions were related to the income component of the current account and
to the other investment component of the financial account.

APPENDIX III

SLOVENIA: PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
1.
Slovenia’s general government debt remained at 29 percent of GDP at end-2005,
which is well below the Maastricht criterion threshold (60 percent). The debt-to-GDP ratio
increased from 18.5 percent in 1994 in spite of fiscal surpluses or moderate deficits since
then. The increase was driven mainly from debt assumed as a result of bank and enterprise
restructuring and by the inheritance of liabilities from the former Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia.1 In addition, until 2000 the central government borrowed mainly through
inflation-linked (and to a lesser extent exchange-rate linked) instruments, which also
contributed to a rising debt profile despite a strong fiscal position.
2.
In the baseline, general government debt would peak at 29.8 percent of GDP in
2007 and decline steadily afterwards. The slight increase over 2006-07 reflects government
plans to finance the fiscal deficit more through borrowing and less through running down its
reserves. The debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to gradually decline to 27.2 percent by 2010,
reflecting fiscal consolidation. In 2000, the government started a gradual transition towards
the use of long-term nominal financing instruments. The first ten-year tolar-denominated
Treasury bonds were issued in 2003. As a result of this debt management policy, the share of
indexed debt is expected to steadily decline in the medium term. This explains why, unlike in
the past, the prudent medium-term fiscal policy is expected to translate into a declining debt
path.
3.
The baseline is relatively resilient to shocks and sustainability is not a problem.
The standard stress tests show that Slovenia’s public debt position is relatively resilient to a
wide range of shocks. Relative to the baseline, shocks to real interest rates, real GDP growth,
the primary balance, or a combination of all three would make the debt-to-GDP ratio rise at
most to around 30 percent. A scenario where, compared to the baseline, interest rates are
higher by 2 standard deviations (SD), real GDP growth is lower by one SD, and there is an
exchange rate appreciation that dissipates over time would lead to an increase in the debt-toGDP ratio to 37 ½ percent by 2010, a level still lower than the Maastricht criterion level.
However, such scenario would set Slovenia on a path of rapid public sector debt increase.

Debt assumption reached a peak in 1995, when they represented 45 percent of end-of-year
outstanding debt.

APPENDIX IV

SLOVENIA: EXTERNAL SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
4.
Although Slovenia’s outlook does not raise major concerns regarding external
sustainability, the recent deterioration in the external debt situation needs monitoring.
Under the baseline scenario, the external debt-to-GDP ratio which jumped by
13.3 percentage points in 2005 to 71.4 percent, will continue to grow, but at a slowing pace
until it reaches 92 percent in 2010. With the current account deficit in 2005 at 1.1 percent of
GDP, the increase in external debt could principally be attributed to the sharp rise in bank
loans from abroad and foreign deposits in the banking system substituting for lower deposit
growth. It is expected that the decline in mutual funds’ returns in 2005 would lead to a return
of deposits to banks. Although some of banks’ foreign borrowing is from parent companies,
as seen in other emerging economies, these loans could still be called back. As the bulk of
new borrowing is euro-denominated, barring a major unforeseen shock, the exchange risk is
low given the imminent euro adoption (January 2007). However, there are maturity and
credit risks arising from banks clients’ balance sheet imbalances. The external debt service,
as a ratio to exports of goods and services, is projected to rise from 17.4 percent in 2005 to
19.7 percent in 2008 and stabilize at around 19.5 percent over 2009-2010.
5.
Stress tests suggest that the baseline scenario is sensitive to shocks, but
Slovenia’s economy appears resilient to such shocks over the medium term. Standard
bound tests show a significant jump in the external debt-to-GDP ratio in 2006 by an average
of 6 percentage points and further gradual increases to at most 95 percent by 2010 (3 points
more than the baseline). A Slovenia-specific scenario assuming, relative to the baseline, a
combination of 2-standard deviation higher interest rates, 1-standard deviation lower real
GDP growth, and exchange rate appreciation that dissipates over time, would worsen debt
trends slightly. The debt-to-GDP ratio would jump by 7 percentage point jump to 79 percent
in 2006, and further increase to 96 percent of GDP by 2010. This would further increase the
already high external debt-to-export ratio from 105.5 percent in 2005 to 165 percent in 2010.
However, with the upcoming euro adoption, generally solid fundamentals and sound macro
policies, and the planned privatization of state assets, the medium-term external debt outlook
does not raise sustainability concerns at this point.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Slovenia
On June 30, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Republic of Slovenia.1
Background
Slovenia is set to become the first among the new European Union member states to adopt the
euro. Aided by broadly favorable initial conditions and generally sound macroeconomic and
incomes policies, Slovenia has over the past decade sustained robust growth with small
external imbalances, while gradually lowering inflation to euro-area levels. Long-term interest
rates, the fiscal deficit, the public debt ratio, and inflation were all within the Maastricht Treaty
limits at end-2005. This, combined with the tolar’s two successful years within the ERM2, has
set the stage for euro adoption in January 2007.
The Slovene economy continued to grow strongly in 2005 amid a stable macroeconomic
environment. Real GDP growth reached 4 percent supported by strong exports, while the
unwinding of inventories accumulated in 2004 ahead of EU accession slowed domestic demand
and imports. In spite of the oil price-driven deterioration of the terms of trade, the external
current account deficit in percent of GDP declined by half to about 1. As growth remained above
potential and idle capacity tightened, the output gap likely closed. Competitiveness remained
adequate, supported in part by the continued positive gap of 1 percent between productivity and
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed
during the Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

-2real wage growth. External debt jumped by 13 percentage points to 71½ percent of GDP
reflecting strong foreign borrowing by banks.
Average inflation in 2005 declined to 2½ from 3 ½ percent in 2004. Despite the reduced
available slack, core inflation more than halved to less than 1 percent during the year, owing to
lower tolar depreciation expectations, increased competition following EU accession, and
conservative wage policy. In particular the implementation of the guideline requiring real wage
to trail productivity helped minimize second-round effects of energy price shocks.
The fiscal deficit in 2005 remained low and public debt was kept at below 30 percent of GDP.
At 1.1 percent of GDP, the general government deficit was better than projected, reflecting oneoff municipal revenues and lags in spending EU transfers. Adjusting for cyclical effects, this
deficit implied a neutral fiscal stance. Tax revenue was buoyant, as indirect taxes recovered
from a temporary drop following EU accession in May 2004.
Monetary policy through 2005 was marginally tight, but credit growth remained strong. Upon
entering the ERM2 in 2004 the central bank set its key policy rate at 4 percent and kept it
unchanged until end-2005, 200 basis points (bps) above the European Central Bank (ECB)
refinance rate. However, a surge in short-term capital inflows in early 2006 and Bank of
Slovenia’s desire to prompt banks to gradually switch away from its bonds ahead of euro
adoption led to cumulative reductions in the policy rate of 75 bps, which together with increases
in the ECB refinancing rate, narrowed the interest rate differential with the ECB to 50 bps.
Buoyed by strong foreign borrowing by banks, credit growth accelerated by 3 percentage points
to 23 percent. Bank profitability and asset quality remained adequate and non-performing loans
declined—in part reflecting a rapid expansion of new credit. However, the relaxation of credit
standards owing to intense competition for market share and the increased recourse to variablerate contracts have increased interest and credit risks.
In 2006, growth is projected to remain around 4 percent, but would be more balanced.
The contribution of domestic demand would rebound, reflecting a recovery in investment and
steady growth of consumption. Investment would be supported by highway construction, and
lower inventory de-cumulation. Exports would continue to grow in line with favorable conditions
in the EU, while import growth would accelerate, reflecting stronger domestic demand.
This, combined with a further deterioration of the terms of trade would lead to the widening of
the external current account to 2 percent of GDP. Despite an expected up-tick in core inflation,
the Maastricht inflation ceiling is not expected to be breached, aided by price competition in the
euro zone and continued wage restraint. Fiscal policy would need to be at least neutral to
support this benign outlook.
Structural reform is still lagging, leaving the economy with many rigidities that pose challenges
to growth and fiscal sustainability in the long run. Slovenia is beset with a relatively unfriendly
business environment with an inflexible labor market, stringent business regulations, and a high
share of government ownership of enterprises. This has led to lackluster performance in
attracting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) relative to other Central European countries.
Generous welfare and retirement benefits have reduced labor participation, while one of the
fastest aging populations in Europe, highlights the challenge to long-run fiscal sustainability.

-3Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Slovenian authorities for the successful economic
transformation that has paved the way for the country’s entry into the euro zone in January
2007. They pointed to solid economic growth, low inflation, moderate public and external debt
levels, and a sound banking system as evidence that years of prudent macroeconomic and
incomes policies have paid off.
At the same time, Directors stressed that while the near-term outlook remains benign, important
challenges remain for the medium term. Sustaining income convergence in the euro zone
requires more attention to improving economic flexibility and long-term growth prospects.
Directors therefore emphasized the need to implement policies that increase productivity, create
an efficient business environment and a flexible labor market, and improve sustainability of
public finances in the face of population aging.
Directors noted that the imminent loss of the exchange rate instrument puts a premium on fiscal
and incomes policies to sustain a balanced expansion in the near term. With the output gap
virtually closed and interest rates converging toward euro area levels, Directors stressed the
need for a neutral fiscal stance in 2006 to contain inflation risks. This would require achieving
expenditure savings to keep this year’s fiscal deficit below budgeted levels. Directors also
emphasized the importance of continuing with prudent wage settlements to contain price
pressures and achieve a balanced growth.
Directors emphasized that over the medium term fiscal policy needs to deal with the challenges
of an aging population, while improving the flexibility and efficiency of public spending.
They welcomed the authorities’ commitment to achieve a structural fiscal balance over the
medium term, but recommended a frontloaded adjustment. This would help achieve balanced
growth and provide an early start to addressing long-term fiscal sustainability concerns related
to population aging. Directors welcomed the authorities’ plans to reduce the progressive income
taxes to enhance incentives to work and boost growth, but emphasized the need to accompany
tax reform with expenditure rationalization. They urged the authorities to focus expenditure
reforms on reducing fiscal rigidities and age-related spending pressures. Priorities in this regard
would be parametric reforms of the pension system, revisions of the level and indexation
mechanisms of social benefits, and linking social benefits to work-reinsertion policies.
Directors acknowledged that the authorities’ consensus-based approach to reforms had helped
preserve social cohesion, but noted that the authorities need to speed up the implementation of
policies that boost productivity growth and increase labor flexibility and participation to maintain
competitiveness and ensure faster convergence. They noted that while price competitiveness
appears adequate and export growth strong, Slovenia trails other new EU member states in
gaining market shares. They also observed that Slovenia’s productivity growth lags behind that
of its regional competitors, reflecting Slovenia’s high income level as well as weak FDI and
technological spillovers. Labor participation is also relatively low among the older and younger
working-age population. To deal with these challenges, Directors urged the authorities to speed
up efforts to raise labor utilization by lowering marginal tax rates, improving the targeting of
social benefits, and reducing incentives for early retirement. Simplifying business regulations
and reducing constraints that create labor market rigidities would increase efficiency and attract

-4FDI. In this respect, they welcomed the creation of centralized registration for independent
entrepreneurs and encouraged extending it to larger corporate entities. Directors also supported
the authorities’ plan to accelerate the divestment of public companies.
Directors observed that while the banking system is sound, bank supervision should be
enhanced to guard against market and credit risks. The rapid increase in credit amid
competition for market share has exposed banks to higher credit risks, especially as interest
rates in the euro zone are set to rise. Directors noted that although banks are expected to be
resilient to these shocks in the near term, euro adoption will pressure profitability through
competition, yield convergence, and loss of foreign exchange related revenue. Directors
welcomed the steps taken to ensure adequate liquidity standards upon euro adoption, but called
on the authorities to strengthen supervision of banks’ credit assessment standards to ensure
continued strong balance sheets. They encouraged enhanced coordination with foreign
supervisors to limit contagion risks arising from the regional concentration of funding. Directors
also urged further progress in increasing the role of the private sector in the banking system to
boost efficiency in an increasingly competitive international environment.

Statement by Johann Prader, Alternate Executive Director for the Republic of Slovenia
and Ksenija Maver, Advisor to Executive Director
June 30, 2006
Slovenia has fulfilled all Maastricht convergence criteria for the adoption of the euro.
Following the recommendations by the EU Commission and the European Central Bank, on
June 15 and 16, 2006 the European Council gave the political go-ahead for Slovenia’s
adoption of the euro on January 1, 2007. When the EU finance ministers will meet on
July 11, 2006, they are expected to formally adopt the decision and to fix the parity between
the Slovenian tolar and the euro. On June 2006, the European Commission proposed that
with effect from January 1, 2007, the exchange rate be fixed at 239.640 Slovenian tolars for
one euro, which is the central rate at which the Slovenian tolar entered ERMII two years ago.
Slovenia will become the 13th EU member state to adopt the euro as of January 1, 2007.
These milestones crown the substantial efforts invested by the Slovenian people into what
has become a national project. However, as discussed during the staff discussions for the
Article IV consultation held in March 2006, the agenda is not yet finished, either on the
macroeconomic or on the structural front.
The staff discussions showed a broad agreement between the authorities and the staff team on
the major policy issues.
Recent economic developments: economic activity, fiscal and monetary policies and
inflation
Economic trends in Slovenia remain broadly favorable. In the first quarter of 2006, economic
growth was 5.1 percent year on year. For 2006 as a whole, the authorities’ growth estimate is
the same as the staff’s (4.2 percent) and – like the staff’s forecast - slightly lower in the next
two years.
The Government’s Framework of Economic and Social Reforms adopted last November is
designed to significantly improve the competitiveness of the economy and to impart a new
momentum to growth for the period beyond 2008. The authorities are now considering
several important reform measures.
On the fiscal front, tax reform aimed at lowering the burden on labor is high on the agenda.
The plan is to specify all its elements by autumn – after taking into consideration the advice
of the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department mission which will visit Ljubljana in July – and to
have the reform ready for implementation in 2007. On the expenditure side, the Employment
and Insurance Against Unemployment Act, which is being currently discussed in the
Parliament, aims at better linking unemployment benefits to active job search and at making
the benefits system more transparent. A Social Protection Act, which would require greater
work effort by the recipients of social benefits is also being discussed in the Parliament.

2
Finally, the Ministry of Finance, with the help of the IMF’s Regional Public Financial
Management Advisor, is planning to address more systematically the issue of expenditure
efficiency and flexibility, as discussed with the staff, by improving budget procedures. It is
intended that work in this area will start with pilot projects in the fields of primary education
and family allowances.
As for wages, agreements were reached in June for adjustments in both private sector and
public sector wages. An increase of 2 percent was agreed for private sector wages in 2006
and 2007. For public sector wages, an increase of 2.35 percent will apply for 2006. However,
only about half of this increase will, in effect, be disbursed in 2006 and the rest being
retained until 2007 and then used for the elimination of wage disparities in line with the new
collective agreement. Thus, the general increase in wages is in line with expected inflation.
Earlier this year, the Bank of Slovenia started to align its interest rates with those of the ECB.
On June 8, 2006, the Bank cut the interest rate on 60-day tolar bills by 0.25 percentage points
to 3.25 percent. The objective of this move – which was made in parallel with the ECB’s
interest rate increase – was to make Slovenian tolar instruments less attractive for banks, and
to encourage them to replace tolar bills with European money market instruments.
There has been no significant excess supply of or demand for foreign exchange in the
markets since Slovenia joined ERM II, which indicates that the central rate is sustainable in
the long run. Since Slovenia has joined ERM II and up until June 2006, the average
differential between the exchange rate in the spot market and the central rate was 0.06
percent.
In May 2006, the EMU convergence price index in Slovenia was 2.4 percent, up from
2.3 percent in the previous month but by 0.3 percentage point below the convergence
criterion. Inflation was one of the toughest challenges faced by Slovenia in meeting the
Maastricht criteria. Helped by the Bank of Slovenia’s moderately restrictive monetary policy,
and coordination between the monetary, fiscal and other macroeconomic policies, the
inflation criterion has been met since last November. The Bank of Slovenia forecasts the
average inflation rate to be 2.2 percent for 2006 and 2007, and 2.6 percent for 2008.
Challenges going forward
Keeping the macroeconomic environment supportive of sustained growth will require
vigilance on several fronts:
* Maintaining long-term sustainability of the general government budget and its
compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), as well as providing an adequate
safety reserve in the public finances.

3
With regard to demographic changes and the ageing population, further reform measures will
be necessary, especially in the pension and the health systems, as well as other policies. The
Framework for Economic and Social Reforms provides for some preventive measures. These
include in the public pension system, raising the participation of the elderly in the work force
so as to increase the retirement age. In the private pension system, it is intended to provide
incentives to enhance the coverage of voluntary funded pension schemes and to increase the
contribution of individuals to these schemes. It will also be essential to increase public
awareness of the implications of the demographic shift.
* Containing the wage growth. The social agreement for the period 2006 – 2009 is still
being negotiated. Its overall objective is to prevent an increase in wages not justified by a
corresponding rise in productivity in either the private or the public sector. The plan is to
keep – for the time being – the average wage growth lagging behind productivity growth.
* Keeping inflation in check. Some inflationary pressures may continue in the short run, but
in the long run there are no major risks to price stability, assuming the continuation of a
moderate growth in labor costs and relatively balanced growth in aggregate supply and
demand. The low level of core inflation and the expected absence of higher energy prices
feeding through into other prices are the two most important arguments supporting this
position.
The pressure, brought by rounding following the euro adoption, is expected to be limited and
temporary as it would be forestalled by the mandatory informative dual pricing effective
from March 1, 2006 until six months after the euro adoption. However, there is the risk
associated with the possible Value Added Tax (VAT) increase, the rise in excise duties and
the relaxation in administered price policy, in particular in the energy sector. There is also the
risk associated with higher oil prices. At the same time, the key tools already tested in the
disinflation process, such as the government-backed plan on regulated prices for the period
2006 – 2007, will continue to be in place also after the euro adoption.
* Managing financial sector risks. The process of financial integration with the European
Union (EU) has increased both the dependence on financial conditions abroad and the
competition among banks. In 2005, interest rate risk increased, and credit risk diminished.
Euro adoption will significantly reduce the exchange rate risk. Managing risks, the interest
risks in particular, will become very important in the increasingly uncertain international
environment. The Bank of Slovenia is considering stepping up its banking supervision
activities and engaging in a constructive dialogue with the banks in order to improve risk
management further.
* Supporting structural reform. The government-backed reform package proposes
measures aimed at increasing the flexibility of the economy. These will comprise
deregulation of product markets and promotion of competition. Also, steps to secure greater

4
labor market flexibility are on the agenda. These include greater regional, professional and
educational mobility, greater flexibility of employment protection, and more flexible forms
of employment. All these measures could contribute to greater macroeconomic stability and
higher economic growth.
Conclusion
The fulfillment of the Maastricht convergence criteria, the favorable forecasts and the
positive expectations of European institutions indicate that Slovenia is ready to adopt the
euro. This step will mark the de jure conclusion of the task of integration that started with the
European Agreement in June 1996. The Slovenian authorities are aware that in de facto
terms, this task is not yet over and depends on the successful implementation of the reform
agenda.
