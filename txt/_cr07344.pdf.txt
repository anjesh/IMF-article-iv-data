Yoon, and other senior officials, academics, and private sector representatives.

•

Context of past surveillance. In recent years, the Fund and the authorities have agreed on
the broad policy priorities. Directors have emphasized that Korea needed to address
challenges to growth, notably by reviving the small-and medium-sized enterprise sector,
modernizing the labor market and developing the financial sector.

•

Statistical Base. Adequate to conduct effective surveillance, but fiscal reporting needs to
be improved. Korea subscribes to the SDDS.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Outlook
•

Korea’s growth performance remains solid and inflation pressures are contained.
After reaching 5 percent last year, real GDP growth of 4¾ percent is expected this year
and 5 percent next year. Export performance continues to be strong while domestic
demand has been resilient. Risks are mostly to the downside. Inflation has remained
persistently below the BOK target range of 2½–3½ percent, although the recent spike in
oil prices could push headline inflation temporarily to the mid-range of the target.

•

The current account is expected to be broadly in balance this year and next, while
net capital flows should moderate. Momentum in exports should continue and offset an
increased oil import bill, but the service account is expected to widen as Koreans
increasingly travel abroad. The recent surge in gross capital inflows is expected to
decelerate, as hedging by shipbuilders starts to plateau. Outflows are also increasing
rapidly, driven by tax incentives and a desire for portfolio diversification.

•

The exchange rate appears appropriately valued. The won has appreciated against all
major currencies and especially the yen since 2003, but there are no clear signs of
misalignment.

Key issues and policy discussions
•

With inflation pressures largely absent, staff sees room for more accommodative
monetary policy should growth slow. The BOK is more cautious and has resumed its
tightening, given concerns over the growth of monetary aggregates and asset prices.

•

Financial risks are manageable. A decline in housing prices would not impact the
financial system as LTV ratios and NPLs are low, but consumption could suffer given the
importance of short-maturity bullet loans. Accelerating ongoing development of the
mortgage market would help reduce this risk. SME lending has risen rapidly, but banks
have improved their risk management practices.

•

Long-term challenges are more difficult. Population aging is expected to generate
enormous fiscal pressures and a range of measures will be needed. The authorities are
well aware of the challenges, but public dialog is at an early stage. Long-term growth
prospects need also to be improved. With its labor force declining, its low-skilled
manufacturing base eroding and service sector productivity low, Korea may see its
potential growth decline. Policies to ensure that manufacturing continues to move up the
value chain and to raise service sector productivity are needed.

4
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
In the decade since the Asian crisis, Korea has staged an impressive economic
recovery. Since 1998, growth has averaged nearly 6 percent per year, led by strong exports,
and average per capita income has increased to more than $18,000. Korean firms have
adapted successfully to a rapidly changing global economy, with a number of companies
emerging as leaders in their industries. And, as the health of the corporate and financial
sectors has improved dramatically and sizable international reserves have been accumulated,
Korea’s vulnerabilities have declined to low levels.
2.
However, as old challenges have been overcome, new ones have emerged. In the
near term, a benign economic outlook remains vulnerable to global developments, while
several risks to the domestic financial sector have arisen. These challenges appear
manageable, but over the longer term, Korea will confront more difficult issues that could
affect growth and, if not addressed, ultimately threaten its external stability. Notably, a
rapidly aging population will likely generate large fiscal pressures and contribute to a
declining labor force. The latter, combined with the ongoing erosion of Korea’s low-skilled
manufacturing base and stagnant service sector productivity, threatens to limit Korea’s longterm growth. Despite the longer-term nature of these problems, early action is needed to
reduce adjustment costs and ensure Korea’s continued economic success.

Korea’s growth remains
healthy. In 2006, real GDP growth
reached 5 percent, the highest in four
years, led by strong exports, which rose
by nearly 15 percent in the face of a
strong appreciation of the won. Activity
moderated in late 2006, but a pickup is
expected over the remainder of 2007,
bringing growth to 4¾ percent for the
year. Exports are projected to remain
strong as vessels exports surge and the IT
sector recovers in the second half of this
year. At the same time, domestic demand
is showing resilience. Facility investment
is expected to rise this year, but a
significant recovery in construction
activity is not in the cards given the
subdued housing market. Consumption is
expected to be supported by a solid labor

5
market and equity prices, but to remain constrained by modest real income gains, high
household debt and a weak housing market. For 2008, a broad continuation of these trends
should allow Korea to grow by about 5 percent.

Price pressures remain well
contained. Headline consumer price
inflation remains at the lower edge of the
BOK target range of 2½–3½ percent.
Inflation is projected to rise temporarily
to around 3 percent by the end of 2007 as
oil prices edge higher, but core inflation
is expected to remain low as wage
pressures are mild and capacity
utilization, while rising, remains
moderate.

5.
The external current account surplus is projected to remain in broad balance,
while the recent surge in capital inflows should ebb. The continued strong export
performance should be offset by higher oil prices. The services account is expected to
continue to widen as Koreans increasingly travel abroad, including for education. Short-term
external borrowing has surged by $60 billion since the beginning of 2006 as exporters of
ships and heavy manufacturing have increased their hedging of future receipts and more
recently as arbitrage opportunities have arisen (Box 1). For the remainder of the
year and next year, inflows are projected to moderate as shipbuilders’ new hedging slows and
recent curbs on short-term borrowing by foreign bank branches reduce, at least temporarily,
the ability to benefit from arbitrage opportunities. At the same time, gross outflows are
expected to increase significantly, owing to a desire for portfolio diversification and recent
changes in the tax treatment of capital gains from abroad.

Box 1. Korea’s Recent Experience with Capital Inflows
Hedging activity by shipbuilders has contributed significantly to the recent surge in capital inflows. Korea’s
shipbuilding industry has become a major source of exports and the outlook is very favorable. With Korea home to
seven of the world’s ten largest shipbuilding companies, it is
benefiting greatly from a surge in global trade, oil prices and

In addition, banks have been actively engaged in covered
interest parity (CIP) arbitrage activities.1 Given the
persistent deviation in CIP, local branches of foreign banks in
Korea have borrowed dollars short-term, sold these dollars for
won on the spot market, then bought CDs or other domestic
bonds, and sold forward the won for dollars generating riskless
profits. This has contributed to the rapid increase in short-term
external debt and to the fivefold increase to 16 trillion won
(about $17 billion) in 2006 in net buying of Treasury bonds and
Monetary Stabilization Bonds by local branches of foreign
banks. To stem the rapid increase in short-term external debt,
beginning in early 2007, the authorities first used moral suasion
which had the effect of raising the CIP deviation. More
recently, they have announced several measures, including the
reduction of the nontaxable amount that foreign bank branches
can borrow from their parent companies abroad starting
January 2008. This announcement appears to have further
fueled the deviation.

According to Covered Interest Parity (CIP), the interest rate difference between two countries should equal the difference between
the forward and the spot exchange rate between the two currencies.

The won has continued to appreciate, but more slowly in 2006–07. Overall
appreciation since October 2004 has reached around 20 percent in real effective terms,
among the highest in emerging Asia. Since the beginning of 2006, the won has strengthened
by 4 percent in real effective terms. To smooth volatility in the foreign exchange market and
prevent a too rapid appreciation of the won, the authorities have intervened at times. Since
the start of 2006, estimated interventions have been modest, averaging around $1 billion per
month or about ¾ percent of turnover in the onshore spot foreign exchange market.

fiscal deficit (excluding social security
funds) in 2006, 1¼ percent of GDP, was ¼ percentage point higher than in 2005. This year’s
budget targets a deficit of 1½ percent of GDP, with a 1 percentage point of GDP revenue
increase, reflecting in part housing tax hikes, offset by increased spending on the social
safety net, education, and research and development. Given the late 2006 economic
slowdown, expenditure was front-loaded to the first half of the year. However, a modest
overperformance for the year as a whole can again be expected, in line with established
practice of spending less than budgeted. A similarly neutral stance is envisaged for 2008,
with continued re-allocation of expenditure towards social spending.

financial turbulence could generate a
reverse of recent inflows to Korea and dampen investor and consumer confidence. Finally, a
sharper or more prolonged slowdown in the United States could have a significant impact on
Korea’s exports.
9.
The political environment is complex but is not expected to create major
uncertainties. A presidential election will take place in December 2007 and parliamentary
elections are scheduled for April 2008. While the ruling party has lost its majority in
parliament, two key pieces of legislation—the Capital Market Consolidation Act and the
pension reform—have recently been adopted and the broad direction of economic policy is
unlikely to change following the elections. Tensions have also eased on the North Korea
nuclear issue and in part as a result, Moody’s has recently upgraded Korea’s sovereign debt
rating to A2.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Near-term risks to the Korean economy are manageable and discussions focused on how to
maintain smooth sailing. The mission identified several vulnerabilities to the financial sector,
but risks are limited and being addressed. Long-term challenges are more daunting: the
rapid aging of the Korean population could threaten Korea’s fiscal and external
sustainability while the erosion of its low-skilled manufacturing base and low service sector
productivity could affect its competitiveness and growth prospects.
A. Smoothly Navigating the Near Term
10.
While monetary tightening has resumed, staff argued that there is scope for a
more accommodative policy should growth slow. Monetary conditions are now fairly tight,
with real interest rates near a post-crisis high and the won strong.1 Inflation is likely to
remain at or below the mid-point of the target band and consumption growth remains
moderate and is subject to downside risks. Should these risks emerge, an easing could be

appropriate. Moreover, staff argued that monetary policy should be focused on the inflation
targeting framework. Credit growth may have picked up since early 2005, prompting some
concerns among policymakers, but this has been from very low levels, and the pace remains
moderate. Concerns about specific types of credit growth, such as credit to SMEs are best
dealt with via prudential oversight. Equity prices have also risen rapidly this year, but
valuations do not appear stretched by historical or regional standards.2 Finally if short-term
capital inflows surge again, a reduction in the policy interest rate could, should inflation
pressures remain low, be appropriate.

The authorities, however, did not see much room for lower rates. The BOK
agreed that there were only modest inflationary pressures. However, they remained biased
toward tightening, arguing that credit growth and rapidly rising asset prices could, if left
unchecked, eventually feed into higher inflation, asset bubbles and an increase in
nonperforming loans. Moreover the BOK noted that past tightening only had limited success
in slowing liquidity growth as, because of sizable arbitrage activities, long-term yields had
not followed the rise in the overnight call rate. In contrast, the BOK argued that the increase
in reserve requirements on won deposits had more impact. Staff and the authorities agreed

that development of the money market would help strengthen the monetary transmission
mechanism and limit future recourse to reserve requirements. In this context, subsequent to
the mission, the BOK announced that it

12.
There is limited scope for a more accommodative fiscal policy in the near term.
The current broadly neutral stance is about right under current circumstances. Should the
economy experience a downturn, the mission recommended that automatic stabilizers be
allowed to operate fully but argued that given Korea’s large medium-term fiscal challenges
the scope for more stimulative fiscal policy was limited. The authorities agreed and also
noted that institutional constraints limited their ability to use countercyclical policy.3
13.
Exchange rate flexibility has served Korea well, and intervention in the foreign
exchange market should be limited to smoothing volatility. Strong export performance
and healthy profits across a range of industries suggest that Korea’s external competitiveness
remains solid overall. At the same time, various estimates point to a broadly appropriate
valuation of the Korean won (Box 2). The authorities reiterated that they are not seeking to
determine the exchange rate, but expressed concerns that the sizable appreciation of the won,
in particular against the yen, has affected profitability in some sectors. If faced with
temporary exchange rate pressure, the mission noted that smoothing operations could—with
due concern for the associated costs—be appropriate. The authorities agreed and added that
recent steps to liberalize and encourage capital outflows had also helped limit pressure on the
won, while allowing Korean residents to diversify their wealth.
14.
The rising deviation from covered interest parity (CIP) may be pointing to a
policy dilemma. Concerned with the rapid increase in short-term external debt, and the
associated pressure on the won, the authorities have taken several measures. Subsequent to
the mission and after issuing initial warnings to foreign bank branches in March, the
authorities have decided to lower the nontaxable amount that foreign bank branches can
borrow from their parent companies from 6 times capital to 3 (“thin capitalization rule”),

Box 2. Assessment of Korea’s Competitiveness1

Nevertheless, the strengthening of the won, in
particular vis-à-vis the Japanese yen, is hurting
Korea’s competitiveness in some sectors. The won
has appreciated by 60 percent against the yen in real
terms since end-2003. As Japan is Korea’s main
competitor in major export industries, including
electronics and automobiles, the won appreciation
against the yen is squeezing profit margins of some
Korean companies, notably automakers who have
recorded a fall in profit margin from 7 to 4½ percent
since 2003.
The strong won appreciation is also having an
impact on SMEs. Profits at many large companies have
remained at healthy, albeit reduced levels, as foreign
exchange hedging and the shift of operations overseas
as well as other cost-cutting measures have helped them
mitigate the impact of the appreciation. However,
producers of low value-added goods as well as some
SMEs are coping with difficulty, partly due to increased
competitive pressures from China and other low-cost
countries and slow progress on some structural reforms.

starting January 2008 and to limit the use of foreign exchange loans by banks to real demand
(financing imports and real investment), beginning August 2007. By signaling the intent to
prevent further arbitrage activities, these measures may have triggered a further widening of
the deviation. This reflects rising tensions between the objective of preventing a too rapid
appreciation of the exchange rate and that of tightening monetary policy. Staff had noted that
given the relatively benign nature of the short-term foreign borrowing—largely borrowing of
foreign bank branches from parent companies—there were only limited concerns that these
would increase Korea’s vulnerabilities. Moreover, the recently announced measures are not
consistent with the authorities’ stated objective of complete capital account liberalization.

A decline in housing prices
would not affect significantly the
financial sector, but could dampen
consumption. Real housing prices rose by
11 percent nationwide last year. Concerns
about the run-up in house prices led to a
wide range of steps to cool the housing
market, including tax measures, selected
price controls, and tighter loan-to-value
(LTV) and debt-to-income (DTI) ratios for
mortgages. These actions led to a sharp
slowdown in house price inflation and a
fall-off in mortgage lending—through May,
mortgage lending by banks was flat for the
year—and a further downturn in prices
cannot be ruled out. Staff noted that

The Korean financial sector is in
good health overall, but there are pockets
of concern. Asset quality, profitability, and
capital adequacy have all increased and risk
assessment practices as well as credit
information have improved in recent years.

with shocks although there are risks that

prices could complicate the ability of households that still have short-term bullet type
mortgages to roll over their debt. Against the background of high household debt, this could
affect consumption. 4 These risks are declining as households have increasingly replaced
short-term bullet loans with longer-term amortizing mortgages, although some households
may face difficulties meeting higher monthly payments when grace periods expire. Over the
medium term, remaining risks from the mortgage market can be addressed by further
financial sector development (Box 3).

Box 3. Mortgage Market Development1
Mortgage structures are changing. Loan maturities have lengthened in response to government
encouragement and tax incentives. Between 2004 and 2006, the share of outstanding mortgages of maturity
3 years or less fell from 60 to 30 percent, while the share of those over 10 years rose from 21 to 51 percent.
Over the same period, the share of amortizing

would need to go hand in hand with strengthened
supervision to ensure that both mortgage
originators and regulated MBS buyers adhere to good standards of risk assessment. In 2004, the Korea Housing
Finance Corporation (KHFC) was set up to promote these ends but the response has been slow. Fixed-rate
mortgages are less than 10 percent of the total and outstanding MBS in Korea are only about 1½ percent of the
total debt market. Financial conditions going forward may better support development: the spread between fixed
and variable-rate loans has narrowed and the rising bank loan-to-deposit ratio indicates tighter funding
conditions that could make securitization more attractive.
A number of steps can be taken to mitigate risks and develop the mortgage market. Prudential regulations
can be harmonized across lenders and geographic areas so as to promote the standardization of mortgage
products and facilitate securitization. Fixed-rate loans can be promoted by developing a long-term bond
benchmark and OTC derivatives hedges. Finally, the KHFC can broaden its support for securitization by
offering credit enhancement for private sector MBS and securitizing capped adjustable-rate mortgages.

risk that looser credit standards could
lead to a rise in NPLs, especially should the economy slow.5 The financial supervisor shared
this view and noted its intention to strengthen monitoring of SME lending including through
on-site examinations. At the same time, the BOK decided to reduce its below-market rate
funding for bank lending to SMEs.
19.
Staff suggested that the most effective way to address these still-modest
concerns is to continue to upgrade the risk assessment models of banks and harmonize
prudential standards with the nonbanks. This would be consistent with the planned move
from rules-based to risk-based supervision under Basel II. The recent tightening of prudential
standards on mortgage lending appears to have contributed to a stabilization of housing
prices, but may also be spurring lending by nonbanks as well as potentially more risky SME
loans. Staff pointed to the need to broaden the coverage of prudential regulations to nonbanks,
on an equal footing with banks where feasible. The authorities were in broad agreement and,
subsequent to the mission, the financial regulator announced its intention to bring nonbanks’

B. Addressing Longer-Term Challenges
20.
Korea’s medium-term prospects are generally favorable and vulnerabilities are
low, but the country faces difficult long-run challenges. With a fertility rate of just over
1—among the lowest in the world—and a rising life expectancy, the old age dependency
ratio is expected to increase from 15 percent to 65 percent by 2050. These changes will
generate significant public expenditure pressures and, with the labor force set to decline
starting in about 10 years, will complicate efforts to maintain strong economic growth.
Growth prospects are also threatened by competition in manufacturing from lower wage
countries and weak productivity in services. Responding early on will help promote a smooth
adjustment to these challenges, thereby ensuring Korea’s continued external stability.
21.
Reflecting these developments, potential growth is projected, in the absence of
reforms, to decline rapidly. In the medium term, staff anticipates growth to remain at
around 4½ percent, with a current account broadly in balance. However, potential growth is
expected to decline to 2½ percent

(Box 4 and Table 7). In addition, the
desire to strengthen Korea’s social safety net and the highly uncertain but potentially large
costs associated with possible reunification with North Korea underline the need to address
age-related spending pressures early.

23.
Addressing these emerging fiscal pressures will require action on a range of
fronts. Staff emphasized that the full range of fiscal tools, including tax policy and
administration and expenditure reform, will likely be required to address these risks.
Ultimately, the weights placed on each of these instruments would need to reflect not only
economic considerations but also social and political requirements.
24.
Staff argued that there is considerable scope to raise revenues over the medium
term. At 25 percent, Korea’s revenue-to-GDP ratio is modest by OECD standards, and
considerable gains could be achieved by base broadening and improved tax administration.
These gains should be fully exploited before considering raising tax rates. In particular,

policy options was a key input into the discussions.

Box 4. Debt Sustainability in Korea
At just over 33 percent of GDP, Korea’s public debt ratio is relatively low by OECD standards, where the average is around
55 percent. Over the next 15 years, while Korea’s relatively new pension system continues to accumulate assets and the old-age
dependency ratio remains low, the gross debt ratio will, even in the absence of adjustment, stay below 50 percent of GDP. However over the
long term, as Korea experiences rapid population aging, fiscal pressures related to pensions, health and long-term care will mount. As a
result, starting around 2025, both the fiscal deficit and gross public debt as well as the external current account deficit would—absent any
adjustment—enter an unsustainable upward trend.
350
350
Public Debt Scenarios
(in percent of GDP)

The authorities view staff’s baseline as overstating the long-term
debt level because public health insurance contributions should, by
law, cover 80 percent of health care costs. Based on the assumption
that the required increase in contributions takes place, public debt
remains lower, at around 80 percent of GDP in 2050, than the more
than 200 percent under staff’s baseline. Staff recognizes that this
mechanism may reduce debt, but views the increases in contributions as
a necessary fiscal measure, because they still require discretionary
action. Moreover, contributions would need to almost triple over the
period, which could prove difficult to sustain.

300

While raising Korea’s potential growth would help alleviate some of
these pressures, it will not on its own be enough to achieve longterm debt sustainability. An increase in growth to around
3 percent would reduce debt by around 20 percent of GDP
in 2050, but the debt path would still be unsustainable.1

Sources: Data provided by the authorities; and IMF staff projections.

Further parametric reforms are needed to put the pension
system on a sustainable footing. In response to aging pressures,
the pension benefit replacement rate has recently been reduced
from 60 to 40 percent of wages, to be phased in from 2008
to 2028. While the reform will push the depletion of the pensions
system’s assets forward by about fifteen years, it will have limited
impact on the long-term debt profile since it does not put the
system on a sustainable footing. To do so, options include a
higher contribution rate or a faster-than-planned increase in the
retirement age.

next review of the pension system,
planned for 2008, would focus attention on these issues. Staff supported plans to strengthen
the social safety net, including the introduction of a basic old-age pension in 2008 and an
earned income tax credit from 2009. Korea’s social spending is low relative to OECD
averages. Moreover, if designed properly, a strengthened safety net could have important
benefits, not only in protecting the poor, but also by allowing an easing of labor mobility and
raising the role of automatic stabilizers in macroeconomic management. However, staff
stressed that any expansion of social spending should be accompanied by a rise in spending
effectiveness and a correspondingly larger rebalancing away from other expenditures,
including public investment and economic services.8 In this context, the authorities aim to
slow non-age-related public spending growth over the medium term and are exploring the
possibility of greater private sector involvement in investment projects.

26.
Staff stressed that acting sooner would reduce significantly the economic costs
of adjustment. Delaying necessary measures would mean that significantly larger tax hikes
or deeper cuts in non-age-related spending would ultimately be required to stabilize debt,
with more serious implications for long-term growth.9 The authorities broadly agreed, while
stressing that public dialogue needs to be intensified to achieve a broad consensus on these
issues. While the government’s Vision 2030 report was an initial attempt to inform the public
of future fiscal pressures, staff suggested that the government consider publishing a regular
long-term fiscal report (as in several OECD countries) to help define the scope of the
problem more precisely and develop and evaluate policy options. The authorities agreed in

According to the OECD, Korea allocates a high share of total public spending (for general government) to
investment (around 8 percent of GDP compared to the OECD average of about 3 percent) and economic affairs
(5½ percent of GDP compared to the OECD average of under 4 percent).

9

Staff analysis suggests that if the effective tax rate is allowed to increase continuously from 2021 until 2035,
the effective PIT rate hike needed for fiscal sustainability could be limited to 7½ percentage points, compared to
9 percentage points if reform is delayed and prolonged from 2025 until 2045. Moreover, at 70 percent of GDP,
the long-run debt level would be twice as high in the delayed reform scenario.

Korea has thrived in the
globalized economy, but now finds its
manufacturing base, in particular at the
low-skilled end, being threatened. In
recent years, Korea’s export performance
has been impressive, with large
manufacturers specializing in high valueadded products and experiencing strong
productivity growth driven by
technological innovation. Producers of

To maintain adequate
competitiveness, policies should aim at
ensuring that manufacturing continues

The Korean authorities are looking to free trade agreements to help them
achieve these goals. The recently concluded Korea–U.S. FTA will, if passed by respective
legislatures, expand access of Korean manufacturers to the U.S. market, with 94 percent of
merchandise trade becoming tariff-free within three years. The direct impact on services
productivity will likely be modest, given the limited scope of the FTA on the services side,
but the agreement could have a significant indirect effect if it attracts additional FDI and
jump-starts structural reforms. The authorities appear intent on completing additional FTAs,
including with the EU, but remain committed to multilateral liberalization.

To boost productivity growth in Korea, the OECD also recommends policies to upgrade the R&D framework,

considerable progress has been made on the former in the past year, and staff welcomed the recent
approval by parliament of the Capital Market Consolidation Act. 11 The passage of the law, which
eases barriers between financial activities, is expected to generate consolidation of the securities
industry, and lead to the emergence of strong investment banks.

Box 5. Past Recommendations and Progress in Structural Areas
SMEs:
Fund recommendations: encourage growth of promising SMEs by scaling back public credit
guarantees and deregulating commercial credit insurance; reforming collateral laws to allow for
a wider range of securitization; improving the flow of information to credit bureaus; and
reforming the corporate and personal bankruptcy system.
Policy developments: public credit guarantees have been reduced as a share of GDP but remain
sizable. There are plans to open up the credit insurance market to private financial companies
and to give credit bureaus access to SME credit information collected by public agencies.
Collateral laws are being reviewed.
Service sector:
Fund recommendations: raise productivity by opening up and deregulating services, notably in
health and education, including through trade liberalization.
Policy developments: focus has been on sector-specific plans and special economic zones rather
than more comprehensive reforms. A recently signed FTA between Korea and the United States
would open some services to competition but does not cover the health and education sectors.
Labor market:
Fund recommendations: increase labor market flexibility by reducing employment protection of
regular workers and expanding and strengthening the social safety net.
Policy developments: a new labor law, aimed at converting nonregular workers to regular status,
has been implemented. This law will help reduce the duality in the labor market, but this process
should go hand in hand with increased labor flexibility for regular workers.

Staff and the authorities agreed that subsequent changes may be needed following the
passage of the Capital Market Consolidation Act. With investment banks expected to capture a
growing share of financial intermediation, staff noted that banks may face increasing competitive
pressure. In fact, banks have already felt increasing pressure on their deposit base from the growing
popularity of Cash Management Accounts (CMA) offered by securities firms. The authorities noted
the need for banks to raise non-interest income 200

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
Korea’s economic prospects continue to be favorable. Korea has achieved an impressive
recovery since the Asian crisis with growth averaging 6 percent per year. This performance reflects
its increased integration with the global economy and substantial economic restructuring. For 200708, the outlook remains positive: growth is expected to be in line with potential, with inflation
contained. The current account should remain in balance, and net capital inflows should slow
following the recent surge.
33.
With inflation pressures contained, the BOK could loosen monetary policy if growth
disappoints. More generally, monetary policy should be framed against the inflation targeting
framework, and asset prices and credit growth considerations, while important, should not be
overriding. To reflect the recent experience with monetary aggregates and the inflation performance,
some consideration could also be given to revising downward the inflation target range.
34.
Korea’s exchange rate appears appropriately valued. The won has appreciated rapidly
over the past few years against all major currencies, but various indicators of exchange rate valuation
do not point to any misalignment and the overall export performance has remained strong.
Intervention in the foreign exchange market should be limited to smoothing volatility.

12

Banks currently have access to capital markets through their related financial holding companies.

23
35.
Some pockets of financial risks have emerged, but they are manageable. A decline in
housing prices, while not a threat to banks, could affect consumption. Despite the recent
improvement in bank’s risk management practices, the recent rapid growth in SME lending could
lead to a rise in NPLs, especially should the economy slow. Dealing with those risks would require
the continuation of upgrading the risk assessment models of banks consistent with the introduction of
Basel II.
36.
Over the longer term, Korea will be faced with a very rapid aging of the population
generating enormous fiscal pressures. Addressing these pressures will require action on a range of
fronts, including raising tax revenues through base broadening and improved tax administration.
Expenditure reforms will also be needed, notably through pension reform, and a reorientation of
spending away from public investment into the social safety net. Of course, the pressure could be
eased should potential output growth be faster than anticipated.
37.
Another long-term challenge will be to sustain Korea’s competitiveness. Doing so would
require policies to create a more conducive investment climate, including for FDI, opening and
deregulating the services sector and enhancing labor market flexibility.
38.
Further financial sector development, including that of capital markets would also be
needed. In this respect, the adoption by Parliament of the Capital Market Consolidation Act is a
major step forward. This law is expected to contribute significantly to the emergence of strong
investment banks and to the development of capital markets. Subsequent changes may be needed,
notably to ease further barriers between bank and capital market activities, and in adapting financial
sector oversight to the new environment.
39.
Developing the financial sector would also help addressing risks from the mortgage
market. Emphasis should be on further developing the government bond market and hedging
instruments to accelerate the spread of conventional mortgages. Steps should also be taken to
encourage the expansion of the market for securitized mortgages.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

Korea’s exchange rate system is classified as “independently floating.” Previously, the exchange
rate against the U.S. dollar was allowed to float only within specified margins around the previous
day’s weighted average exchange rate in the interbank market. The margins were widened five
times between March 1990 and November 1997 (most recently to +/-10 percent), and on
December 16, 1997 were eliminated altogether. On August 14, 2007, the exchange rate was
W 932=US$1. Korea maintains exchange restrictions for security reasons, in accordance with UN
Security Council Resolutions, which have been notified to the Fund under the procedures set forth
in Executive Board Decision 144-(52/51).
VIII.

Last Article IV Consultation:

Korea is on a 12-month consultation cycle. Staff discussions for the 2006 Article IV consultation
were conducted on a mission to Seoul during May 25-June 8, 2006. The Article IV consultation was
concluded by the Executive Board on September 29, 2006. In addition, a staff visit took place
during November 2–10, 2006.

3
IX.

FSAP and ROSC Participation:

MCM: The final FSAP mission was conducted during October 2002. The mission
completed the FSAP by assessing the short-term vulnerability of the financial sector to
macroeconomic and sectoral shocks and analyzing overall financial sector soundness and
developmental challenges, including issues arising from the draft standards assessments. A followup technical assistance mission on the supervision of derivatives markets was held in Seoul during
January 9–20, 2003. The Financial System Stability Assessment report has been published (country
report No. 03/81) and is available on the web through the following link:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/fsap/fsap.asp
FAD: Discussions on fiscal transparency were held in Seoul during June 2000, and a report
was drafted and finalized in November 2000, with input from APD staff. The report has been
published and is available on the web through the following link:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/rosc/kor/fiscal.htm
STA: Discussions on Korea’s data dissemination practices against the IMF’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) were held in Seoul during April 2001, and a report was drafted and
finalized on November 28, 2001. The report has been published and is available on the web through
the link: http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2003/cr03127.pdf
X.

Technical Assistance:

FAD: A technical assistance mission visited Seoul during January 8–19, 2001 to evaluate
current practices in budgeting and public expenditure management and to provide advice on setting
up a medium-term fiscal framework. A mission visited Seoul during August 31–
September 16, 2005 to provide technical assistance on the reform of tax policy and administration.
MCM: A mission conducted a high-level technical seminar during May 16–22, 2000 on the
development of the foreign exchange market. The seminar covered issues in supervision, market
monitoring, derivatives instruments, and market microstructure. Technical assistance missions
visited Seoul to provide advice on macroprudential and derivatives supervision during October 27–
November 7, 2005, on the reform and development of the foreign exchange market during
March 30–April 13, 2006, and on strengthening the debt management function and further
development of the government securities market during September 20–October 2, 2006.
STA: A technical assistance mission visited Seoul during March 29–April 12, 2000 to
provide advice on balance of payments and external debt statistics, with a view toward improving
the recording of financial derivatives and developing an international investment position statement.
XI.

Resident Representative:

The resident representative office in Seoul was opened in March 1998. Ms. Meral Karasulu
has been the Resident Representative since September 2006.

4
Appendix II: Korea—Statistical Issues
The statistical base is adequate to conduct effective surveillance. Korea has been a subscriber to the
Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since September 1996. During 2006 there were
occasional dissemination delays for some data categories, particularly for central government
operations.
Real Sector
The overall structure of the national accounts follows the 1993 System of National Accounts; the
transition from the 1968 SNA was completed in March 2004. Constant (base year 2000) and current
price estimates of GDP are produced using the production and expenditure approaches, and current
price accounts using the income approach. While the size of the informal sector has not been
measured, informal activities (including some illicit activities) are expected to be reflected in the
next revision of the national accounts. The commodity flow technique could be improved by
moving to the Supply and Use Table framework, but there have been difficulties in obtaining
required basic data.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) covers 38 urban areas (about 80 per cent of the urban
population) and is defined to exclude farm and fishing households. The CPI could be further
improved by extending its coverage to rural areas. The basket is updated every five years and its
weights are derived from the 2005 Family Income and Expenditure Survey. The geometric mean of
price changes would be a suitable alternative to the ratio of arithmetic means of prices.
The scope of the Producer Price Index (PPI) covers all domestic industrial activities and a large
segment of service activity, as well as free trade zones and bonded warehouses. The weights are
based on 2000 revenue shares. The PPI could be improved by imputing missing prices using the
prices of similar commodities, rather than carrying forward the last reported price. A geometric
mean of price relatives should be used rather than an arithmetic mean.
Fiscal Sector
Two sets of government finance statistics (GFS) are compiled for the central government, using
national definitions and using internationally recognized standards. Concepts and definitions used in
the latter generally follow the recommendations of the Manual on Government Finance
Statistics 1986 (GFSM 1986). The data cover the budgetary units of the central government
(including social security funds owned and/or managed by the government) and the extra-budgetary
funds owned or managed by these units. These statistics are produced from the National Financial
Information System (NAFIS), which integrates the preparation of budget data, accounting reports,
and the generation of fiscal statistics on a monthly basis. The NAFIS provides for automatic
crosschecks at different levels of the compilation process.
Consolidated data on the general government consistent with international standards are not
compiled, with the central government accounting for about 75 percent of general government
operations. The last year for which GFS were reported for publication in the GFS Yearbook
was 2005.

5
Monetary Sector
Following the recommendations of the 2001 data ROSC mission, revised monetary aggregates have
been compiled since early 2002. These aggregates almost fully comply with the Monetary and
Financial Statistical Manual (MFSM 2000). Data relating to foreign assets and foreign liabilities are
affected by the BOK’s practices of valuing its financial assets and financial liabilities at book value
(rather than at market value) and revaluing its foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities
twice yearly (rather than on a monthly basis). Also, some banks are using nationality rather than
residency to distinguish between resident and nonresident individual and household accounts,
affecting the accurate measurement of net foreign assets of the banking sector. The authorities have
begun reporting monetary data to STA using the new Standardized Reporting Forms, but the data
show discrepancies from those reported using the old forms. The authorities have been informed of
the problem, and resolution is pending.
External Sector
The overall quality of the monthly balance of payments data is good. The BOK implemented the
fifth edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5) in early 1998, but some deviations
remain in the classification and sectorization of certain transactions. Following liberalization, the
coverage of the balance of payments statistics has become less comprehensive, as residents were
permitted to conduct transactions via accounts with banks abroad. There is also incomplete
coverage of transactions via intercompany accounts, and non-cash transactions. The BOK has
developed an array of statistical techniques and collection systems to improve the coverage,
classification, and timeliness of source data, especially in services transactions.
The quality of quarterly external debt statistics has greatly improved since the financial crisis.
Since September 2003, the statistics have been compiled on a residency basis according to the Debt
Guide (IMF). In early 2007, the BOK switched from annual to quarterly reporting of the
International Investment Position (IIP), with quarterly data reported for 2001–06.
Data dissemination on international reserves and foreign currency liquidity generally meets the
SDDS specifications for periodicity, timeliness, and advance release calendar. In late April 2006,
the authorities decided to disseminate foreign reserves on a monthly basis rather than twice a
month, as had been done since 1997.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
REPUBLIC OF KOREA
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the Asia and Pacific Department
September 7, 2007

1.
This supplement to the staff report summarizes the main developments since the staff
report was issued on August 15, 2007. The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged.
2.
The Bank of Korea (BOK) tightened further monetary policy in August. For the
second consecutive month, the BOK raised its policy rate by 25 bps, to 5.0 percent, citing
continued concern with rapid money and credit growth, but signaled that interest rates were
now near neutral levels. At its monthly monetary policy meeting on September 7, the BOK
left rates unchanged.
3.
The impact of the ongoing global credit market crisis in Korea has been manageable,
notwithstanding a significant increase in volatility:
•

Korean financial institutions appear to have limited exposure to the U.S. subprime
market. Current estimates are that direct exposure by banks amounts to less than
0.1 percent of total banking assets, with some additional small exposure for insurance
and asset management companies.

•

The won has weakened modestly over the period since July 20, falling by 2½ percent
against the dollar and just over 3 percent in nominal effective terms. There has been
no indication of official foreign exchange intervention.

•

After an initial sharp drop, the Korean stock market has rebounded, broadly in line
with other emerging markets. The KOSPI is down 5 percent since July 20, but has
increased 15 percent since August 17. The market remains up more than 31 percent
up since the start of the year. However, foreign investors have continued their selloff, with net selling by foreign investors reaching $9½ billion in August, compared
with $5 billion for July.

•

Domestic corporate spreads remain broadly unchanged but accessing overseas
funding has become more difficult and several large firms have indicated their

2
intention to freeze overseas bond issuance. Net external borrowing by foreign bank
branches from home offices also are reported to have slowed in July, but this appears
to be more a reflection of window guidance by the financial regulator and the recently
introduced thin capitalization rules than market turbulence.
•

The authorities have taken several steps in response to the increased volatility.
Immediately following the onset of the global turbulence, the BOK announced that
they stood ready to provide liquidity to financial markets if needed. In addition, the
Ministry of Finance and Economy has set up a task force along with the BOK and
financial regulators to monitor both domestic and international markets on a daily
basis and to devise contingency plans.

4.

Recent data releases indicate that growth remains solid, with inflation modest.

•

Second quarter GDP data indicate that growth reached 1.8 percent (q/q seasonally
adjusted), marginally higher than earlier flash estimates, led by strong facilities
investment and exports.

•

Exports have continued to perform well in the third quarter. Exports rose by
20 percent (y/y) in July, on strength in both the high tech sector and heavy industry,
and the current account recorded a sizable surplus of $1.5 billion. Preliminary August
trade data indicate export growth remained robust.

•

Indicators of domestic demand are solid. Industrial output expanded by 2.1 percent
(m/m seasonally adjusted) in July, led by increased production of semiconductors. In
addition, business confidence remained strong in August, despite the financial
volatility. Both of these developments point to likely continued strong investment. On
the consumption side, data are more mixed. In July, while service sector output rose
0.7 percent (m/m seasonally adjusted), it moderated from June, and large store sales
were flat. However, consumer confidence rose in August.

3
•

In August, headline inflation declined by ½ percentage point, to 2 percent (y/y),
below the lower edge of the BOK’s target band. The decline, which is expected to be
temporary, reflects food and oil prices. Core inflation was unchanged at 2.3 percent.

5.
Staff projections have changed only marginally since the issuance of the staff report,
reflecting the downgrading of global growth prospects:
•

Growth projections for this year remain unchanged, but 2008 growth has been
lowered by 0.2 percentage point, to 4.8 percent, reflecting weaker external demand.

•

Both exports and imports are projected to moderate compared with projections in the
staff report, with the current account still broadly balanced. In light of ongoing global
financial turbulence, however, staff’s projections of net capital inflows and reserves
have been lowered for 2007, with some turnaround expected next year.

•

Key downside risks continue to be those highlighted in the staff report—further
financial market turmoil, a sharper-than-expected U.S. slowdown, or higher oil
prices—but these risks have increased in line with recent global developments.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 24, 2007

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with
the Republic of Korea
On September 12, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Korea.1
Background
Korea is enjoying its longest uninterrupted period of economic expansion—
17 consecutive quarters—since the Asian crisis. Growth reached 5 percent in 2006,
buoyed by strong exports, and is only expected to slow marginally to 4¾ percent this
year. Inflation has remained below the Bank of Korea’s target range of 2½ to 3½ percent
over the last year, and unemployment has fallen to a four-year low. The current account
is expected to remain broadly in balance, with strong exports being offset by a higher oil
import bill and a further widening of the services deficit. Gross capital inflows have
increased since 2006, reflecting hedging by exporters and arbitrage activities, but are
expected to moderate.
On the policy front, the fiscal stance remains neutral, although this year’s budget has
been front-loaded in response to the late 2006 slowdown. On the other hand, after a
lengthy pause, monetary tightening has recently resumed, with the Bank of Korea twice
raising its target rate by 25 basis points, to 5 percent, in response to concerns about
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
rapid money and credit growth. After having appreciated for several years, the won has
stabilized in 2007, and appears broadly appropriately valued. To smooth volatility and
prevent the won from appreciating too rapidly, the authorities have at times intervened in
the foreign exchange market in modest amounts.
The impact of the ongoing global financial turbulence has so far been manageable but
downside risks to the outlook have increased, with the nascent consumption recovery
vulnerable to a downturn in asset markets, a hard landing in the United States, or the
possibility of further hikes in oil prices. The financial sector is generally in good health,
and risks appear modest. Housing prices have stabilized in recent months, and any
decline would not affect the financial system significantly given low nonperforming
loans(NPLs) and loan-to-value ratios. At the same time, while lending to small- and
medium-sized enterprises(SMEs) has accelerated, vulnerability appears limited given
improvements in risk management practices.
Over the medium term, Korea faces more daunting challenges. A rapidly aging
population will generate strong fiscal pressures through large outlays for pensions and
health care. In addition, the expected decline in the labor force, combined with the
ongoing erosion of its low-skilled manufacturing base and sluggish service sector
productivity, could affect growth and threaten external stability.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the strong recovery that Korea has made since the Asian
crisis and its success in adapting to the changing global landscape, which have been
supported by the authorities’ forward-looking and prudent economic policies. In recent
years, growth has been buoyed by strong exports and resilience in domestic demand.
Notwithstanding some increase in volatility in the Korean equity market, Korea has thus
far weathered well the ongoing turbulence in the global financial system.
Directors observed that Korea’s near-term outlook is favorable, with growth likely to
remain robust and inflation contained. However, they cautioned that the risks in the
global environment have increased, as indicated by recent world market developments.
Directors considered that, with inflation pressures well contained, there is scope for
loosening monetary policy were downside risks to materialize. They encouraged the
authorities to further develop the money market to strengthen the monetary transmission
mechanism, which would help limit further recourse to reserve requirements. Directors
saw less room for maneuver on the fiscal side, in light of Korea’s considerable mediumterm fiscal challenges. The broadly neutral fiscal stance therefore remains appropriate.
Directors agreed that the won appears broadly appropriately valued. External
competitiveness remains strong despite the large appreciation of the won vis-à-vis most
major currencies over the last few years. Going forward, Directors agreed that the

3
exchange rate should continue to be market determined, with intervention in the foreign
exchange market limited to smoothing volatility.
Directors welcomed the progress that has been made in recent years in strengthening
Korea’s financial sector, as reflected in improvements in financial soundness indicators,
risk assessment practices, and credit information. As a result of these reforms,
vulnerabilities are low and the financial sector appears to be well-placed to deal with
shocks. However, there remain pockets of domestic risk that bear close watch. A decline
in housing prices could affect consumption, in particular as a sizable share of
households still hold short-term bullet-type mortgages. Also, notwithstanding recent
improvements in risk management practices at banks, the recent rapid growth in lending
to small- and medium-sized enterprises could lead to an increase in nonperforming
loans, particularly if the economy were to slow. Directors saw the further development of
the mortgage market and continued upgrading of banks’ risk assessment models, in line
with the introduction of Basel II, as effective ways of mitigating these risks.
Directors considered that further financial sector development would support Korea’s
economic performance over the longer term, as well as assist in dealing with potentially
volatile capital flows. In this respect, they welcomed the recent passage of the Capital
Market Consolidation Act, which should contribute significantly to the emergence of
strong investment banks and a resilient capital market.
Directors observed that Korea will confront the burden of an aging society in coming
decades, as have many industrial countries. Addressing the resulting fiscal pressures
will require action on a number of fronts, notably increasing tax revenues through base
broadening and improved tax administration, further pension reform, and reorientation of
public spending toward high-priority areas. Directors appreciated the authorities’
ongoing efforts to address these challenges, and stressed that comprehensive and
timely reforms would ease adjustment. At the same time, they commended the
authorities’ efforts to inform the public of long-term fiscal pressures through their Vision
2030 initiative. Some called for the regular publication of a comprehensive long-term
fiscal report.
Directors noted that Korea’s manufacturers are likely to face increasingly intense
competition from lower-wage countries, while services sector productivity remains
relatively low. To maintain competitiveness in global markets and sustain high rates of
growth over the long term, Directors encouraged the authorities to continue taking steps
to liberalize the services sector, enhance labor market flexibility, and improve the
investment climate, notably for foreign direct investment. They supported the authorities’
intention to use free trade agreements to help achieve some of these goals, while
remaining committed to multilateral trade liberalization initiatives.

Statement by Richard Murray, Executive Director for Korea
and Jong-won Yoon, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
September 12, 2007
We welcome the constructive policy dialogue during the Article IV consultation, and thank
staff for the high-quality papers which provided a candid assessment of the Korean economy.
There was broad agreement between the authorities and staff on most issues, and staff’s
policy recommendations will be properly taken into account in future policy deliberations.
Ten years have passed since the Asian financial crisis severely hit the Korean economy.
Since then, painful but rewarding structural reforms and sound macroeconomic policies have
led to a successful transformation of the economy, with per capita GDP expected to reach
nearly US$20,000 this year from US$7,523 in 1998. Despite this achievement, daunting
longer-term challenges remain, for which the authorities are preparing.
Recent developments and outlook
The economy continued to expand robustly at its potential growth rate, marking the
longest continued expansion since the 1997 crisis. Second quarter GDP growth stood at
1.8 percent (q/q) which is the highest since 2003. A strong recovery of domestic demand
together with brisk exports have led to more balanced growth this year (Chart 1). Modest
growth of private consumption, which the authorities consider appropriate given the still-high
household debt level, is backed by solid employment performance and a recovery of real
incomes (Chart 2). Facility investment has rebounded strongly, and construction investment
is also returning to a positive growth. CPI inflation remains low at 2 percent despite higher
oil prices, and the current account has moved from around 4 percent of GDP in 2004 to
roughly balance this year. Reflecting continued structural reform efforts and enhanced
vigilance on possible vulnerabilities based on an early warning and crisis prevention system,
the authorities have adequately addressed potential structural risks to the economy with
preemptive policy responses where needed.1

The early warning and crisis prevention system consists of 5 sectors with sub-sectors, covering various risk
segments of the economy. Based on the system, the authorities closely monitor potential risk factors and
produce a summary report on a monthly basis.

Over the near term, the Korean economy is expected to continue growing robustly at
close to 5 percent with stable price inflation. The external current account is expected to
stay in balance. As staff indicated, risks appear to be tilted to the downside especially on the
external front, including a possible slowdown of global demand, increased volatility of
international financial markets and a worsening of the terms of trade such as from higher oil
prices. The recent turmoil in the international financial markets associated with the subprime
mortgage shakeout in the U.S. led to greater volatility in the Korean financial markets, but
the impact so far has been limited.
Short-term policy responses
The macroeconomic policy stance will remain neutral, but flexible to market
developments given downside risks ahead. The steady appreciation of the won has had a
contractionary impact on the economy, reducing the growth contribution of net exports, but
buoyant domestic demand has helped the economy to grow at a solid pace. Given the
favorable near-term outlook, the authorities will continue the current neutral policy stance,
but stand ready to adjust it should the downside risks materialize.
Fiscal policy continues to be prudent despite increasing spending pressures. According
to an interim report released this week, the revenue this year is expected to exceed the budget
by 11 trillion won, due in part to a broadened revenue base. As a result, the overall balance
will record a surplus of around 3 percent of GDP, being roughly balanced excluding social
security funds. As the authorities plan to use a majority of the revenue increase to repay
debt, the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to decline accordingly. With next year’s budget to be
submitted to the National Assembly in September, the current prudent fiscal stance will
continue. In addition, the revenue base will be further broadened and spending adjusted to
achieve a greater focus on social spending, education and R&D.

3
Given the downside risks and growing uncertainties on global financial markets, the
Bank of Korea (BOK) will remain flexible in setting policies. This year, the BOK raised
its policy rate twice to 5 percent in response to the solid economic recovery. Due to this
increase and, more importantly, a rapid real appreciation of the won, overall monetary
conditions have tightened. However, further adjustment will be dependent on data, given the
considerable uncertainties on the global financial markets and global demand. Regarding the
inflation target framework, the authorities will examine the adequacy of its target range in the
future review, based on expected future inflation developments.
Despite continued large capital inflows, the authorities have demonstrated their firm
commitment to a flexible exchange rate policy. As pointed out in the staff report, the real
exchange rate has appreciated significantly in recent years, and in particular the bilateral rate
with respect to the Japanese yen has risen by more than 50 percent since 2004. Despite
growing domestic criticism and concerns over the deterioration of external competitiveness,
the authorities have continued to let the exchange rate be determined in the market, limiting
market intervention only for short-term smoothing operations. The remaining restrictions on
capital account transactions have also been removed expeditiously, with a gradual rise in
capital outflows helping alleviate the strong pressures on the won.
These efforts notwithstanding, short-term capital inflows have rapidly increased, driven
by interest arbitrage opportunities, including yen carry trades, as well as hedging activities by
some large exporters (Chart 3).2 The recent
surge in capital inflows raised the following

First, the rapid rise of short-term debt
could impair macroeconomic stability,
as an abrupt unwinding could lead to
unwarranted instability in financial
markets. This concern unfortunately
turned out to be a reality in the recent
episode of global financial turbulence
which might not yet have ended its
course, with carry trades playing some
role in the process.

Second, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) increased their exposure to
external short-term debts, largely unhedged. As a result, a sudden change in market

External short-term debts increased 72 percent in 2006 and another 15 percent for the first quarter this year. As
a result, the ratio of short-term debts rose from 35.1 percent in 2005 to 45.3 percent in the first quarter this year.
More than half of short-term debts has been lent to SMEs.

4
sentiments could badly affect their financial position which has already weakened due
to intensified global competition and the rapid appreciation of the won. This, in turn,
could exacerbate the on-going structural adjustment of SMEs which account for
almost 90 percent of total employment.
In order to address these risks, the authorities have taken preventive prudential measures.
They include aligning capitalization rule for foreign bank branches with domestic firms and
limiting the use of foreign exchange loans by banks for real demand transactions, (i.e.,
financing imports and real investment). Notwithstanding these particular prudential
measures, the authorities will continue to remove the remaining restrictions on capital flows
and complete the liberalization by 2009 as announced, which will help further deepen the
foreign exchange markets and promote Korea’s financial hub strategy.
Financial market stability
The authorities broadly shared the staff’s view on financial sector health. The regulators
are paying close attention to risks, including in housing as well as SME loans. However, the
possibility of systemic risk from these factors seems limited given heightened prudential
standards, but the authorities are closely watching market developments and reviewing their
possible impact. Differences in prudential standards on mortgage loans between banks and
nonbanks have recently been aligned considerably so as to prevent rooms for regulatory
arbitrage.
Due consideration will be given to policy suggestions on developing the mortgage
market, including long-maturity and fix-term mortgages, which will help spread interest
risks borne by households and reduce housing-related risks in the financial sector.
Long-term fiscal challenges
Being fully cognizant of the grave consequences of the demographic change, the
authorities have implemented a comprehensive policy package to cope with the longterm challenges. Based on a Basic Act enacted in 2005, the authorities have been taking
measures, which aim at raising fertility, promoting female labor participation, cultivating
ageing-friendly industries, and expanding a socioeconomic infrastructure for elderly welfare.
Besides these efforts, the authorities have initiated policy plans to address the
population ageing-related fiscal burden. Given the formidable fiscal burden, the
authorities are fully committed to preserving long-term fiscal sustainability. A long-term
roadmap report, Vision 2030, was prepared last year, which reviewed the long-term fiscal
implication from population ageing and drew up policy directions to deal with long-term
spending pressures especially in the area of pensions, health and long-term care. The thrust
of policy responses identified in this report is broadly consistent with staff’s
recommendations. They include enhancing revenues through broadening the base and

5
strengthening tax administration to be followed by rate increases; consolidating expenditure
through further rationalization of spending and a shift in its composition; and restraining the
anticipated pension and health care-related fiscal burden. Policies are being implemented in
this direction, and will be refined over time. For instance, the recently passed pension reform
bill, which improved pension sustainability considerably, is an important step forward.
Further measures are to be considered in 2008 as part of the regular five-year general review,
in which additional reform of the public pensions as well as reform of the occupational
pension system will be deliberated.
The authorities fully agree with staff of the importance of early action and the need for
additional fiscal adjustments through wide-ranging measures. The analysis in Chapter 1
of Selected Issues is useful, as it provides a review of various policy options and their
macroeconomic implication over the long-term horizon. However, despite the “highly
illustrative” nature of the analysis, it could have been more useful if the analysis had been
based on more plausible assumptions. For example, the staff baseline did not reflect the
current legal stipulations, not to mention the well-known, long-standing fiscal conservatism
in Korea. Under the National Health Insurance (NHI) Act, the government is mandated to
subsidize only 20 percent of the NHI’s anticipated revenues and the remainder to be financed
through insurance payment revenues. Contrary to this legislation which has already been
enacted, the staff baseline assumed a considerably higher fiscal subsidization to the NHI.
While projections based on overly simplifying assumptions and a mechanical plugging-in of
numbers may be effective in scaring the public about long-run fiscal sustainability, they are
too “illustrative” to draw any practical implications.
In contrast, the long-term fiscal projections by the Korea Institute of Public Finance (KIPF)
based on the current legislation showed that the government debt-to GDP ratio would rise to
around 80 percent in 2050, which is significantly lower than the staff baseline. Given the
KIPF’s more realistic, but still-high long-term debt level as well as spending pressures in
other areas, the authorities remain committed to fiscal prudence, which is evidenced by the
aforementioned conservative fiscal stance and various preemptive reform measures.3
Enhancing growth potential
The authorities have strengthened policy efforts to enhance long-term growth potential,
considering the anticipated decline of labor inputs over time and intensified competition,
especially from neighboring countries. The policy priorities include promoting competition
and technical innovation through greater integration into the world economy; strengthening
competitiveness of SMEs; and enhancing productivity of service industries, including
financial sector development.
3

KIPF’s long-term simulation showed that, if the permanent portion of the expected revenue increase this year
is carried into the future, the debt-to-GDP ratio would decline by around 13 percentage points of GDP in 2050.

6

There has been significant progress on this front. The Korea-U.S. FTA was successfully
concluded, and now awaits legislators’ approval in both countries. A new labor law has been
implemented to better protect vulnerable workers and enhance labor market flexibility. The
Capital Market Consolidation Act, which has been passed by the National Assembly, will
further spur competition and financial innovation, thereby considerably changing the
financial landscape. Deregulation and market opening in the non-financial service sector are
vigorously being pursued, including in the business, education and medical service areas.
Reforms in some areas have been less ambitious so far due to practical limitations such
as difficulties in achieving broad public consensus. For example, staff indicated the
exclusion of health and education sectors in the Korea-U.S. FTA coverage, but this reflects
intense controversies over their public goods nature and the resulting difficulties to garner
broad public support. Nevertheless, the on-going efforts to deregulate and open up these
sectors will help promote competition and raise productivity, and further reforms will be
pushed forward as efforts to achieve broader public consensus are undertaken.
