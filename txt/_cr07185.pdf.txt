SAMOA
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2007 Consultation with Samoa
Approved by Masahiko Takeda and Michael Hadjimichael
May 4, 2007

Discussions: Apia, March 8–20, 2007. The team met with Prime Minister Tuilaepa
Malielegaoi, Minister of Finance Niko Lee Hang, Central Bank of Samoa Governor
Papali'i Tommy Scanlan, and other senior government officials.
Team: Messrs. Semblat (head) and Porter, and Mses. Mineshima and Zhou (all APD).
Mr. Momo (OED) joined the discussions.
Economic Setting: Despite a recent slowing, the current economic situation is sanguine.
The slowdown almost entirely reflected the restructuring of an auto parts manufacturer,
with other sectors remaining robust. Looking ahead, growth will rebound thanks to tourism
and construction related to the South Pacific Games in September 2007.
Exchange rate: Samoa maintains an exchange rate arrangement pegged to a basket of
currencies with undisclosed weights. Samoa has accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on
payments and transfers for current international transactions.
Outreach: Staff met with business leaders, donors, and representatives of the diplomatic
corps. As in the past, the authorities intend to authorize the publication of the report.
Previous Fund Advice: Samoa has had a very good track record in implementing Fund
advice: in line with previous Fund recommendations, the authorities have maintained fiscal
prudence and deepened their agenda of structural reforms.
Statistical issues: Core economic data are updated regularly in a timely manner, which
enhances surveillance. National accounts data have improved but are not on prepared on an
expenditure bases. Balance of payments data are limited.

Executive Summary
Background
•

Samoa has achieved a major economic transformation over the last decade and a
half. Real per capita GDP has increased by over 3 percent per year on average, and
external public debt has fallen below 40 percent of GDP. These achievements have
entitled Samoa to graduate from LDC status.

•

Macroeconomic conditions remain good. Despite a recent slowing in growth, real GDP
growth is rebounding to its 3-3½ percent historical pace, boosted by the continued
dynamism of the service sector and the rapid development of tourism. Inflation remains
low and the external position, after some weakening in 2006, has recovered thanks to a
tightening of fiscal and monetary policies.

•

Over the medium-term, steady real per capita growth is expected to continue.
Growth is expected to remain at around 3½ percent until 2010/11. The current account
should improve gradually as net exports of services and remittances continue to grow and
the reserve position is also expected to improve further. As growth remains strong and
fiscal prudence continues, external debt is expected to decline to around 34 percent of
GDP.

Key Policy Issues
•

Sustaining the strong performance requires the continuation of prudent fiscal
policies. The authorities could face a series of fiscal pressures over the medium-term. To
deal with these pressures, the authorities should restrain overall expenditure in
conjunction with a higher prioritization of current spending toward health and education
expenditures.

•

Improving the effectiveness of monetary policy would help better deal with possible
shocks. This could be done notably by developing money markets and enhancing the
communication strategy of the Central Bank of Samoa (CBS).

•

Accelerating the program of structural reforms would boost growth further.
Removing impediments to the economic use of customary land would unlock an
untapped potential, especially for tourism and intensive agricultural development.
Promoting private sector development would require further privatization of SOEs, as
well as improving the business climate and developing the financial sector. The
successful restructuring of Polynesian Airlines and the recent fall in telecom tariffs
following the introduction of competition in the sector have clearly demonstrated the
benefits of the reforms.

I. SUCCESS STORY OF THE PACIFIC
1.
Over the last decade and a half,
Samoa has achieved a major economic
transformation. Real per capita GDP
increased by over 3 percent per year on
average, faster than that seen elsewhere in
the Pacific as well as in other small island
regions. This is a remarkable performance
for a small and remote island. The
transformation is reflected in the transition
toward service activity, especially
commerce and tourism.

The external position benefited
from the rapid growth of remittances

respect for elders and attachment to land,
expatriates send large remittances and visit

The authorities also liberalized interest
rates, eliminated credit ceilings, and moved to indirect monetary policy instruments. The
success of these reforms was facilitated by Samoa’s political stability: the Human Rights
Protection Party (HRPP), in power for the past 25 years, was reelected following the March
2006 Parliamentary elections.

their homeland regularly. These visits have also helped kick-start the tourism industry, with
Samoa now becoming a tourism destination for Australians and New Zealanders. Reflecting
this, tourism is likely to contribute significantly to growth over coming years.
4.
These successes are enabling Samoa to graduate from LDC status. Samoa
exceeds two of the three LDC criteria set by the U.N., the Human Assets Index and the per
capita Gross National Income Index, although Samoa’s economic vulnerability still remain
high. As a result, the U.N. committee on LDCs decided last year to remove Samoa from its
list. Following a three year transition period, the country will officially graduate in 2009.

of the external position, the authorities tightened their fiscal stance. In the April-June 2006
period, the authorities ran a sizable fiscal surplus limiting the overall 2005/06 deficit to
½ percent of GDP, much lower than the
4¼ percent budget target.

Private sector credit growth was
rapid in 2005/06, although it declined
after some monetary tightening. Fueled by
a surge in lending for construction activities,
notably in the tourism sector and in
anticipation of the SPG, private sector credit
growth accelerated sharply. To limit pressure
on the external position, the central bank
tightened monetary policy.

Inflation remains low. The recent
pick-up in the headline and underlying
measures of inflation mostly reflected
changes to excise rates in July 2006 and a
2½ percentage point increase in the VAT in
October. However, excluding those
elements, inflation has remained muted,
currently running at around 2½ percent
(year-on-year).

Rates on CBS securities—the CBS’s main

the rise in the lending rate was relatively

rates, the central bank used moral suasion
to curb lending.

The external position has
recovered since mid-2006. The preelection stimulus, private sector credit
growth, and higher oil import bill,
contributed to a 23 percent surge in imports
in the first quarter of 2006. Even as tourism
receipts and private remittances rose, the
deterioration in the trade balance led to a
fall in foreign reserves to below 3 months
of imports in May 2006. Since the
tightening of fiscal and monetary policies,
the external position has improved, with
reserves rising to about 3½ months of
imports by January 2007.

B. Outlook and Risks
10.
Short-term prospects are good. Growth is expected to rebound to 3 percent for
2006/07. Construction activity remains buoyant thanks to the SPG and ongoing donor
projects. Combined with rising tourist arrivals, this should help boost 2007/08 growth to
around 3½ percent. Reflecting the recent increases in the VAT rate and excise taxes, headline
inflation should remain around 5¼ percent through 2006/07. Nonetheless, core inflation
remains low and headline inflation is expected to revert to 3 percent in 2007/08. The balance
of payments should continue to benefit from growing tourism, foreign investment, and
remittances, while import growth decelerates given the policy tightening, allowing reserves
to rise to almost 3¾ months of imports by mid-2008.
11.
Over the medium-term, steady real per capita growth is expected, with external
debt declining. Under the baseline scenario, staff expects annual per capita growth to remain
at around 3-3½ percent until 2010/11, with continued emigration limiting population growth.
The service sector is likely to be the key driver of growth, boosted by the strong performance

of the tourism sector. The current account should improve to a surplus of 1½ percent of GDP
in 2010/11 as net export of services and remittances continue to grow. Reserves are projected
to reach 5 months of imports by 2010/11. Consequently, external debt should decline from
around 40 percent of GDP to 34 percent in 2010/11. Moreover, with all external debt
concessional, the net present value of debt is expected to decline to 20 percent of GDP.
12.
Nonetheless, given its size and remoteness, Samoa remains vulnerable to external
shocks. First among them are cyclones: Samoa has been hit by 3 major cyclones since 1990.
Should a cyclone hit the islands again, destroying much of the agriculture crop and slowing
tourism, the outlook would worsen with lower growth, higher inflation and a short-term
deterioration in the balance of payments. Other shocks affecting regional tourism or
remittances could also adversely impact the economy.
13.
Continued deepening of the reform program would yield a much higher real per
capita growth. While Samoa’s growth performance has been impressive, the economy still
faces impediments to growth. The restriction on leasing customary land for productive uses,
notably for tourism and intensive agriculture, together with the cost of finance and some
infrastructure services remain critical issues. Staff believes that a more forceful push to
remove these impediments could raise average real per capita growth by ½ to 1 percentage
point over the medium term, through additional tourism and investment activity.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS: SUSTAINING THE STRONG PERFORMANCE
The discussions focused on ways to sustain rapid per capita income growth, while limiting
Samoa’s vulnerability to risks and pressures. Given Samoa’s stable macro-economic
situation, particular attention was placed on ways to deal with possible future fiscal
challenges—aging of the population and lower donor assistance—while maintaining fiscal
balance, and ways to strengthen the monetary policy framework in order to better deal with
possible external shocks. In addition, the staff reinforced the importance of deepening
structural reforms in order to accelerate per capita income growth, in line with the
authorities’ intentions.
A. Maintaining Fiscal Prudence
14.
The staff and authorities agreed that continued fiscal discipline, especially in the
face of coming fiscal pressures, is crucial to sustaining Samoa’s strong performance.
Moreover, given Samoa’s basket peg regime and the significant impact of government
operations on the balance of payments, the staff emphasized the need to maintain prudent
fiscal policy. Indeed, as the episode of 2005/06 has shown, reserves can quickly evaporate if
the fiscal situation deteriorates.

9

15.
The fiscal strategy is therefore
designed to ensure the sustainability of
Samoa’s public and external debt, and
create some fiscal space to deal with possible
shocks. Currently, the public debt to GDP ratio
in Samoa, at around 39 percent, is in line with
other Pacific islands.4 Maintaining the overall
fiscal position around balance over the
medium-term would help reduce it to 34
percent by 2010/11. However, should a strong
cyclone hit Samoa, public debt levels would
rise again to more than 40 percent by 2010/11.
If a series of unusually strong cyclones hit
Samoa (as happened since 1990) Samoa’s debt
profile would deteriorate further (see attached
DSA annex).

Over the medium-term, Samoa
could face several fiscal pressures: first,
among those, the pressure from an aging
population: with Samoans’ average life
expectancy rising, so will public
expenditures on health. Together with the
authorities’ intentions to increase spending
on education, the likely increase in social
spending will put pressure on overall
expenditures.5

Samoa’s anticipated graduation could also put pressure on the fiscal accounts by
limiting both the external grants (which have averaged around 8 percent of GDP in recent
years) as well as access to concessional financing for infrastructure projects. In discussions
with staff, most donors did not link their assistance decisions to the LDC graduation decision,
suggesting a relatively minimal impact on donors’ assistance to Samoa. However, the
authorities should prepare for lower levels

This also argues for restraining
the growth of public wages. The
authorities noted that this was being dealt
with by moving towards implementing a
salary structure more closely aligned with

19.
Reflecting these pressures, the
staff argued for continued balanced
budgets with overall expenditure
restraint. With revenue to GDP at around
30 percent—slightly above the average for
tourism-based islands—the staff argued
that fiscal pressures should be handled
primarily through current expenditure
restraint. For instance, a halving of grants
by 2010/11 would require reducing
current spending from around 25 percent
of GDP to 23 percent so as to keep
development expenditure constant.

performance over the next two years. Staff supported this initiative, noting that any general
public wage increase should be consistent with budgetary constraints set by medium-term
fiscal plans, and integrated with any civil service reform.
21.
Restraint on current spending, as well as additional social spending needs, also
calls for cutting non priority spending. This could be done by cutting subsidies and
transfers for SOEs which have cost an average of 2½ percent of GDP per annum since 2000.
These measures, together with the saving of any surpluses, would also create a cushion in
case of unforeseen expenditure, such as after a natural disaster.
B. Improving the Effectiveness of Monetary Policy
22.
Staff and the authorities agreed that a pause in the recent monetary tightening
was justified. The tightening has succeeded in slowing private sector credit growth, but
given such lingering risks to the external position as the final boost in construction for the
SPG and the last step in the phased public wage increases in July 2007, monetary policy
should remain on hold for the time being.
23.
Improving the resilience of the economy to external shocks requires a stronger
monetary policy framework. When reserves fell below their four-month import coverage
target, the central bank tightened its stance. Lacking open-market like instruments to inject
liquidity at a time when excess reserves were very low, the central bank had difficulties
steering short-term interest rates. The central bank therefore relied on moral suasion which,
combined with the lack of additional liquidity in the system, succeeded in slowing lending.
24.
The effectiveness of monetary policy could benefit from the development of the
short-term money market.6 The staff welcomed the recent development of an active interbank market, but, as agreed with the authorities, further development requires a more active
involvement of the National Pension Fund (NPF) in the CBS securities auctions and the
interbank market given its structurally long cash position. Such a development could improve
the functioning of monetary policy but would also be an important step in fostering financial
market development in Samoa. Further developments could include the issuance of
government securities. However, should these instruments be insufficient, the CBS could
also rely more on the Statutory Reserve Deposit (SRD) requirement rate.
25.
The staff recommended that the CBS clarify its primary policy target, and
enhance its dialogue with the private sector. The staff argued that the ultimate objective is
the maintenance of the exchange rate peg, which acts as a credible anchor, with the reserveimport coverage ratio as the intermediate target. Although the authorities noted that capital
controls allow the CBS some influence over monetary conditions, the maintenance of the peg
6

12

takes preference over the CBS’s inflation goal. In the current framework, stable inflation is
an outcome provided by the basket peg and its strong credibility. The staff also suggested
more regular presentations from the central bank to enhance its communication with the
private sector so as to guide market expectations on interest rates. The CBS noted that it
already provides extensive information on its website, and that the bimonthly Cabinet
Development Committee meeting provided a forum for conveying its views.
26.
The staff and the authorities agreed that raising the CBS’s target import
coverage ratio to five months would be desirable. Samoa’s vulnerability to shocks that can
lead to a rapid erosion of reserves has been amply demonstrated in the recent past.
Consequently, the staff argued that gradually raising the import coverage ratio over the
medium-term to five months would provide an important additional buffer. Samoa’s shallow
markets and limited access to financial markets make this form of self-insurance particularly
important.

28.
Nonetheless, staff believes that
the tala is appropriately valued. In many
sectors, especially tourism, Samoa’s main
competitors lie with its island peers in the
Pacific region. In this regard, there are no
indications that the tala has deviated from
other regional currencies and Samoa’s real
effective exchange rate has remained
relatively stable since the one-time jump
of late 2003 consecutive to cyclone Heta.
Moreover, given Samoa’s impressive
record of structural reforms and growth,

regime remains appropriate and should
be maintained. The basket peg regime
has provided a strong anchor against
inflationary expectations. The basket is
composed of six currencies, those of its
main trading partners, and appropriately
reflects tourism and remittance flows.
Reflecting the recent strength of the
Australian and New Zealand dollars, key
currencies in the basket, the tala has
appreciated vis-à-vis large Asian
economies.

improved access to Samoa and cheaper
airfares following the restructuring of Polynesian Airlines, the tourism industry is expanding
rapidly.

C. Promoting the Economic Use of Land and Fostering Private Sector Development
30.
Samoa’s performance over the past decade has been impressive, but much of its
potential remains untapped. The country is rich in fertile land, fishing resources, and
attractive potential tourist locations. Samoa also has a relatively flexible labor market and
high levels of investor protection. Past impediments that have inhibited Samoa reaching its
potential relate to the economic use of customary land, and the pricing of some utility
services.7
31.
The staff and the authorities agreed that long-term growth prospects depend on
the economic use of customary land. At present, 81 percent of the land in Samoa is
customary, owned by extended families represented by their chiefs (“Matai”). Customary
land cannot be sold, and while leases are legally possible, they are difficult and expensive to
arrange. This is seen as a major impediment to further tourism development and intensive
agriculture. Recognizing these constraints, the authorities intend to develop a reform plan,
with the support of the AsDB, aimed at easing processes for leasing customary land and
allowing the use of customary leases for collateral. Consultations with the public have
already begun.
32.
Recent successes have demonstrated the importance of SOE reforms. The
restructuring of international services of the government-owned Polynesian Airlines into
Polynesian Blue (through a joint venture with a foreign airline) has reduced airfares to Samoa
by around half, resulting in a significant increase in tourist arrivals, and removed an average
7

annual cost of one percent of GDP from the budget. Similarly, the deregulation of the mobile
telecommunications sector has triggered a sizable fall in call costs. These gains have
strengthened public support for further reforms. The authorities noted that remaining
priorities include plans to reform the remaining domestic operations of Polynesian Airlines
(which still generate losses), and a longer-term plan to reform the electricity sector, including
through the introduction of competition. Further reforms should focus on removing crosssubsidies from utility prices, especially electricity.
Box 1. Samoa: Private Sector Development
Facilitating the economic use of land would boost private sector development. Customary land has a
central place in Samoan culture and society. Its inalienable nature limits its transfer across uses, and prevents
it from being used as collateral when borrowing for investment. Although leases are legally possible, they are
time consuming, expensive to arrange, and considered difficult to enforce. Consequently, less than one-fifth of
customary leases are for commercial purposes, with church leases far more significant. Although leases can
legally be used as collateral, no bank currently accepts them as collateral. Streamlining the leasing process and
making enforcement easier, should increase the availability of both land for projects and financing.
Progress in other areas would also reduce the cost of doing business and obtaining financing:
•

Public Services: Increasing private provision and competition in public services, together with improved
management of the remaining public bodies, should lower business costs. Samoa’s infrastructure
compares well with some in the region, but some public services remain costly. Increased competition
such as in the telecom sector would help reduce costs.

•

New Businesses: The processes for starting a business and foreign investment could be streamlined.

•

Financing Costs: Streamlining the property registry and establishing a credit bureau would reduce the
cost borrowing.

33.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ renewed efforts to accelerate the privatization
program and improved SOE governance. The authorities plan to privatize Samoa
Broadcasting Corporation, Agriculture Store Corporation and Samoa Shipping Services this
year. The staff noted that this should be followed the sale of the government’s stake in other
non-strategic SOEs, with SamoaTel mentioned by the authorities as a likely candidate. Staff
also recommended that the list of strategic SOEs be reviewed regularly with the objective of
gradually reducing public sector involvement in the economy over time. Although the
creation (with the assistance of the AsDB) of the independent Institute of Directors has
helped develop the skills of directors, the government continues to be heavily represented on
the boards of major SOEs. Future efforts could aim to increase the number of independent
directors, make managers more accountable for their performance, and more strictly enforce
the 50 percent rule on dividend payments by profitable SOEs.
D. Developing and Strengthening the Financial Sector
34.
Despite the recent rapid growth in private sector credit, and a reduction in the
interest margin, the banking system remains sound. Non performing loans as a share of
total loans have increased to around 4 percent, but remain relatively low and the level of
provisioning is adequate. Bank profitability remains high, although tight liquidity witnessed
over the past year has led to an increase in the cost of funds. Consequently, some decline in
profits could be expected as the lending margin has declined and credit growth decelerates.
Nonetheless, this possible deterioration should be manageable as all four banks, including
two subsidiaries of major Australian banks, are adequately capitalized and the supervisory
framework appears adequate to deal with these potential risks.

decisions. The recent establishment of a nascent credit information and debt collection firm is
welcome. Future efforts should focus on a credit bureau reporting positive information.
1

36.
Staff welcomes the recent improvements in the management of the NPF. The
authorities stressed that overall lending guidelines have been strengthened, and thanks to the
establishment of a debt management unit, the NPF has improved its management of nonperforming assets. In addition, the Fund has started investing a portion of its assets in foreign

16

safe assets. Staff suggested that the NPF also invest in domestic risk-free assets such as CBS
securities. More generally, the financing of consumption should not be the NPF’s primary
activity. Presently NPF members can borrow up to half of their accumulated funds for any
purpose, with many taking up this opportunity. Staff recommends that the 50 percent
borrowing cap gradually be lowered, and/or that this borrowing be restricted to housing,
education or other investment projects.
37.
Regulation and supervision of both the domestic and international (offshore)
banking sectors have significantly improved since the offshore center assessment of
2002. An update concluded prior to the Article IV mission found that compliance with Basel
Core Principles for domestic and international banking supervision has improved compared
with the previous assessment.8 On-site examinations of two key areas—credit risk
management and AML/CFT—have been conducted at all domestic banks. For the
international banks, which remain small, supervisory arrangements were strengthened by the
requirement that banks establish a physical presence in Samoa and maintain records there,
and on-site inspection was introduced. The Samoa International Finance Authority (SIFA)
was also established in 2005 as an autonomous supervisory agency for the offshore sector.
38.
Nonetheless, areas for improvement remain. For the domestic sector, the
supervision of banks’ credit policies, connected lending, and large exposures could be
strengthened, and the CBS still has to implement the new AML/CFT legislation. For
international banks, SIFA’s operational independence could be improved by transferring the
Minister of Finance’s remaining powers to SIFA and the supervisory system should be
strengthened further through the introduction of prudential guidance on banks’ lending and
other risk taking activities.
E. Further Integrating Samoa into the Global Economy
39.
Staff welcomes recent efforts to conclude negotiations on WTO accession. The
mission believes that Samoa’s integration into the global economy and a further opening up
of its economy could yield significant benefits. Securing a rapid conclusion of the
negotiations would be important, especially at a time when graduation from LDC status
could affect Samoa’s current preferential access treatment to some major markets.
Discussions with the EU on an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) are ongoing, with
the hope that negotiations will be completed early next year.

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
41.
Samoa’s economic transformation over the past decade has been impressive.
This period has seen significant development of the service sector, and growth fast enough to
make Samoa a middle-income country. While Samoa remains a small, isolated and
vulnerable economy, its transformation clearly demonstrates the benefits of its broad-based
and ongoing reform program, and sound macroeconomic policy, as well as its stable political
environment.
42.
Near-term growth is set to rebound. Following the manufacturing slowdown in
2005/06, growth is expected to accelerate over the near term reflecting increased activity in
construction leading up to the SPG and associated tourism. Core inflation is expected to
remain muted in the near term. Continued remittance flows and strong tourists arrivals should
result in a further accumulation of reserves.
43.
Nonetheless, Samoa remains a vulnerable economy, highlighting the importance
of prudent policy. Natural disasters, such as cyclones, remain an ongoing risk, as do sudden
swings in commodity prices. Moreover, given the aging of the population and prospective
LDC graduation, Samoa is expected to face rising fiscal pressures over coming years.
44.
Continuation of prudent fiscal policy is essential. With revenue collections already
relatively high, expenditure restraint is the most appropriate way to deal with fiscal pressures.
Spending restraint will sharpen the need for government to prioritize expenditure into areas
9

Among other measures, the authorities should ease work permits for foreign workers and managers.

18

that would boost growth opportunities (infrastructure and education), and address the needs
of an aging population.
45.
Samoa’s vulnerabilities also argue for additional reserves and a stronger
framework for monetary policy instruments. The episode of 2005/06 showed how quickly
reserves can evaporate. Consequently, Samoa should aim to maintain reserves to cover
around 5 months of imports over the medium-term. Moreover, deepening money markets
would help enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy.
46.
The basket peg exchange rate regime remains appropriate. This regime has
provided a credible nominal anchor, and has contributed to low inflation. The basket weights
are appropriately based on foreign trade, tourism and remittance flows. The recent weakness
of merchandise exports reflects specific non-price factors.
47.
The benefits of structural reform have been clearly demonstrated. The
restructuring of air services has resulted in a sharp increase of tourists, and the introduction
of competition in the telecommunications sector has generated a fall in call costs. Similar
benefits are likely to result from reforms in other utility and infrastructure areas, such as
electricity provision. Efforts to strengthen management and accountability of SOEs and
promoting the transparency of SOE pricing are likely to significantly improve the business
environment.
48.
Expected continuation of the wide-ranging structural reform efforts will be
important to maintain high and sustainable medium-term growth. In particular, making
the leasing of customary land easier promises significantly higher growth as it remains the
most binding constraint to further development. The government’s reform process holds the
promise of improving both the allocation of land as well as prospects for project financing if
leases can be accepted as effective collateral.
49.
The quality of statistics is continuing to improve. Fund staff, including PFTAC,
will continue to assist in this area.
50.
It is recommended that the Article IV consultation with Samoa take place on a
24-month cycle. The authorities would welcome an interim staff visit in early 2008.

ANNEX I: SAMOA—MEDIUM-TERM DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS1
The baseline and scenario analysis suggest that Samoa is at low risk of debt distress.
A. Baseline Scenario
Assumptions: The baseline scenario, described in Table 4, has medium-term growth
expected at around 3½ percent a year, equal to that seen over the past decade. The continued
growth reflects an anticipated step-up in tourism and foreign investment activities as recent
economic reforms filter through to the rest of the economy. Despite impressive growth in
recent years, foreign investment in Samoa has historically been well below that elsewhere in
the Pacific, and extremely low compared with foreign investment in island economies
elsewhere. Further structural reforms, including to increase the use of customary land, are
expected to lead to increased foreign investment. With spending restraint generating a
broadly balanced fiscal position, and supporting both domestic and external positions, the
current account is expected to improve to around 1½ percent of GDP by 2010/11, and foreign
reserves are expected to gradually rise to around 5 months of imports.
Debt Dynamics:2 Under this baseline, public debt and debt service indicators are all well
below the levels typically associated with stress for countries with strong institutions and
governance.3 Nominal public debt is expected to rise slightly to 39½ percent of GDP in
FY2007/08 reflecting planned infrastructure spending, and then gradually fall to 34 percent
of GDP by FY2010/11. With all public debt concessional, the NPV of external debt was less
than 30 percent of GDP at end FY2005/06, and is expected to decline monotonically to
around 22 percent of GDP by FY2010/11.4

1

Prepared jointly with World Bank staff.

2

Only an external DSA has been prepared for Samoa. Domestic debt issuance has been minimal, with the
authorities reporting domestic bond issues of around SAT 2 million (less than 0.2 percent of GDP). Given the
highly shallow nature of Samoa’s bond markets, the extent of domestic borrowing will likely remain very low
for some time.

3

Thresholds associated with international evidence of historical debt distress episodes in countries with strong
institutions and governance are for the NPV of debt to: GDP above 50 percent; exports above 200 percent;
revenue above 300 percent. For debt service, indicative ratios are for debt service to: exports above 25 percent;
and revenue above 35 percent.

4

Note that reflecting the importance of capital transfers, as well as the deficiency in Samoa’s balance of
payments data, there has been very large historical “residual” debt accumulation. Projected residual financing is
smaller than historical patterns.

3

B. Sensitivity Analysis
Scenarios and bound tests do not suggest significant risks to Samoa’s debt sustainability.
Most scenarios and stress tests result in, at most, a temporary rise in the debt burden.5 Under
all standard stress (bound) test, the debt burden is below its FY2006/07 level within a decade.
A permanent shock in which growth, inflation, the current account, and net FDI inflows
permanently equal their average values over the past eight years (a “historical” scenario),
would see a rising debt burden over time. This entirely reflects the high average non-interest
current account deficit (3.5 percent of GDP), and low average FDI inflows (0.2 percent of
GDP) over the past eight years. Indeed, endogenous debt dynamic under the historical
scenario tend to reduce debt even faster than under the baseline scenario.6 The importance of
the large assumed current account deficit is demonstrated by an adjusted historical scenario
where the current account and net FDI inflows are assumed to lie between the historical
average and their baseline values. In this adjusted scenario, the debt burden declines
generally over the horizon (Figure I-1). However, even in the unadjusted historical scenario
the indicators of debt burden remain below the levels typically associated with debt distress
in countries with strong institutions and governance.
Nonetheless, Samoa remains vulnerable to natural disasters. A scenario assuming a
“cyclone” every five years starting from 2007/08,7 which reduces GDP growth to zero and
export growth to 60 percent of its baseline value, results in a relatively flat path for the NPV
of debt indicators (with the NPV of debt rising very slightly relative to exports and falling
very slightly relative to GDP). Debt service relative to exports rises over time. However, all
indicators remain below the level associated with debt distress.
The analysis suggest that Samoa is at low risk of debt distress. This follows from standard
debt indicators remaining well below the thresholds typically associated with potential
distress, even under standard stress tests, throughout the period until FY2026/27.

5

Additional financing required under any of these scenarios or stress tests is assumed to be on concessional
terms.
6

Endogenous debt dynamics are those driven mechanically by movements in GDP growth, interest rates,
inflation and the exchange rate.

7

Samoa had three major cyclones between 1990 and 2005.

ANNEX III: SAMOA—SUPPORT FROM THE PACIFIC FINANCIAL
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTRE8
The Centre’s assistance to Samoa since 1998 has included 29 advisory missions. Samoa also sent
31 officials to regional seminars and workshops.
Public Financial Management
Samoa sent participants to the PFTAC workshop in Nadi in November 2006 on Medium-Term
Financial Framework and to the second PIFMA meeting in March 2007. PFTAC has in place a
peripatetic consultant to help establish a forward estimates project over two budget cycles.
Tax Administration and Policy
In early 2002, the advisor undertook an introductory visit to Samoa to discuss tax policy and
administration related issues with the authorities. In June 2005, the adviser traveled to Samoa for
providing advice on issues associated with the possible establishment of a large taxpayer unit and
introduction of a single tax identification number. Samoa is an inaugural member of the Pacific
Islands Tax Administrators Association (PITAA) and hosted the second annual meeting on
October 2005.
Financial Sector Regulation and Supervision
The PFTAC advisor visited the CBS and SIFA in June 2005. The mission provided training to
bank supervisors in both the domestic and offshore banking sectors in the areas of AML/CFT and
the Basel Core Principles for Effective Bank Supervision. The mission also recommended the need
for the CBS to strengthen supervision of the pension fund. The mission also advised SIFA on the
need to strengthen supervision of the trust and company service provider sector.
Economic and Financial Statistics
The CBS started working on a BPM5 basis for Balance of Payments estimates in 2003. In
June 2004, the PFTAC Statistics advisor visited to review the implementation progress, and in
April 2005 the CBS BOP compiler attended a regional training course in Fiji. A short term expert
mission was arranged in December 2005 to improve monetary statistics (jointly with Solomon
Islands and Fiji). In April 2006, the PFTAC advisor visited to assess TA needs in all sectors, and
arranged a short-term expert mission to continue progress on BOP implementation.

ANNEX IV: SAMOA––RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP9
(As of April 2007)

Since Samoa became a Bank member in June 1974, 15 IDA credits totaling US$87.8 million
have been made covering the agriculture, power, telecommunication, finance, transport, and
health sectors. Samoa is eligible for an IDA 14 allocation of SDR 7 million (indicative only)
over FY2006–08. The IDA allocation for FY07 is SDR 6.4 million (with carryover from
FY06), with 45 percent on a grant-financed basis.
The Bank’s assistance to Samoa is guided by the Government’s own development priorities
as articulated in the Strategy for the Development of Samoa (2005–07), and the Bank’s
broader Pacific Regional Strategy FY2006–09 which has a focus on (1) strengthening
government capabilities, and (2) improving incentives for the private sector. The Bank’s
current activities in Samoa are in the following areas:
Strengthening Government Capabilities
•

Health Sector. Through the Health Sector Management project (approved 14/09/2000,
IDA US$5 million), the Bank is supporting Government’s reform program aimed at
ensuring equitable access to a modern, effective, efficient, and environmentally friendly
health service, delivered in close collaboration with the private sector and NGOs.
Implementation is within a sector coordination framework involving other donors
(AusAID).

•

Infrastructure Asset Management Phase 2. The objective of this second-phase
program (approved 29/12/2003, US$12.8 million) to be carried out over a period of eight
years is to enhance the economic, environmental and social sustainability of transport and
coastal infrastructure assets, and to manage these assets, natural resources and disaster
risks through an effective partnership with private sector stakeholders. Additional
finance of approximately US$8.2 million is currently being finalized to help cover
shortfall in project costs.

•

Infrastructure Emergency Recovery. The Cyclone Emergency Recovery Project
(approved 29/4/2004, US$4.5 million) is assisting Samoa to recover from the damage
caused by Cyclone Heta and reduce the vulnerability of its people to prevailing natural
hazards through: (a) Recovery of coastal resilience to erosion, flooding, and landslide
hazards (b) Nurturing the recovery of fragile coastal ecosystems through sustainable
practices; and (c) Rehabilitation of damaged land transport communications.

•

Procurement Reforms and Capacity Development. Based on the Operational
Procurement Review and, with funds from an IDF grant (signed 06/10/2004,
US$176,000) the Government of Samoa has selected a consultant to review and revise
their Procurement Guidelines. After the Procurement Guidelines are revised, consultants

9

Prepared by the World Bank staff.

11

will prepare the Procurement Manuals and Standard Bidding Documents, and then
provide training.
Improving Incentives for the Private Sector
•

Telecommunications and Postal Sector Reform. Through the project, the Bank
(approved 17/12/2002, US$4.48 million) is assisting Samoa to improve the performance
of its telecommunications and postal sectors by increasing competition and private sector
participation; strengthening institutional and regulatory capacities; and enhancing the
provision of telecommunications and postal services, particularly in rural areas. Effective
competition in GSM mobile services, achieved through the project, produced spectacular
results. The number of overall customers (GSM and fixed line) exceeds 60,000, which is
a four-fond increase from the beginning of the project.

•

Private Sector Development. FIAS is currently undertaking a review of Samoa's
Foreign Investment Act, its associated draft regulations, and related legislation. The incountry consultative mission for this process was recently carried out, and a final report is
expected to be presented to Government within the next few weeks. The Private
Enterprise Partnership (PEP) is providing assistance to the Samoa Hotel Association
(SHA) including implementation of Worldhotel-link booking engine for SME hotels and
capacity building and strengthening of SHA. The IFC is assisting the Samoa Venture
Capital Facility, with support of US$400,000.

ANNEX V: SAMOA––RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK10
The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) operations in Samoa started in 1969. Up to 2006,
32 loans totaling $131.0 million for 29 projects and technical assistance totaling
$23.427 million for 82 projects have been provided.
The previous Country Strategy and Program Update (CSPU) 2005–06 for Samoa aimed to
enhance access to, and quality of, basic social services by (i) improving access to, and quality
of, education; (ii) enhancing the environment and public health of Apia (water and
sanitation); and (iii) meeting the growing power demand with improved efficiency, viability,
and reliability. Second, the strategy aimed to improve the environment for the private sector
by (i) ensuring sound fiscal and macroeconomic policies; (ii) rationalizing state-owned
enterprises (SOEs), and enhancing their efficiency and effectiveness; and (iii) improving the
institutional and policy framework for the private sector.
An Education Sector Project II was approved in 2005 with AusAID and NZAID co-financing
for a total amount of $30 million. ADB’s approved ADF lending for this project is
$8.06 million. Four TA grants were approved from 2005 for a total of US$1.8 million,
including the latest for preparing the power sector expansion program for US$0.75 million,
approved in May 2006.

ANNEX VI: SAMOA—STATISTICAL ISSUES
A number of significant improvements have been made in the compilation of basic
macroeconomic data in recent years with technical assistance from the Fund, including
through the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC), the Secretariat for the
Pacific Community (SPC) and the Asian Development Bank (AsDB). These improvements,
as well as the timely release of core data, make statistical coverage broadly adequate for
surveillance purposes. Statistics in Samoa compare well with those available in other Pacific
Island countries. National accounts and government finance statistics (GFS) are the
responsibility of a special statistics unit within the Treasury, while balance of payments and
financial statistics are the responsibility of the Central Bank. The Statistics Department
compiles the CPI and monthly merchandise trade statistics based on Customs records.
However, there is a possibility that national accounts and GFS statistics may move to an
independent Statistics Department in the near future. Samoa has not yet participated in
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). However, the first draft GDDS metadata was
compiled in 2006 with the technical assistance of PFTAC.
Real sector
Real sector data reported to STA for publication in the International Finance Statistics (IFS)
include CPI, values of exports and imports, an index of manufacturing production and GDP
volume at 1995 prices. The CPI was rebased in 2005 based on the results of the 2002
Household Income and Expenditure Survey. Both Headline and underlying CPI are released
monthly.
Quarterly and annual GDP estimates are prepared on a production basis (broken down by the
standard industrial classification (SIC)) and are compiled in both nominal and real terms.
Estimates are available around three months after the end of each quarter. Sources of
agricultural and trade data have all improved following the 2002 Agricultural Survey and the
use of Customs data to estimate exports and imports. However, there remains an
inconsistency in the treatment of the activity of the automotive parts plant between the
national accounts and the balance of payments which is still unsolved. National accounts are
not currently compiled on an expenditure basis, but the authorities expressed their intention
to report expenditure-side estimates within the next two years.
Quarterly employment and average earnings statistics are compiled and published annually,
utilizing National Provident Fund (the compulsory pension fund) records, although the
authorities intend to publish employment on a more frequent basis in the near future.
Government finance statistics
Government finance statistics (GFS) based on the 1986 GFS manual are published quarterly.
Data quality is hampered by difficulties in the misclassification of accounts, particularly net

14

lending and external grants, and current and development expenditure. The underlying
budgetary system is not coded to GFS headings. The authorities are planning, with the
assistance of PFTAC, to move to GFSM 2001 (but on a cash basis) over the next two years.
Samoa does not report government finance statistics to STA for publication in the IFS or the
GFS Yearbook.
Monetary and financial statistics
Comprehensive monetary sector data are published monthly in the Selected Economic
Indicators and quarterly in the Central Bank of Samoa Bulletin. Data for the accounts of the
Central Bank of Samoa (CBS) and deposit money banks along with interest rates are reported
to STA for publication in the IFS on a regular and timely basis. A transition plan to move to
the standardized report form (SRF) has been developed with technical assistance from
PFTAC. The initial report in SRF was expected in November 2006, but has been delayed. An
expert from PFTAC is expected to visit Samoa within a year to provide technical assistance
on monetary statistics.
Monthly data are published on the lending activities of other credit institutions. No data on
offshore financial institutions, supervised by the Samoan International Finance Authority, are
published.
Balance of payments statistics
Annual and quarterly balance of payments data are regularly published in the quarterly CBS
Bulletin and annual data are reported for publication by the Fund in the IFS and Balance of
Payments Statistics Yearbook. The transition to the BPM5 methodology was finalized in
2005 with the assistance from PFTAC. While most current account estimates are fairly
comprehensive, service exports classified as export processing (principally automotive parts
manufactures) is considered under-reported. The data published for direct investment may
also be under-reported, although the authorities are implementing a direct investment survey
to address this. Official reserves have, since 2005, been compiled in a standard manner.
Cooperation
In recent years, PFTAC has provided technical assistance in order to improve the quality of
statistics; the latest mission was in 2006. An expert from PFTAC is expected to visit Samoa
within the next year to provide technical assistance in monetary statistics. Also, PFTAC
plans several missions on the GFS, balance of payments statistics and or the national account
statistics in 2008. The SPC and AsDB have also provided assistance with surveys, national
accounts and the CPI. Fund and PFTAC staff have recommended closer coordination
between the CBS, the Statistics Department and the Treasury Department (the agency
responsible for compiling external debt statistics, grant aid, and other international
transactions of the government) to improve the overall quality of economic data.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with Samoa
On May 18, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
2007 Article IV consultation with Samoa.1
Background
Samoa has achieved a major economic transformation over the last decade and a half. Real per
capita GDP has increased by over 3 percent per year on average, and external public debt has
fallen below 40 percent of GDP. The external position benefited from the rapid growth of
remittances and tourism receipts. This performance owes to a broad-based reform program
initiated in the early 1990s. These achievements have entitled Samoa to graduate from Less
Developed Country (LDC) status.
Macroeconomic conditions continue to be good. After a strong performance in 2004/05, real
GDP growth decelerated to 1¾ percent in 2005/06 on account of a slowdown in the
manufacturing sector. The rest of the economy, especially tourism and commerce activities,
have however remained vibrant. For 2006/07, real GDP growth is expected to accelerate to
3 percent. Inflationary pressures, despite a recent pick up in headline inflation reflecting
increases in tax rates, remain muted.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
The external position remains strong. In 2005/06, Samoa’s balance of payments came under
pressure as the fiscal situation deteriorated following a raise in civil servants wages and
spending related to the restructuring of the national airline, and private sector credit growth
accelerated. However, given the subsequent tightening of fiscal and monetary policies, the
external position has recovered, with reserves rising to about 3½ months of imports.
Since 2005, there has been important achievements in the program of structural reforms. The
international operations of government-owned Polynesian Airlines have been restructured into a
joint venture with a foreign airline. This has helped reduce airfares to Samoa by around half,
resulting in a significant increase in tourist arrivals, and removed a financial burden to the
budget. Similarly, the deregulation of the mobile telecommunications sector has triggered a
sizable fall in calling costs.
At the same time, progress has been made in other areas. Governance of public enterprises
has been strengthened, thanks in part to the introduction of business plans. The operations of
the national pension fund have also improved following a strengthening of the lending
guidelines. Finally, consultations with the public in order to promote the economic use of
customary land have begun.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors congratulated the authorities on Samoa’s impressive growth performance
and economic transformation over the past decade, with Samoa now set to graduate from least
developed country status. Nonetheless, they cautioned that Samoa remains a small, remote,
and vulnerable economy, and welcomed the authorities’ intentions to address these
vulnerabilities by maintaining macroeconomic stability and promoting further structural reforms
in the years ahead.
Directors urged the authorities to maintain their prudent fiscal policy stance. With revenue
collection already relatively high, they suggested that expenditure restraint would be most
effective in dealing with potential fiscal pressures, including from natural disasters, the aging
population, or possible reductions in aid flows as Samoa graduates from LDC status. Directors
emphasized that spending restraint will place a sharper focus on the need to prioritize
expenditure for education, health, and infrastructure.
Directors supported efforts toward a stronger monetary policy framework. While recognizing the
constraints of the small size of the financial sector, they observed that the medium-term
development of interbank markets would help the central bank in its conduct of monetary policy,
as well as advance financial sector development.
Directors supported Samoa’s current basket peg exchange rate regime. They noted that the
regime has provided a credible nominal anchor and contributed to low inflation. Directors
agreed with the recommendation that increased reserve holdings would help cushion the
economy against external shocks.

3
Directors welcomed the recent reforms of the public enterprise sector. The restructuring of
Polynesian Airline’s international services has resulted in a large fall in air fares and boosted
visitor arrivals. Similarly, the introduction of competition into the mobile telecommunication
sector has brought about a significant fall in calling costs. Directors noted that additional
benefits are likely to follow also reforms in other utility and infrastructure areas, such as
electricity provision.
Directors noted that continuing the wide-ranging reform effort is important for maintaining high
and sustainable medium-term growth. They were encouraged by the government’s plans to
make the leasing of customary land easier, accelerate their privatization program, improve
further the business climate, and strengthen the management and accountability of public
enterprises.
Directors welcomed significant improvements in the supervision of both domestic and offshore
banking sectors. All offshore banks have now established a physical presence, and on-site
examinations of credit risk management and assessments of anti-money laundering and
combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) have been conducted at domestic banks.
They looked forward to the further strengthening of the AML/CFT framework under the new
legislation.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's views and
analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or countries) concerned, PINs
are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with member countries, of its surveillance
of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member
countries with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of
general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use
the free Adobe Acrobat Reader to view this pdf file) for the 2007 Article IV Consultation with Samoa is also
available.
