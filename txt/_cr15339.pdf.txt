IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Mali, Completes
Fourth Review under the Extended Credit Facility Arrangement, and Approves
US$5.5 Million Disbursement
On December 2, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 and completed the fourth review of Mali’s
performance under an economic program supported by a three-year Extended Credit Facility
(ECF) arrangement. The Board’s decision enables the disbursement of SDR 4 million (about
US$5.5 million), bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to SDR 22 million
(about US$30 million).
In completing the review, the Executive Board approved the authorities’ request for the
modification of the performance criterion on non-concessional external borrowing in light of
the new policy on debt limits that became effective in June 2015. The Executive Board
approved the ECF arrangement for Mali on December 18, 2013 for SDR 30 million (about
US$41 million), see Press Release No. 13/524).
The program performance through June was strong, with all performance criteria and most
structural benchmarks met. The 2016 program features a somewhat higher fiscal deficit
compared to 2015 to allow for increased public investment and reconstruction spending. The
program’s structural component incorporates measures to support continued revenue growth,
strengthen public financial management, and promote good governance.
Mali’s recovery has entered its third year. After a 7 percent spurt in 2014, reflecting a return
to more normal levels of agricultural production and a strong pickup in manufacturing,
growth is moderating in 2015, but is projected to remain robust in the near term (at over
5 percent). The external current account is projected to strengthen in the near term but would
weaken thereafter, mainly as a result of less favorable terms of trade. Robust public capital
inflows and foreign direct investment should allow Mali to finance these deficits and even
slightly strengthen its imputed international reserve position. The overall fiscal deficit is
expected to remain contained in the near term and decline over the medium term, keeping
nominal public debt below 40 percent of GDP. Tax collections are expected to continue

strengthening, with revenue gains allowing to create space to accommodate higher public
investment and social spending.
Following the Executive Board’s discussion, Mr. David Lipton, Deputy Managing Director
and Acting Chair, made the following statement:
“The Malian authorities have continued to take necessary steps to ensure that the goals
established under their Fund-supported program are achieved. Program performance through
June was solid, enabling the authorities to strengthen their fiscal program for 2015. The
program for 2016 allows for a somewhat higher, but still moderate, fiscal deficit to
accommodate increased capital spending and reconstruction needs. This is expected to be
accompanied by continued robust GDP growth, although the challenging security situation
represents a risk to the economic outlook.
“The turnaround in tax revenue growth observed in 2015 is particularly welcome, and
follows various measures taken by the Ministry of Economy and Finance early in the year.
Higher tax revenue, together with improvements in the quality and efficiency and spending,
is key to creating additional space to finance infrastructure and social expenditure to support
growth and poverty reduction. However, going forward, it would be important that further
increases in revenue rely on broadening the tax base, including through the reduction of large
exemptions.
“The authorities’ continued efforts to strengthen public financial management are also
welcome. Further improvements in this area are important to support overall fiscal discipline
and help the adequate use of public resources.
“Fiscal decentralization should help improve accountability over public spending, and
provide increased support to Mali’s less-favored regions. It is important that this is
implemented gradually and that adequate transparency and accountability mechanisms are
put in place to help ensure that resources transferred to local governments are well-used.
“Reforms aimed at improving the business environment are key to boosting Mali’s economic
prospects. The authorities’ agenda under their Fund-supported program targets areas with
documented weaknesses. Progress in these areas, notably in improving governance and
lightening the administrative burden for taxpayers, is crucial to raising growth and
employment, and ultimately to reducing poverty.”

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities for the recent strong macroeconomic
performance featuring robust economic growth, low inflation, and a sustainable fiscal
position. While the economic outlook is favorable, Directors also pointed to key downside
risks, particularly those stemming from Mali’s still fragile security situation. They welcomed
the recent peace agreement between the government and rebel groups, but noted that the
recent tragic events in Bamako underscore the need for continued efforts to strengthen
security with support from the international community.
Directors commended the authorities for their commitment to policies aimed at safeguarding
macroeconomic stability and fostering inclusive economic growth. In particular, they
supported the efforts to increase tax revenue mobilization and improve the quality and
efficiency of spending in order to create space for basic infrastructure and social
expenditures. They concurred that additional revenue mobilization should take place through
broadening the tax base and reducing exemptions. Directors also encouraged the authorities
to step up ongoing efforts to strengthen public financial management to support the adequate
use of public resources while maintaining sound public finances. A cautious approach to
taking on additional non-concessional financing will further ensure the preservation of debt
sustainability.
Directors supported the authorities’ plans to move gradually with fiscal decentralization with
the goal of improving the accountability over spending while increasing support for lessfavored regions in the country. They underscored that this process should be phased in
tandem with an increase in the administrative and absorption capacity of local governments,
and be accompanied by adequate transparency and accountability mechanisms.
Directors emphasized that boosting long-term sustainable growth will require diversifying
Mali’s sources of growth and export base through reforms to improve infrastructure,
education, and the business environment. Private sector activity and investment would be
facilitated by better regulation, lower labor taxation, increased labor force participation,
particularly by women, and improved governance.
Directors called on the authorities to continue their efforts to address weaknesses in the
financial sector to help promote financial inclusion, stability, and growth. This includes
cleaning up the balance sheets of banks with high NPL levels, reducing credit concentration
on a few large borrowers, and strengthening the microfinance sector. Directors welcomed
the authorities’ plans to restructure the Malian Housing Bank, which should reduce fiscal
risks and make the institution attractive to private investors. They also called for continued
work on strengthening the AML/CFT framework.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION,
FOURTH REVIEW UNDER THE EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY
ARRANGEMENT, AND REQUEST FOR MODIFICATION OF A
PERFORMANCE CRITERION
KEY ISSUES
Context. The political situation stabilized somewhat during the first half of 2015. A new
government was appointed in January, with a mandate to implement sound public
financial management after the governance lapses of 2014. In June, the government
signed a peace agreement with rebel groups, involving more decentralization and the
implementation of development projects in the North and other parts of the country.
However, the security situation remains fragile, with continuing attacks by jihadist
groups, especially in the North. There have also been attacks in the South, including a
deadly one in Bamako targeting expatriates in March. On the economic side, the
recovery has entered its third year, and growth is projected to remain robust in the near
term.
Article IV discussions. Discussions focused on creating space for priority spending,
boosting long-run economic growth, and strengthening the financial system. Increasing
tax revenue and improving the efficiency and quality of public spending are key to help
finance large infrastructure, social, and human capital needs while maintaining healthy
public finances. Addressing such needs is required to raise long-run economic growth
and reduce poverty in a context of high population growth. Reducing labor taxation and
improving governance would also help foster growth, employment, and poverty
reduction. In the financial sector, it is important to reduce credit concentration on a few
borrowers and the high level of non-performing loans while consolidating and
strengthening supervision of the micro-credit sector.
Program implementation. Program performance through June was strong, with all
performance criteria and most structural benchmarks met. The fiscal program for 2015
has been strengthened, mainly to reflect higher tax revenue. The 2016 program allows
for a higher fiscal deficit to accommodate increased capital spending and reconstruction
needs. The program’s structural component incorporates measures to support continued
revenue growth, strengthen public financial management, and promote good
governance. The authorities request modification of the performance criterion on nonconcessional external borrowing in light of the new policy on debt limits.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
1.
Political and security context. The political situation stabilized somewhat during the first
half of 2015. In January, the President appointed a new government, with a mandate to implement
sound public financial management after the governance lapses which delayed the first and second
reviews of the ECF arrangement. In June, the government signed a peace agreement with armed
rebel groups, involving more decentralization and the implementation of regional development
projects, not only in the north but also the in south of the country. The government is preparing a
strategy to give coherence to such projects, following the needs assessment conducted jointly with
multilateral developments banks (MDBs). Meanwhile, the security situation remains fragile, with
continuing guerilla attacks on the UN force (MINUSMA) and the Malian army by jihadist groups
mainly in the North. There has also been activity by armed groups in the South, including in in
Bamako, where a terrorist attack claimed six victims in March.
2.
After an unusually strong performance in 2014, growth is projected to decelerate in
2015–16, but should remain robust. After reaching 7.2 percent in 2014, thanks mainly to a record
harvest, real GDP growth is projected to slow to about 5 percent in 2015. Agricultural outqut is
expected to expand as more land is coming under cultivation and thanks to good rainfall, but
manufacturing growth should soften. For 2016, growth is expected to rise to 5.4 percent, driven
partly by higher public investment and strong donor support. Growth should remain above trend
through 2018 on account of the ongoing rebound from the 2012/13 crisis, and then fall back to
trend (about 4.5 percent). Inflation in 2015 is expected to rise slightly to 2.1 percent (0.9 percent in
2014), driven by food, and remain below the regional ceiling of 3 percent in coming years. The
recent depreciation of the CFA franc against the US dollar (which reached 13 percent during the year
ending in September) appears to have had limited effects on domestic consumer prices.
3.
The external current account is projected to strengthen in the near term, but weaken
over the medium term, mainly as a result of less favorable terms of trade. The current account
deficit is projected to decline to 2.8 percent of GDP in 2015 (5.5 percent of GDP in 2014)—
significantly lower than previously anticipated—driven largely by lower oil prices and higher
volumes of gold exports. However, the deficit is projected to rise to close to 4 percent of GDP in
2016 and continue to weaken in subsequent years as terms of trade deteriorate and gold output
declines. The deficits are expected to be financed by public capital inflows and foreign direct
investment, in amounts that should still allow a slow improvement in Mali’s imputed international
reserve position at the regional central Bank (BCEAO).
4.
Monetary conditions remain supportive of economic activity. Commercial banks have
continued to take advantage of the BCEAO’s accommodative policy, and expanded credit to the
private sector. Credit growth stood at 17.7 percent (year-on-year) in June 2015, after reaching
19 percent in 2014. The BCEAO’s policy has also allowed local banks to finance purchases of Mali’s
and other WAEMU countries’ government paper. The depreciation of the CFA franc against the US
dollar might also support economic activity, although likely in a limited fashion only owing to Mali’s
export structure (with its reliance on gold and cotton) and little-diversified economy.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALI

5.
The overall fiscal balance is projected to remain contained. On a payment order basis,
the overall deficit is expected to narrow to 2.5 percent of GDP in 2015 (4.3 percent of GDP on cash
basis as the float is paid off and domestic arrears are reduced), reflecting increased tax collections,
notably from fuel, as the authorities have taken advantage of the drop in import petroleum prices to
remove the implicit subsidy without affecting retail prices. The deficit would rise to slightly above
3 percent of GDP in 2016–17 to accommodate higher capital spending—partly to support the Peace
Accord—before being reduced to the WAEMU convergence criterion of 3 percent of GDP from
2018. This trajectory would be consistent with keeping nominal public debt below 40 percent of
GDP (or below 25 percent of GDP in NPV terms) over the medium term.

6.
Bank financial soundness indicators appear to have improved somewhat over the last
year, although non-performing loans remain high. The latest available data (March 2015) show
that banks have strengthened their capital, which remains well above the relatively low regional
required minimum (8 percent, Table 8). Non-performing loans (NPLs) have experienced a slight
decline over the last year, but still represent 17 percent of total loans and are not fully provisioned.
About 30 percent of NPLs date back to more than ten years ago, and are concentrated in three
banks, including the state-owned Malian Housing Bank (BHM), which is in the process of being
restructured (paragraph 19). Bank liquidity also rose in the year ending in March 2015, partly
reflecting the BCEAO’s accommodative monetary policy stance.1 Bank profitability looks adequate.
7.
The macroeconomic outlook is subject to several risks (Box 1). In the event the current
Peace Accord does not lead to a permanent improvement in the fragile security situation, there may

dependence on gold and cotton exports (60 and 13 percent, respectively) leaves Mali’s balance of
payments—and, to a lesser extent, its public finances— exposed to fluctuations in international
commodity prices. Although the new government has made progress in addressing some of the
weaknesses in public financial management, new lapses could dampen consumer and business
confidence, discourage donors, and drag down growth. Changes to the global environment, in
particular lower growth in Europe and China, could have a moderate impact on Mali’s growth and
external sector. Given Mali’s limited financial integration with the rest of the world, the impact from
tighter global financial conditions would be low, and so would the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar
(see paragraph 4). Further declines in oil prices would benefit Mali, which is fully dependent on
imports for its petroleum needs.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
8.
Focus of the Article IV consultation. In addition to the outlook and downside risks, the
discussions focused on the following issues: (i) creating fiscal space for priority spending that will
foster growth and employment; (ii) boosting the growth potential of the economy, given the results
of the assessment of the structural transformation of the economy; and (iii) strengthening the
stability of the financial system. There was broad agreement between the authorities and staff on
the economic policies required to address these issues.
9.
Implementation of recommendations of 2012 Article IV consultation (Box 2). Overall,
the authorities’ policies in the fiscal policy area have been in line with recommendations during the
2012 Article IV consultation. Fiscal discipline has been maintained—including in the face of difficult
circumstance following the suspension of donor support in 2012—and underpinned by the current
ECF-supported program during the last two years. Progress has also been made on tax policy and
administration reform, as well as on improving cash-flow management. Energy reforms have also
advanced through the elimination of fuel subsidies; in the electricity sector, there has recently been,
in effect, a reduction in subsidies as the authorities have not passed lower fuels costs to consumers,
but—absent an increase in tariffs—significant untargeted subsidies remain. Progress on financial
sector reform has been modest thus far, although there are concrete plans to restructure BHM (see
paragraph 19).

A. Creating Space for Priority Spending
10.
The authorities and staff concurred that increasing tax revenue was key to financing
priority spending while maintaining fiscal sustainability. Mali has large gaps in the infrastructure
and social sectors that need to be addressed to support inclusive long-run economic growth and
reduce poverty. To help finance these needs while maintaining healthy public finances, the
authorities plan to continue raising the tax revenue ratio to reach 18 percent of GDP by 2017—three
percentage points up from its 2014 level. The authorities recently raised taxes on financial
transactions and telecommunication. By keeping retail prices constant, the drop in import prices for
petroleum products turned into a windfall for the treasury to the tune of 0.8 percent of GDP in 2015.
With the support of FAD,2 they have been strengthening tax and customs administration to broaden

Policy and Administration and in Managing National Resource Wealth (TTFs-TPA and NRWM).

MALI

the base and increase compliance, although with mixed success thus far. Staff argued that the
incentive system for tax and customs inspectors, especially the sharing in penalties (just raised to
45 percent for tax inspectors), had potentially distortionary effects and discouraged the adoption of
reforms favoring voluntary self-declarations combined with risk-based controls for a maximum
number of tax payers. Going forward, the authorities agreed that efforts are needed to further
bolster revenue administration (MEFP, paragraphs 22 and 26).3 Particularly important is the gradual
reduction in tax exemptions, which amounted to 4 percent of GDP in 2014. A new automated central
registry should help facilitate this. The authorities also concurred that the level of taxation of
petroleum products was now appropriate and that future movements in international prices should
be passed to consumers in a symmetrical fashion. The authorities target raising tax revenue to
20 percent of GDP over the medium term, as required by WAEMU commitments.
11.
Spending reprioritizing may also help meet peace-related needs in the near term. To
this effect, the authorities will exploit any scope for expenditure reallocation to cover security and
humanitarian needs. However, this may not suffice and a slower fiscal consolidation in 2016–17 may
be appropriate, with the overall deficit rising somewhat above 3 percent of GDP. The authorities
would bring the deficit to 3 percent of GDP by 2018 (which would imply a basic deficit of zero) to
meet the WAEMU convergence criterion and consistent with maintaining fiscal sustainability. This
fiscal stance would allow providing better support to the implementation of the Peace Accord and
higher capital spending, while avoiding the crowding out of private investment. Strengthening the
public expenditure chain from budget preparation to expenditure payment, as envisioned under the
ECF arrangement,4 should also help improve the quality of expenditure and improve its efficiency
while helping avoid the accumulation of arrears.
12.
Staff supported ongoing efforts to strengthen public financial management. With
technical assistance from FAD, AFRITAC, and donors, the authorities are improving public financial
management, including budget preparation and execution, treasury management, and public
procurement (MEFP, paragraphs 30, 33, 35, and 38). Against this background, the authorities have
continued to consolidate the cash held by government agencies in commercial banks into the
treasury single account at the central bank, which should help improve cash management and
reduce borrowing costs (MEFP, paragraph 45). With technical support from the World Bank, they
have adopted a new public procurement code. The government is also putting in place measures to
bolster budget transparency and improve the presentation of Mali’s fiscal accounts, including by
adopting a presentation based on the 2001 Government Finance Statistics Manual from 2016
onward (MEFP, paragraph 41).

3

The measures the authorities are planning comprise: (i) increasing the compliance with VAT, currently estimated at
only 50 percent for large and medium-size taxpayers; (ii) implementing multidisciplinary audits of tax returns,
customs duties and government procurement to widen the tax base and identify companies which underreport their
income (estimated to have a large revenue cost); (iii) enlisting specialized firms to audit the tax returns of mining
companies; and (iv) bringing the Mining Code up to current international standards.

13.
The government is moving gradually on fiscal decentralization. The Peace Accord
between the government and the rebel groups in the North (paragraph 1) aims for a transfer of
30 percent of government revenue by 2018 to the country’s 8 existing regions and the new regions
which will be created (see SIP on Fiscal Decentralization in Mali and Lessons from International
Experience, chapter III). Currently, the central government transfers about 12 percent of budget
revenue to local governments and, in addition, spends at a local level the equivalent of about
8 percent of budget revenue (decentralized resources).5 The authorities plan to help achieve the
30-percent transfer objective partly by reassigning to the newly empowered regions staff currently
“decentralized”. While acknowledging the commitments under the peace agreement and the need
to foster a higher level of development in the North and other less developed regions, the
authorities stressed the importance of building administrative capacity and expenditure control at
the local level to ensure expenditure quality—in line with the recommendations from recent FAD
technical assistance.6 They underscored that this would require the transfer of additional resources
to the regions to take place gradually, which would also help ease the burden on the public finances
and preserve fiscal stability.

B. Building the Foundations for Higher and More Inclusive Growth
14.
Growth in Mali has been relatively low and volatile over the past twenty years. (See
Selected Issues paper, chapter I, on “Growth, Structural Transformation, and Diversification in Mali”).
Despite a lower starting level of income per capita, Mali has grown more slowly on average over the
past two decades relative to the average for Sub-Saharan Africa. The majority of Mali’s population is
employed in low-productivity agriculture and the secondary sector is underdeveloped. Further
structural transformation and diversification of output and exports could yield significant growth
dividends. Improving the business environment should be a key policy priority; along with boosting
agricultural productivity (possible measures include liberalization of the cotton sector, increasing
support for agricultural R&D, increasing land cultivation of semi-arid agriculture, increasing
production of export-competitive products, and improving management practices of land and
water). With half of the population being less than 15 years old and the population set to double in
the next 25 years, the demand for public services and jobs will increase strongly. The authorities are
aware that meeting this demand will require steadfast progress in domestic resource mobilization,
public financial management, and other structural reforms to promote private sector development
and job creation.

Improving infrastructure and increasing human capital are key to raising long-run
economic growth. The authorities agreed on the need to address structural weaknesses which
hinder the development of new economic activities, such as the lack of infrastructure, electricity
shortages, inadequate education and training, limited access to finance, underdeveloped trading
networks, a malfunctioning labor market, and poor regulation. While the evidence is mixed
concerning the success of industry-focused measures, there seems to be scope for targeted
measures in agriculture, such as increased irrigation, better use of fertilizer, and the use of
motorized equipments. This is especially important given Mali’s potential for a large increase in the
land area under cultivation. These measures could make a substantial difference to growth and
poverty reduction, given the large scope for increasing productivity in agriculture and the high share
of agricultural employment in Mali.
16.
High labor taxation is a drag on formal sector employment and overall economic
growth. (See Selected Issues paper, Chapter III, on “Labor Income Taxation and Its Implications in
Mali”). Staff stressed the need to reduce the high tax wedge to boost formal employment by
reducing the number of taxes levied on labor income and shifting the tax burden away from it. The
authorities were concerned about the
revenue loss that lower labor taxation
would entail and were not prepared to
move in this direction in the near term.
Staff argued that short-term revenue
losses would be manageable under
plausible scenarios: lowering the tax
wedge by one third, for example, would
bring it close to Senegal’s level and
reduce tax revenue by 0.5 percent of
GDP. However, this revenue loss would
be reduced as more labor shifts from the
informal to the formal sector in response
to lighter taxation. Any residual loss
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 11

MALI

would be covered by intensifying revenue mobilization—including via reduction of exemptions—as
envisaged under the program or greater reliance on indirect taxation (see MEFP, 21–15).
17.
Staff also pointed to the potential benefits from increasing women’s participation in
the labor market in terms of boosting growth and reducing gender inequality and poverty.
(Please see Selected Issues paper, Chapter I, “Growth, Structural Transformation, and Diversification
in Mali”). It noted that measures that can help reduce gender inequality (e.g., education and
increased access to contraception), might also help promote the structural transformation of the
economy and harness the demographic dividend. There is thus a case for the government to focus
their efforts on them.
18.
Improving governance can produce high economic dividends. (See Selected Issues
paper, on the Economic Benefits of Reducing Corruption, Chapter II). Governance indicators in Mali
generally weakened over the 2007–13 period, including relative to peers in the region. If they had
not, Mali could have enjoyed 0.7 percentage points more annual growth over that period. While
these are broad, illustrative estimates, there is little doubt that reducing corruption can yield
significant growth dividends in Mali. In that respect, the mission encouraged the authorities to
continue pushing forward with the implementation of the strategy to address corruption contained
in the ECF arrangement.7 This includes initiatives such as publishing regular reports on remedial
measures taken in response to the findings of the Auditor General’s reports; implementing the asset
declaration system prescribed by the 2014 law against illegal enrichment; and strengthening the
implementation of Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT)
legislation. The authorities were broadly receptive to these recommendations and agreed to the
implementation of the 2014 law
against illicit enrichment as part
of the ECF-supported program
for 2016. Staff also suggested
making public the asset
declarations by high-ranking
government officials (under
current legislation, such officials
are only required to submit
asset declarations to the
Supreme Court). However, the
authorities were not prepared
to commit to this measure at
this point, arguing that overall
Mali was already moving in the
right direction in the area of
promoting good governance, including compared to peers in the region.

C. Strengthening the Financial Sector
19.
The banking system continues to face important risks. Stress tests conducted during the
regional consultation with the BCEAO and the Banking Commission earlier this year indicated that
the concentration of credit on a few large borrowers is the main risk for the stability of the banking
sector.8 At present, this risk remains largely unaddressed. Macro-financial linkages are weak given
the small size of the financial sector. However, serious fluctuations in economic activity, as
experienced in 2012, do affect the financial sector, especially its profitability and asset quality While
bank capital has increased over the last year, there are uncertainties about the valuation of the large
amount of real estate not linked to bank operations in excess of the prudential norm on banks’
balance sheet. Staff recommended that the authorities conduct an assessment of the market value
of these real estate assets in
collaboration with the regional
Banking Commission. Such an
assessment would provide
information to determine
whether banks need more
capital. Banks’ large holding of
real estate is related to the high
NPLs, an important share of
which is accounted for by three
banks, including the stateowned Malian Housing Bank
(BHM). Staff encouraged the
authorities to address this
problem by designing and
implementing a plan to extract
the related NPLs from the
balance sheets of the three banks concerned.
20.
The authorities have plans to restructure BHM, the only state-owned bank remaining
in the country (MEFP, paragraph 55). The authorities have changed their approach to dealing with
BHM, which initially envisaged outright privatization or liquidation. They now envisage BHM’s
restructuring in two stages. In a first stage, to be completed by end-2015, they plan to merge BHM
with the stronger and larger Malian Solidarity Bank (BMS). Besides reducing fiscal risks, the merger
would establish a new entity with a sufficiently-strong balance sheet to attract participation by
private investors in the new bank. In a second stage, the government would divest itself from its
equity stake in this new institution.

of Member Countries (March 2015).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 13

MALI

21.
Staff encouraged the authorities to strengthen the micro-finance sector. The financial
soundness of the micro-finance sector is weak (non-performing loans in the sector stood at
13 percent in March 2015) and its structure is highly fragmented, with over 100 weakly managed
and supervised institutions. Although the sector represents only a small fraction (about 3 percent) of
banking system assets and does not seem to pose a major risk to financial stability, its weakness
undermines confidence by the population in financial institutions and may be a hurdle to raising
financial inclusion, and ultimately to economic growth. The mission encouraged the authorities to
develop and implement a plan to strengthen the stability of the micro-finance sector—in line with
the recommendations of the March 2015 Word Bank developmental FSAP mission—including
closing down weaker institutions and paying off their depositors.

D. External Sector Issues
22.
An external stability assessment suggests that the exchange rate is broadly in line with
fundamentals, but structural competitiveness needs to improve (Annex I). Since the events of
2011–13, Mali’s balance of
payments has been dominated
by flows relating to external
security assistance, with weak
export performance due to
declines in the world gold price.
However, the recent drop in the
world oil price, together with
high levels of aid, is expected to
lead to a temporary
improvement in the current
account balance in 2015. While
the exchange rate appears to
be broadly in line with Mali’s
fundamentals, medium-term
improvements in structural
competitiveness are essential to enable Mali to raise economic growth, diversify its exports away
from gold and contribute to safeguarding external stability of the zone (see paragraphs 14–15, in
Chapter I of the Selected Issues Paper). Qualitative competitiveness indicators point to significant
structural bottlenecks, a challenging business environment and weak governance, implying a large
scope for improvement.
23.
Mali is assessed to be at a moderate risk of debt distress—unchanged from the
previous DSA. (See accompanying DSA Supplement). Debt sustainability is highly sensitive to a
tightening of financial terms, underscoring the importance for the Malian government of continuing
to meet its external financing needs with grants and concessional loans, wherever possible. Debt
indicators are also vulnerable to a reduction in transfers and foreign direct investment and an export
shock stemming from the concentration of exports in gold.

MALI

PROGRAM ISSUES
24.
All quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets for end-June were met,
(Tables 3–5 MEFP, paragraph 8 and Table 1). After underperforming in 2014, owing to
administrative weaknesses at the customs administration and a conflict with importers,9 gross tax
revenue has been back on track since March. The turnaround in tax collections follows actions taken
by the Ministry of Economy and Finance in early 2015. These comprise a change of management at
customs; the introduction of results-based management at the tax and customs administrations; and
the increase in revenue from fuel taxation by utilizing the space created by the lower international
petroleum prices. The authorities are now on track to achieve an increase in gross tax revenue of
1.5 percent of GDP in 2015, as targeted under the program.10 Expenditure at end-June was lower
than programmed, owing mainly to a slow release of budget credits to spending departments.
25.
Except for one, all structural benchmarks for end-June were observed, (MEFP,
paragraph 9 and Table 2). Benchmarks focused on dealing with fuel pricing, and on measures to
increase tax revenue and improve public financial management. By keeping retail prices unchanged,
against the backdrop of lower international prices, the authorities have eliminated fuel subsidies.
They also produced a report on their efforts to improve tax audits. However, a benchmark geared
towards improving the monitoring of import value declarations was missed because the Customs
Administration’s contract with the inspection company does not provide for the production of
monthly reconciliation reports. The government undertakes to amend the contract to obtain
monthly reconciliation reports per declaration from January 2016, and proposes to move the
benchmark to August 2016. The government also prepared a detailed borrowing plan underpinning
the 2015 budget and the 2016 draft budget. The Public Service Audit Office produced its first audit
of secret defense procurement, covering the last quarter of 2014.
26.
Fiscal policy in 2015 is expected to be tighter than previously envisaged. While revenue
growth this year has remained strong, expenditure has been lower than anticipated, owing mainly to
under execution of the capital budget financed with external resources (paragraph 5). The 2015
program now targets an overall fiscal deficit of 2.5 percent of GDP on a payment-order basis,
compared to the previous target of 3.2 percent of GDP (on a cash basis, the deficit is projected at
4.3 percent of GDP, below the 5 percent of GDP previously targeted) (Tables 3-5, and MEFP
paragraph 7). The basic fiscal deficit would, however, remain at 0.8 percent of GDP.
27.
The fiscal program for 2016 maintains the target for the overall deficit at 3.3 percent
of GDP (MEFP, paragraph 15). The higher deficit from 2016 would be driven by increased capital
9

10

See IMF Country Report No. 15/151 Mali: Third Review under the Extended Credit Facility Arrangement-Staff Report,
paragraph 5.
About half of this increase would stems from higher petroleum taxation because of the very limited pass through
of the decline in international oil prices to retail prices. The remainder comes mainly from tax administration
measure and increases in taxes on financial transactions, telecommunications, alcohol and tobacco.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 15

MALI

spending as the authorities continue their reconstruction efforts while implementing other critical
infrastructure projects. The program targets an increase in tax revenue of about 1 percent of GDP,
supported by the tax measures adopted in the first half of 2015 (higher rates for the financial
transactions, telecommunications and excise taxes) and ongoing efforts to strengthen tax and
customs administration (See footnote 3 and MEFP, paragraphs 21–25 and Table 3). Sustaining these
efforts and reducing current large tax exemptions would maintain revenue growth over the medium
term. The target for the basic fiscal balance has been revised down from zero to -0.9 percent of
GDP, but would remain broadly unchanged from 2015. The downward revision reflects higher
expenditures on security and, in the wake of the Peace Accord, reconstruction, plusan increase in the
share of these expenditures financed with domestic sources. The basic deficit is projected to decline
to zero by 2018 and remain at that level thereafter. The Peace Accord calls for a needs assessment
of the North by the MDBs, which will be the basis for a Special Development Strategy to be
designed by all stakeholders. At the October Paris conference,11 the government appealed to donors
for support; concrete new financing will be incorporated into a revision of the 2016 budget to be
agreed in the context of the fifth program review in March 2016 (MEFP, paragraph 17).
28.
Structural conditionality for 2016 focuses on the need to further increase tax revenue,
improve public resource management, and promote good governance. With this aim, the
program includes several measures to strengthen tax and customs administration, some supported
with technical assistance from the Fund, as well as to progressively reduce tax exemptions (MEFP,
paragraphs 22–27 and Table 4). The program also incorporates measures to strengthen public
procurement, budget practices and process, and transparency (MEFP, paragraphs 30–36, and 57).
29.
The new policy on debt limits has been incorporated into the program. Since Mali
remains at a moderate risk of external debt distress (paragraph 22) and is assessed as having a weak
debt-monitoring capacity, the program includes a performance criterion on the nominal value of
new external non-concessional borrowing and a memorandum item on the nominal value of new
external concessional borrowing, based on the authorities’ detailed borrowing plan and consistent
with fiscal and debt sustainability (Tables 13 and 14). The authorities are requesting modification of
the performance criterion on non-concessional external borrowing to incorporate this change. The
program also incorporates a new structural benchmark for 2016 to improve the capacity of debt
monitoring (MEFP, paragraph 50 and Table 4), focusing on the weaknesses identified in the most
recent Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment and the Debt
Management Performance Assessment (DeMPA). The authorities also plan to strengthen the debt
committee created in 2014 to screen all loans and government guarantees envisaged by line
ministries before submitting them for approval by the Minister of Economy and Finance.

11

The conference, which brought together Mali and its bilateral and multilateral development partners, aimed at
presenting the government’s action plan to implement the June 2015 peace agreement, reinforcing the dialogue
on Mali’s development policies, and underlining the commitment of Mali’s international partners to support the
implementation of the peace agreement.

Program risks. The fragile security situation constitutes the main risk to the program (see
paragraph 7). Other potential exogenous shocks, such as poor weather conditions and a less
favorable external environment, could also affect economic growth and tax collections, threatening
the authorities’ ambitious tax revenue targets. The authorities, however, see considerable space to
increase tax collections by improving revenue administration to broaden the tax base and reduce
evasion, as well as by reducing tax exemptions. They are also prepared to lower non-priority
spending in the event of revenue shortfalls, or in case there is a need to accommodate higher
security spending should security conditions deteriorate.
31.
PRSP implementation review (Box 3). Mali’s growth and poverty reduction strategy builds
on five pillars: peace and security, macroeconomic stability, pro-poor growth, equitable access to
quality social services, and governance. Implementation of the strategy was undercut by the
2012–13 political crisis and the ensuing deterioration in the security situation. Although
macroeconomic stability was maintained during the crisis, this event generated significant output
losses, which were compounded by the 2012 drought. Growth has resumed, but the economic
setback and other dislocations caused by the crisis likely led to an increase in poverty. Although
social spending has continued to increase, defense spending has risen more rapidly as a result of the
crisis, doubling (from 2 to 4 percent of GDP) during 2012–15 and taking resources away from more
productive uses. Little progress has been made in improving governance and corruption has also
been costly to the economy. All in all, three years into its implementation, results from the poverty
reduction strategy have been mixed as assessed against its objectives.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 17

MALI

Box 3. Review of Poverty Reduction Strategy Implementation
Mali’s comprehensive and ambitious agenda for growth and poverty reduction is outlined in Mali’s
third Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (GPRSP–3, 2012–17).1 The strategy builds on five
pillars: peace and security, macroeconomic stability, pro-poor growth, equitable access to quality social
services, and governance. Three years into its implementation, the program’s results have been mixed as
assessed against these broad objectives.
Implementation of the strategy in its initial years has been undercut by the conflict in 2012 and by
deterioration in the security situation in its aftermath. The security situation remains volatile despite the
signing of the Peace Accord in June 2015. Violent confrontations between competing rebel groups have
continued in the North, while the risk of terrorist attacks has spread to the rest of the country, including the
capital Bamako. Finding a lasting peaceful solution to the conflict is urgent and needs to include greater
autonomy for the North along with fiscal decentralization reforms.
Mali has maintained macroeconomic stability. Its efforts, reinforced by the ECF-supported program, have
led to successful completion of three program reviews. The peg to the euro, which serves as the policy
anchor, has been supported by fiscal discipline. General government deficits have been kept in the
sustainable range despite intensifying spending pressures; inflation remains subdued; and the current
account deficit of the balance of payments has narrowed.
The population living in poverty conditions likely increased following the drought in 2012 and the
conflict in the North, reversing the past favorable trend.2 Public spending is broadly aligned with the
poverty reduction strategy but is not well targeted and access to services is generally poor, particularly in the
North. The pro-poor strategy aims to strengthen the agricultural sector and improve education. Public
spending on health, education, and social services has been on a rising trend (in percent of GDP),3 but held
back because of the competing need to improve security. Defense spending doubled between 2012 and
2015, rising from 2 percent of GDP to slightly more than 4 percent of GDP, outstripping social spending
growth.
The recent drop in the international oil prices has helped reduce electricity subsidies and eliminate
petroleum product subsidies, which had benefited non-poor urban residents. As a result, the targeting
of subsidies has improved somewhat relative. To further improve the targeting, the government should
consider introducing a system of direct transfers to the poorest households, while allowing diesel and
gasoline prices to respond automatically to changes in international oil prices.
Progress in improving governance has been slow (see Selected Issues paper, Chapter II, on “Corruption
and Economic Performance in Mali”). Serious lapses in public financial management caused a delay in the
program review set for mid-2014. Businesses point to the obstacles they face, including uneven treatment
from various regulators, and in public tenders. Corruption has a negative effect on much needed reforms,
saps the strength of the private sector, discourages business investment and creates incentives for
companies to operate in the informal economy.

Weak statistical capacity hinders the accurate measurement of poverty and its trends. The last poverty survey is from
2010. The World Bank estimates that the number of poor has likely increased since 2010 (World Bank, Republic of Mali:

STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
Recent macroeconomic performance has been strong, and the outlook is favorable.
The economic recovery following the 2012/13 crisis is in its third year and is expected to continue,
with the economy projected to grow robustly in 2015–17, before it returns to its long-run trend of
about 4.5 percent. Inflation is expected to remain low, and fiscal and external sector deficits are
expected to remain at sustainable levels.
33.
The authorities remain strongly committed to maintaining sound fiscal policy to
safeguard macroeconomic stability and inclusive growth. Staff supports their goal of keeping
the overall fiscal balance at moderate levels. This should allow Mali to adequately respond to priority
spending needs while ensuring public debt sustainability. Staff also supports the authorities’
commitment to mobilize more tax revenue and improve the quality and efficiency of spending. This
is required to create space to finance expenditure on infrastructure and the social sectors to support
long-run economic growth and poverty reduction. Staff encourages the authorities to continue to
strengthen public financial management, which is also key to the adequate use of public resources
and to maintaining healthy public finances while making progress toward meeting development
goals.
34.
Staff supports fiscal decentralization plans and the authorities’ intent to implement
them gradually. As envisaged in the June Peace Accord, fiscal decentralization would involve a
significant increase in the resources transferred to the regional and local governments, including in
the North. The goal is to improve the accountability over spending by bringing the decisions closer
to the affected population while helping less favored regions improve their socio-economic
conditions. It is important that the decentralization process and resource transfer are implemented
gradually and in tandem with an improvement in the administrative and absorption capacities of
local governments to protect the quality and efficiency of expenditure. Putting in place adequate
transparency and accountability mechanisms would also help ensure that transferred resources are
well-used.
35.
Improving infrastructure, education, and the business climate are key to raising longrun economic growth. Mali’s growth record in recent decades does not compare favorably with
that of peers in the region and elsewhere. To improve this record, staff encourages the authorities to
strengthen basic infrastructure (roads, electricity, and irrigation) as well as education and training to
raise human capital. The authorities’ policies to create fiscal space to address priority spending
needs are in this respect a step in the right direction. It is also important that public resources are
spent in a sound and efficient manner, prioritizing projects with the highest social returns.
Strengthening Mali’s business climate, including through better regulation, lower labor taxation, and
an enhanced AML/CFT framework, would help the country raise its long-term economic potential.
Determined implementation of the government’s strategy to address corruption will be important
for achieving these economic dividends. Finally, Mali’s growth strategy will also need to tackle the
challenges posed by rapid population growth for job creation and the provision of public services.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

MALI

36.
It is necessary to address weaknesses in the financial sector. While the recent
improvement in some financial soundness indicators is welcome, risks stemming from the
concentration of bank credit on a few borrowers need to be addressed. It is also important to
reduce the high NPL ratio and find an appropriate solution to this problem by putting in place a
plan to extract NPLs related to real estate assets from the balance sheets of the banks concerned.
Staff encourages the authorities to implement the plan to restructure BHM to reduce fiscal risks and
strengthen its balance sheet to make it attractive to potential private investors. Strengthening the
traditional banking system and the micro-finance sector would help promote financial inclusion and
overall economic growth in Mali
37.
The Malian economy faces several risks. The still-unsettled security situation constitutes
an important risk to the outlook and the ECF-supported program. The authorities would need to be
prepared to reallocate budgetary resources to cover priority needs while protecting the public
finances. Mali’s vulnerability to poor weather conditions and external economic factors, owing to the
economy’s high dependence on agriculture and very few export products, is also a source of risks.
These vulnerabilities can be addressed through the implementation of sound fiscal policies, as well
as policies to diversify Mali’s economy.
38.
Staff supports completion of the fourth ECF review. The program remains on track and
economic policies for 2016 are consistent with the program’s objectives. Staff also supports the
authorities’ request for modification of the performance criterion on non-concessional external
borrowing. It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the 24-month cycle.

Annex I. External Stability Assessment
Since the events of 2011–13, Mali’s balance of payments has been dominated by flows relating to
external security assistance, although underlying export performance has been weak due to declines in
the world gold price and led Mali to run a large current account deficit. But sharp declines in the world
oil price during 2014, together with high levels of aid, are expected to lead to a near term, albeit
temporary, improvement in the balance in 2015. At present, the real exchange rate appears to be
broadly in line with Mali’s fundamentals. But medium term improvements in structural
competitiveness are essential to enable Mali to diversify its exports away from gold and maintain
external stability. Qualitative competitiveness indicators point to significant structural bottlenecks, a
challenging business environment and weak governance, indicating there is much progress that can be
made.

A. External Sector Developments
1.
Mali is a low income country with a significant current account deficit that over the
last decade averaged over 7 percent of GDP (Text Table 1A). The deficit has been mainly
financed by inflows of foreign aid and foreign direct investment (the latter mainly in the gold and
telecommunications sectors).
2.
From 2013, the balance of payments has been dominated by flows relating to external
security and recovery assistance (Figure 1A). Following the instability in Mali’s political and
security situation in 2011–13 and international military intervention in the North in 2013, foreign aid
increased to help strengthen security capacity and the reconstruction effort.1 These flows were
reflected in the current account as imports of military services (and some food and machinery
imports), financed by grants. In addition, the international community committed at the Brussels
Conference in May 2013 to resume aid to Mali to help the country recover from the crisis. They
announced disbursements of US$4 billion over 2013 and 2014, and of that nearly 90 percent was
disbursed.

gold reserves, Mali’s future export
performance will depend crucially
on export diversification. Notwithstanding new, productively viable, discoveries of reserves, Mali’s
gold production is assessed to have peaked around 2002 and is projected to decline secularly in the
medium term. Alongside gold and cotton, other main exports include livestock, mangoes and nuts.
5.
The level of diversification of Mali’s exports is low, both in terms of number of
products and partners. (See the Selected Issues paper, Chapter I, on “Growth, Structural
Transformation, and Diversification in Mali”). Exporting new products, increasing the share of
currently minor export markets, and exporting to new markets should therefore be key policy
priorities to enhance competiveness and medium-term external stability.
6.
The Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) depreciated sharply over 2014 and is now
around its 10 year average level. REER movements in Mali tend to be caused primarily by changes
in the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER); the inflation differential with trading partners is small
and therefore has little impact on the REER. Since Mali is a member of a common currency area
whose currency is tied to the Euro, the significant depreciation of the euro against the US dollar
during 2014 led to a depreciation of Mali’s real effective exchange rate by over 6 percent (Figure 1).
This unwound the gradual appreciation during 2012–14, such that Mali’s real effective exchange rate
is now broadly around its 10 year average level.
7.
The sharp decline in oil prices over 2014–15 will provide a modest boost to the current
account in the near term. Oil prices fell by 43 percent during the course of 2014 from US$105 per
barrel to US$61 per barrel. At end-September 2015, prices were still below the US$50 mark after
further declines this year. Mali is an importer of oil and the bulk of the impact of lower prices on the

36

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALI

current account is expected to be felt in 2015, when oil imports are expected to fall by about 30
percent, equivalent to 2 percent of GDP.

B. Structural Competitiveness
8.
The challenging business environment is a major impediment to improving the
performance of non-gold exports. While the macroeconomic environment is deemed favorable,
Mali’s overall structural competitiveness is ranked low by several survey indicators. Mali’s business
environment is notably hampered by inadequate investor protection, low financial market
development, insufficient access to electricity, difficulties in paying taxes, and low health and
education standards. At the current juncture, the business evironment is also likely to have been
negatively impacted by the security situation.
9.
There has also been a deterioration in survey measures of competitiveness over the
past few years (Figure 3A). Although Mali has taken steps to improve its business environment, a
number of qualitative indicators suggest that Mali’s competitiveness has deteriorated in recent
years. In the World Bank’s Doing Business report, Mali ranks 146 out of 189 countries in 2015, a fall
of three places since the last survey in 2014. Its lowest rankings relate to starting a business: (169)
and trading across borders: (163). The World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index ranks
Mali 128 out of 144 countries in 2014–15, a rise of 3 places since 2013–14 but still far below its
ranking of 115 in 2007-08.
10.
Mali also ranks low on governance measures. Mali’s government effectiveness, as
measured by the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) indicators, has
declined over the last few years but its overall score of 3.4 remains about average for SSA. The
largest deterioration in performance since 2009 has been in the economic management and public
management and institutions categories, the latter of which includes corruption. On the other hand;
however, Transparency International ranks Mali 115 out of 185 countries in its 2014 Corruption
Perception Index, an improved score relative to 2013 (128).

C. Exchange Rate Assessment
An empirical analysis suggests that Mali’s current account deficit and REER are broadly in line with
economic fundamentals. For that, three methodologies were applied from the IMF’s new EBA-lite
toolkit: the current account approach, the real effective exchange rate approach and the external
stability approach (Figure 4A).

Background: new EBA-lite toolkit
11.
The IMF has updated its exchange rate assessment methodology for low income
countries. In 2015, the previous CGER-based toolkit was replaced by the the External Balance

38

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALI

Assessment Lite (EBA-Lite) toolkit.2 EBA-lite builds on the CGER-based approach in three main
regards. First, the analysis concentrates on present day fundamentals, rather than a medium term
perspective, by controlling for cyclical factors. Second, it differentiates between factors under the
control of the authorities (‘policy’ variables) and structural factors. Third, it has wider country
coverage and a better model fit (although it has larger confidence intervals).

The Current Account Approach
12.
The current account approach compares Mali’s actual balance with that of a modelpredicted result, based on the fundamental determinants of saving-investment decisions in
the economy and the policy stance. If the actual and model predicted values are close, this
suggests the current account is largely consistent with fundamentals and desired policies. If they are
far apart, this may be evidence of imbalances in the external accounts, implying the need for a real
exchange rate adjustment.
13.
The EBA-Lite methodology suggests a small undervaluation of Mali’s REER in 2015.
The model uses the 2015 projected value of economic fundamentals to generate a norm of the
current account deficit-to-GDP ratio based on coefficient estimates obtained using a panel
regression on a dataset that includes 190 countries over the 1995–2012 period. Mali’s current
account norm is estimated as a deficit of 7.0 percent, which is larger than the projected underlying
current account deficit in 2015 of 3.3 percent.3 Using a trade elasticity of -0.2, a real appreciation of
about 16 percent would be necessary to allow the underlying current account deficit to approach
the level of the norm.4 The decomposition of this estimate suggests that the norm of a large deficit
is being driven mainly by Mali’s high dependence on aid and remittances (Figure 4).

2

The EBA-lite model uses a similar framework to the External Balance Assessment, but for a wider sample of
countries. See External Balance Assessment (EBA): Technical Background of the Pilot Methodology for more details
on the original model.

3

The projected actual current account balance for 2015 was adjusted for one-off delayed budgetary transfers from
2014 (equivalent to 0.5 percent of GDP).

4

CA elasticity=Export elasticity*Share of exports in GDP-((Import elasticity-1)*Share of Imports in GDP). The
calculation of the trade elasticity of -0.24 for Mali used in this exchange rate assessment is based on the simple
average of two separate estimates of import and export elasticities taken from Tokarick (2010) and Isard and Hamid
(2010).

The External Sustainability Approach
14.
The external sustainability approach compares a country’s current account balance
with its net foreign asset (NFA) position. It determines what level of the CA balance would
stabilize the NFA position at its current level. The approach uses the following equation:

equilibrium NFA-to-GDP ratio, and
Figure 4 summarizes the assumptions for Mali.

40

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALI

15.
The approach concludes that to maintain NFA at its current level, the current account
deficit must remain above historic averages. The NFA ratio in 2015 is projected to be -32 percent
of GDP, thus a net debt position. To prevent this indebtedness from growing, the current account
deficit should not be larger than around -4.8 percent of GDP (Figure 4). The results differ depending
on the assumption about the steady state level of the current account. If the 2015 underlying level
of -3.3 percent of GDP is used, closing the gap with the NFA-stabilising current account would
require a modest real appreciation of 6 percent. If, on the other hand, the underlying level of the
current account is assumed to be the same as the historic average (7.1 percent of GDP), closing the
relatively large gap with the NFA-stabilizing level would require a REER depreciation of 10 percent.
16.
In terms of international reserves, Mali can help strengthen the region’s position.
WAEMU’s (and Mali’s) reserves declined steadily during 2011–13, and despite their partial recovery
in 2014, reserve coverage in the region is below optimal levels estimated by staff in the context of
the WAEMU regional consultation.5 By adhering to its fiscal consolidation plans, Mali can contribute
to increasing WAEMU’s international reserves.

The Real Effective Exchange Rate Approach
17.
In contrast to the previous two methods, the real effective exchange rate (REER)
approach focuses directly on the exchange rate as the dependant variable. It is a reduced form
model (based on the REER regression from the EBA-lite toolkit) and estimates a fitted value for the
real effective exchange rate as a function of a set economic variables that cause persistent
deviations from long-run purchasing power parity, such as terms of trade, productivity, government
consumption, aid, and remittances among others. A norm for the REER is then calculated based on
these fitted values and adjusted for deviations of a countries’ policies from desired levels (such as
level of reserves, fiscal stance, capital account openness and the real interest rate).
18.
The baseline REER model suggests a small currency undervaluation of around
8 percent. This result is driven entirely by terms of trade. In other words, according to the model,
given Mali’s currently favourable terms of trade, its real exchange rate should be slightly stronger.

D. Conclusion
19.
The three empirical approaches suggest a modest undervaluation of Mali’s real
exchange rate in 2015. Both the current account approach and the external sustainability approach
suggest Mali’s current account ‘norm’ is lower than the underlying 2015 balance of -3.3 percent,
indicating a modest real exchange rate undervaluation. Similarly, the real effective exchange rate
approach suggests Mali’s current level of the REER is slightly undervalued relative to its ‘norm’ in
2015.

20.
But the 2015 level of Mali’s current account is boosted by the impact of lower oil
prices and is significantly higher than its historic average. The long run average of Mali’s current
account is around -7 percent, which is also in line with the projected level for the medium term
current account deficit in staff’s debt sustainability analysis. Over time, the current account is likely
to deteriorate gradually as the impact from lower oil prices on import volumes wanes due to
substiution and income effects and gold export volumes decline. If the norm for the current account
balance from the current account approach were compared to an underlying value of -7 percent, the
approach would suggest the real effective exchange rate is at equilibrium. Similarly if -7 percent
were also used as the steady state level of the current account in the external sustainability
approach, the real exchange rate would be assessed as slightly overvalued.
21.
Given the uncertainties in determining Mali’s underlying current account balance,
together with the small magnitude of estimated real exchange rate misalignments, staff’s
best assessment is that Mali’s real exchange rate Mali’s real exchange rate appears to be
broadly in line with fundamentals. The latest External Stability Assessment for the West African
Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) REER came to a similar conclusion.6
22.
Maintenance of external stability in the medium-term, however, will depend on
successful diversification into other exports as gold production declines. This, in turn, requires
improvements in Mali’s competitiveness. Competitiveness indicators suggest there is great scope for
improving non-price or structural competitiveness. The Malian economy faces serious structural
bottlenecks, such as energy, infrastructure and human resources. While governance indicators
suggest more progress is needed on increasing transparency and reducing corruption. The business
environment can be improved by enhancing access to finance, protecting investors, widening the
tax net and helping tax payers to comply, and raising health and education levels.

Appendix I. Letter of Intent

Bamako, November 9, 2015

Madame Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20431
U.S.A.
Dear Madame Managing Director:
1.
On December 18, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
approved a three-year arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) for Mali in an amount
equivalent to SDR 30 million. The arrangement aims at supporting the government’s policies to
maintain macroeconomic stability and revive growth in 2014–16, with broad-based support from
technical and financial partners for the country’s renewal following the 2012 security and political
crisis.
2.
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) discusses recent
developments in Mali’s economy and progress made in implementing our policies in 2015. As
explained in the MEFP, all performance criteria and indicative targets at June 30 were met as well as
all continuous performance criteria. Four out of five of the measures subject to structural
benchmarks were implemented. In light of the budget execution during the first six months of the
year and since then, the objectives of our budgetary programming for end-2015 approved at the
time of the third review under the ECF arrangement are within our grasp. As a result, the
government requests completion of the fourth review under the ECF arrangement and the
disbursement of the fifth tranche of SDR 4 million. Although negotiations with creditors for nonconcessional loans in the electricity sector are taking longer than envisaged, the government has
decided to keep the non-concessional borrowing ceiling of CFAF 250 billion (USD 425 million)
approved at the time of the third review for 2015 and to carry forward this ceiling to 2016. The
government also requests modification of the performance criterion on non-concessional external
borrowing in light of the new policy on debt limits that became effective in June 2015.
3.
The MEFP also sets out the economic and financial policies for the rest of 2015. Pending the
outcome of the Paris conference of October 22, 2015, where the government presented its strategy
for implementing the Accord for Peace and Reconciliation in Mali (APRM), the government
presented its 2016 draft budget to the National Assembly to implement its program of economic
and financial policies for 2016. With oil taxation remaining at the level recorded during the first

44

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALI

quarter and measures taken to implement results-based management in tax revenue collection
agencies, net tax revenue is set to rise by 1.5 percent of GDP in 2015 and 0.8 percent of GDP in
2016. With these revenue increases and the external aid expected, it will be possible to increase
public spending on our strategies for promoting growth and reducing poverty and on the
implementation of the APRM, while at the same time reducing the budget deficit (cash basis) from
4.3 percent of GDP in 2015 to 3.8 percent of GDP in 2016. In light of the outcome of the Paris
conference, the government will prepare, if needed, at the time of the fifth review under the ECF
arrangement, a draft supplementary budget during the first half of 2016 to take into account the
new expenditure with a view to implementing the specific strategy for development of the Northern
regions.
4.
This MEFP also outlines the other economic and financial policies that the Malian
government undertakes to implement this year in order to maintain macroeconomic stability,
consolidate the economic recovery, step up the implementation of reforms with a view to improving
public financial management, and facilitate private-sector development.
5.
The government believes that the measures and policies set out in the attached MEFP are
appropriate for attaining the objectives of this program and will take any further steps that might be
necessary to that end. It will consult with the IMF on the adoption of such measures prior to any
revision of the policies described in the attached MEFP.
6.
The government will continue to provide IMF staff with any relevant information referred to
in the Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) concerning progress made under the
program.
7.
The government intends to make public the content of the IMF staff report, including this
letter, the MEFP and the TMU attached, and the informational annex. It therefore authorizes the IMF
to publish these documents on its website once the IMF Executive Board approves the fourth review
of the three-year arrangement under the ECF.
Very truly yours,
/s/

Attachment I. Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policies
1.
This memorandum on economic and financial policies (MEFP) presents recent developments
and performance with respect to Mali’s program of economic and financial policies implemented in
connection with the three-year arrangement under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF).1

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN 2015 AND PERFORMANCE WITH
RESPECT TO ECF-SUPPORTED POLICIES
A. Economic Developments in 2015
2.
Real growth is projected at 4.9 percent compared to 5.0 percent expected under the
program, and after an already strong 7.2 percent in 2014. This change reflects a return to normal
after the recovery of growth observed in the primary and secondary sectors in 2014. With good
rainfall and the provision of agricultural inputs at the start of the growing season, agricultural
production is expected to surpass the exceptional level seen in 2014 by roughly 4 percent. In the
secondary sector, production is expected to increase by 2.4 percent. Tertiary sector production is
expected to expand by 6.9 percent, driven by increased activity in the telecommunications and nonmarket services sectors. Consumer price inflation is forecast at 2.4 percent, compared to 0.9 percent
in 2014.
3.
The current account deficit (including grants) is expected to narrow to 2.8 percent of GDP
compared to 5.5 percent under the program and 5.5 percent in 2014. The deficit is expected to
narrow following the sharp decline in petroleum prices since mid-2014. The current account deficit is
expected to be financed entirely by net capital inflows, mainly in the form of foreign aid and foreign
direct investment. As a result, the overall balance of payments should post a surplus of CFAF
8.2 billion (US$14 million), contributing to the accumulation of international reserves by the same
amount at the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO).
4.
The money supply is expected to grow by 13.6 percent, driven by credit to the economy and
to the government.
5.
In the banking sector, the risk-weighted capital ratio increased from 12.7 percent in
December 2014 to 14.7 percent in March 2015. Aided by the government’s efforts to repay arrears
to its suppliers, the stock of past-due credits decreased from 18.9 percent of total credits
(7.6 percent after provisions) in June 2014 to 16.3 percent (6.0 percent after provisions) in June 2015.
The financial stability of the micro-finance sector improved slightly: the share of nonperforming
loans declined from 8.8 percent in 2014 to 8.2 percent at end-June 2015.

6.
Tax revenue recovered during the first half of 2015, returning to program levels despite the
underperformance seen in 2014.2 Net tax revenue totaled CFAF 569 billion, an increase of 22 percent
compared to June 2014. The increase reflects the intention to maintain petroleum taxation at the
high level observed since the start of the year (¶ 23) and efforts to implement results-based
management at the revenue-collecting agencies. Expenditures were substantially below the
programmed level (by 37 percent) due to the low execution rate of capital expenditures. As a result,
the basic deficit3 and overall deficit were below programmed levels. The government took particular
care to ensure that expenditures authorized at end-2014 for which payment was deferred to 2015—
an unusually high total of CFAF 140 billion—were paid in full during the first half of the year, and
that expenditures authorized in 2015 were timely paid. As a result, at end-June 2015, expenditures
pending payment totaled CFAF 8.4 billion. With these efforts, the government intends to prevent
any accumulation of arrears and support businesses' cash flows, thereby helping reduce banks' stock
of nonperforming loans.
7.
The overall fiscal deficit (cash basis, grants included) is programmed at 4.3 percent of GDP in
2015, compared to 5 percent of GDP programmed in 2015 and 2.8 percent observed in 2014. Gross
tax revenue is unchanged with respect to the objectives set for in the 2015 supplementary budget
(Loi de finances rectificative) approved by the National Assembly in June. Projected revenue and
grants totaled CFAF 1407 billion (21.7 percent of GDP), below the programmed level (23.6 percent),
following the downward adjustment of general budget assistance, in light of the status of
negotiations with non-traditional partners, and to project capital expenditures financed from
external resources, in light of the execution rates observed during the first half of the year (¶ 6). The
government undertakes to under-execute domestically financed expenditures relative to the
amounts provided in the 2015 supplementary budget by an amount equal to CFAF 42.6 billion (0.7
percent of GDP) to offset the CFAF 38 billion downward adjustment of general budget assistance
and the upward adjustment of VAT credits to be refunded to mining companies. Accordingly, the
projected basic deficit (CFAF 48.5 billion, or 0.7 percent of GDP) remains unchanged with respect to
the supplementary budget. Despite the concentration of expenditure in the third quarter, the
government undertakes to ensure strict adherence to fiscal rules in the execution of the budget.

B. Performance with Respect to ECF-Supported Policies
8.

All of the performance criteria and indicative targets at end-June 2015 were met (Table 1):



The ceiling on net domestic financing of the government by banks and the financial market
was met. Considering the adjustors provided in the Technical Memorandum of
Understanding (TMU),4 net domestic financing of the government by banks and the financial

The basic budget balance is the difference between total revenue and expenditures under the authorities' direct
control; in other words, revenue (including resources from the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative) plus
grants used for general budget support less current expenditure and domestically financed capital expenditure.

market was exceeded by CFAF 177 billion (US$300 million or 2.7 percent of GDP) due to
early payment of the float of outstanding invoices combined with under-execution of
expenditure during the first half of the year (¶ 6).


The zero ceiling on the cumulative increase in external payment arrears was met.



The ceiling of CFAF 250 billion (US$424 million) on new external loans contracted or
guaranteed by the government on non-concessional terms was met. The government did
not contract or guarantee any non-concessional external loans.



The floor on gross tax revenue was met. Gross tax revenue totaled CFAF 568 billion
(US$964 million), exceeding the program total by CFAF 4 billion.



The floor on the basic fiscal balance was met. Considering the adjustors provided in the
TMU,5 the floor was exceeded by CFAF 30 billion (US$61 million or 0.5 percent of GDP),
largely due to the shortfall in customs receipts and delays in disbursing general budgetary
assistance grants (¶ 6).



The floor on priority poverty-related spending, i.e., domestically financed spending on
education (basic, secondary, and tertiary), scientific research, health, and social development
sectors (excluding transfers to the Malian Social Security Fund (CMSS)) was met. The floor
was exceeded by roughly CFAF 30 billion (US$50 million or 0.5 percent of GDP).

9.
Four out of the five measures defined as structural benchmarks were implemented; a oneyear delay is proposed for the implementation of one measure (Table 2):


The public sector oversight agency (Inspector General of the Public Sector, CGSP) conducted
a compliance audit of contracts covered by the “defense secret” or “essential government
interests” exemptions pursuant to Decree 2014-764/P-RM of October 9, 2014 establishing
procedures applicable to procurements of goods, services, and works exempt from the
public contracts code (¶ 36).



The National Petroleum Products Office prepared a strategy to gradually eliminate the
revenue losses identified in the petroleum products pricing structure (¶ 22).



The Customs Administration (DGD) did not prepare an analysis of monthly reconciliation
reports comparing taxes paid and outstanding per import declaration during the first half of
2015, because its contract with the inspection company does not provide for the production
of monthly reconciliation reports. The government undertakes to amend the contract to
obtain monthly reconciliation reports per declaration as from January 1, 2016. The DGD will
prepare an analysis of monthly reconciliation reports comparing taxes paid and outstanding
per import declaration during the first half of 2016 by August 31, 2016 (new proposed
benchmark, Table 4).

ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES FOR 2016
10.
The 2012–17 Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (GPRSP) adopted in
December 2011; the 2013–18 Government Action Program (PAG) adopted in April 2013; and the
Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation in Mali (APRM) signed in Bamako on May 15, 2015 and
completed on June 20, 2015 serve as reference for the 2016-18 economic and financial policies:


The objective of the GPRSP is to promote strong, sustained growth to significantly reduce
poverty and provide a better standard of living for all Malians.6 The GPRSP is based on five
pillars: (i) strengthening peace and security; (ii) increasing macroeconomic stability;
(iii) promoting stronger, sustainable, pro-poor growth aimed at creating jobs and increasing
incomes; (iv) consolidating the long-term bases for development and facilitating equitable
access to quality social services; and (v) strengthening institutions and governance.



The PAG, prepared through a process involving all the ministries, focuses on six areas:
establishing strong, credible institutions; restoring the security of persons and property
throughout the national territory; implementing a proactive national reconciliation policy;
rebuilding Malian schools; building an emerging economy; and implementing a proactive
social development policy.



The APRM provides for the creation of a Northern Regions Development Zone and the
development of a specific development strategy to bring the northern regions' development
indicators to the same levels as those of Mali’s other regions. The government will prepare
the strategy based on the needs assessment for the northern regions conducted jointly by
the World Bank, the African Development Bank, and the Islamic Development Bank. A donor
conference was held on October 22, 2015 in Paris to establish the Sustainable Development
Fund, which will be the financial instrument for the development strategy.

11.
Despite an uncertain international environment, Mali’s economic outlook appears favorable
in light of the signature of the APRM, the gradual restoration of security, and the support of Mali’s
technical and financial partners (TFP) following the Paris conference. The government’s efforts,
particularly in the agricultural sector, and the re-engagement of TFPs should lead to increased GDP
growth in real terms at 5.4 percent in 2016, 5.1 percent in 2017, and 5.5 percent in 2018 through the
effects on the construction and services sectors. The current account deficit (including grants) is

expected to widen to 3.9 percent of GDP in 2016, in view of the continued economic recovery, and
to be financed entirely by foreign direct investment in the gold and telecommunications sectors and
by external assistance in the form of loans. The overall balance of payments is expected to be close
to equilibrium during 2016-18. The implementation of prudent monetary and fiscal policies is
expected to maintain inflation in line with the community convergence criterion of 3 percent per
year, assuming sufficient rainfall.
12.
The government intends to continue implementing its program to: (i) support growth
through a prudent fiscal policy while giving preference to priority poverty-related spending;
(ii) improve public financial management from the revenue as well as the expenditure side; and
(iii) modernize the business environment to encourage private sector development and improve
competitiveness.

A. Promote Growth through Prudent Fiscal Policy Aligned with the Priorities of
the Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy
13.
The government intends to continue implementing sustainable fiscal policies in accordance
with its commitments as a WAEMU member country. In particular, the government will adopt and
implement a fiscal policy aimed at maintaining the basic fiscal balance close to equilibrium.
Moreover, the government will maintain the overall fiscal balance (including project grants, sector
budget support, and capital expenditure financed from external resources) at a level compatible
with public debt sustainability, as indicated by the debt sustainability analysis conducted annually in
cooperation with International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank staff (¶51), and with the
community convergence criteria of 3 percent of GDP to be met in 2018.
14.
The execution of budget expenditures will reflect the priorities of the GPRSP, the Accelerated
Development Program for the Northern Regions (PDARN), and the PAG (¶10). As proof of its
determination to implement those priorities, the government undertakes to maintain spending in
social sectors above a floor (proposed indicative target, Tables 1 and 3).
15.
In the context of these commitments, the government proposes the following budget
framing in 2016 for its ECF-supported program7:


7

A total of CFAF 1566 billion, or 22.4 percent of GDP, is provided for revenue and grants, of
which CFAF 1222 billion in net tax revenue, or 17.5 percent of GDP, compared to CFAF
1064 billion, or 16.4 percent of GDP, under the 2015 revised program (¶ 7). The framing also
provides for sufficient resources to refund VAT credits (¶ 26).

The budget framing is identical to the framing used as the basis for the 2016 draft budget submitted to the
National Assembly, with one exception: the expenditures financed by grants and project loans are included at
75 percent of the amounts provided in the draft budget in light of the historical execution rates for these
expenditures.

50

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALI



The proposed total expenditure and net loans is CFAF 1786 billion, or 25.5 percent of GDP,
compared to CFAF 1568 billion, or 24.2 percent of GDP, in the 2015 revised program, of
which CFAF 1533 billion, or 22.1 percent of GDP, from domestic resources, compared to
CFAF 1359 billion, and 21.0 percent of GDP, in the 2015 revised program. The composition
of expenditure is aligned with the GPRSP objectives, with 25 percent allocated to
strengthening the education, health, and social sectors; 25 percent to the development of
agriculture, water supply and distribution systems, public works, and urban development;
27 percent for defense and public administration; and 8 percent to development of the
North of the country.8 A provision of CFAF 25 billion is provided to pay the government's
audited domestic arrears accumulated to suppliers during the spending freeze following the
event of March 2012 (¶ 50).



As a result, the target basic fiscal balance is a deficit of CFAF 52 billion, or 0.7 percent of
GDP, compared to CFAF 49 billion, or 0.8 percent of GDP, in 2015. The target overall balance
including grants (cash basis) is CFAF 242 billion (or 3.5 percent of GDP), compared to CFAF
276 billion and 4.3 percent of GDP in 2015.

16.
Pending the results of the needs assessment of the North and the results of the Paris
conference (¶ 10), the draft budget provides for CFAF 116 billion (US$198 million or 1.7 percent of
GDP) to support the implementation of the APRM, distributed as follows:


CFAF 52 billion from domestic resources, of which CFAF 39 billion allocated to the creation
of entities provided by the APRM and development projects, and CFAF 13 billion to fund
emergency measures; and



CFAF 64 billion for investment projects in the transportation, energy, agriculture, and food
security sectors as provided in the APRM, including CFAF 13 billion from domestic resources
and CFAF 53 billion from external resources.

17.
In light of the results of the Paris conference, the government will prepare a supplementary
budget in the first half of 2016, if necessary, to provide for new expenditures to implement the
specific strategy for development of the northern regions.
18.
As provided by the APRM, the government undertakes to transfer 30 percent of budget
revenue to the subnational jurisdictions (collectivités territoriales) by 2018. In 2016, the draft budget
increases the share to 16.7 percent compared to 14.0 percent in the 2015 supplementary budget.
The government plans to attain the 30 percent target by transferring a portion of decentralized
resources (resources déconcentrées), i.e., expenditure by the central government through its regional
and local agencies, which represents 23 percent of budget revenue in the draft budget. Specifically,
8

The effective number of civil servants (excluding members of the army and regional government civil servants) has
fallen by 2 percent between December 2014 and September 2015. This reduction in headcount has coincided with a
4 percent increase in nominal salaries (equivalent to a 3 point fall as a percentage of fiscal revenues). A small
increase in the number of civil servants (1 percent) is expected in 2016, concurrent with a 9 percent increase in
nominal salaries (equivalent to a 1 point fall as a percentage of fiscal revenues).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

51

MALI

the decentralized resources will be transferred by devolving authority for central government
personnel working in the regions to the regional authorities once the regional governing boards
have been elected by universal suffrage.
19.
The investment projects totaling CFAF 5500 billion (US$11 billion or 93 percent of GDP) for
which memoranda of understanding were signed with foreign companies in September 2014 and
regional integration projects in Mali totaling CFAF 1750 billion (US$3.5 billion or 30 percent of GDP),
as presented by the WAEMU Commission in September 2014 in Dubai, are still at the preliminary
study phase and therefore have no impact on the draft budget. Their implications for the public
finances will continue to be analyzed during the preparation of future budget laws. The
implementation of all of the projects will be subject to adherence to the government's commitments
regarding financial sustainability, public debt, and good practices for public financial management
assumed in the context of the ECF arrangement.

B. Improve Public Financial Management
20.
The government will continue to improve public financial management, in particular by
remedying the weaknesses identified by the 2011 PEFA assessment and technical assistance
missions from the IMF Fiscal Affairs Department.

Strengthen revenue management
21.
The government undertakes to increase tax revenue by a minimum of 1 percent of GDP in
2016 by implementing reforms to expand the tax base (performance criterion, Table 2). Specifically,
the government intends to expand the reforms undertaken by the DGI, the DGD, and the National
Directorate of Government Property and Lands (DNDC) and transform the culture of the revenue
collecting units, in particular through ethical standards and performance-based management. In
cooperation with economic partners, the government also intends to undertake efforts to improve
the revenue-collecting agencies’ civic-mindedness in regard to taxes.

Reform tax policy
22.
The government intends to continue to phase out exemptions by implementing the
following measures:
As introduced in the 2013 budget, the inclusion of tables as annexes to the draft budgets
identifying each exemption provided in the General Tax Code, the Customs Code, the
Petroleum Code, the Investment Code, the Mining Code, the law governing property
development, and all other laws or government decisions providing for tax benefits, with the
respective legal basis of the exemption and the implementation date during 2013, 2014, and
the first half of 2015, and the estimated loss of revenue for the government.9



9

In 2013, total tax expenditure resulting from exemptions totaled CFAF 233 billion (US$466 million, or 4.2 percent
of GDP), of which CFAF 162 billion (2.9 percent of GDP) in exemptions for taxes collected by the DGI and CFAF

MALI



Analysis of the central database of tax and customs exemptions to identify the total amount
of exemptions by type of tax and by legal and regulatory source, expiration date,
beneficiaries, and any other relevant information that was finalized in 2014. In 2014, the DGI
identified 452 tax exemptions representing a tax expenditure of CFAF 147 billion
(US$294 million or 2.5 percent of GDP), of which VAT exemptions represented 86 percent;
financial transactions tax (TAF) exemptions, 10 percent; and corporate income tax
exemptions, 4 percent. The tax expenditures by legal basis were as follows: General Tax Code
(CGI), 52 percent; mining codes, 20 percent; ministerial decisions, 18 percent; Investment
Code, 7 percent; specific agreements, 2 percent; public contracts, grants, and externally
financed NGOs, 1 percent. The DGI will produce by February 28, 2016 a memorandum
analyzing the exemptions compiled in the database by type of tax, legal or regulatory basis,
economic sector, and expiration date; and the amount of the exemptions in 2015 for each of
the above categories, identifying options to reduce the expenditures. The DGI will publish on
its website a list of beneficiaries of tax exemptions (including those granted by the DGD), the
duration of the exemptions, and associated tax expenditures for 2015, replacing the name of
the beneficiaries with a unique identifier.



To reduce customs fraud, approach the TFP to propose eliminating the tax exemptions for
projects they finance; in 2014, these exemptions represented CFAF 45 billion (US$91 million,
or 0.8 percent of GDP), of which CFAF 26 billion for the DGI and CFAF 19 billion for the DGD.



Continue efforts to control discretionary exemptions and gradually reduce to a minimum the
exemptions provided under the CGI, the Customs Code, the Investment Code, the Mining
Code, the Petroleum Code, the real property development law, and all other laws or
government decisions providing for preferential tax treatment, beginning with the 2016
budget.



Considering the financial impact of these exemptions, contract the services of a private firm
to audit the amounts and terms under which exemptions were granted from taxes collected
by the DGI and the DGD in 2014 and 2015 by June 30, 2016 (proposed structural benchmark,
Table 4).

23.
To halt the erosion of tax revenue on petroleum products,10 the government is
implementing the following measures:


calculation of retail petroleum product prices based on actual market values of imported
products, as provided by Community’s legislation; determination of the loss of revenue or
71 billion (1.3 percent of GDP) for taxes collected by the DGD. In 2014, the total tax expenditure representing
exemptions totaled CFAF 206 billion (US$351 million or 3.4 percent of GDP), of which CFAF 147 billion (2.4 percent
of GDP) for taxes collected by the DGI and CFAF 59 billion (1 percent of GDP) for taxes collected by the DGD of
which CFAF 37 billion in VAT (US$63 million or 0.6 percent of GDP).

10

Since 2005, tax revenue from petroleum products has declined from 3 percent of GDP in 2005 to less than
1 percent of GDP in 2012. In 2014, they increased to 1.5 percent of GDP. See IMF Country Report No. 14/31. Mali–

potential revenue attributable to setting retail prices below the prices indicated by that
calculation; and publication of this presentation of the price structure;


presentation, in budget laws, of the potential loss of revenue on petroleum products during
the preceding year based on the revenue loss per unit resulting from the price structures, by
main road, product, and liter;11



implementation of a pricing mechanism that ensures that changes in the cost of imported
petroleum products are fully reflected in pump prices within a margin of 3 percent per
month12; implementation of this mechanism could be suspended in the event of successive,
particularly steep increases in petroleum product costs;

24.
The government undertakes to simplify tax laws to reduce to a minimum the administrative
burden of tax returns for operators and tax collection for the DGI. The simplification will involve
taxes assessed on actual income (the ordinary tax applied to large taxpayers and the simplified
version applied to medium-size taxpayers), the alternative minimum business tax (impôt synthétique)
(AMBT) applied to small taxpayers, the tax on wages and salaries, employer contributions, real
property taxes, the tax on securities, and the financial transactions tax. The government will conduct
all relevant preliminary studies and consultations to continue implementing the simplification
efforts. Simplification of the AMBT in the 2015 budget, including replacement of the schedule of
rates with a single rate of 3 percent of turnover, serves as a model in this area. The draft budget
provides for a reduction of VAT prepayments from 12 to 4 for taxpayers who pay the simplified tax
on actual income.
25.
With assistance from the IMF Topical Trust Fund on Managing Natural Resource Wealth, the
government hopes to increase receipts from mining and petroleum resources while improving the
competitiveness of the business environment in Mali. The mining and petroleum codes will be
modernized in light of current international standards. The government submitted a new Petroleum
Code which was promulgated in July 2015. It will introduce amendments to the Mining Code by
end-2015. In this context, it will take steps to reduce the tax stability period from 30 to 15 years, in
line with the average length of time deposits are exploited. To increase the government's share of
income from mining operations, the government plans to retain specialized firms to audit mining
contracts and identify any cases of tax avoidance and tax optimization. It plans do to the same with
telephone companies. It also plans to strengthen the capacities of DGI and DNDC staff in auditing
the companies' tax returns. Finally, to increase transparency in the mining sector, the government
has published all mining and petroleum contracts on the Ministry of Mines website and will publish
the feasibility studies pertaining to companies currently in the production phase by end-2015.13

11

During the first seven months of 2014, petroleum product consumption subsidies are estimated at CFAF 22 billion
(US$44 million or 0.4 percent of GDP). For the 12 months of the year they are projected at CFAF 38 billion
(US$76 million or 0.6 percent of GDP).

Reform the tax, customs, and government property administrations
26.
Priority will be given to implementing the reforms begun in 2011 to sustainably improve the
operation and efficiency of VAT, which generates roughly 40 percent of tax revenue. The following
measures have been implemented to this end:


To ensure that VAT credits are timely refunded, a special allocation account was created to
be used exclusively for refunding VAT credits. The account will continue to be funded by the
full amount of VAT revenue paid by mining companies and their subcontractors on imports,
and 10 percent of domestic VAT revenue, or more if needed: the Ministry of Economy and
Finance (MEF) issued a directive indicating that if the balance of the account is insufficient to
cover the refund of VAT credits, the contribution of VAT revenue collected by the DGI can be
increased by the amount required. This mechanism will ensure that VAT credits are
effectively and regularly refunded, in accordance with Community legislation, to exporting
gold companies and to all other companies that generate VAT credits, with the exception of
resellers at this time. VAT refunds owed to gold mining companies for 2014 total CFAF
56 billion, of which CFAF 30 billion was refunded in 2014 and CFAF 26 billion in 2015. In
addition, the government refunded CFAF 49 billion in VAT credits from prior years. In 2015,
the estimated total VAT credits to be refunded to gold mining companies for fiscal year
2015 is CFAF 67 billion, of which CFAF 50 billion will be refunded in 2015 and CFAF 17 billion
during first quarter 2016. In 2016, the estimated total VAT credits to be refunded to gold
mining companies for fiscal year 2016 is CFAF 65 billion, of which CFAF 49 billion will be
refunded in 2016 and CFAF 16 billion during first quarter 2017. The DGI has produced a
table of VAT credits by company from the time of issuance to refund, indicating the mode of
payment (by offset or cash) for fiscal years 2013 and 2014 and the first half of 2015.



To ensure that the process of refunding VAT credits operates efficiently, submit a formal
request to the Section of Accounts of the Supreme Court to conduct an audit to ensure that
the amounts refunded and the refund process are consistent with applicable laws by June
30, 2016.



To avoid the accumulation of VAT credits by domestic operators, VAT withholding at source
will be completely abolished on January 1, 2017. VAT withholding at source was eliminated
for large businesses on December 31, 2011. Beginning January 1, 2016, withholding will also
be eliminated for the Treasury. To ensure that the elimination of VAT withholding does not
result in loss of tax revenue, the DGI: (i) conducted a communication campaign directed to
suppliers of large businesses on VAT reporting and payment obligations, and will conduct a
similar campaign for all government suppliers by end-October 2016; (ii) will conduct
heightened monitoring of VAT payments by suppliers to large businesses immediately, and
by suppliers to the government once VAT withholding is eliminated for those suppliers; and
(iii) will systematize production of the annex on deductible VAT included in the VAT returns
of taxpayers managed by the DGE and make better use of the information contained in the
annex.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

55

MALI

To increase the number of businesses that effectively pay VAT,14 the DGI will expand the
campaign of selective audits of VAT credits, beginning with businesses whose activity should
not systematically generate VAT credits (particularly commercial activities and service
providers). It produced a report on the interim results of the audits in 2015 and will produce
another report of the results by February 28, 2016. To this end, the DGI will continue, with
support from AFRITAC West, the training of staff assigned to research, targeted VAT audit,
and audit of VAT credits.



27.
The DGI, the DGD, the DNDC, and the Directorate General of Government Property
Administration (DGABE) will continue their efforts to improve tax, customs, and public property
administration in order to expand the tax base and increase tax yields:
Implementation of multidisciplinary audits.



 The Joint Economic and Financial Intelligence and Investigation Committee (CMRIEF) was
established on March 15, 2012, to improve the effectiveness of tax audits and identify
new taxpayers using, notably, all the databases of taxpayers and economic operators
available to the DGI, the DGD, the DNDC, the DGABE, and the Directorate General of
Public Contracts and Delegation of Public Services (DGMP-DSP).
 By comparing imports declared to the DGD and turnover reported to the DGI, the
CMRIEF determined that over 80 percent of importers, or roughly 1,000 businesses,
appear to have understated their turnover to the DGI in 2009, 2010, and 2011 by an
estimated total of CFAF 500 billion per year. On June 30, 2015, the DGI issued tax
adjustment notices to 139 taxpayers for a total of CFAF 273 billion (US$464 million or
4.2 percent of GDP), of which CFAF 30 billion (US$51 million or 0.5 percent of GDP) was
recovered following the verification program. The DGI will update the analysis for the
years 2012-2014 by August 31, 2015. For fiscal years 2012, 2013, and 2014, a comparison
of figures for imports declared to the DGD and revenues declared to the DGI suggests
that about 59 percent of importers would have understated the revenues they declared
to the DGI.
 By comparing the public contract amounts in the DGMP database with turnover
reported to the DGI, the CMRIEF determined that over 90 percent of government
contractors, or roughly 450 businesses, reported turnover that appears to be lower than
the value of the contracts awarded to them in 2010 and 2011. On June 30, 2015, the DGI
issued tax adjustment notices to 17 taxpayers for total at CFAF 36 billion (US$61 million
or 0.6 percent of GDP), of which CFAF 1.3 billion was recovered following the verification
program.

14

In 2014, 51 percent of large businesses and 51 percent of medium-size businesses required to pay VAT effectively
paid the tax, compared to 27 percent and 20 percent, respectively, between January 2012 and May 2013, given the
large number of businesses that systematically claim VAT refunds. See IMF Country Report No. 13/355. Mali:
Technical Assistance Report: Continued Modernization of the Malian Tax System and Administration, ¶ 49.

MALI

 The DGI has added these importers to its audit program, beginning with the businesses
with the largest amounts apparently underreported in absolute terms. It regularly
submits reports of the interim results of the audit program to the Council of Ministers.
Since the second half of 2014, the DGI has included the recipients of government
contracts in its audit program and provided an interim report on this subject to the
Council of Ministers on September 10, 2015. It will submit a new report to the Council of
Ministers covering importers and government contract awardees by February 28, 2016.


Improving DGI effectiveness
 Change in the DGE and DME turnover thresholds to streamline taxpayer administration.
To improve management of taxpayers and expand the number of taxpayers managed by
the DGE and the DME, the Council of Ministers adopted an order raising the DGE
turnover threshold from CFAF 500 million to CFAF 1 billion, and will adopt an order
reducing the DME turnover threshold from CFAF 100 million to CFAF 50 million as of
January 1, 2016. This change will improve the DGE’s management and control of
businesses, will quickly increase the number of taxpayers managed by the DME, and will
improve management of the VAT by assigning all responsibility for this tax to the DGE
and the DME effective January 1, 2016, given that the annual turnover threshold for
payment of VAT is CFAF 50 million.
 Promoting tax compliance. In October 2011 the DGI began publishing the lists of
taxpayers managed by the DGE and the DME, respectively, on the MEF website.15 It
updates the lists on a regular basis so that the public can appreciate the results of efforts
to expand the tax base. As of March 2014, the DGE handled 474 taxpayers, the DME
handled 1,411 taxpayers, and the tax centers (CDIs) for the six communes of Bamako
handled 49,665 taxpayers. As of August, 2015, the figures increased, respectively, to
536 for the DGE, 1,847 for the DME, and 55,839 for the Bamako CDI.
 Increase in the number of taxpayers managed by the DME. Using mainly the results of
audits arranged following the CMRIEF reports, the DGI has begun to increase the
cumulative number of taxpayers managed by the DME to 2,250 by end-2015 to increase
the proportion of DME revenue to DGI revenue from 5.2 percent in 2014 to 10 percent
as quickly as possible. To achieve this objective, the DGI plans an institutional reform to
convert the DME into one or more medium-size taxpayer centers (CME), which will come
under the supervision of the Bamako District Directorate of Taxes beginning March 31,
2016.
 Introducing the capability to pay taxes to the DGE and DME via bank transfer. To simplify
and ensure the security of tax payments, the DGI is taking steps to gradually allow DGE
and DME taxpayers to pay their taxes by bank transfer; as at August 31, 2015,
78 taxpayers had paid their taxes by bank transfer. The DGI undertakes to collect taxes
from taxpayers managed by the DGE via bank transfer by August 31, 2016.

 Enhancing the accountability of tax collectors. The government undertakes to enact
measures to convert tax collectors, who are de facto government accountants, into fullfledged government accounting officers, so that they fully assume their tax collection
responsibilities.
 More effective tax audits. The DGI undertakes to increase the proportion of large
businesses audited annually from 19 percent in 2014 to 25 percent in 2015 and
30 percent in 2016. It undertakes to increase the ratio of medium-size businesses
audited annually from 14 percent in 2014 to 20 percent in 2015 and 25 percent in 2016.
The DGI undertakes to reduce the non-filer rate among medium-size businesses from
26 percent between January 2012 and April 2013 and 25 percent in 2014 to less than
10 percent in 2015 and 2016. To accomplish this, the DGI undertakes to complete the
task of locating the 657 DME taxpayers who have not responded to DGI
correspondence. The DGI undertakes to reduce the non-filer rate among taxpayers
managed by CDIs from over 70 percent between January 2012 and April 2013 and
35 percent in 2014 to less than 15 percent in 2015 and 2016.
 Identification of all taxpayers, including businesses and individuals, through the use of a
national identification number (NINA) to facilitate business creation and modernize tax
administration. The government undertakes to conduct a feasibility study for the
migration, taking into account the expertise gained since the taxpayer identification
number (NIF) was introduced in 1996, by December 31, 2015.
 Implementation of measures to improve tax dispute practices in line with the
recommendations of the World Bank technical assistance mission by June 30, 2016. The
measures will include the establishment of a joint mediation committee (composed of
representatives from the private sector and tax administration) chaired by an
independent individual; the appointment of a tax mediator charged with receiving and
reviewing taxpayer complaints against members of the revenue-collecting agencies’
staff; and the establishment of taxpayer rights to bring disputes before the BVG or the
Anti-Corruption and Unlawful Enrichment Commission when it becomes operational.
Improving DGD effectiveness:



 The DGD will carry out its action plan to implement the recommendations of the June
2013 technical assistance mission by the IMF Fiscal Affairs Department.16 The action plan
aims to: (i) optimize human resource management; (ii) improve management of material
and financial resources; (iii) control commercial operations; (iv) step up efforts to combat
fraud and cross-border crime; (v) facilitate trade and partnership; and (vi) optimize
information and communication technologies through migration to the ASYCUDA World
system. The purpose of this migration is to allow all customs documents to be processed
in paperless form and to institute a fully electronic customs declaration system.

 To increase customs duty collection, the DGD informed operators that it would impose a
30 percent fine on imports not inspected prior to loading, in accordance with applicable
laws. The DGD will ask the inspection company to provide monthly reconciliation reports
comparing duties paid and receivable by declaration, and will analyze them for the
purpose of increasing collections by August 31, 2016 (¶ 9, proposed benchmark, Table 4).
 Introducing the capability to pay customs duties to the DGD via bank transfer. To simplify
and ensure the security of customs duty payments, the DGD and DNTCP are taking steps
to collect customs revenue by bank transfer by August 31, 2016.
 To help maintain the competitiveness of Malian businesses, the DGD will systematically
verify WAEMU and Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) certificates
of origin in cooperation with the issuing authorities and will draft an interim report on
the results of verification by February 28, 2016. If the WAEMU and ECOWAS certificates
of origin are found to be inapplicable, the DGD will collect the duties according to the
tariff preference and will deposit the remainder in accordance with applicable rules.


Modernizing the DNDC. The DNDC will continue to implement the recommendations of the
organizational audit sponsored by the Institutional Development Commission (Commissariat
au development institutionnel) on modernizing its organization and automating processes.
The DNDC will take steps to increase the collection of capital gains tax on real estate sales
by individuals, which was first assessed in October2011. The measures will include
rationalizing recording fees and other fees and commissions on real estate transactions. It
will continue efforts to establish the land registry and will create a secure archiving system. It
undertakes to migrate 4,000 property titles already digitized in the cadastral information
system database by end-December 2015 in addition to the 1500 titles recorded to date. It
undertakes to migrate an additional 50,000 titles in 2016.



Modernizing the DGABE. The MEF will modernize the DGABE through the introduction of
modern management tools such as results-based management (RBM), greater use of IT (use
of inventory accounting software in the accounting offices of ministries and public
institutions), and implementation of reforms for better monitoring and appraisal of the
government portfolio.

Improve expenditure management
28.
The government will take steps to improve the regulatory framework for public financial
management and the preparation, execution, monitoring, and control of budget execution.

Transpose the harmonized legislative framework prescribed by WAEMU directives
29.
The government transposed WAEMU directives 01/2009 and 06/2009 through 10/2009
concerning the transparency code, budgets, public accounting, budget nomenclature, the
government chart of accounts, and the TOFE into national laws and regulations. The government
also undertakes to transpose Directive 01/2011 concerning the subnational jurisdictions’ financial
regimes in 2015. The government will ensure that the regulatory texts are published by December
31, 2015. They will be accompanied by directives and guides to ensure they are readily and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

uniformly understandable in order that they can be implemented as they become available between
now and the end of 2015.

Improve government budget preparation
30.
To improve the budget presentation and facilitate evaluation of the efficiency of public
expenditure, the government will gradually implement program budgets and results-based
management in accordance with the relevant WAEMU directive. A first step to test the budget
management tools will be the presentation of the 2016 budget law to the National Assembly for
information in the form of program budgets. During a transition period, the government will submit
not only the annexes prescribed by the directive, but also, for information, the distribution of
appropriations under the current resource-based budget and the distribution of appropriations by
region.
31.
To gain visibility of budget support from the TFPs as early as possible, the government will
ask the TFPs to provide information in April on the budget support planned for the following year.
32.
In order to involve the National Assembly as early as possible in the budget preparation
process, the government will organize budget strategy discussions with the National Assembly
during the first half of the year on the following year’s draft budget. Discussions for the 2017 budget
will be held before June 30, 2016. The information prepared for the discussions, and all other budget
preparation and execution reports, will be published on the MEF website in order to fully inform all
stakeholders in Mali’s development.

Improve government budget execution
33.
To ensure compliance with budget rules and with good practices for governance and
transparency in public financial management, the MEF will begin appointing directors of finance and
equipment and administrative and financial directors in the ministerial departments beginning with
the 2016 budget execution (proposed structural benchmark, Table 4). It will remind operators
through the media that only contracts that have been approved in advance by the financial
controller are binding on the government. The government has produced a report on off-budget
spending during the first seven months of the year and will produce a new report covering the
entire year before February 28, 2016. During the first 7 months of 2015, off-budget expenditure has
been estimated at CFAF 806 million (0.01 percent of GDP).
34.
Pursuant to Community directives, the following closing dates have been established for
2015 budget execution: November 30, 2015 for commitments of operating expenditures, investment
expenditures, and expenditures under petty cash procedures; December 20 for commitments of
other expenditures; December 31 for payment orders; and January 31, 2016 for government
accountants' acceptance of payment orders, approval, and ex post validation. Under this
arrangement, the carryover period will be limited to accounting operations. A memorandum on
closing procedures was issued on September 8, 2015 indicating the deadlines for commitments and
validation in preparation for the closing of commitments on November 30, 2015.

To increase transparency and expedite the award of public contracts, the DGMP-DSP will take
steps to increase the amount of information on contract awards published on its website,17 in line
with practices observed in neighboring countries. The DGMP-DSP will publish a list of government
contract awards at regular intervals, specifying for each contract the contractor, the contract
amount, the type of procurement procedure (e.g., open or restricted competition or direct
negotiation), and a citation to the provision of the public procurement code supporting the
procurement procedure used.18 To reduce the average time required to award contracts,19 the
government adopted the following measures in April:


improve requirements planning by forwarding procurement plans to the DGMP-DSP in
September (instead of November 30 under current practice) and allow procurements to
proceed to the point of provisional award pending approval of appropriations, which
represents a gain of two months in terms of planning and processing; in this context, the
Minister of Economy and Finance asked all contracting authorities to prepare their 2016
procurement plans and forward them to the DGMP-DSP no later than September 30, 2015;



increase the signature and approval thresholds to increase the accountability of contracting
authorities;



reduce the regulatory time frames provided for the various public procurement stakeholders
from 108 to 80 business days, a gain of 28 business days;



reduce the number of contract signatories from seven to four;



eliminate the dual review of externally funded contracts;



reduce the number of mandatory administrative documents required of candidates and
bidders for public contracts;



in accordance with the Accra Agenda and to improve the project implementation rate, the
African Development Bank conducted an evaluation of Malian national contracting
procedures that found that the procedures adhered to principles of economy, efficiency, and
transparency in procurement and applicable best practices, and on that basis signed a letter
agreement on July 17, 2014 with the Malian government authorizing the use of national
procurement procedures in national competitive bidding; and finally

17

18

In 2014, the government awarded 1352 public contracts for a total of CFAF 266 billion (US$539 million, or
4.5 percent of GDP), 85 percent of which were awarded pursuant to competitive bidding (90 percent in terms of
value), 3 percent through limited competition (3 percent of value), and 7 percent through direct negotiation
(12 percent of total value). During the first six months of 2015, the government awarded 317 public contracts for a
total of CFAF 64.5 billion (US$110 billion or 1 percent of GDP), of which 87 percent were awarded pursuant to
competitive bidding (65 percent in terms of value), 16 percent through limited competition (2 percent of value),
and 27 percent through direct negotiation (33 percent of total value).

19

The average time required to award contracts was reduced from 94 days in 2013 to 90 days in 2015 and 87 days
during the first six months of 2015.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

61

MALI

to further improve the business environment, the public contracting authority presented a
proposed new public contracts code to the government, which approved it in August 2015.
The government recognizes the risk of incorrect interpretation of the provision in this new
code concerning unsolicited bids. Therefore, the government has improved, in collaboration
with the World Bank, the implementing regulations of the new code to take into account the
amendments deemed necessary by the World Bank concerning the possibility for suppliers
to make unsolicited bids. The scope of unsolicited bids has thus been limited in the
implementing regulation signed on October 22, 2015. The government undertakes to
modify this provision of the code in a durable manner, in consultation with the World Bank.
Thus, a revised code will be approved by the Council of Ministers by end-August 2016.



36.
To minimize the price of all government supplies, the government has executed all exempt
contracts designated as "defense secret" or "essential government interests" pursuant to Decree
2014-764 of October 9, 2014—identical to the version of the same decree adopted by the Council of
Ministers on September 19, 2014—(establishing the rules and procedures for procurements of
supplies and services exempt from the provisions of Decree 08-85/P-RM of August 11, 2008
concerning the award, performance, and payment of public contracts and delegations of public
service) since the adoption of the decree. As provided by the decree, the public sector oversight
agency (Contrôle Général des Services Publics, CGSP) will audit all exempt contracts designated as
"defense secret" or "essential government interests" from the previous year by June 30 of the
following year to verify that they have been implemented in accordance with the decree (¶ 9). The
CGSP report on exempt contracts between October 9 and December 31, 2014 indicated that exempt
contracts in the amount of CFAF 1.5 billion (US$2.6 million) were awarded and that irregularities
were found in the award and performance of those contracts. The government undertakes to
execute all exempt contracts in accordance with Decree 2014–764. The MEF will send a letter to the
ministers concerned to remind them of the need to comply with the decree. In 2016, the CGSP will
prepare an audit of exempt contracts from 2015 by February 29, 2016, i.e. by the June 30 deadline
provided by the decree (proposed benchmark, Table 4).
37.
To maximize returns on public investment and minimize the associated costs, the Directorate
General of Budget (DGB), the National Directorate of Development Planning (DNPD), and the
General Directorate of Public Debt (DGDP) will:


accelerate the sector ministries' implementation of investment projects for which the
execution rate was 20 percent during the first half of 2015; to this end, increase project
supervision missions to address the risks and constraints that slow execution down; in this
regard, the DNPD undertakes to conduct supervision missions with the DGDP for at least
100 projects in 2016, compared to 29 projects in 2015;



evaluate the cost of projects proposed by sector ministries with the help of a market price
list posted on the MEF website on March 15, 201520;

20

http://www.finances.gouv.ml/contenu_documentation.aspx.

62

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALI



provide access to information on project financial execution: the DNPD and the DGDP
undertake to publish quarterly information on the financial execution status of externally
financed projects;



improve the quality of project preparation through the use of the project studies and
preparation fund and by conducting a study in 2016 to define all strategic infrastructure
projects critical to the Malian economy;



implement the public investment management application, beginning with the project
programming and finance component in 2016 and the monitoring and evaluation
component in 2017;



continue redirecting appropriations to favor the completion of key projects, giving priority
to projects with certain, programmed financing that can begin quickly; and



strengthen the sector ministries’ expertise and the DNPD’s capacities for critical review in
selecting investment projects.

38.
To gradually improve budgeting procedures and the monitoring and execution of
investment appropriations, the following measures will be adopted:


The 2013 budget introduced the budgeting of commitment authorizations (AEs) and
payment appropriations (CPs) relating to three-year public investment expenditures. On that
basis, the MEF is arranging to monitor the utilization of AEs and CPs through the PRED5
expenditure management application.



Starting with implementation of the 2016 budget, the procedure for carrying over CPs will
take effect under a mechanism providing for full implementation of the carryover
procedures established by WAEMU directives, which allow only guaranteed CPs included in
the cash flow plan to be carried over.

39.
Payment deadlines will be more strictly monitored to prevent the accumulation of arrears.
Public financial management applications (PRED5 and AICE) will be used to monitor payment order
execution times and ensure that payments are made within 90 days of certification, in accordance
with applicable WAEMU directives. Monthly tables will be posted on the MEF website for this
purpose.21
40.
The government will continue to implement the recommendations of BVG audit reports and
those of the Supreme Court audit section on the purchase of an aircraft and a contract for
equipment and supplies awarded by the Ministry of Defense and Former Combatants.22 In line with
those recommendations, the government has registered the aircraft acquired in 2014 and
undertakes to record it in the government's material accounting system. The government will take
steps to review the aircraft’s operating mode.

Improve fiscal transparency
41.
To improve transparency in regard to the government’s fiscal, liquidity, and asset position,
the DNTCP will gradually implement the new WAEMU directive on the TOFE and other financial
statements. To ensure an orderly transition to the new TOFE, the DNTCP will produce the TOFE
during 2015–17 using the 1998 and 2009 nomenclatures. In 2015 and 2016, program monitoring will
continue to be based on the 1998 TOFE. Beginning in 2018, the DNTCP will produce the TOFE using
only the 2009 nomenclature to monitor budget execution, and any new program with the IMF will
be based on the 2009 TOFE. In 2016, the DNTCP will first focus its attention on producing three of
the four financial statements provided by the 2009 directive: (i) the TOFE; (ii) the statement of public
debt; and (iii) the report on cash flow operations. The fourth financial statement, i.e. the government
balance sheet, will be produced for the first time in 2015 based on the position as at end-2014.
42.
Implementation of the new Treasury integrated accounting application, AICE, will continue.
The application was installed in the Koulikoro regional treasury office in January 2013 and will be
implemented at the Treasury Central Accounting Agency (ACCT) as regional government accounting
office by January 1, 2016. Installation and testing of the various functions at the Kayes, Ségou,
Sikasso, Mopti, Tombouctou, Gao, and Kidal regions, and of the component consolidating national
budget execution and real-time accounting with accounting offices at the ACCT, will be completed
by end-2016. The AICE implementation at the ACCT will allow consolidated statistical reports to be
produced for all government entities connected to the system, including the integrated Treasury
balance and TOFE, by January 1, 2017.

Improve cash flow management
43.
The DNTCP will prepare a monthly cash flow plan at the beginning of the year and update it
each month to ensure that expenditures and payments are executed on a timely basis throughout
the year. The plans will be updated each month to reflect revenue collected, expenditures executed,
and external financing disbursed.
44.
The DNTCP will continue the current efforts to develop a more accurate understanding of
the components of the net government position (NGP) vis-à-vis the banking system.23 It regularly
publishes reports on the MEF website analyzing activity in PNG components, breaking out activity in
the most important components of the net Treasury position (NTP) and the net position of other
government entities (PNACP).24 These reports present the opening and closing stocks and identify
all owners of the accounts included in the PNACP. The DNTCP will update the tables every six
months. The report for end-December 2015 will be available before February 28, 2016. The BCEAO
23

As of June 30, 2015, the net government position (NGP) vis-à-vis the banks was a creditor position of CFAF
7 billion (US$12 million or 0.1 percent of GDP) for the government as broadly defined in the WAEMU directive on
the Table of Financial Operations. That figure includes a net Treasury liability position of CFAF 176 billion
(US$299 million or 2.7 percent of GDP) and a net creditor position of CFAF 183 billion (US$311 million or
2.8 percent of GDP) for other government entities.

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALI

will continue to provide the DNTCP with the NTP extracted from the monetary survey for the
purpose of compiling the TOFE, in accordance with applicable WAEMU directives.
45.
The DNTCP will continue the implementation of the Treasury single account (TSA) at the
BCEAO. The first step, completed December 31, 2014, was the transfer to the TSA of the accounts of
government accounting officers within the scope of the PNT, except officers assigned to regions
where the BCEAO does not maintain a presence. All term accounts within the scope of the NTP were
transferred to the TSA as they matured. However, if the DNTCP has a cash surplus, it will invest it in
term deposits with commercial banks so long as the interest rates on those deposits exceed the
BCEAO lending rate, as occurred during the first half of 2015 when the cash surplus was placed in a
three-month term deposit paying 4 percent after taxes. In the second step, to be gradually
implemented in 2015, the funds of administrative public entities (EPA), which are responsible for
implementing government policy under the government's direct supervision and receive most of
their funding from the government, will be incorporated in the TSA. As at June 30, 2015, those funds
represented roughly CFAF 203 billion. The obligation to deposit EPA funds with the Treasury will be
clearly reestablished and upheld in accordance with the principle of a single Treasury account and
consolidation of cash holdings cited by the 2009 WAEMU directive on the subject. The exceptions
will be public hospitals, as provided by Law 02-050 of July 20, 2002; the two pension fund
administrators (CMSS and the National Social Insurance Administration (INPS)) and the national
health insurance fund (CANAM), which are jointly held entities over which the government does not
exercise direct control; and EPAs that do not receive government subsidies. The government will
introduce proposed legislation to clarify existing provisions governing the deposit of EPA funds with
the Treasury by December 31, 2015. In the interim, the government will combine the Malian
counterparties to new co-financed projects in an escrow subaccount at the BCEAO for projects
whose donors agree to the principle.
46.
The DNTCP will tighten supervision of EPAs.25 In January 2005, the government required all
EPAs to adopt the accounting system developed by the DNTCP. The DGB will ensure that each EPA
forwards its budget to the minister of finance for approval at the beginning of each fiscal year. The
DNTCP will receive the EPAs’ semiannual budget execution reports. The MEF will advise the EPAs
that it will not approve their 2016 budgets until they have forwarded their financial statements for
the first half of 2015 to the DNTCP. In 2016, the EPAs will be required to release financial statements
including semiannual intermediate results (résultat semestriel intérimaire).

Strengthen internal and external control
47.
The internal and external control agencies will be strengthened. The internal and external
control agencies identified numerous administrative weaknesses in the management of Mali's public
finances. To correct these weaknesses, the government adopted a national internal control strategy
in August 2011, covering the period 2012–15, to be implemented with the support of several TFPs.
25

Of the 103 EPAs, only 11 have an accounting framework approved by the MEF; 73 forwarded monthly financial
statements to the DNTCP in 2015 compared to 65 in 2014 and 43 in 2013.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

65

MALI



In the area of internal control, the CGSP prepared a risk map for the ministries of health,
agriculture and rural development, national education, and equipment and transport.



The National Financial Oversight Directorate (DNCF) will carry out new missions arising from
the implementation of WAEMU directives (¶ 30), i.e., ex ante control of expenditure, ex post
evaluation of program performance, and continued decentralization of activities. In addition,
the DNCF will produce regular reports on the verification of services received.



In the area of external control, the BVG programmed 29 inspections in 2015 and 36 in 2016,
compared to 27 in 2014 and 20 in 2013. It audited all expenditures of the Ministry of
Defense and Former Combatants from 2010 to mid-2014.



The staff of the Supreme Court audit section will be increased. This section will be converted
to a Court of Audit in accordance with the relevant WAEMU directive as soon as possible.

48.
The government's annual financial statements will be produced and audited on a regular
basis, as provided by applicable Community directives. The National Assembly approved the budget
review laws for fiscal years 2008 through 2011. The government submitted proposed budget review
laws for fiscal years 2012 and 2013 to the National Assembly. It will adopt the proposed budget
review law for fiscal year 2014 before end-2015, as provided by the relevant community directives.

Bring the Malian Social Security Fund and the National Social Insurance Administration
into financial balance
49.
The government intends to take action to ensure the financial soundness of the Malian
Social Security Fund (CMSS), the public sector pension administrator, and the National Social
Insurance Administration (INPS), which administers pensions, employee accident insurance, and
family allowances for private-sector employees. According to the most recent available actuarial
studies (2005 and 2010 for the CMSS, 2006 for the INPS), the deficits of both systems could each
represent at least 1 percent of GDP in the near future. The government will commission new
actuarial studies for both regimes, the results of which should be available by August 31, 2016.

Conduct a sustainable borrowing policy
50.
The government will continue to conduct a borrowing policy consistent with the objective of
debt sustainability (¶ 13).


The debt sustainability analysis conducted with IMF and World Bank staff concluded that the
risk of debt distress continues to be moderate. The analysis also confirms that the
sustainability of Mali's debt is highly sensitive to the price of gold (which represents
60 percent of exports, with production expected to decrease in the medium term), the
financial terms of loans, and the continuation of sustainable fiscal policies.



Accordingly, the government reiterates its commitment to cover its external financing needs
primarily through grants and loans in foreign currency for which the grant element is at least
35 percent. The government proposes a cumulative ceiling of CFAF 250 billion
(US$426 million, or 3.6 percent of GDP) for the contracting of non-concessional loans in

66

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALI

2015–16. This corresponds to four loans totaling CFAF 200 billion from Exim Bank of China
(for which the grant element is 29 percent) that will finance investments in transportation
and electricity distribution that the World Bank considers aligned with the sector
development policy, and loans totaling CFAF 50 billion for projects with high rates of return,
to be identified, and for which financing is not available under concessional terms; IMF staff
will be consulted prior to the signature of these loans (continuous proposed performance
criterion, Tables 1 and 3).


To prepare for implementation of the new public borrowing policy and IMF-supported
programs, which took effect June 30, 2015, the Directorate General of Public Debt (DGPD)
prepared a detailed chart of loan agreements that will support execution of the proposed
2015 supplementary budget and the 2016 draft budget. The chart identifies the amount
disbursed and the financial terms of each loan agreement and will be annexed to the 2016
draft budget (Table 5). Under the borrowing plan, the government requests a cumulative
ceiling of CFAF 250 billion for 2015-16 (see previous bullet point, proposed performance
criterion, Tables 1 and 3) and notes, for reference, the ceilings of CFAF 557 billion on
concessional borrowing for the same period. The government reserves the right to revise
these ceilings at the time of the next ECF review provided they remain compatible with the
debt sustainability analysis. To improve debt management, the DGDP will prepare a report
on the implementation of recommendations from the West AFRITAC October 2014 technical
assistance mission to improve the quality of the public debt database, including an action
plan with a detailed timetable for implementation of all the recommendations (proposed
structural benchmark, Table 4).



To closely monitor its borrowing policy, the government launched the National Public Debt
Committee by decision of March 24, 2014. The committee's principal functions are to
provide an opinion on any initiative or plan for government borrowing or the provision of a
government guarantee and to produce an annual borrowing strategy document to be
annexed to the budget law.

51.

Domestic debt management will be strengthened.



To this end, the DGDP will compile an inventory of all government domestic loan
agreements and all government commitments to guarantee domestic debt to ensure that
the repayment schedules are included in the public debt data and budget laws.



The government will include an annual ceiling on increases in the total amount of
guarantees the government is permitted to provide in the draft budgets submitted for
approval by the National Assembly. In accordance with applicable laws and budget
procedures, the 2016 draft budget will provide for a provision of 10 percent of risk falling
due, i.e., the amount of guaranteed debt maturing in 2016.



The government retained a firm to audit domestic arrears accumulated by the government
during the spending freeze following the 2012 coup and in previous years since 1995. The
audit identified a total of CFAF 206 billion in arrears (3.2 percent of GDP), of which
47 percent were accumulated in 2012 and another 28 percent during 2010 and 2011. Of the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

67

MALI

total, CFAF 166 billion (2.6 percent of GDP) was validated by the consultant based on
information provided by the administration. The government already paid CFAF 82 billion of
the validated arrears, CFAF 36 billion of which in 2013 and CFAF 46 billion in 2014. To pay
the remaining CFAF 84 billion, the government included a CFAF 27 billion provision in the
2015 proposed supplementary budget and a CFAF 25 billion provision in the 2016 draft
budget (¶ 15). The validated arrears include a CFAF 34 billion court judgment against the
government, which will review the matter by February 28, 2016 to determine whether it has
exhausted all its appeals. If so, the government will include appropriations in the 2016 draft
budget to pay the corresponding arrears. Before paying the full amount of its arrears, the
government will ensure that the taxpayers concerned do not owe back taxes, and if so the
government will withhold the amount of the tax arrears from the payments to its suppliers.
The government has requested a supplementary audit by the firm, to be provided by
February 28, 2016 if possible, to provide creditors of invalidated debts totaling CFAF
40 billion the opportunity to supplement their dossiers. If necessary, the government will
include appropriations in the 2016 proposed supplementary budget to pay any additional
validated arrears.

C. Improve Economic Statistics
52.
The National Statistics Institute (INSTAT) published new national accounts based on SNA
1993 for the years 1999–2013 by August 31, 2015. As a result, GDP was adjusted upward by an
average of 15 percent. The government will use the revised series in monitoring the implementation
of its economic and financial policy beginning January 1, 2016.

D. Improve the Business Environment to Encourage Private Sector Development
53.
The government will remove the principal constraints on the business environment, which
were identified in the latest Africa Competitiveness Report––produced jointly by the World
Economic Forum, the World Bank, and the African Development Bank––as access to financing,
corruption, insufficient infrastructure (including in the energy sector), complex tax laws, government
bureaucracy, and inadequate work force qualifications.
54.
The government will take measures to mobilize resources for infrastructure investment and
simplify tax legislation (¶ 24). In addition, it will take the measures described below to maintain the
stability of the financial sector and improve access to financing provided by the sector, improve the
financial position and productive capacity of the electricity sector, and reduce corruption.

Promote the stability and development of the financial sector
55.
Recognizing that a strong financial sector is critical to continued, sustainable growth in Mali,
the government is determined to resolve the most pressing problems for the sector. In particular,
the government undertakes to:


68

Provide security for bank branches that have reopened in Northern Mali since August 2013.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALI



Complete the restructuring of the Malian Housing Bank (BHM). The government has
adopted a two-stage plan to restructure BHM. In a first stage, BHM will be merged with the
stronger Malian Solidarity Bank (BMS) by the end of 2015. The government has submitted
the merger for approval to the Regional Banking Commission); the government has retained
several specialized firms to assess the status of the merger-absorption process and conduct
due diligence. The interim goal is to consolidate the two entities and clean up the balance
sheet of the new bank, which would help minimize risks to the public finances and make the
new bank sufficiently attractive to private investors. In a second stage, the government will
take the necessary steps to seek participation from the private sector in the new bank
resulting from the merger, with the aim of eventually disengaging the state from it;



Following the implementation from May 30, 2015 of a credit reporting bureau (BIC) in
accordance with applicable WAEMU legislation, contribute, in support of the actions of the
BCEAO, to strengthening the credibility of the BIC through communication campaigns in
order to increase the rate of collection of consent from clients of financial institutions;



Restore confidence in the micro-finance sector by implementing a detailed action plan in
2016 for reform of the sector.

Reform the electricity sector
56.
The government will take steps to eliminate the structural deficit between the cost of
producing electricity and the selling price in Mali. In 2014 the electric utility EDM posted a loss
before subsidies of CFAF 57 billion (1 percent of GDP) which the government absorbed through a
budget transfer in the same amount. In 2015, EDM is expected to post a loss of CFAF 36 billion
(0.6 percent of GDP) before subsidies, an improvement relative to 2014 reflecting lower petroleum
prices, which the government will absorb with a budget transfer of CFAF 42 billion, of which CFAF
12 billion was financed by an ECOWAS grant. The transfer will serve to limit EDM's debt to
commercial banks to CFAF 33 billion at end-2015. If the ECOWAS grant is not forthcoming, the
government undertakes to transfer to EDM the resources needed to maintain its bank debt below
CFAF 33 billion in 2015. In 2016, EDM is expected to post a loss of CFAF 28 billion. The draft budget
provides for a transfer of CFAF 20 billion, which will be adjusted upward if necessary in the 2016
proposed supplementary budget to absorb EDM losses and enable it to achieve its production
objectives without accumulating arrears vis-à-vis the banks and its suppliers, and to stabilize EDM's
bank debt at CFAF 33 billion at end-2016. The projections incorporate the government's
commitment to pay invoices in advance at the beginning of each quarter. EDM will take the steps
needed to increase its billing rates and reduce operating costs, in particular by outsourcing the fuel
supply function. EDM will publish its financial statements (balance sheet and income statement) on
its website and its performance indicators on that site and in an annex to the annual draft budget.
57.
Due to its tight financial position, EDM has recently built up arrears to suppliers. As part of
the regular annual audit of EDM’s accounts, we will determine the total amount of these arrears at
end-2015, and present a plan for the clearance of these arrears by February 29, 2016. We will also
take the necessary measures to ensure that EDM does not accumulate new arrears from now on.

Promote good governance
58.

The government will fight vigorously for good governance.



To this end, the government undertakes to: carry out the measures described above to
improve the management and transparency of public finances and forward senior
government officials’ financial disclosures pursuant to the unlawful enrichment law to the
Supreme Court by August 31, 2016 (proposed structural benchmark, Table 4).



The government also undertakes to promote good governance in the judicial system by
publishing the decisions of commercial courts and the decisions of other courts concerning
governance-related offenses.26



The government will give priority to remedying failures of the administration identified by
oversight agencies, including the BVG, in their annual and sector reports. It will take the
steps required to sanction responsible staff members through the use of administrative or
legal measures, as applicable. The CGSP published a first annual report on the
implementation of oversight agencies' recommendations from 2011 to 2013.27 It will publish
a second annual report by February 28, 2016 highlighting the results of actions taken to
remedy failures identified by oversight agencies in 2014, with particular attention to the
measures taken to sanction staff misconduct through administrative or legal measures.



The government will implement an action plan to strengthen the legal framework to combat
money laundering, terrorism financing, and corruption, giving consideration to the
recommendations of the IMF technical assistance mission that visited Bamako in September
2014.

PROGRAM MONITORING
59.
The program will undergo periodic reviews based on the performance criteria at endDecember 2015 and end-June 2016, the continuous performance criteria and indicative targets at
end-March and September 2016 (Tables 1 and 3), and the benchmarks (Table 4). The performance
criteria and indicators are set forth in the technical memorandum of understanding (TMU), which
also describes the nature and frequency of the reporting required for program monitoring purposes.
The conclusions of the fifth and sixth reviews under the ECF arrangement are expected, respectively,
on or after May 1 and November 1, 2016.

Attachment II. Technical Memorandum of Understanding
1.
This Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) defines the performance criteria and
indicative targets presented in Tables 1 and 2 of the Memorandum of Economic and Financial
Policies (MEFP). It also determines the frequency and deadlines for reporting data to the staff of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) for program monitoring purposes.

I. DEFINITIONS
2.
Unless otherwise indicated, the government is defined as the central government of the
Republic of Mali and does not include the local authorities, the central bank, or any other public
entity with autonomous legal status that is not included in the Government Financial Operations
Table (TOFE). The National Directorate of the Treasury and Government Accounting (DNTCP) reports
the scope of the TOFE in accordance with the account classification provided by the BCEAO and
forwards it to the central bank and IMF staff.

II. PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
3.
Except as noted, the following financial targets will serve as performance criteria at endDecember 2015 and end-June 2016, and as indicative targets at end-March 2016 and endSeptember 2016.

A. Ceiling on Net Domestic Bank and Financial Market Financing of Government
4.
Net domestic bank and financial market financing of government is defined as the sum
of (i) the net position of the government in the narrow sense, as defined below; and (ii) financing of
the government through the issuance (net of redemptions) of securities to individuals or legal
entities outside the banking system or to nonresident banks domiciled in the West African Economic
and Monetary Union (WAEMU).
5.
The net position of the government in the broad sense is defined as the balance of the
government’s debts and claims vis-à-vis the central bank and the commercial banks. The scope of
the government’s net position is that used by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO)
pursuant to Community provisions. It involves a definition of government that is broader than the
definition given in paragraph 2 and includes the local authorities, certain projects, and some public
administrative entities. The government’s claims include CFAF cash balances, postal checking
accounts, secured liabilities, and all deposits by government agencies with the BCEAO and the
commercial banks, with the exception of government industrial and commercial agencies (EPIC) and
state-owned corporations, which are excluded from the calculation. The government’s debts to the
banking system include all debts to these financial institutions. Cotton Stabilization Fund deposits
and government securities held outside the Malian banking system are not included in the
calculation of the government’s net position. The broad net government position is calculated by
the BCEAO.

76

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALI

6.
The net position of the government in the narrow sense is defined as the difference
between the government’s debts and claims vis-à-vis the central bank and the commercial banks.
The scope of the government’s net position in the narrow sense is as defined in paragraph 2. The
narrow net government position is calculated by the BCEAO.

III. ADJUSTERS
7.
The ceiling on net domestic bank and market financing of government will be adjusted
upward if external budgetary support falls short of program projections. External budgetary
support is defined as grants, loans, and debt relief operations (excluding project grants and loans,
sectoral budgetary support, IMF resources, and HIPC debt relief, but including general budgetary
support). The adjuster will be applied at a rate of 100 percent up to a threshold of CFAF 25 billion
and at a rate of 0 percent for larger amounts.
8.
The ceiling on net domestic bank and market financing of government will be adjusted
upward (downward) if the net reduction in the budgetary float (instances de paiement) is higher
(lower) than program amounts (MEFP, Tables 1 and 3). The budgetary float is defined as payment
orders that have not been paid by the National Directorate of the Treasury and Public Accounting
(DNTCP) in the context of budget execution or on miscellaneous correspondent or depositor
accounts, irrespective of how long such payments have been outstanding.
9.
Lastly, the ceiling on net bank and market financing to government will be adjusted upward
(downward) for the payment of VAT credits, other tax refunds, external arrears, and audited
arrears from previous fiscal years, which exceed (fall short of) program amounts (MEFP, Tables 1,
and 3).

B. Ceiling on Accumulation of External Government Payments Arrears
10.
External payments arrears are defined as the obligations resulting from the service of an
external debt (repayment of principal and interest expense) payable or guaranteed by the
government that were not paid on the due date as specified in the loan agreement, taking any
applicable grace period into consideration. The definition of external debt given in paragraph
15 applies here. Arrears payable to official bilateral creditors are not covered by this definition if the
government is attempting to negotiate a rescheduling of the debt, provided the government pays
into an escrow account the amounts coming due on such loans, taking any applicable grace period
into account, as specified in the loan agreement.
11.
During the program, the government undertakes not to accumulate external payments
arrears (except on debts that are being renegotiated or rescheduled). The performance criterion with
respect to the non-accumulation of external payments arrears will be applied on a continuous basis
throughout the program period.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

77

MALI

C. Ceiling on Non-Concessional External Debt Contracted or Guaranteed by the
Government and/or Public Enterprises
12.
Definition of the debt. The definition of the debt is set out in point 8 of the attachment to
IMF Executive Board Decision No 15688:
(a) the term “debt” will be understood to mean a current, i.e., not contingent, liability,
created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the form of
assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one or
more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some future
point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities
incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones being
as follows:
i. loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of an
undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits,
bonds, debentures, commercial loans and buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges of
assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans under which the obligor is
required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from
the buyer in the future (such as repurchase agreements and official swap arrangements);
ii. suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer
payments until sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered or services
are provided; and
iii. leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the lessee has the
right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the
total expected service life of the property, while the lessor retains the title to the
property. For the purpose of the guideline, the debt is the present value (at the
inception of the lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of
the agreement excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair, or
maintenance of the property.
(b) Under the definition of debt set out in this paragraph, arrears, penalties, and judicially
awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual
obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that
is not considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give
rise to debt.
13.
Guaranteed debt. The guarantee of a debt by the government is understood to be an
explicit legal obligation to ensure that a debt is serviced in the event of nonpayment by the
borrower (involving payments in cash or in kind).

78

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALI

14.
Concessional debt. A debt is understood to be concessional if it includes a grant element of
at least 35 percent;1 the grant element is the difference between the nominal value of the loan and
its present value, expressed as a percentage of its nominal value. The present value of the debt is
calculated on the date on which it is contracted by discounting the future stream of payments of
debt service due on this debt. The discount rate used for this purpose is five percent.
15.
External debt. For the purposes of the relevant assessment criteria, external debt is defined
as a debt denominated, or requiring payment, in a currency other than the CFA franc. This definition
also applies to the debts contracted between WAEMU member countries.
16.
Debt-related performance criteria. The performance criteria apply to new nonconcessional debts contracted or guaranteed by the government, the Mali energy company (EDM),
and the Malian textile company (CMDT), insofar as the government is the majority shareholder. The
performance criteria shall apply to any debts or liabilities contracted or guaranteed for which value
has not yet been received. They shall also apply to private debt for which official guarantees have
been extended and which, therefore, constitute a contingent liability of the government. The
performance criteria are monitored on a continuous basis. No adjusters will be applied to these
performance criteria.
17.
Special provisions. The performance criteria shall not apply to: (i) debt rescheduling
operations in existence at the time the arrangement is approved; (ii) import-related, short-term
external loans (with maturities of less than one year); (iii) external loans contracted by the Malian
Textile Company (CMDT) and guaranteed with cotton export revenue; and (iv) short-term external
loans (at maturities of less than one year) contracted by the EDM to finance the purchase of
petroleum products.
18.
Reporting. The government shall immediately report to the IMF staff any new external loans
it contracts or guarantees, stating the conditions, no later than two weeks after signing the loan
contract.

D. Floor on Gross Tax Revenue
19.
The government’s gross tax revenue is defined as the revenue appearing in the TOFE and
includes all tax revenue in the national budget, before deducting the tax refunds generated during
the year, in particular accumulated VAT credits.

IV. INDICATIVE TARGETS
20.

The following will serve as indicative targets at end-June, September, and December 2015.

1

The reference to the IMF website below leads to a tool that can be used to calculate the grant element in a wide
range of financial arrangements: http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/conc/calculator.

2

Calculation of the grant element takes account of all the aspects of the loan contracts, including maturity, grace
period, repayment schedule, origination fees, and management fees.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

79

MALI

A. Floor on the Basic Fiscal Balance
21.
The basic fiscal balance is defined as the difference between net total revenue, plus
budgetary grants (general budgetary support) and HIPC resources, and total authorized expenses
plus net lending, excluding capital expenditure financed by creditors or donors, pursuant to the
definition of the basic fiscal balance in the WAEMU texts (Additional Act N° 05/2009/CCEG/UEMOA
of March 17, 2009, amending Act Nº04/1999 on the Convergence, Stability, Growth, and Solidarity
Pact).

V. ADJUSTER
22.
The floor on the basic fiscal balance is adjusted downward if budgetary grants (general
budgetary support) fall short of program projections. The adjuster will be applied at the rate of
100 percent up to a threshold of CFAF 25 billion and at a rate of 0 percent for larger amounts.
23.
Lastly, the floor on the basic fiscal balance will be adjusted downward (upward) for the
payment of VAT credits and other tax refunds exceeding (under) the programmed amounts
(MEFP, Tables 1 and 3).

B. Floor on Priority Poverty-Reducing Expenditure
24.
Priority poverty-reducing expenditure is defined as the sum of expenditure in the sectors of
basic education, secondary and higher education, scientific research, health, and social development
other than transfers to the Malian Social Security Fund (CMSS). It excludes project-related capital
expenditure financed by foreign technical and financial partners.

VI. STRUCTURAL BENCHMARKS
25.
Information concerning the implementation of measures constituting structural benchmarks
will be reported to the IMF staff no later than two weeks after their scheduled implementation date.
26.
As of May 31, 2011, changes have been to the Government Financial Operations Table
(TOFE) as described below. Income and expenses recorded in suspense accounts are reported
above the line as income or expenses, with no breakdown. In cash basis adjustments, a distinction is
made between operations charged to previous fiscal years and those charged to the current fiscal
year and, as well as, in the latter case, a distinction between funds in transit (less than three months)
and changes in arrears (more than three months) with respect to budgetary expenditures (including
VAT credits and called guarantees and pledges). Under the heading “net domestic financing,” bank
financing is separated from privatization income and from other financing. Bank financing includes
changes in the net position of the government vis-à-vis the central bank, the IMF, and the resident
commercial banks. In showing operations with commercial banks, a distinction is made between the
Treasury, the National Social Security Institute (INPS), and other government agencies. Other
financing includes mainly changes in cash accounts (uncashed checks), advance tax installments
received for the following year, adjustments to the installments received the previous year for the

80

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALI

current year, operations with nonresident WAEMU creditors, and changes in deposits and
consignments from Treasury correspondents.
27.
As of June 30, 2014, the available balances in current account opened for government
accounting officers included within the scope of the net government position, narrowly defined
(¶6), also known as the net Treasury position (NTP), with the exception of those located in regions
where the BCEAO is not present, will be transferred to the Treasury single account at the BCEAO.
The available balances are all the amounts in such accounts except for:


frozen Treasury accounts at the Malian Development Bank (BDM) in the amount of
CFAF 19.5 billion pursuant to the provisions of the privatization agreement concerning that
bank;



blocked Treasury funds at the Banque Régionale de Solidarité (BRS) in the amount of

Implementation of Catastrophe Containment and Relief (CCR): Not Applicable
As of February 4, 2015, the Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief Trust has been transformed to the
Catastrophe Containment and Relief (CCR) Trust.
Decision Point:
Point at which the IMF and the World Bank determine whether a country qualifies for assistance
under the HIPC Initiative and decides on the amount of assistance to be committed.
Interim Assistance:
Amount disbursed to a country during the period between decision and completion points, up
to 20 percent annually and 60 percent in total of the assistance committed at the decision point (or
25 percent and 75 percent, respectively, in exceptional circumstances).
Completion Point:
Point at which a country receives the remaining balance of its assistance committed at the decision
point, together with an additional disbursement of interest income as defined in footnote 2 above.
The timing of the completion point is linked to the implementation of pre-agreed key structural
reforms (i.e., floating completion point).
Safeguards Assessments: The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is the common central
bank of the countries of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). The latest
safeguards assessment of the BCEAO of December 13, 2013 found that the bank continued to have
a strong control environment and has enhanced its governance framework. Specifically, an internal
audit committee was established and progress is underway to strengthen its capacity with external
expertise to oversee the audit and financial reporting processes; transparency has increased with
more timely publication of the audited financial statements; and the BCEAO is committed to fully
comply with international financial reporting standards for the audit of FY 2015. The assessment also
identified some limitations in the external audit process and recommended that steps be taken to
ensure the adequacy of the mechanism through selection of a second experienced audit firm to
conduct joint external audits, which was done in 2015.
Exchange Rate Arrangements:
Mali is a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). The union’s
common currency, the CFA franc, was pegged to the French franc at the rate of CFAF 50 = FF 1
from 1948 until early 1994. Effective January 12, 1994, the CFA franc was devalued, and the new
parity set at CFAF 100 = FF 1. Effective January 1, 1999, the CFA franc was pegged to the Euro at a
rate of CFAF 655.96 = EUR 1.
As of June 1, 1996, Mali and other members of WAEMU accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. Mali’s exchange system has no restrictions
on making payments or transfers for current international transactions and the country does not
engage in multiple currency practices.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALI

Sharing a common trade policy with other members of WAEMU, Mali has shifted key trade policymaking to the sub-regional level. The common external tariff (CET) was adopted in January 2000.
Mali complies with the union’s tariff rate structure and has effectively dismantled internal tariffs.
Between 1997 and 2003, WAEMU tariff reform reduced the simple average custom duty from
22 percent to 15 percent; the maximum rate is currently 20 percent. Imports to Mali are not subject
to quantitative restrictions.
Mali’s exports to the European Union generally enjoy non-reciprocal preferential treatment in the
form of exemption from import duties under the Everything but Arms initiative. Malian goods enjoy
nonreciprocal preferential access to the markets of developed countries other than the European
Union under the Generalized System of Preferences. Mali is also eligible to benefit from the United
States’ African Growth and Opportunity Act. Mali imposes no de jure restrictions on exports.
Article IV Consultations:
Mali’s Article IV consultation cycle is governed by the provisions of the decision on consultation
cycles, Decision No. 14747–(10/96) (9/28/2010), as amended. The Executive Board completed the
last Article IV consultation (Country Report No. 13/44) on January 28, 2013.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Mali—Statistical Issues Appendix
(As of October 29, 2015)

I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: The National Institute of Statistics (INSTAT) released in August 2015 a new series of
annual national accounts covering the period 1999-2013, in accordance with the System of National
Accounts 1993 (SNA93) and adapted to certain characteristics specific to Mali. They are compiled on an
annual basis. There are, however, some weaknesses due to inadequacy of source data, along with
insufficient funding and technical staffing of the INSTAT. The work on implementing quarterly national
accounts is ongoing, with the support of AFRITAC West.
Price Statistics: In concert with the other member countries of the West African Economic and
Monetary Union (WAEMU), the INSTAT has been compiling and timely publishing a harmonized
consumer price index (CPI) for Bamako on a monthly basis since early 1998. The harmonized CPI has
been updated in 2010 with 2008 as the new reference year.
Government Finance Statistics: Broadly adequate. As part of the process of economic integration
among the member countries of the WAEMU, the country has made significant progress in bringing its
fiscal data in line with the common framework that has been developed with IMF technical assistance (the
harmonized table of government financial operations – TOFE based on the Government Finance Statistics
Manual 1986). However, further efforts are needed to improve the timeliness and coverage of the TOFE.
Work is progressing with the assistance of STA, AFRITAC West and AFRISTAT to expand the coverage of
the TOFE to public agencies and local governments, as well as to strengthen coverage of domestic
financing items. Quarterly budget execution reports are posted on the Ministry of Finance website on a
timely basis.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: African States (BCEAO) MFS are broadly adequate and their
institutional coverage is comprehensive. The dissemination of monthly monetary data from the BCEAO
takes four to six weeks consistent with e-GDDS recommendations. Data are posted on the BCEAO
website with a considerably longer lag. Accuracy is somewhat hampered by the use of 1990 sorting
coefficients to estimate cross border amounts of banknotes among BCEAO countries, which in turn are
used to estimate currency in circulation and to adjust the net foreign assets of each member country.
Standardized Report Forms (in line with the Monetary and Financial Statistical Manual) are still not
regularly used to report monetary data to the IMF.
Financial Sector Surveillance: Mali reports a basic set of financial soundness indicators on a quarterly
basis, except for profitability indicators, which are provided on an annual basis.
External Sector Statistics: In December 1998, the responsibility for compiling and disseminating balance
of payments statistics was formally assigned to the BCEAO by area-wide legislation adopted by the
countries participating in the WAEMU. The BCEAO national agency finalizes the data toward mid-

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALI

November of the following year, and publishes immediately thereafter in the form of a brochure, which
however are not sufficiently robust.
In general, the external sector statistics in Mali exhibit serious deficiencies. Concepts and definitions used
to compile the balance of payments statistics are in broad conformity with the guidelines presented in
the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). The adoption of BPM6 methodology is not
required before 2013/2014, except for the recording of SDR allocations as debt liabilities. The Mali
balance of payments metadata should also be updated.
The BCEAO set up a sub-regional unit responsible for reconciling intra-WAEMU trade data, which
is responsible for harmonizing the bilateral statistics of member states to eliminate asymmetries before
these data on internal transactions in the Union are consolidated to prepare the WAEMU regional
balance of payments. The corrections made are retroactive to national data and help to improve them.
Balance of payments data remain weak in a number of key areas. Data on remittances, foreign direct
investment, and portfolio flows are similarly weak. Several large in-kind projects are not captured in the
balance of payments data properly. However, project aid that used to be classified as current transfers are
now classified in the capital account.
Data on international investment position is published in IFS and BOPSY up to 2007. A foreign private
capital survey (FPC) from DFI called “PRC CPE” is underway as in all Franc Zone countries. However,
foreign assets of the private non banking sector are not well covered in the financial accounts as the
surveys of residents’ foreign assets remain very partial, and no use is made of an existing alternative
source, e.g., BIS statistics.
The April–May 2003 multi sector statistics mission found that the balance of payments compilation
system is generally sound and encouraged the authorities to integrate banking settlement sources and
disseminate the balance of payments within the recommended timeliness, as set by the GDDS. The first
of these recommendations remains pending. Annual statistics on balance of payments are reported to
STA on a regular basis, but with some delay.
In May 2013, the BECAO published a new methodology guide for the elaboration of the balance of
payments and the global external position for the WAEMU countries that is consistent with the sixth
edition of the IMF BOP Manual. Mali BOP is currently presented according to the new guide.
Mali reports balance of payments and international investment position data according to the
methodology of the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position
Statistics Manual (BPM6). The authorities have submitted 2013 balance of payments and IIP data for
publication in the 2015 Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook (BOPSY) and in the 2015 International
Financial Statistics Yearbook (IFSY).
II. Data Standards and Quality
Mali has been participating in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS) (and its successor eGDDS) since September 2001.

No data ROSC mission has been done in Mali.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION,
FOURTH REVIEW UNDER THE EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY
ARRANGEMENT, AND REQUEST FOR MODIFICATION OF A
PERFORMANCE CRITERION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By
Roger Nord and Peter Allum
(IMF) and John Panzer (IDA)

Prepared jointly by staffs of the International
Monetary Fund and the International Development
Association

Risk of external debt distress:

Moderate

Augmented by significant risks
stemming from domestic public debt?

No

Mali’s risk of debt distress continues to be assessed as moderate—unchanged from the
previous Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA). Debt sustainability is highly sensitive to a
tightening of financial terms, limiting the room for non-concessional borrowing. It is also
vulnerable to a reduction in transfers and foreign direct investment and an export shock
stemming from the concentration of exports in gold.

MALI

BACKGROUND
A. Recent Developments in Public External Debt
1.
As a result of the enhanced Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), Mali’s stock of external debt declined significantly in the
early to mid-2000s. Mali’s stock of public and publicly guaranteed external debt declined from 89 percent
of GDP in 2001 to 19 percent in 2006 owing to enhanced HIPC debt relief in 2002 and MDRI debt relief in
2006 (Text Table 1). At end-2014, it had increased to 25 percent of GDP owing mainly to new loans granted
by the International Development Association (IDA), the African Development Bank (ADB), the Islamic
Development Bank (IsDB), and the IMF (mainly through an allocation of SDR 74 million in 2009). The bulk
of Mali’s stock of external public debt is owed to multilateral creditors, mainly IDA, ADB and IsDB. There are

B. Recent Developments in Public Domestic Debt
2.
Mali’s domestic public debt is low but has increased rapidly over the past few years. At end
2014, domestic public debt was 7.4 percent of GDP, compared to 2.3 percent of GDP in 2009 (Text Table 2).
The outstanding stock consists mainly of treasury bills and bonds issued on the regional market of the

gross external liabilities of the Malian non-bank sector vis-à-vis banks that report to the Bank of International
Settlements (BIS). The latter may also include any debt of the public sector to BIS-reporting banks.

West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), but it also includes some arrears owed to domestic
suppliers that have been validated through audits and recognized as debt by the authorities. The sharp
increase in the stock of domestic debt between 2009 and 2014 resulted mainly from new issuances of
treasury bills and bonds. The increase also reflects the inclusion of debt previously unreported in the official
statistics, following an inventory of all loans contracted or guaranteed by the government that the
authorities have been conducting as part of their plan to strengthen debt management.

C. Debt Burden Thresholds under the Debt Sustainability Framework
3.
Mali is a medium policy performer for the purpose of determining the debt burden
thresholds under the Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF). Mali’s rating on the World Bank’s Country
Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) averaged 3.38 (on a scale of 1 to 6) during 2012–14, making it a
medium policy performer. The corresponding external public debt burden thresholds are shown in Text
Table 3.

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
A. Baseline Scenario
4.
In the short run, the economy is expected to grow slightly above trend as the recovery
following the political and security crisis of 2012 takes hold. The baseline scenario remains broadly in
line with that of the December 2014 DSA2 and assumes a stable political environment, the implementation
of sound macroeconomic and structural policies, and the resumption of aid and foreign direct investment
(FDI). Notable revisions compared to the December 2014 DSA include (Text Table 4):


Real GDP growth is expected to be slightly weaker in the near term (2015) on the back of
unusually strong agricultural production during the previous year. In the long run, growth is
assumed to revert toward the historical average of 4.5 percent



Oil prices are around 20 percent lower over the projection period, expected to result in a
modest boost to the trade balance in the medium term from lower oil imports.



Gold prices are around 7 percent lower over the projection period, although the impact on
the value of export receipts is offset in the near term by upward revisions to the projected
volume of production from existing mines and production from new mines expected to
come on stream during the next five years. From 2019, however, the volume of gold
production is expected to decline by around 2 percent per annum.



The medium-term current account deficit (excluding grants) is expected to be higher than in
the previous DSA in the medium term, due to staffs’ updated assumption of the likely
duration of international military assistance and associated military services imports.3



The medium-term current account deficit (including grants) is expected to be lower than in
the previous DSA in the medium term, due to the beneficial impact of lower oil prices on
imports.



The overall fiscal deficit (excluding grants) is projected to be slightly lower than in the
previous DSA in 2015 due to under-executed capital spending, but broadly similar further
out.



All new external borrowing is projected to be on similar terms as in the recent past. The
main change with respect to the previous DSA is a projected increase in the share of Mali’s
external loans provided by Chinese development banks.

See Joint IDA/IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis in the IMF Country Report No. 14/337.

3

International military assistance is registered in the balance of payments as imports of security services financed by
grants and includes the United Nations MINUSMA mission and the French Barkhane operation. Although
MINUSMA’s mandate is renewed on an annual basis there are no indications it will be wound down soon, while to
Staff’s knowledge, there is no published end-date for Barkhane.

5.
The central feature of Mali’s medium- and long-term external sector outlook is the steady
decline of annual gold production expected to be compensated only in part by other exports. The
baseline long-term scenario assumes trend GDP growth of 4.5 percent—in line with the historical
average—as strong growth in the secondary and tertiary sectors offsets the steady decline of gold
production (Box 1). Inflation is expected to remain moderate as prudent fiscal policies are implemented
with no recourse to domestic borrowing on a net basis, and the monetary policy stance stays consistent
with the objectives of the regional central bank. The current account deficit is expected to remain stable
(8–9 percent of GDP excluding grants, 6 percent including grants) as the decline in gold exports is
compensated by an increase of other exports including agricultural products and other minerals, and a
deceleration in import growth. The deceleration of import growth stems from the decline in gold exports
that are particularly import intensive relative to other exports.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALI

Box 1. Mali: Macroeconomic Assumptions Underlying the Baseline Scenario, 2015–35
 Real GDP growth. It is expected to remain robust as Mali’s recovery from the recent political and
security challenges takes hold. Near term growth in 2015 is projected to remain strong at 5 percent,
while long-term growth is expected to average 4.5 percent per year. This is moderately higher than the
trend observed during the past 10 years which included the 2012 crisis (4.3 percent) but broadly in line
with average growth over the past 30 years. Gold output is projected to decline by around 2 percent
annually starting in 2019 but strong growth in the secondary and tertiary sectors, aided by political
stability and supported by structural reforms, is expected to offset this decline over time. With a
projected rapid population growth, the baseline scenario thus assumes low per capita income growth
and therefore continuous access to concessional financing linked to low income status.
 Consumer price inflation. It is projected to remain below the WAEMU convergence criterion of
3 percent, reflecting low global inflation and normal domestic weather conditions.
 Fiscal policy. Owing to pressing public spending needs related to implementation of the peace
agreement1, the overall fiscal deficit (excluding grants) is expected to remain close to 6 percent of GDP
in 2015. The 2015 deficit is expected to be financed by higher disbursements of grants and loans
pledged by the international community to help with the country’s recovery from the 2012–13 crisis,
some of which represent undisbursed support from 2014. Thereafter, the overall fiscal deficit (excluding
grants) is projected to come down to and average around 5.4 percent of GDP in 2021–35, and to be
financed in equal proportion by grants and external loans. The basic fiscal balance (revenue plus
budgetary grants minus domestically financed expenditure) is expected to remain at zero from 2018
onwards and the overall fiscal balance at 3 percent of GDP, in line with the convergence criterion of the
WAEMU, of which Mali is a member. Tax revenue, as a percent of GDP, is expected to increase by about
5.0 percentage points over the projection period, finance the increase of domestically financed
expenditure, and compensate the reduction of aid after the post-crisis surge in 2013–15. Therefore,
there is no recourse to additional domestic borrowing to finance the budget, except for rolling over
current stock of domestic debt at market rates.
 The non-interest current account deficit (including transfers). It is projected to average 6.1 percent
of GDP over 2021–35, slightly above the historic average (6.8 percent of GDP). It is expected to decline
from 5.5 percent of GDP in 2014 to 2.5 percent of GDP in 2015, mainly resulting from a decline in the
value of oil imports due to lower oil prices. The improvement in the current account (including grants),
in turn, is expected to lead to a small accumulation of reserves at the BCEAO. Gold export volumes are
expected to decline steadily over time, with the share of gold in total exports projected to fall from
67 percent in 2014 to about 31 percent in 2035.2 This decline is projected to be compensated in part by
a gradual increase in other exports (including food, cotton, tourism and other minerals such as cement,
phosphate, uranium, bauxite, iron ore, copper, nickel, oil) and in part by a deceleration of import growth.
Remittances are projected to remain at their current level of 7 percent of GDP.

See paragraph 1 of Staff Report.
New mining projected to come on stream from 2018 is, however, expected to provide some support to gold exports in
the medium term.

B. External DSA
6.
Under the baseline assumptions, all external debt and debt-service ratios remain below the
policy-dependent thresholds throughout the projection period (Figure 1a). The present value (PV) of
external debt, calculated using a 5 percent discount rate, is expected to remain broadly constant
throughout the projection period, between 15 and 19 percent of GDP (Table 1a). As production from

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

MALI

existing and planned new gold mines declines starting in 2019 and growth of other exports only partly
compensate for that decline, the PV of the external debt-to-exports ratio is projected to increase from
52 percent in 2014 to 143 percent in 2035, only slightly below the threshold of 150 percent (Figure 1a,
Table 1a). With a 5 percentage point increase in tax revenue to GDP during the projection period, the PV of
the external debt-to-revenue ratio is expected to remain broadly stable between 70% - 80% percent of
GDP, significantly below the threshold of 250 percent (Figure 1a, Table 1a).
7.
Under the alternative probability approach, all external debt and debt-service ratios also
remain below the policy-dependent thresholds throughout the projection period (Figure 1b). Since
Mali’s debt-to-export ratio lies within 10 percent of the threshold in the baseline case (and is hence
considered borderline), the use of the “probability approach” is recommended. The “probability approach”
is an alternative and complementary methodology for assessing external debt sustainability, based on the
evolution of the probability of debt distress over time, rather than on the evolution of debt burden
indicators. Under the probability approach, the projected probability of debt distress (expressed as a
percent) associated with each debt burden indicator is compared to a threshold level, which in contrast to
the baseline approach, is country specific; in this case, the thresholds incorporate Mali’s individual CPIA
score and average GDP growth rate. Application of the probability approach in Mali’s case yields a similar
conclusion as the standard approach, except that there are now no breaches under any of the shocks
(Figure 1b).
8.
Mali’s external debt sustainability is most sensitive to a tightening of financial terms while
also being vulnerable to a reduction in transfers and FDI and an export shock. Under a bound test
where financial terms are tightened by 2 percentage points over the projection period, the PV of debt-toexports ratio would breach the threshold in 2024 and continue to increase until the end of the projection
period to reach about 270 percent in 2035 (Figure 1a, Table 1b, Scenario A2). Under a bound test that
reduces FDI and official and private transfers in 2016–17 by 5 percent of GDP, the PV of the debt-to-exports
ratio would exceed the threshold from 2019 until the end of the projection period (Table 1b, Scenario B4).
And under a bound test that reduces export growth temporarily in 2016–17 with the effect of reducing
exports levels permanently by 15 percent, the PV of the debt-to-exports ratio would breach the threshold
in 2030 (Table 1b, Scenario B2). Under the probability approach, stress tests do not result in breaches of
thresholds, though the margin relative to the threshold for the debt-to-export ratio is very small. Under this
approach, external debt is most sensitive to a shock to non-debt flows for all debt level and debt service
indicators (Figure 1b).
9.
Mali’s external debt sustainability assessment remains similar when remittances are
accounted for.4 Workers’ remittances represent a reliable source of foreign exchange in Mali, averaging
7 percent of GDP during the past three years. Under the baseline assumptions, all external debt and debtservice ratios remain below the policy-dependent thresholds throughout the projection period (Figure 2,
Table 3). Over 2015–35, the PV of debt-to-GDP plus remittances remains broadly constant, between 14 and
18 percent, and the PV of debt-to-exports plus remittances increases from 47 percent to 96 percent. Under
4

8

Note that the risk of external debt distress is based on the without-remittances assessment.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALI

a bound test that tightens financial terms, the PV of debt-to-exports plus remittances ratio would breach
the threshold in 2022, and remain above it for the entire projection period through 2032 (Figure 2, Table 3).

C. Public DSA
10.
The inclusion of domestic debt does not alter the assessment of Mali’s debt sustainability.
Given the small size of Mali’s domestic debt and the absence of recourse to additional domestic borrowing
in the baseline scenario, the public debt sustainability analysis closely mirrors the external debt
sustainability analysis (Figure 3 and Table 2a). The PV of public sector debt-to-GDP ratio stays between
23 and 28 percent of GDP during the whole projection period. However, in light of the recent rapid growth
in the stock of domestic debt (¶2), new domestic borrowing should be closely monitored.
11.
The Malian authorities broadly agreed with the conclusions of the DSA. Staffs stressed the
importance of continuing to meet their financing needs with grants and concessional loans with a
minimum grant element of 35 percent, where possible. The authorities indicated they found some of the
DSA assumptions, notably on long-run economic growth (4.5 percent), conservative, but shared the staff’s
overall assessment. In accordance with the Fund’s new debt limits policy, which will be applicable to Mali
under its Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement following the current 4th review, the authorities agreed
a borrowing plan for 2015 and 2016 with IMF staff. Based on this, a ceiling for the nominal value of new
external borrowing contracted during these years was included in the ECF-supported program.

D. Conclusion
12.
The DSA indicates that Mali remains at moderate risk of debt distress based on the external
debt burden indicators. Although none of the debt burden thresholds are breached over the 20–year
projection period under the baseline scenario—unchanged from the last DSA—the alternative scenario
shows a sustained breach of the debt-to-exports limit under the most extreme shock. Contrary to this
finding, the probability approach does not show breaches of the thresholds under stress tests, which could
be consistent with a low risk of debt distress. However, the debt-to-export threshold is almost breached by
stress tests on this approach, and given Mali’s undiversified export base and significant uncertainties
surrounding both gold export prices and volumes, vulnerabilities on this front merit retaining a moderate
risk of debt distress rating. Debt sustainability is highly sensitive to a tightening of financing terms,
underscoring the importance for the Malian government of continuing to meet its external financing needs
with grants and concessional loans, wherever possible, and where loans are contracted on less concessional
terms, ensuring that the underlying projects deliver a high return on investment. In addition to a financing
shock, Mali’s debt sustainability is also vulnerable to a reduction in transfers and FDI, and an export shock
owing to the export concentration in gold. Given the expected decline in gold exports in the medium term,
and the uncertain prospects for export diversification, improving export performance in other sectors to
compensate for the expected decline in gold exports will also be critical to maintaining external debt
sustainability.

1/ Public sector external debt only.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); project grants, changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate
changes. The calculation of the residual assumes the capital account is a debt-creating flow, which is inappropriate in Mali's case since the capital account consists primarily of project grants (around 2% of GDP).
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

4/ Debt service is defined as the sum of interest and amortization of medium and long-term debt.
5/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability. The historical average for the primary deficit, however, excludes 2006 (the year of MDRI debt relief and hence an unusually
large primary surplus).

Statement by Mr. Ngueto Tiraina Yambaye, Executive Director for Mali and
by Mr. Oumar Diakite, Advisor to the Executive Director
December 2, 2015

Our Malian authorities are appreciative of the constructive discussions held with staff last
September in Bamako during the 2015 Article IV consultations and the fourth review under
the Extended Credit Facility (ECF). The policy discussions focused on achieving structural
transformation and long-run growth, creating space for priority spending, and strengthening
the financial system, while also addressing the security situation, climatic and terms of trade
shocks. Our authorities broadly concur with the main recommendations in the staff report.
The good performance in the context of the ECF-supported program demonstrated the
progress achieved by Mali in restoring and maintaining macroeconomic stability. All
performance criteria at end-June 2015 were met, and four out of five structural measures
were implemented.
The authorities are striving to improve the prospects for stability and security in the country.
A peace agreement with rebel groups was signed in June 2015 which represents an important
milestone in the efforts to restore peace in the north of the country. The authorities also
organized jointly with the OECD in Paris a high level international conference on October
22, 2015, in co-operation with France and other partners of Mali. The expected assistance of
the international community will be essential to allow the government to implement its
development strategy, particularly in the northern regions.
In spite of this encouraging progress, it is worth noting that Mali continues to face security
threats as demonstrated by the recent terrorist attacks operated in the capital Bamako on
November 20, 2015. The casualties resulting from this terror besides its impact on the
population and economic activity call for further strengthening of the security and increased
international cooperation against terrorism in the region. Therefore, it is important that
security issues be forcefully addressed in the context of Fund’s surveillance and supportedprograms.
Recent Economic Developments and Performance under the ECF
In 2015, real GDP growth is expected to return to normal level following the rebound in
2014. It is projected at 4.9 percent, compared to 7.2 percent last year and reflects the strong
growth in the primary and secondary sectors. As in 2014, agricultural output is expected to
remain strong due to favorable rainfalls and early distribution of agricultural inputs.
Performance in the secondary and tertiary sectors should also be sustained, while inflation
would be contained at 2.4 percent, up from 0.9 percent in 2014.
Following the decline in oil prices since mid-2014, the external current account deficit
(including grants) is projected to narrow to 2.8 percent of GDP, compared to 5.5 percent in
2014. This deficit is expected to be entirely financed by net capital inflows in the form of

2
foreign aid and FDI. As a result, the overall balance of payments should post a surplus of
about US$14 million, with increased international reserves.
The soundness of the financial sector improved slightly. In the banking system, the riskweighted capital ratio increased from 12.7 percent in December 2014 to 14.7 percent in
March 2015. The government made a determined effort to clear its arrears to suppliers, which
helped nonperforming loans (NPLs) to decrease from 18.9 percent in June 2014 to
16.3 percent in June 2015. The financial stability of the microfinance sector also improved
with the share of NPLs decreasing from 8.8 percent in 2014 to 8.2 percent at end-June 2014.
In the fiscal sector, the authorities continued their efforts to increase tax revenue and
implement a prudent expenditure policy. During the first semester of 2015, tax revenue
returned to the trajectory of the program and increased by 22 percent compared to 2014, as
the authorities maintained the higher level of taxation on petroleum products observed since
the beginning of the year. Furthermore, they implemented a results-based management
framework in revenue-collecting agencies which resulted in positive outcomes on tax
revenue. On the other hand, expenditures were lower than programmed due to the slow
procurement process for capital expenditures in the beginning of the year. Important efforts
were also made to strengthen public financial management notably by preventing the
accumulation of arrears, supporting business cash flows, thus contributing to the reduction of
NPLs in the banking sector. In light of these positive fiscal developments, the overall fiscal
deficit in the program has been reviewed downwards from 3.8 percent of GDP to 2.5 percent.
The overall performance under the ECF program was satisfactory. All performance criteria
and indicative targets at end-June 2015 were met. Four out of five structural benchmarks
were observed. The measure on the monitoring of import value declarations has been
postponed as the Customs Administration could not prepare a monthly reconciliation report
since its contract with the inspection company does not provide for that activity. The
authorities intend to amend the contract accordingly and implement this measure during the
first semester of 2016.
Economic and Financial policies in the medium term
The economic and financial policies of the government will continue to be based mainly on
the priorities of the growth and poverty reduction strategy paper (CSCRP) for the period
2012–17. In addition, other specific programs will guide the development efforts of the
country, such as the Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation (ARPM) signed in May 2015
and which envisages the creation of a development zone in the northern regions of the
country, together with a larger transfer of revenues to the regions.
Fiscal Policy and Reforms
Our authorities are mindful that creating fiscal space for priority spending is a necessity in
the pursuit of long-run economic growth. They remain committed to implement a sustainable

3
fiscal policy, while giving priority to poverty reduction expenditures and addressing
infrastructure gaps. To this end, they will focus on improving the management of public
finances and enhancing revenue mobilization.
On the revenue side, the authorities are committed to increase the ratio of tax revenue to
GDP by at least 1 percent in 2016 through fiscal reforms aimed at broadening the tax base.
The reforms initiated at the Tax, Customs and Government property administrations
supported by a results-based management framework to enhance revenue collection will be
pursued.
The authorities will also continue their efforts to gradually reduce exemptions notably by
establishing a central file of tax and customs duties exemptions. This will allow determining
the stock of exemptions granted by type of taxes, legal reference, and beneficiaries as a basis
for their gradual reduction. The control of discretionary exemptions will be pursued. Starting
with the 2016 budget and to the extent possible, the authorities aim to also gradually reduce
exemptions under the Tax, Customs, Investment, Mining, petroleum and real estate codes.
The exemptions granted to donor-financed development projects will also be discussed with
the donors’ community with a view to eliminate them.
The government is also committed to stop the erosion of fiscal revenue on petroleum
products, notably by calculating the retail price structure on the basis of actual market value.
They will continue to implement the new petroleum product price adjustment mechanism
which will pass on the evolution of petroleum products prices to retail prices within a margin
of 3 percent a month, as long as there are no protracted periods of price increases.
The efforts aimed at simplifying fiscal legislation will also be pursued with the objective of
reducing the administrative burden on taxpayers and simplifying tax collection. Among the
measures envisaged, the simplification of the minimum tax applied to small tax payers with a
uniform rate of 3 percent is noteworthy. This should facilitate tax compliance by this
category of taxpayers which are mostly in the informal sector. The authorities also intend to
increase revenue from mining and oil activities, while improving the environment for private
sector investments. With the assistance of the IMF Trust Fund on managing natural resource
wealth, they will undertake the revision of the mining and petroleum code based on
international standards.
On the expenditure side, the efforts to improve the regulatory framework for public financial
management in the context of regional directives and regulations will be pursued. In this
regard, the WAMU directives will continue to be transposed into the Malian laws, as it was
done for the directives related to the transparency code, budget laws, public accounting, and
the government chart of accounts and flow of funds table (TOFE)). The authorities will step
up their efforts to improve the preparation, execution and control of the budget, and treasury
operations as well. In this respect, the effectiveness of the single Treasury account opened at
the regional central bank (BCEAO) will be strengthened with the integration of the accounts

4
held by public administrative agencies operating under the direct control of the government.
The implementation of the national internal control strategy for 2012–15 will continue in
order to strengthen internal control structures, notably by enhancing the capacities of the
accounting section of the Supreme Court which is expected to be transformed into a Court of
Audit. A new public procurement code, which benefitted from technical assistance support
from the World Bank, has been adopted.
External debt and Structural Reforms
The authorities will continue to meet their external financing needs while preserving debt
sustainability. To this end, they will have recourse mostly to grants and highly concessional
loans. A detailed borrowing plan has been prepared, outlining each loan agreement envisaged
for the period 2015–16, the amounts disbursed and financial terms consistent with the
framework of the new Fund debt limit policy. In that context, a ceiling of approximately
US$426 million of non concessional borrowing is envisaged to finance critical investments in
the transport and electricity sectors. IMF staff will be consulted during the next program
review if there is a need to finance additional investment projects. In order to improve debt
management, a national debt committee has been established with the view to examine all
loans or publicly guaranteed contracts and publishing a yearly debt strategy document to be
annexed to the budget.
Our Malian authorities recognize that infrastructure investments and good governance are
essential to private sector development. To this effect, they will steadfastly implement
structural reforms aimed at achieving more inclusive growth. They are committed to take
measures to promote the stability and development of the financial sector, to reform the
electricity sector, mobilize resources for infrastructure investments and improve economic
governance.
The authorities will take steps to address the weaknesses of the financial sector. The Housing
Bank (BHM) will be restructured in two stages. In the first stage, the BHM will be merged
with the stronger and larger Malian Solidarity Bank (BMS) and its capital opened to private
investors. In the second stage, the government intends to divest itself from its equity stake in
the bank. Another important step to reduce the concentration of risks in the banking sector
will be to strengthen the credit reporting bureau that was established in May 2015. The action
plan for the microfinance sector will also be implemented in order to restore confidence and
allow this sector to play its crucial role of promoting financial inclusion and hence economic
growth. Regarding the electricity sector, the government will seek to eliminate the structural
deficit and put the electricity company (EDM) on a sound financial footing. Actions to
promote good governance will also be pursued, notably the implementation of the law
against illicit enrichment and the strengthening of the legal framework for AML/CFT based
on the recommendations of the IMF technical assistance.

5
Conclusion
Our Malian authorities remain committed to the objectives of the ECF program. They will
continue to implement the reforms aimed at achieving strong economic growth, preserve
macroeconomic stability and improve public financial management as well as the business
environment. In view of Mali’s satisfactory progress under the ECF arrangement, and the
commitment to pursue the reforms, I would appreciate Directors’ support for the completion
of the fourth review and modification of a performance criterion.
