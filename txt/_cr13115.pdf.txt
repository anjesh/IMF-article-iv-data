STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 17, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context: The Netherlands’ track record of robust public finances and status as a safe
haven are attributes of the euro area (EA) AAA countries. However, the economy faces
many of the challenges of the periphery economies, including headwinds from a highly
indebted household sector, significant financial sector stresses, declining real estate
prices, and weak domestic demand.
Risks: The cycle of household and bank deleveraging, declining house prices and weak
domestic demand would be amplified by any adverse external developments,
particularly in the rest of the euro area, unanticipated shocks to domestic confidence, or
heightened policy uncertainty. A more medium-term risk is that policy measures fail to
avoid a decline in the economy’s growth potential.
Policy recommendations: The main policy challenge is to restore growth and manage
downside risks, while allowing for an orderly adjustment of private sector balance sheets.
Fiscal consolidation should focus on structural targets aimed at ensuring sustainable
public debt dynamics over the medium term, and avoid excessive procyclicality linked to
short-term macroeconomic developments. Ensuring the resilience of the banking system
is a top priority, given its exposure to falling real estate prices and heavy reliance on
wholesale funding. The measured pace of implementation of housing sector policies,
including reductions in mortgage interest deductibility (MID) and loan-to-value (LTV)
ratios, is appropriate. Additional policies to improve the functioning of housing and
labor markets should be phased in.

INTRODUCTION
1.
The Netherlands is an AAA euro area (EA) economy, but with significant private sector
imbalances. It shares an AAA credit rating and relatively robust public finances with Germany,
Finland, and Luxembourg. Like Germany, its sovereign bonds enjoy safe haven status, and it has a
growing net international asset position since 2008. However, it also has a highly indebted
household sector, significant financial sector challenges, declining real estate prices, and weak
domestic demand. As a result, the Netherlands’ GDP growth, unemployment, and public debt
dynamics since the onset of the global financial crisis have diverged from other AAA EA economies
(Figure 1).
2.
The main policy challenge over the near term is to restore growth and manage
downside risks, while allowing for an orderly adjustment of private sector balance sheets.
Policy actions should be executed in a predictable manner to minimize policy uncertainty and
support confidence, with a focus on the unwinding of accumulated distortions and balance sheet
imbalances as well as on protecting the economy’s growth potential. Fiscal consolidation should
focus on structural targets while allowing

term priorities.
3.
The staff's diagnosis and policy advice is built around an analytical framework that
considers the Netherlands to be undergoing a balance sheet recession linked to the
adjustment of house prices. The outlook is clouded by uncertainty mainly surrounding the future
path of house prices, as well as the policy environment and developments in the rest of the EA.
Reasonable counterarguments to the underlying analytical framework could be made, which would
have implications for the appropriateness of staff’s main policy recommendations, which are to let
house prices adjust naturally and to anchor fiscal policy around medium-term objectives linked to
specific structural measures. The section "Point and Counterpoint to the Staff’s Views” (p.22)
attempts to highlight possible counterarguments to the staff's diagnosis and key policy
recommendations that readers may pose, and offers responses.

The extended weakness in activity in the Netherlands reflects the slow deleveraging of
the household and financial sectors. Prior to 2008, in the context of ample global liquidity, a
favorable macroeconomic environment, and supportive tax and regulatory incentives, households
had accumulated substantial mortgage debt with generous loan-to-value (LTV) ratios and
advantageous mortgage interest deductibility (MID). Household debt as a share of disposable
income doubled over the past decade—to the highest in the euro area—and drove up house prices
to unsustainable levels. Meanwhile, banks’ assets-to-GDP rose to a peak of 4 times GDP by 2011

below the 2008 level five years on.

B. Outlook and Risks
Staff’s Views
5.
Balance sheet adjustments in the context of weakness in the rest of the EA will
continue to be a drag on the recovery and delay external adjustment. Despite the
nominal 20 percent correction since the peak, a further decline in house prices is expected to weigh
on consumer confidence and consumption. With the banking system highly exposed to the real
estate sector and continuing to rely on

expected to widen marginally through 2014. In line with these projections, the output gap will
narrow only gradually over the forecast horizon.
6.
The baseline outlook is subject to a number of downside risks. The interaction of
household and bank balance sheets linked through changes in house prices makes the outlook
subject to unusually large uncertainty. A drop in house prices in excess of what is currently assumed,
although a low likelihood event, would further restrain both household consumption and lending by
banks, and could in turn lead to a deepening cycle of falling house prices and deleveraging, clearly a
high impact event (see paragraph 14 for appropriate policy responses). Solvency requirements in
pension funds also weigh on consumer confidence as benefits and contributions need to be
adjusted procyclically. 1 Persistent uncertainty about structural policies and the degree of
procyclicality of fiscal policies could also act as a restraint on household spending decisions and
postpone the recovery. External developments, especially in the rest of the EA, that add to
uncertainty, generate financial stress, weaken consumer confidence, and lower exports, would
adversely affect activity in the Netherlands (see discussion of related policy challenges in paragraphs
8-11 and 13) (Figure 4).These medium-likelihood risks would have a medium to high impact in the
Netherlands. A more medium-term risk is that policy measures fail to avoid a decline in the
economy’s growth potential, with medium likelihood and medium impact on the Dutch economy
(discussed in paragraphs 28-30). On the upside, a rapid reduction in uncertainty and a recovery in
consumer confidence could help support the outlook.

The Authorities’ Views
7.
The authorities agreed with the staff’s analysis of the outlook and risks. They noted that
the ongoing balance sheet recession would act as a drag on activity for an extended period, and
that uncertainty among households remains elevated. They were of the view that the bottoming out
of house prices would mark a turning point for the economy. On pension funds, the authorities
shared the view that a stable and predictable discount rate would reduce uncertainty about the level
of expected pension benefits and contributions and make it less procyclical. Finally, the authorities
agreed that external developments, especially in the rest of the EA, would strongly influence the
outlook.

Reforms introduced in 2011 aimed at improving solvency in pension funds. In addition, regulation requires pension
funds to implement recovery plans if their coverage ratio is less than 105 percent.

SUPPORTING RECOVERY WHILE MANAGING THE
ADJUSTMENT OF BALANCE SHEETS
The main policy challenge over the near term is to restore growth and manage downside risks, while
allowing for an orderly adjustment of private sector balance sheets.

A. Fiscal Policy
Background
8.
Following structural fiscal consolidation of around 1 percent of GDP last year, an
additional 1.6 percent structural tightening is envisaged this year with some additional
tightening planned over 2014–17. Despite the 1.6 percent of fiscal tightening in structural terms
envisaged in 2013, the considerably weaker macroeconomic outlook this year points to a headline
deficit of 3.4 percent in 2013 under the staff’s baseline (0.7 ppt higher than under the December
2012 Update of the Stability Program), broadly in line with the authorities’ projections. The
authorities now aim to attain the target of a headline deficit below 3 percent by end-2014, with
proposed additional structural measures of around €4.3 billion (0.7 percent of GDP). The measures
consist mostly of freezing income tax indexation and public sector wages in the health sector and
general government. The current baseline does not include these additional discretionary policy
measures, because they are pending approval in parliament.

Staff’s Views
9.
Fiscal policies should reduce the risk of a self-reinforcing downward spiral of
deleveraging and economic contraction. While the Netherlands’ strong public finances are central
to its role as an anchor for the EA, excessive procyclical tightening could be self-defeating as only
modest improvements in public sector balance sheets would come at the cost of worsening
household balance sheets and financial sector fragility. There is also little evidence to suggest that
the safe haven status of the Netherlands and its low borrowing costs are linked to meeting shortterm headline deficit targets. Making fiscal policy conditional on frequent revisions to the near-term
macroeconomic outlook would introduce unnecessary uncertainty into households’ and firms’
decisions to consume and invest, and possibly lead to greater output losses than necessary. Were
the cycle of low growth and deleveraging to become entrenched, this could pose longer-term risks
to the sustainability of public debt and damage the economy’s growth potential (Figure 5).
10.
Fiscal consolidation should therefore focus on structural targets and allow automatic
stabilizers to operate fully. In the staff’s view, the fiscal policy commitments made under the
December 2012 Update of the Stability Program remain appropriate and budgeted expenditures
should be fully executed. The envisaged structural consolidation (including measures to contain the
growth of public healthcare expenditures) would ensure that public debt is firmly on a downward
trajectory over the medium term, while automatic stabilizers would act as a shock absorber for
shorter term macroeconomic volatility. Moreover, since the medium-term path has been

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS—NETHERLANDS

communicated and internalized, it could serve as an anchor for expectations by making the fiscal
policy stance more predictable and less dependent on short-term macroeconomic developments.
Frequent discretionary changes in the fiscal policy stance would be avoided.
11.
The authorities’ decision not to undertake any additional measures in 2013 is
appropriate and additional discretionary measures for next year are not necessary. Under the
staff’s baseline, this would imply that the headline deficit would remain slightly above 3 percent
in 2014, and would decline to below 3 percent by 2016 as the recovery becomes firmly established.
This would ensure that debt is on a declining trajectory over the medium term and that
unemployment does not rise beyond what is currently projected. Most importantly, the Netherlands’
fiscal credibility would remain secure.

The Authorities’ Views
12.
The authorities stated that the goal to meet the 3 percent deficit target in 2014 is
appropriate. In their view, the headline deficit target is a measure of fiscal policy credibility and
enjoys the broad support of the public. As a result, the authorities see meeting the target as soon as
possible as supportive of stability and a means to anchor policy expectations. They see the benefits
of enhanced credibility and adherence to EU rules as outweighing the uncertain benefits of a slightly
less procyclical stance.

B. Financial Sector Policies
Background
13.
The Dutch financial system is large relative to the size of the economy and remains
heavily reliant on wholesale funding. Dutch banks have significant exposure to the real estate
sector domestically— residential real estate loans represent about 30 percent of total loans—in
addition to large cross-border exposures. Ensuring adequate buffers to falling real estate prices and
allowing orderly deleveraging thus assumes systemic importance given the potential for outward
spillovers. As regards outward bank spillovers, the three most exposed countries (defined in terms of
consolidated claims of Dutch banks as a percentage of borrower country GDP) are Luxembourg
(38.7), Belgium (25.4), and Ireland (8.7). In absolute terms, the most exposed countries are Germany
(€145 billion), United States (€136 billion), and the United Kingdom (€120 billion).2

Staff’s Views
14.
Given banks’ exposure to the real estate sector, and the significant exposure of the
public sector to the banking system through capital and guarantees, proactive measures to
shore up capital from private sources need to be stepped up. Three of the top four banks are

2

BIS data as of September 2012.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS—NETHERLANDS

reliant on significant public sector support which will need to be scaled back.3 As underscored by
the nationalization of fourth largest bank SNS REAAL on February 1, banks should be strongly
encouraged by the regulator to build additional capital buffers to guard against any systemic threats
from the real estate sector. This could take the form of issuing additional equity and higher retained
earnings. Higher capital would also allow banks to lengthen the maturity profile of wholesale
funding liabilities and reduce vulnerability to funding shocks. Thus far an abrupt pullback in lending
has been avoided as rising deposits have helped reduce the loan-to-deposit ratio. Nevertheless, a
reduction in assets will also be necessary. It will be important to ensure that the pull back in assets is
done in an orderly manner both domestically and for cross-border lending to avoid adverse external
spillovers.4
15.
Overseas exposures of banks would need to be rationalized carefully by focusing on
core business lines to avoid adverse outward spillovers. Dutch banks have sizable overseas
exposures (Figure 4). While the largest nominal exposures are to large economies including
Germany and the United States, Dutch banks are notable in their exposures as a share of host
country GDP in several other countries. Some Dutch banks are also significant players in global trade
financing, particularly of commodity trade including for a number of low-income countries, and the
process of deleveraging should ensure that global trade is not adversely affected.
16.
The treatment of senior creditors of banks needs the introduction of rules at the EU
level, carefully weighing the trade-off between financial stability and protection of taxpayers.
In the case of SNS REAAL, the authorities fully expropriated equity and subordinated debt holders,
while deciding not to bail-in senior creditors. The government nationalized the bank and provided
€2.2 billion in new capital, €1.1 billion in new loans and €5 billion in guarantees. In addition,
€0.8 billion was written off from an earlier aid package and €0.7 billion was used to put the real
estate portfolio at arm’s length. This operation added 0.6 percent to the deficit in 2013 and
1.6 percent to national debt. In the absence of rules at the EU level on the treatment of senior
creditors and loss-sharing, a unilateral bailing-in of senior creditors in the case of SNS REAAL could
have induced funding stress on other banks and led to systemic repercussions. Looking ahead, staff
support a clear European framework for applying the hierarchy of creditor claims under resolution
while ensuring the protection of insured depositors.

3

With the notable exception of SNS REAAL, banks have made progress in the repayment of public support. In
November 2012, ING agreed with the European Community to amend its restructuring plan and committed to repay
the remaining capital plus the 50 percent exit premium to the Dutch state in 4 equal tranches. The government has
also announced that it expects to sell its stake in ABN Amro, preferably through an initial public offering, but not
before 2014. However, the Dutch state still has a large stake in the banking system as of end-2012, with guarantees
on bank liabilities totaling €17.5 billion, capital injections in the amount of €30.7 billion, an asset relief facility of
€7.8 billion, and a liquidity support equivalent to €3.7 billion. In addition, the rescue of SNS-REAAL has further
increased the exposure of taxpayers to the banking sector, with €3.7 billion to stabilize SNS REAAL and its newlycreated bad bank and about €6 billion in loans and guarantees for SNS REAAL and its bad bank.
4

The banking system’s Basel II Tier 1 capital ratio was at about 12.3 percent in 2012Q3. On the basis of a pro forma
Basel III core Tier 1 capital ratio, both ABN Amro and ING raised their ratios to 10 percent at end-2012 while
Rabobank has reported that it has already complied with Basel III at end-2011.

17.
Most FSAP recommendations have been implemented and supervision in the DNB has
been strengthened. The authorities have established a Financial Stability Committee and adopted a
macro-prudential mandate. Measures on LTV and MID have been adopted as planned. Adequate
legal protection has been granted to the DNB and the AFM officials for their actions in official
capacity. The DNB has adopted a new supervisory approach, which consists of three elements:
cultural change (“Learning to say No”), stronger risk-based supervision with five categories (T1 to
T5), and macro, sectoral, and thematic assessments of risk. The DNB on-site inspection staff has
been increased by 10 percent. Crisis management and bank resolution have been strengthened with
the Intervention Act. However, in monitoring of unfolding risks in banks, the DNB still lacks
adequate legal basis to request information from institutions for macro-prudential reasons. There
are no direct implications of the Banking Union on previous FSAP recommendations. The ultimate
steady state single supervisory mechanism is likely to depend on local expertise and therefore
strengthening domestic supervision, reporting, and other recommendations along the lines of FSAP
recommendations remain relevant.

The Authorities’ Views
18.
The authorities agreed that the real estate sector and wholesale financing continue to
pose vulnerabilities for the banking system. They were of the view that the size of wholesale
financing relative to real estate lending among banks was large (the so-called “funding gap”) and
that this needed to be reduced over time. The authorities also were of the view that the move
towards a pan-European Banking Union was proceeding at a rapid pace, and this would help
improve the resilience of financial systems across the region, including in the Netherlands. They
were also of the view that European directives for resolution would provide the foundations of a
framework that would clarify the landscape for different classes of creditors of banks.

C. Housing and Macro-Prudential Policies
Background
19.
Based on a range of metrics, house prices are still overvalued and could be expected to
continue to fall. The authorities have initiated steps to reduce the Netherlands’ generous LTV ratios
and full MID, given their role in increasing household indebtedness and fueling a housing bubble.
The housing market is also subject to a number of distortions, including the high proportion of
subsidized public housing (some 80 percent of the stock of rental housing) and constraints to
increasing the supply of owner-occupied dwellings.

Staff’s Views
20.
The reduction of LTV ratios and limiting the scope of MID is a necessary first step to
reform the housing market. The authorities’ plan to reduce maximum LTVs (from 106 percent by
1 percentage point each year until it reaches 100 percent) is appropriately paced given the
prevailing house price dynamics. After the market has stabilized, consideration should be given to
reduce maximum LTVs further. The elimination of MID for new mortgages except for 30 year

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS—NETHERLANDS

amortizing mortgages is also a welcome step that over time should also help generate sustainable
housing market dynamics and improve financial stability. There is scope to gradually phase in caps
to the size of MID in nominal terms and target MID to lower-income citizens. After prices have
stabilized, announcing a time path and gradually phasing in further housing reform measures would
help anchor expectations and avoid destabilizing markets.
21.
Sensitivity analyses showed banks to be resilient to moderate macro shocks and
potentially large losses if tail risks materialize. The analyses used a model that estimated the
sensitivity of expected losses to changes in unemployment, mortgage rates, and house prices.
A 20 percent drop in house prices in 2013, a transient increase in mortgage rates, and rise of
unemployment rate above 7 percent in 2014, would lead to insignificant reductions in the capital
ratios due to generous unemployment and social benefits, the lack of strategic defaults and fact that
most at-risk employees live in rental housing. However, if economic conditions deteriorate further
and households with underwater mortgages change behavior, the possibility of a large number of
simultaneous defaults cannot be ruled out. This reinforces the need for banks to shore up capital
from private sources.
22.
There are several structural measures that could improve the functioning of the
housing market. The supply response of housing to price changes is limited by regulations
(including on zoning) that prevent new construction to meet increased demand. While zoning
regulations to some extent reflect social choices, solutions need to be explored that allow
improvement in the functioning of the housing market through increased supply when demand
rises. The planned review of the scope of public housing with a view to better targeting them to
lower-income segments is also welcome as it would free up more dwellings for the rental market.
Similarly, constraints to repurposing vacant commercial real estate for residential use need to be
addressed.

The Authorities’ Views
23.
The authorities believe that uncertainty about the future path of house prices impedes
recovery. They emphasize that their goal is to pursue predictable policies to remove the distortions
from the housing market gradually, without adding to policy uncertainty. The reforms to LTVs and
MID are therefore important first steps in their aim to reform the housing sector. However, many
distortions have been built up over a considerable period of time, and additional reforms will need
broad support across the population and will take a number of years to be implemented.

Box 1. Sensitivity Analysis of a Decline in House Prices
As requested by Staff, DNB conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess the resilience of the banking
system to further declines in house prices. The sensitivity analysis estimated expected loan losses arising

The sensitivity analysis combined a micro-level satellite model containing household specific
information and a firm-level model that simulates bank balance sheets. The satellite model contains
information on a representative sample of 100,000 households including data on their mortgage loans,
payments, and income sources and reflects important behavioral and institutional features of the Dutch
mortgage and labor markets. Staff further provided assumptions related to unemployment and refinancing
mortgage rates during 2013-14 that were required by the micro-level satellite model. The effects of changes in
house prices on expected losses and capital ratios are mitigated by generous unemployment and social benefits
embedded in the micro-level satellite model that lessen the likelihood of households defaulting on their
mortgages as well as by the inability to declare strategic default under the Dutch law. Therefore, the decline in
house prices only affects the Loss-Given-Default (LGD) and not the Probabilities of Default (PDs) of the
residential loan portfolio implicit in the DNB micro-level satellite model.
Even under the most adverse scenario of a 20 percent decline in house prices, the increase in expected
losses and the reduction in the banking system capital ratios would be small in during 2013-14.1/ In
particular, the increase in expected losses would reduce the banking system’s Basel II Capital Adequacy and
Tier 1 Capital ratios by about 13 bps and 26 bps in 2013 and 2014, respectively.2/ Despite a small average
increase in default rates, it is important to note that the distribution of simulated loss rates across different age
cohorts is different, with the 35-44 year cohort shouldering a large share of the losses. Should economic
conditions deteriorate further, with higher unemployment rates and lower house prices and should underwater
households change their behavior, the possibility of a large number of simultaneous defaults by households
cannot be disregarded.

D. External Sector Issues
Background
24.
While the Netherlands has run large current account surpluses for decades, its net
international investment position turned positive again only in 2008. The sustained current
account surpluses are explained in large part by savings of the corporate sector and to a lesser
extent by institutional pension savings of the households. A favorable tax regime, good
infrastructure, a helpful geographical location, and stable business environment make the
Netherlands an attractive business location for trade-oriented companies while relatively slow
growth and the nature of some large businesses make domestic investment less attractive than the
alternatives abroad or even infeasible. Large domestic corporate sector savings arise as globallyoriented firms in the Netherlands finance a substantial outflow of FDI (the stock of outward FDI
stood at 85 percent of GDP at end-2011). In the past decade, about half of the current account
surplus can be accounted for by demographic changes, the presence of an exhaustible resource
such as natural gas, fiscal policy, increased financial integration, and relatively slow GDP growth.
25.
The large current account surpluses have not generated a correspondingly large net
international investment position. Appreciation of the exchange rate, write-offs on paid goodwill,

needed. The staff’s assessment remains that the
external sector is stronger than justified by

fundamentals, and is consistent with the ESR assessment. Persistently large surpluses, even after
allowing for biases created by being a financial center and an energy exporter (with a cyclicallyadjusted surplus estimated at 8 percent of GDP), point to a cyclically-adjusted current account
balance 1–3 percent stronger than the value implied by fundamentals and desirable policy settings.
The REER has fallen somewhat in recent years, following appreciation between 2006–09, as a result
of euro depreciation and decelerating wage and price pressures. It remains slightly higher than
historical averages. Policy settings are broadly appropriate and few policy measures are needed.

The Authorities’ Views
27.
The Authorities view persistent current accounts surpluses as a result of the Netherlands’
openness, geographic location and the fact that the country is a domicile to many export-oriented
corporations.

RAISING LONG-TERM GROWTH POTENTIAL
Implementing measures to raise the economy’s growth potential will help anchor expectations
constructively and safeguard the credibility of long term fiscal sustainability.

Background
28.
The Netherlands’ trend decline in potential growth over the past three decades, due
mainly to a slowing of both productivity growth and capital deepening, will face added
pressures as an aging population shrinks the labor force. The larger and globally competitive
multinationals domiciled in the Netherlands are highly productive, but smaller domestically-oriented
firms are much less so.

Staff’s Views
29.
Efforts to raise the productivity of smaller and domestically-oriented firms can raise
potential growth while contributing to the reduction of external imbalances. Increasing the
intensity of research and development activities (R&D) is an area where the Netherlands lags many
regional peers and could boost productivity. Policies that improve the incentives for private research
activities and that bring the results of research in academic institutions closer to industry have
promise. There is also room for improvement in streamlining procedures for starting businesses,
enhancing the protection of investors in these businesses and improving the efficiency of contract
enforcement, where Netherlands lags some of its regional peers. To the extent that these measures
boost investment and growth in domestically oriented firms, they could help reduce imbalances on a
structural basis by reducing the savings-investment imbalances of the corporate sector and boosting
domestic demand (Figure 2). Containing long term healthcare costs will also be important to
maintaining competitiveness and safeguard fiscal soundness.
30.
Further measures to improve the functioning of labor markets and raise human capital
will be needed. Measures to further reduce the duality in labor markets by increasing the protection
for temporary workers while reducing rigidities for permanent workers will help improve equity and
preserve flexibility. In addition, the reduction of the period of unemployment benefits to two years
and additional measures to increase incentives to re-enter employment within a year of
unemployment are welcome. Improving the quality of education will be an essential building block
of raising the productivity of the labor force.

The Authorities’ Views
31.
To increase potential GDP growth, the authorities plan to implement measures to
improve the functioning of the labor market and to enhance human capital. The duration of
unemployment benefits is proposed to decrease from 38 to 24 months, and their level will be
reduced after the first year of unemployment from 70 percent of the salary to 70 percent of the
minimum wage. The authorities view this measure as necessary to reduce the duration of

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS—NETHERLANDS

unemployment spells. Student grants will be replaced with loans from 2014-15 academic year
onwards and the revenue from student loans will be invested in education and research. An
additional 150 million euro will be available for strengthening fundamental research and 250 million
for intensifying secondary vocational education.

POINT AND COUNTERPOINT TO THE STAFF’S VIEWS
While the staff’s conclusions have been articulated in the previous sections, they are debatable. Four
elements of the staff’s views are scrutinized below, with the view to providing the reader a better sense
of the arguments and counterarguments.
32.

Is the staff’s characterization of a balance sheet recession right?

Argument: Can weak consumer confidence really be blamed on weak balance sheets? This seems
unlikely because, while household’s gross debt is high, this is balanced by very large financial assets.
Moreover, the Netherlands enjoys low borrowing costs as a safe haven with an AAA sovereign
rating, and households could work off their high gross debt gradually as debt servicing costs are not
rising sharply. So the characterization of household balance sheet strains by staff may be
exaggerated and the only thing needed to revive consumption and growth would be to a return of
positive “animal spirits.”

Counterargument: While it is true in principle low interest rates mean that households in the
Netherlands could carry a larger load of debt, this must be weighed against the fact that house
prices on average have fallen by 19 percent in nominal terms since 2008. As a result, some
25 percent of mortgages are underwater but need to be serviced as the lenders have full recourse
(i.e., can pursue the borrower’s other assets in court). The motivation for households to increase their
savings and restrain consumption is therefore not due to rising debt service costs but to offset the
substantial fall in net worth since 2008 in the face of higher uncertainty about employment and
income. Moreover, an overwhelming proportion of household financial assets are in pension funds
which cannot be accessed for liquidity purposes, and the present value of these assets is also
dependent on economic and financial factors. As a result, the balance sheet strains on households
reflect the decline in the value of assets rather than an increase in the value of their liabilities, and
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS—NETHERLANDS

households could be expected to continue to restrain consumption and build savings until the
imbalance has been narrowed substantially. Finally, underwater mortgages are most common
among young households, who also have higher net debt and lower assets. Hence, aggregate
balance sheets mask substantial distributional differences which are important for consumption
behavior.
33.
Since household savings are primarily channeled to pension funds, should not more of
these funds be intermediated domestically to offset the structurally lower amount of
household deposits in banks relative to bank assets? Wouldn’t that help support the housing
market while also reducing banks’ reliance on wholesale funding?
Argument: The assets of pension funds amount to about 160 percent of GDP. Some 88 percent of
these are invested abroad and act as a conduit for channeling household savings overseas. As a
result, household deposits at domestic banks are low at €374 billion while mortgage loans (primarily
by domestic banks) are €651 billion. This “funding gap” for mortgages is filled through wholesale
financing by banks. Channeling pension fund assets domestically could alleviate the funding gap for
banks and make them less reliant on wholesale funding, while making mortgages less sensitive to
bank funding conditions.5 Therefore, the staff’s assertion that mortgage debt is too high may be
misleading as there is an ample pool of domestic savings which could be tapped to support
mortgages.
Counterargument: Pension funds already have a home bias since the Netherlands’ own securities
account for some 5 percent of the universe of investible assets of Dutch pension funds. The socalled “funding gap” instead, in the staff’s view, reflects the fact that banks expanded on the basis of
wholesale financing to provide mortgages that benefited from favorable MID and generous LTV
ratios. This in turn fueled the sharp rise in household debt (and mortgage debt in particular) and
house prices. Pension funds manage their assets independently and in the view of staff need not be
provided with any additional incentives to alter their asset allocation process. In the staff’s view, the
main principles that should be observed with regard to reducing distortions in the housing sector
are that the natural adjustment of prices should proceed unimpeded, that banks continue to reduce
their reliance on wholesale funding, that risk from exposure to the real estate sector is priced
transparently and appropriately, and that the government does not take on additional contingent
liabilities.

5

The “funding gap” is described in the Van Dijkhuizen proposal of March 11, 2013 to establish a new Dutch
Mortgage Institution (NHI) ) to tap funds from pension funds, insurance companies and other national and
international investors to finance Dutch mortgages.

34.
How is staff sure that home prices have not overshot? Wouldn’t this justify
intervention?
Argument: With house prices having already fallen by 20 percent, and no evidence of an abnormal
rise in vacancies, could prices be overshooting? Given the impact of house prices dynamics on
overall sentiment and activity, is there not a case for intervention to support house prices?
Counterargument: It is true that house prices have fallen substantially. But while no one can be sure
about house prices, various models to estimate their level relative to fundamentals (summarized in
Figure 4, top panel) suggest that they remain overvalued. There is little evidence to support the view
that house prices have overshot. Moreover, in the staff’s view, the housing market is subject to
numerous distortions, such as the small market for rentals outside of social housing, the constraints
to a supply response in housing due to regulations, and still generous LTV ratios. Additional
interventions in a highly distorted market could produce unwelcome side effects, and the priority
should be instead to allow for the natural adjustment of prices and wind down the distortions to
enable a better functioning housing market to emerge.
35.
If policy uncertainty is such a concern, why does staff oppose the specification of a
target for the headline deficit of 3 percent to alleviate uncertainty? Why is focusing on
medium-term hard-to-assess structural targets better?
Argument: While removing uncertainty probably would support activity, it is less clear that the focus
of fiscal policy should be on medium-term targets based on specified structural measures. This
makes it difficult to form expectations of the headline deficit path, which would add to uncertainty
and possibly restrain households’ and firms spending decisions. If the headline deficit target is
known, then that could be the anchor for the private sector that reduces uncertainty.
Counterargument: The staff’s argument to focus on medium term structural targets and reduce
policy uncertainty rests on minimizing the deviation of discretionary fiscal policy measures from the
specified medium-term path. With the Coalition Agreement having already spelled out the mediumterm structural measures that would be undertaken, this can help anchor the private sector’s
expectations. Given that headline deficits are highly dependent on near-term macroeconomic
prospects which are subject to high uncertainty from both domestic and external sources, focusing
on a headline deficit target adds rather than subtracts from the general macroeconomic uncertainty
as the discretionary component of fiscal policy becomes a moving target. The staff is of the view that
the already articulated medium-term structural measures are a better anchor of expectations.

STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
The Netherlands is in a balance sheet recession as households and banks continue to
deleverage against the backdrop of still declining house prices. The necessary reduction of
household debt is expected to weigh on sentiment and consumption over the medium term. Banks
remain heavily exposed to the real estate sector and overly reliant on wholesale funding, requiring

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS—NETHERLANDS

adjustments in their balance sheets over the foreseeable future. With exports to the rest of the EA
expected to strengthen only gradually, output growth will remain below its potential for some time.
37.
Downside risks dominate. The interaction of household and bank balance sheets through
house prices magnifies the uncertainty surrounding the outlook. Larger-than-expected house price
adjustments would restrain household consumption and bank lending, and could result in an
amplified cycle of falling house prices and deleveraging. Persistent uncertainty about fiscal and
structural policies could also restrain household spending and postpone the recovery. External
developments that aggravate uncertainty, especially in the rest of the EA, could weaken consumer
confidence, lower exports, and further diminish activity. On the upside, a rapid recovery in consumer
confidence and resolution of uncertainty could improve the outlook.
38.
The overarching policy priority is to support activity and manage downside risks, while
allowing for an orderly adjustment of private sector balance sheets. Given weak consumer
confidence and considerable uncertainty, policies should help minimize downside risks to growth
and avoid exacerbating the pace of deleveraging, while anchoring medium-term expectations to
enable a sustained recovery to take hold.
39.
Adhering to the structural fiscal measures outlined in the December 2012 Update of
the Stability Program remains the appropriate fiscal policy anchor over the medium term.
Given the unexpected weakness in activity, the plan for no additional measures in 2013 is
appropriate. Fiscal policy beyond 2013 should focus on structural adjustment as outlined in the
December 2012 Stability Program Update, while allowing automatic stabilizers full play. A clear focus
on medium-term objectives will cement the Netherlands’ policy credibility and mitigate policy
uncertainty. Excessively procyclical fiscal policies could damage potential growth should they deepen
and prolong the downturn.
40.
The financial system needs to reduce its dependence on wholesale financing and banks
reliant on public sector support need to wind down this support. Given banks’ exposures to the
real estate sector, capital should be increased from private sources by issuing common equity and
through higher retained earnings. Higher capital buffers would extend the duration and terms of the
wholesale financing, reduce vulnerability to abrupt shifts in funding conditions, and prepare banks
for Basel III capital requirements. Banks should also increase allowances for loan losses in the real
estate portfolio. While idiosyncratic shocks to the real estate portfolio appear manageable, a large
systemic shock could expose banks to more significant losses.
41.
The numerous distortions in the housing market should be removed gradually. The key
principles that should guide the reduction of housing sector distortions are the unimpeded natural
adjustment of house prices, continued reduction of banks’ reliance on wholesale funding,
transparent pricing of risk from exposure to the real estate sector, and avoiding the assumption of
additional contingent liabilities by the government. The incremental reduction of maximum loan-tovalue ratios from 106 to 100 percent and elimination of mortgage interest deductibility for nonamortizing mortgages are important initial steps in reducing the excesses emanating from the
housing sector.

Reforms in the labor markets and to raise human capital will be important in
safeguarding the economy’s growth potential. More protection for temporary workers with more
flexibility for permanent workers will help improve equity while incentives to re-enter employment as
quickly as possible will help reduce longer term unemployment. Channeling resources into
fundamental research and improved quality of education will help raise productivity. Measures must
also be taken to contain long-term healthcare costs which could in the long-term threaten public
finances and competitiveness.

Box 2. Authorities’ Response to Past IMF Policy Recommendations

The authorities have taken on board several policy recommendation made by the Fund
in the previous Article IV consultations. They have implemented tighter
macroprudential measures in the housing markets, proposed structural reforms to
improve the functioning of the labor market, and passed a pension reform to
counteract declines in the supply of labor due to ageing.
Financial sector issues
The plan to reduce maximum LTVs (from 106 percent by 1 percentage point each year
until it reaches 100 percent) and the elimination of MID for new mortgages except for
30-year amortizing mortgages are in line past Fund policy recommendations to
improve financial stability. In addition, most FSAP recommendations have been
implemented and supervision in the DNB has been strengthened.
Fiscal issues
The authorities implemented a frontloaded fiscal tightening in 2012-13 during a period
of contracting GDP while Fund’s recommendation was to tighten fiscal policy once
growth firms. The Fund recommended improvements to trend budgeting to further
reduce its procyclicality and augment its flexibility to deal with severe recessions.
However, the authorities attach great importance to adhering to the SGP rule that limits
headline deficits to 3 percent of GDP.
Structural reforms
In line with Fund’s advice, the authorities have proposed measures to increase potential
growth. They have proposed measures to reduce the period of unemployment benefits
to two years with additional measures to increase incentives to re-enter employment
within a year of unemployment. The new government has also proposed increases in
the funding of R & D and improvements in the quality of education. Finally, measures
to contain the growth of healthcare costs are being implemented.

KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS—NETHERLANDS

Table 6. The Netherlands: Implementation of the Main FSAP Update Recommendations
Recommendations
Macroprudential Management Priority
Assign priority to developing macro-prudential
instruments.

Announce maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratios
for new lending, and consider linking higher
LTVs to higher capital ratios.
Provide supervisors with powers to vary the level
of designated macroprudential instruments in
response to developments.

Announce plans to reduce mortgage interest
deductibility (MID) over the medium–term.
Twin Peaks
Provide the DNB and AFM greater discretion to
put in place enforceable rules. The lack of
sufficient rule making authority leads to ad hoc
approaches that risk becoming arbitrary and
subject to legal challenge.
Afford legal protection to DNB and the AFM as
institutions, for their official actions, except in
cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct,
in line with practice in many neighboring
countries.
Continue integration of DNB staff across
banking, insurance, and pensions functions, to
draw the synergies of having a single regulator.

Microprudential Bank and Insurance
Supervision
Establish routine reporting requirements to
strengthen monitoring and risk modeling.

Intensify supervision of large international
financial institutions, with greater emphasis on
group supervision and soundness of business
models. Greater international cooperation,
beyond participation in colleges of supervisors,
is warranted.
Adopt more proactive and decisive approach,
including timely off-site inspection and
corrective actions that rely less on moral
suasion.

34

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Implementation
Macroprudential instruments to be introduced through the
implementation of CRD IV will include anticyclical buffers, RRP’s, leverage
constraints, stress tests, and higher risk weights for real estate. The
introduction of a domestic SIB-buffer has been announced.
Since 2013 the maximum LTV ratio will be gradually reduced from
106 percent to 100 percent.
A Financial Stability Committee has been set up with representatives of
DNB (chair), the Ministry of Finance (MoF), and the AFM to discuss
macroprudential developments, issue warnings and recommendations,
and monitor the implementation of ESRB-recommendations. Legislation
to be in force in 2014 will expand DNB’s mandate to include
macroprudential supervision.
The new tax regime limits MID only to amortizing loans. In addition the
maximum tax rate for deductibility will be capped and gradually reduced.
The DNB and the AFM have operational independence to set rules within
their legal mandate, and are equipped with enforcement powers. Rules
not under the DNB and AFM powers can be requested in regular toplevel discussions and formally to the MoF in an annual open legislation
letter. The Minister responds to these requests in a letter to Parliament.
Since July 2012 legislation limits the legal liability of the DNB and the
AFM. In February 2012, a clear division of responsibility between the
President of DNB (central bank tasks) and a newly appointed Head of
Supervision (prudential supervision) was introduced by a change in the
DNB governance.
In renewing the Mission Statement of the DNB, its new Board of Directors
has identified the need to strengthen synergies within DNB. Proposals
have been made to assign cross-sectoral responsibilities to a Division
Director and several initiatives have encouraged job-shifting between
Divisions.

Improving data quality and availability has been identified as a main
priority in DNB’s thematic approach. Legislation granting power to DNB
to request information for monitoring and risk modeling purposes needs
to be passed.
The new supervisory approach introduced in February 2012, internalizes
the broader scope of supervision and includes elements of supervision,
with two new risk drivers added: i) business models and strategy; and ii)
behavior, culture, and governance. Legislation granting powers to the
DNB to request information on foreign subsidiaries of Dutch financial
groups needs to be passed.
The new supervisory approach aims at making supervision more
comprehensive and intrusive, including with risk-based, multidisciplinary,
and sector-wide assessments, strengthened macro-orientation, and
thematic reviews. To support it, a new separate Division has been set-up
with a stronger role for experts, a separate department for internal risk
management, and a separate department responsible for intervention
policy to safeguard timely intervention.

KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS—NETHERLANDS

Table 6. The Netherlands: Implementation of the Main FSAP Update Recommendations
(continued)
Recommendations
Securities market
Strengthen the AFM’s ability to enforce issuers’
compliance with financial reporting standards.
Strengthen the regulatory and supervisory
framework for management companies of
collective investment schemes.
Pensions
Develop a communication plan on recent and
prospective changes in payouts to stakeholders.

Require incorporation of professional Board
members for pension funds beyond a minimum
size, and provide legal authority that allows
direct supervision of core pension activities
independently of the entity performing them.
Crisis management and bank resolution
Reform the Deposit Guarantee Scheme so that it
is: (i) ex ante funded, (ii) authorized to fund bank
resolution operations, and (iii) enjoys depositor
preference. (¶49)

Strengthen the institutional framework for crisis
management by: (i) shifting decision-making
power from the Judiciary to DNB in the context
of bank resolution, and (ii) specifying more
clearly the respective roles of the MoF and DNB
in bank resolution.
Improve the framework for official financial
support by establishing a standing budgetary
authorization for the Government to fund
solvency support in a manner that avoids risk of
moral hazard.

Improve the framework for bank resolution by
establishing a single regime for resolving banks
under official control; such regime should set
appropriate objectives (including financial
stability), as well as tasks and powers for the
official administrators.

Implementation
The AFM’s legal ability to enforce issuers’ compliance with financial
reporting standards has been strengthened by amendments to the Act on
Financial Reporting.
In July 2011 the European Alternative Investment Fund Managers
Directive (AIFMD) was published that covers all of these aspects. The
Netherlands will implement the Directive by end-July 2013.
The DNB, the Federation of the Dutch Pension Funds and the Ministry of
Social Affairs and Employment, have developed a communication plan for
approximately 70 funds to lower their entitlements in 2013. The DNB will
encourage and monitor pension funds’ transition process to the new type
of pension contract.
From July 2013 new legislation on the governance of pension funds will
be in force. Key elements include reinforcing countervailing powers in the
governance structure and improving quality by creating seats for
professional board members. DNB already has, through the board of
pension funds, powers to supervise all core pension activities even if
outsourced.
The introduction of the DGS with an ex-ante funded scheme has been
postponed from 2013 to 2015 as a result of the “resolution tax” to be
imposed on banks in 2014 after the SNS Reaal nationalization. The Dutch
Intervention Act in force since June 2012 has introduced the option to
transfer deposits with DGS resources. The introduction of depositor
preference in the Netherlands will be discussed at the European level.
The Intervention Act has strengthened the role the both DNB and the
MoF in crisis management and clarified their responsibilities and roles.
The Intervention Act provides for powers for DNB to resolve banks and
insurance companies in a timely and orderly manner, powers for the MoF
to ensure the stability of the financial system, and limitation of the rights
of contracting parties of a financial institution after a measure (“trigger
event”) taken by DNB or the MoF.
The Netherlands has not amended the Public Accounts Law or other
relevant legislation to establish a standing budgetary authorization for
the Government to fund solvency support. If a financial institution needs
solvency support, the State can decide to recapitalize it under strict
conditions and only as a last resort. The Intervention Act provides for the
possibility for the Dutch Minister of Finance to expropriate common
equity and (subordinated) debt.
Since June 2012 the Intervention Act has strengthened the role of both
DNB and the Ministry of Finance in crisis management and clarified the
different responsibilities and roles in the process.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance.
National accounts
The Netherlands adopted the European System of Integrated Economic Accounts 1995 (ESA95)
in 1999. As a one-off matter, a number of institutional reforms had a significant impact on
national account and other data in 2006. Most importantly, the reform of healthcare insurance
caused a significant reclassification of private consumption into public consumption. This shift
had a big impact on the growth rates of the components concerned, but overall GDP was not
affected.
Government Accounts
Until 2004, general government data compiled in the context of the national accounts have been
used as the basis, together with additional fiscal data, for compiling and reporting GFS according
to the GFSM 2001 for publication in the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY).
This practice was ceased in 2005, when the authorities agreed that the IMF uses the fiscal data
reported to EUROSTAT for publication in the GFSY (bridged from 1995 ESA formats to the GFSM
2001 framework).
Balance of Payments Accounts
The DNB compiles the balance of payments in close cooperation with the CBS. An agreement
between the CBS and the DNB was formally ratified in 2006 to further strengthen the decadeslong cooperation between the two institutions. Balance of payments is compiled according to
the Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM5) and the legal requirements of the ECB and
Eurostat.
Financial Soundness Indicators
The Netherlands participates in the financial soundness indicators (FSIs) project. Quarterly data
for most of the 40 FSIs are posted on the FSI website for the period 2008:Q1 to 2012:Q4.
II. Data Standards and Quality

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with the
Kingdom of the Netherlands—Netherlands
On May 1, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Kingdom of the Netherlands.1
Background
The Netherlands is an AAA euro area (EA) economy, but with significant private sector
imbalances. It shares an AAA credit rating and relatively robust public finances with
Germany, Finland, and Luxembourg. Its sovereign bonds enjoy safe haven status, and it
has a growing net international asset position since 2008. However, it also has a highly
indebted household sector, significant financial sector challenges, declining real estate
prices, and weak domestic demand. As a result, the Netherlands’ GDP growth,
unemployment, and public debt dynamics since the onset of the global financial crisis have
diverged from other AAA EA economies.
The extended weakness in activity in the Netherlands reflects the slow deleveraging of the
household and financial sectors. Prior to 2008, in the context of ample global liquidity, a
favorable macroeconomic environment and supportive tax and regulatory incentives,
households had accumulated substantial mortgage debt with generous loan-to-value

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

ratios and advantageous mortgage interest deductibility. Household debt as a share of
disposable income doubled over the past decade—to the highest in the euro area—and
drove up house prices to unsustainable levels. Meanwhile, banks’ assets-to-GDP rose to a
peak of 4 times GDP by 2011 accompanied by a sharp increase in wholesale funding.
Zoning and other restrictions prevented an adequate supply response to cool house prices.
The global financial crisis of 2008 was the external trigger that led to a slow deleveraging
spiral accompanied by falling confidence, declining house prices, and increasing financial
strains. As a result, despite the recovery of global trade, a balance sheet recession has left
GDP in the Netherlands below the 2008 level five years on.
Balance sheet adjustments in the context of weakness in the rest of the EA will continue to
be a drag on the recovery and delay external adjustment. Despite the nominal 18-percent
correction since the peak, a further decline in house prices is expected to weigh on
consumer confidence and consumption. With the banking system highly exposed to the
real estate sector and continuing to rely on wholesale funding, the adjustment of its balance
sheets is still underway. Exports to the rest of the EA are expected to pick up only gradually
against the backdrop of a slow EA recovery. This implies that under the baseline, following
an estimated 0.9 percent contraction last year, output is projected to fall by an additional
0.5 percent in 2013 before recovering by 1.1 percent in 2014. Reflecting the need to shore
up balance sheets, the current account surplus is expected to widen marginally through
2014. In line with these projections, the output gap will narrow only gradually over the
forecast horizon.
The baseline outlook is subject to a number of downside risks. The interaction of household
and bank balance sheets linked through changes in house prices makes the outlook
subject to unusually large uncertainty. A drop in house prices in excess of what is currently
assumed would further restrain both household consumption and lending by banks, and
could in turn lead to a deepening cycle of falling house prices and deleveraging. Solvency
requirements in pension funds also weigh on consumer confidence as benefits and
contributions need to be adjusted procyclically. Persistent uncertainty about structural
policies and the degree of procyclicality of fiscal policies could also act as a restraint on
household spending decisions and postpone the recovery. External developments,
especially in the rest of the euro area, that add to uncertainty, generate financial stress,
weaken consumer confidence, and lower exports would affect activity adversely in the
Netherlands (Figure 4). A more medium-term risk is that policy measures fail to avoid a
decline in the economy’s growth potential. On the upside, a rapid reduction in uncertainty
and a recovery in consumer confidence could help support the outlook.

3

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Netherlands’s track record of robust public finances and
status as a safe haven. Directors noted that notwithstanding these strong fundamentals, the
economy faces challenges from a highly indebted household sector, significant financial
system stresses, still declining real estate prices, and weak domestic demand. Adverse
external developments, especially in the euro area, could also pose risks. Directors agreed
that policy priorities ahead should focus on restoring growth and managing downside risks
while allowing for an orderly adjustment of private sector balance sheets.
Directors commended the authorities’ commitment to maintaining fiscal sustainability and
welcomed the decision not to undertake any additional fiscal measures in 2013. In light of the
ongoing economic uncertainty, most Directors recommended that fiscal policy should be
more flexible, focus on structural targets, and allow automatic stabilizers to operate fully. The
envisaged consolidation under the 2012 Update of the Stability Program remains appropriate
and would ensure sustainable public debt dynamics over the medium term. Some Directors
were of the view that the authorities’ emphasis on achieving the headline deficit target
provided policy credibility and anchored expectations.
Noting the vulnerabilities facing the financial system, Directors emphasized the need to
reduce its dependence on wholesale financing and increase bank capital from private
sources. Building additional capital buffers will be important to guard against any systemic
threats from the real sector as well reduce vulnerability to shocks. Directors commended the
implementation of most Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) recommendations
and encouraged further action to strengthen domestic supervision and reporting. A clear
framework for creditor hierarchy, at the EU level, which carefully establishes burden sharing
between financial stability and protection of taxpayers, will also be important.
Directors underscored the need to remove housing market distortions. In this context, they
saw need for unimpeded adjustment of house prices, transparent pricing of real estate sector
risk, and avoidance of additional contingent liabilities by the government. Directors
commended the steps taken to reduce maximum loan-to-value ratios and eliminate mortgage
interest deductibility and called for further efforts in these areas after the market has
stabilized.
Directors emphasized that labor market reforms as well as measures to increase productivity
and raise human capital will be important to boost the economy’s growth potential. Reform
efforts should focus on reducing the duality in labor markets and period of unemployment

4

benefits. Channeling resources into research and development and improving the quality of
education will also be essential.

Statement by the Staff Representative on the Kingdom of the Netherlands—Netherlands
May 1, 2013

This statement summarizes developments in the Netherlands since the issuance of the staff report.
This new information is in line with staff recommendation and does not change the thrust of the
staff appraisal.
In April 2013, the Dutch government and social partners have reached agreement (“Social Accord”)
on fiscal policies and labor market reforms. The agreement postpones the decision on additional
spending cuts for 2014 until autumn. The cuts of €4.3 billion (0.7 percent of GDP) will be reassessed
in light of new information on the state of the economy. The postponement of a decision on
additional spending cuts is welcome and in line with staff recommendations not to implement
additional tightening measures. The agreement also postpones the gradual reduction in the
duration of unemployment benefits until 2016; it unifies redundancy procedures, provides for a
transitional allowance for those employees whose contracts have been terminated, and allows
temporary employees to qualify for a permanent contract more quickly. Finally, the maximum
pension tax incentive will be reduced by 0.4 percent and no tax incentive will be given for
pensionable annual earnings above €100,000.

Statement by Menno Snel, Executive Director for the Kingdom of the Netherlands—
Netherlands and Robert Mosch, Advisor to Executive Director
May 1, 2013
We thank staff for their thorough analysis of the Dutch economy. The Dutch authorities
appreciated the constructive discussions during the mission, and share the main gist of the staff
report.
On the policy agenda
Since the start of its term at the end of 2012, the Dutch government has pursued an
ambitious agenda of structural reform and budgetary consolidation. Currently, reforms of
the pension system, health care, labor market and housing market are being implemented.
To increase the sustainability of the pension system, the retirement age will be gradually
increased from 65 to 67 years and indexed to life expectancy. The pace of retirement age
increases has been stepped up to three months a year until 2018, and four months a year
thereafter. The subsidy for pension savings will be better targeted by eliminating the favorable
fiscal treatment for annual income above EUR 100,000.
Wide-ranging measures have been introduced to stem the rise in health care costs. Over
the government’s term, growth of health care expenditures will be cut back by EUR 5 billion
(0.8% of GDP). Health care insurers and providers will bear more risk, entitlements will be cut
back and co-payments will increase.
On the labor market, several measures are being taken to counter unemployment. For
instance, the government will support initiatives for retraining and measures to increase job-tojob mobility. Specific measures will be introduced to reduce youth employment and promote reintegration of older unemployed workers. The pace of reforms will be gradual to take account of
the current low growth environment and consumer confidence, and in order to lessen any
potential negative impact in the short term. The government will also take measures that aim to
achieve a better balance between flexible and permanent employment by increasing the
protection for temporary workers while reducing rigidities for permanent workers.
As part of a wide-ranging reform, the implicit subsidy to the housing market is being cut
back by half. Mortgage Interest Deductibility (MID) has been limited to 30-year amortizing
mortgages, and the rate at which the mortgage is deductible will be gradually lowered starting
January 1, 2014. Also, the Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio is being lowered from 106% to 100% in six
years – gradually, so as to not be procyclical in a downward housing market. Although assets of
households are significantly larger than their liabilities, these measures will be instrumental to
address risks that may arise from high household debt. An important element of reforms in the
rental market is to bring current subsidized rents more in line with market values, thereby
improving allocational efficiency and realizing a better targeting of public resources.

2

Given the impact of reforms, the government has actively pursued broad support. The
current political situation, with the government lacking a majority in the Senate, and low
consumer confidence require an inclusive decision making process. A gradual and inclusive
approach is a general feature of successful reforms. In recent months, the government managed
to reach agreement with opposition parties on the reform of the housing market, and with labor
unions and employers’ federations on the reform of the labor market and health care system.
On staff’s assessment
While we share the main thrust of staff’s appraisal, we would like to offer the following
comments.
Staff seems to ignore the sound fundamentals of the Dutch economy when it compares
the Netherlands to countries which are under market pressures. Among other things, the
current account surplus, the funded pension system with assets over 100% of GDP, the
government debt ratio below OECD average, the strong competitiveness position, and the high
labor participation rate do not warrant such a comparison. Indeed, international rankings such as
the OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), the competiveness
indicators of the World Economic Forum, and the ranking in the Doing Business report would call
for a more balanced description.
We see little argument to consider the budgetary policy being excessively procyclical, as
staff suggests. Automatic stabilization is an important element of the Dutch budgetary system.
By letting the budget balance deteriorate from a surplus at the onset of the crisis to current
sizable deficits, the budget has provided support to the real economy. Moreover, interventions in
the financial sector, which resulted in a rapid increase in government debt and government
guarantees, have supported the functioning of the financial system. Although the original aim
was to bring the deficit within the 3% limit in 2013, the government decided not to take additional
measures for 2013 as economic conditions have deteriorated. The deficit is likely to surpass the
3% limit for the fifth consecutive year in 2013.
For 2014, the government remains committed to a deficit within the European limit of 3%
of GDP. Whereas in 2013 cyclical conditions will warrant an extension of the EDP deadline (the
nominal budget deficit will likely stay above 3% of GDP even as the structural budget balance
will improve), this is not the case in 2014. Without additional measures, the structural budget
balance is set to deteriorate. Surpassing the 3% limit while also not improving the underlying
budgetary position could jeopardize the credibility of the medium-term consolidation plan as well
as the recently reformed EU governance framework.
Regarding the characterizations of the authorities’ views, we feel that the short
descriptions do not always do justice to the information and views shared with staff
during the mission. In our view, staff could have elaborated in more detail on the extensive

3
discussions and on the information provided. This would portray a more nuanced view than
currently follows from these paragraphs. More specifically, a recurrent theme over the past year
has been the IMF’s emphasis on the cyclical nature of the current economic situation, whereas
the authorities take the view that economic growth will be lower for an extended period of time,
which argues against back loading the necessary budgetary adjustment and structural reforms.
Staff mentions that structural measures will be needed to reduce the current account
surplus. However, it is not clear why and how the current account surplus should be reduced by
policy measures in the short term, since there are no indications that the Dutch current account
surplus is the result of underlying distortions. Therefore, before action is taken in an effort to
reduce the surplus, a much better understanding would be needed of the underlying
mechanisms that are responsible for the structural surplus. For example, as staff mentions, data
on the current account should be treated with great caution due to statistical issues. In this
respect, we also note that some of staff’s other recommendations, such as limiting household
debt related to the housing market, could actually result in an increase of the surplus.
On the financial sector
We generally agree with staff's assessment of macroprudential policy and supervision in
the Netherlands, including the recent reforms to the macroprudential framework and
supervision. Table 6, on implementation of the main recommendations of the 2011 FSAP, shows
that the results of the FSAP continue to be relevant for financial stability policy in the
Netherlands. The new Financial Stability Committee, which met for the first time in December
2012, should prove to be a strong forum to discuss macroprudential issues at the national level.
The three elements of a new supervisory approach – cultural change, stronger risk-based
supervision, and macro, sectoral, and thematic assessments of risk – are based in large part on
international best practices compiled by the Fund. We add to this list the extensive top-down and
bottom-up stress testing of the financial sector by DNB (the Dutch Central Bank), which is a
critical tool in assessing the resilience of the financial sector. DNB is currently undertaking an
ongoing asset quality review (AQR) of commercial real estate, also meant to identify pockets of
distress and ensure adequate valuations by banks.
We concur with staff’s identification of the financial stability risks. As staff points out, a
renewed escalation of the European debt crisis remains the major risk, and unanticipated shocks
to domestic confidence or persistently low growth could also have a clear impact on the outlook.
In its most recent Overview of Financial Stability, DNB has also emphasized the risks for banks
and pension funds of the low interest rate environment, banks’ retail funding gap and the use by
banks of secured funding, which can shift risks between investors. Finally, current policies are in
line with staff’s recommendation for proactive measures to shore up capital from private sources.
The Netherlands plans to use the national discretion available in CRD4 to introduce additional
SIFI buffers and Systemic Risk Buffers to address risks within the banking system.

4
In line with staff’s recommendation, the authorities took steps to reduce procyclical
elements of the pension system. Measures have already been implemented to reduce the
volatility in the market-based discount rate due to illiquidity of interest swap markets for long
horizons. Furthermore, by lengthening the recovery period and smoothing benefit reductions, the
procyclical impact of decisions has been limited. In addition, the Dutch authorities are working
towards a new regulatory system as part of reforms to safeguard the sustainability of pension
contracts. Even though this financial supervision framework is based on marked valuation, the
reforms are expected to help reduce the procyclicality of contributions and benefits. Day-to-day
volatility will be smoothened through several adjustment mechanisms.
