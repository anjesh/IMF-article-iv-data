STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 27, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Context. Maldives has rapidly grown into a middle income country, driven by tourism
development. Over the past decade, the economy has experienced persistent fiscal deficits,
occasionally accompanied by a widening current account deficit and pressure on the
stabilized exchange rate regime. At the time of the previous Article IV consultation, official
data pointed to large current account and fiscal deficits. Staff recommended policy action,
combining fiscal consolidation, exchange rate devaluation and an incomes policy. Some
fiscal policy actions were taken. The exchange rate parity was maintained.
Recent economic developments. Two years on, the picture is different: a recovery in
tourism is supporting growth; Maldives has performed well relative to peers; substantial
data revisions paint less worrying picture of the external sector; and there is little pressure
on the exchange rate. But the large and growing fiscal deficit remains the Achilles heel.
Policy recommendations:


Fiscal policy. Fiscal consolidation is necessary to ensure sustainability. The 2015
Budget contains helpful measures but they do not seem sufficient to bring debt ratios
down. With limited policy buffers, the risks of fiscal slippages are high and the
economy is vulnerable to external shocks. Staff advise greater fiscal adjustment
through expenditure restraint to place the debt ratio firmly on a downward path.
Strengthened public financial management is critical to support fiscal goals.



Monetary, financial and external policies. Support from monetary and financial
policies would help build buffers. The external position is highly uncertain given data
issues, but on balance looks modestly weaker than implied by fundamentals and
desirable policies and the exchange rate modestly overvalued.



Medium term. Care needs to be taken to ensure that medium term policies do not
add substantially to public sector expenditures, that infrastructure spending adds to
potential growth and does not run into capacity constraints



Data. Statistics should be further strengthened to assist policy decisions.

CONTEXT
1.
Maldives has rapidly grown into a middle income country, driven by tourism
development. Tourism activity—accounting directly and indirectly for around three-quarters of
output—underpins the $6740 per capita GDP in 2013. The country’s unique geography, with 200
inhabited islands covering around 90,000 sq.km, high import-intensity, and dollarization, pose policy
challenges, alongside the detrimental impact of climate change. With tourist transactions mainly in
U.S. dollars, the economy is highly dollarized. Given the weak fiscal position, monetary conditions
(under the stabilized exchange rate regime and open capital account) are determined by fiscal policy
and the supply of foreign exchange. Low population density (outside Malé) raises the cost of public
service provision, results in a lack of employment opportunities and youth unemployment is high
(only 40 percent of youth is in employment).
2.
Over the past decade, the economy has
experienced persistent fiscal deficits, occasionally
accompanied by a widening current account
deficit and pressure on the exchange rate. Since
the 2004 tsunami, Maldives has faced fiscal deficits
initially from reconstruction needs, but then from
large increases in the public sector wage bill and
social spending. These were financed mainly
domestically—including through monetization—and
led to intermittent pressure on official reserves and
the exchange rate, especially since the global
financial crisis.

3.
By early 2013, official data pointed to large current account and fiscal deficits. At the
conclusion of the previous Article IV consultation, the official data indicated a current account deficit
of 26.5 percent of GDP and official reserves of $304mn (1.6 months imports) on a declining path.
Difficulties financing the fiscal deficit led to some recourse to arrears. Consistent with these
conditions, staff recommended policy action, combining fiscal consolidation, exchange rate
devaluation and an incomes policy to curb import demand. Some fiscal policy actions were taken.
The exchange rate parity was maintained.
4.
Two years on, the growth outlook is brighter, and significant data revisions paint a less
worrying picture of the external sector position. A recovery in tourism activity has supported
growth and exports; and there has been little apparent pressure on the exchange rate. Revisions to
official statistics have resulted in a substantial reduction in the current account deficit (Box 1), and
nominal GDP has been revised up (Annex 1). The puzzle of large current account deficits and low
reserves but well stocked stores has been partly resolved by revised data. However, staff’s analysis
points to further underreporting of tourism exports suggesting that the current account deficit may
still be somewhat overstated (Box 5). These revisions also imply a stronger private sector saving
position than previously estimated. Nevertheless, the fiscal deficit and public debt remain very high
and need to be addressed.

though net reserves remained low.
6.
But the fiscal deficit is thought to have
widened sharply in 2014, on the back of spending
largesse. Staff estimates the deficit at 7.8 percent of
GDP in 2013 compared with official data which report a
deficit of 3.9 percent of GDP. The difference reflects
higher staff estimates for interest payments, subsidies,
and social welfare.2 Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA)
financing data also points to a higher deficit (see table).
A sharp rise in recurrent expenditures (pensions, and
wages) is likely to have widened the deficit to 11.6
percent of GDP in 2014. The 2015 Budget measures aim
to rein in the deficit (Box 2).
7.
Public debt is correspondingly high.
Sustained primary deficits placed public debt (including
SOEs, excluding arrears) on a rising path from
52 percent in 2009 to 75 percent of GDP in 2014, above
the 60 percent limit in the recently established Fiscal

Responsibility Law. The stock of arrears estimated by staff would add 6.3 percent of GDP to the debt
ratio. The arbitration ruling over the authorities’ cancellation of the airport operating concession
could pose a sizable contingent fiscal liability.3
Box 1. Data Revisions to the Balance of Payments
Significant revisions have been made to the balance of payments data in line with IMF technical
assistance recommendations. Estimated current account deficits have been substantially reduced from rates
of around 20 percent of GDP to single digits in 2012–13 (text figures). This reflects new data sources, better
methods and new data.1
Higher tourism exports. Data from the Tourism Goods
and Services Tax (TGST) from the Maldives Inland
Revenue Authority (MIRA) has been used to estimate total
travel receipts (including new data for 2013) and the bednights tax has now been included in the estimate. Net
effect: reduces the current account deficit by 2.1 and 9.5
percentage points of GDP in 2012 and 2013 respectively.



Lower imports of goods and services. Two partially
offsetting revisions were made. Double counting of the
import of jet fuel was eliminated and imports of services
were revised upwards (using withholding tax data). Net
effect: reduces the current account deficit by 3.2 and 4.1
percentage points of GDP in 2012 and 2013 respectively.



Higher net income. New improved methods have been
used for estimating outward company profits and
foreign workers’ remittances. Net effect: reduces the
current account deficit by 3.7 and 0.6 percentage points
of GDP in 2012 and 2013 respectively.



The estimation of the financial account has been
improved and gaps reduced using a variety of data
sources: (i) annual FDI survey; (ii) use of the MMA’s
monetary and financial statistics for bank flows; (iii)
Bank of International Settlements data for non banks;
and (iv) the IMF’s Coordinated Portfolio Investment
Survey database. Further improvement is expected with
the new FDI survey launch in 2015. Previous estimates
were incomplete.

Though large, the revisions are plausible and help partly resolve the external sector puzzle. They reduce
the scale of errors and omissions in 2012 ($24mn), though these remain large in 2013 ($98 mn). They go some
way to reconciling the puzzle of large deficits yet few signs of difficulty obtaining foreign exchange or
imported goods.

Financial soundness indicators are slowly improving, monetary conditions are easy, but
credit growth is subdued. Bank profitability has increased and nonperforming loans in the tourism
and construction sectors are falling back from high levels built up during the global financial crisis
(Figure 4, Table 6). Base money and broad money have been growing rapidly financed by reserve
accumulation and sharply higher NFA of the banks. But private sector credit growth is subdued (0.5
percent in November 2014 year on year) as banks appear to be cautious about lending to the
tourism and construction sectors; and large investments are financed abroad (thought to include
own funds of tourism operators held abroad). Instead funding is channeled into the MMA’s
Overnight Deposit Facility or directed into Treasury bills despite lower yields.

B. Outlook and Risks
Staff’s Position
9.
Growth is forecast to remain fairly strong over the medium term, slowing a little as
fiscal consolidation implied by the 2015 Budget takes hold. However, there is upside potential if
lower oil prices are sustained.


Under the baseline scenario medium term growth is projected to be around 4½ percent,
somewhat slower than the average of 6½ percent when tourism development was at its peak.
Although the global recovery is uneven, Maldives has proved adept at attracting tourism from a
variety of regions (see text figure), new resort openings and the development of the airport will
add to capacity, and tourist activity is expected to grow moderately.4 On the upside, if lower oil
prices are sustained, and passed on in lower airline fares; this could provide a further boost to
tourism.

Around three quarters of activity is directly or indirectly linked to tourism. Maldives is a high end tourist destination
with around 60 percent of resorts in the 5 star and plus category, and demand is relatively price and income inelastic.
The authorities expect to lease five new resorts a year. A second runway at the airport will also add to capacity.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALDIVES



If fully implemented, the authorities’ fiscal adjustment plans would have a mildly negative effect
on growth (around ¾ of a percentage point in 2016 17). Staff estimates the fiscal multiplier to be
relatively low: Maldives is a high end destination for tourism, demand for which is likely relatively
price inelastic; and other characteristics (high trade openness, low labor rigidities high public
spending and debt) are consistent with a low multiplier.



The recent drop in oil prices has improved the current account and inflation outlook. The current
account is expected to narrow over the medium term to around 4.7 percent of GDP by 2019 as
fiscal restraint and lower oil prices help constrain imports. Inflation is forecast to be just 0.3
percent in 2015 but to pick up with the increase in import duties and is expected to settle at
around 4 percent in the medium term.

10.
However, limited policy buffers suggest the economy is vulnerable to fiscal slippages
and inward spillovers (Risk Assessment Matrix). In the event of fiscal expenditure overruns relative
to the authorities’ targets, borrowing costs and monetization could increase, which could make the
external position become fragile. Homegrown risks could also be triggered if there is a period of
protracted low growth in advanced and emerging economies. In the face of a large external shock,
foreign capital inflows (thought to be primarily inflows from tourism operators) may weaken as
occurred during the global financial crisis. If risks materialize, an accelerated fiscal consolidation
effort with tough expenditure control would be needed to restore sustainability and stem the erosion
of reserves.
Authorities’ Views
11.
The authorities expect growth to be stronger than projected by staff with tourist
arrivals rising robustly, especially as airport capacity is expanded. Real GDP growth is expected
to average around 8 percent over the next three years. As a small open economy, Maldives is
unavoidably vulnerable to external shocks. They were of the view that boosting growth potential, as
has been done in the past with the development of the tourist industry, was the best way to manage
shocks. Current plans to improve infrastructure and to develop Special Economic Zones (SEZs)
(paragraph 27) would support growth and help build buffers.

POLICIES FOR FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY
Background
12.
The 2015 Budget aims to reverse the rise in the fiscal deficit, resulting from growing
spending commitments. Public spending has risen by 9.9 percentage points of GDP since 2011
reflecting high spending on wages, subsidies and social welfare, and the spending-to-GDP ratio is
high relative other tourism-based economies ( Figures 1, 3). This reflects a combination of new
spending initiatives and critical weaknesses in the governing framework for expenditure control. The
Budget is largely aimed at revenue raising measures (imposing a green tax, acquiring fees from SEZs
and raising import duties), supplemented by some expenditure restraint through a temporary public
employment freeze and better targeting of subsidies (Box 2).
8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALDIVES

Staff’s Position
13.
The fiscal consolidation implied by the 2015 Budget is commendable and significant
but may not deliver sufficient savings to place the debt ratio on a sustainable path. Based on
baseline forecasts, staff expects the Budget to deliver a significant improvement in the primary deficit
of around 4.1 percentage points in 2015, (see Box 2, Table 2), containing the primary deficit to 2.4
percent of GDP over the medium term (consistent with an overall deficit of 7.6 percent in the
medium term). Public debt would continue to increase, though at a slower pace and would remain
well above the debt anchor of 60 percent of GDP in the Fiscal Responsibility Law (text figure and
Debt Sustainability Analysis, Supplement 1). This contrasts with the authorities’ fiscal projections,
where they assume additional revenues (in particular from fees related to the acquisition of Special
Economic Zones), earlier realization of some measures, and faster GDP and tourism growth.

14.
Staff’s view is that an additional and more permanent consolidation, amounting to
around 3 percentage points of GDP is needed over 2015-19 to bring debt ratios down. If the
authorities’ ambitious capital spending plans are fully realized (see Box 2), then further adjustment
would also be needed to offset the fiscal impact. Additional consolidation could be achieved through
politically feasible structural measures that build on the 2015 Budget and deliver a more permanent
improvement in the fiscal position. Gradually lowering the debt ratio would reduce pressure for
monetary financing, strengthen the external position by cutting import demand and reduce
crowding out, albeit at some cost to near-term growth. 5

The 2009 fiscal consolidation plan targeted a 30 percentage points of GDP reduction in the deficit in a year was not
implemented as essential political support for large scale measures dissipated, especially given a recession that year.

Box 2. Maldives 2015 Budget Fiscal Adjustment Measures
The 2015 Budget passed in December includes measures to reduce the fiscal deficit. Measures
are weighted to revenues and include some expenditure restraint (see tables). Staff estimates that the
package could help reduce the primary deficit by 4.1 percentage points in 2015.



Revenues. Measures are directed at the
tourism sector and imports. The green tax
(replacing the bednights tax) is an
important source of income from the
tourism sector. Import duties on some
consumer items are being raised from
zero and excises are being increased. The
authorities expect significant revenues
from the acquisition of land for SEZs and
licenses for new resorts.

Expenditures



Expenditures. Measures aim to contain current spending, including a public employment freeze.
Stricter control over public sector employment and the wage bill, and targeting subsidies, are
both important goals. Previous work by the World Bank found that subsidies could be much
better targeted—half the electricity subsidy goes to the highest two income quintiles, and food
subsidies were similarly poorly targeted (with subsidies also benefiting the tourist resorts).



Capital expenditures. The authorities plan a large increase in capital expenditures (for a Maléairport road bridge and for airport development) financed by bilateral official loans.

Staff project the deficit will be higher than the official target for a number of reasons: the
delayed introduction of some measures, uncertainty over revenue realization from the acquisition of
land for SEZs, the need for targeting of subsidies to be accompanied by measures to secure safety
nets (this will take time, although some conditions are in place for proxy means testing); possible
slippage on wages, and a different base, given 2013 estimates. In the other direction, staff expect
capital spending to come on stream more gradually than envisaged by the authorities (as feasibility
studies for these projects have yet to be completed) reducing the overall deficit.

To ensure successful implementation, the size and phasing of fiscal adjustment needs
to be relatively gradual and calibrated to avoid a sharp growth slowdown (although fiscal
multipliers are likely low). Evidence from other small economies illustrates the importance of
sustaining an adjustment effort over a number of years and focusing on expenditure control (Box 4).
To return the debt ratio to the level of 2013 and bring it within reach of the 60 percent limit (text
figure and table 5), staff proposes additional savings of 3 percentage points of GDP, beginning in
2016, with just over half of the additional savings deriving from the spending side:


Expenditure measures: spending restraint over 2016–19 with structural measures to durably
contain the wage bill (by establishing a pay body to set consistent rules across the public sector,
by reducing the number of paid local councilors, and by embarking on the public service reform
already envisaged by the authorities), by containing rising healthcare costs and savings on
transport and communications.6 Saving 1.7 percentage points of GDP.



Revenue measures: an increase in the TGST rate from 12 to 15 percent in 2016 would help
underpin revenues. Increased revenues: 1.3 percentage points of GDP.

16.
Better public financial management is a prerequisite for fiscal sustainability. The recent
Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability assessment identified deep rooted problems with
greater fiscal discipline and better prioritization needed across government. Difficulties include:
unrealistic budgets with spending allocations insufficient to meet commitments, reshuffling of
spending between activities/ministries, and unenforced spending ceilings. Reforms were suggested
in many areas, including a baseline review of expenditures (Box 3). Better methods are needed to
track payments, including subsidies, in order to design targeting and monitor savings. Compliance
with the Fiscal Responsibility Law (which came into force in May 2014) would also support longer
term fiscal goals. The Law includes positive features that can helpfully discipline fiscal policy—
including debt and deficit limits and strict limits on MMA credit to government (preventing
monetization). It could also be used to help anchor a targeted primary balance path.
Authorities’ Views
17.
The 2015 Budget includes significant measures, expected to result in a larger fiscal
consolidation than estimated by staff. The set up of Special Economic Zones would generate fee
income from their acquisition and could significantly supplement revenues with no need for further
revenue measures. Expenditure restraint, in particular through the public sector employment freeze
has political backing and, together with the review of local government pay structures, this would
generate sizeable permanent cost savings. They also agreed that a public sector wide pay body could
be helpful to ensure consistency of wages and salaries across public service and drive forward public
service reform. Strengthening public financial management is a key government priority, and
continued technical assistance on the fiscal chart of accounts and budget execution would be
valuable.

The universal healthcare insurance scheme, Aasandha was introduced in 2012 and covers the whole population.
Costs have risen rapidly and the announcement in 2014 of unlimited health insurance will escalate costs. According to
the World Bank, savings could be achieved through bulk procurement of essential and generic drugs and by reducing
expenditure on overseas treatment through negotiation of close-ended package rates with providers.

Box 4. Episodes of Large Fiscal Consolidation in Smaller States
Recent IMF research for the Jamaica Article IV shows that expenditure adjustment measures offer the
greatest likelihood of success for durable fiscal consolidation.



Work on “Smaller Countries and Large Fiscal Adjustments” by Simard, Lonkeng and Lindow looked at
35 cases of large fiscal consolidation for smaller countries since the 1990s.1 The analysis focused on
countries which reduced public debt through improvements in the primary balance (and did not
benefit from a reduction in debt through a HIPC or a debt exchange). Successful fiscal consolidations
were defined as those where the debt ratio remained lower four years following the fiscal
consolidation episode.2



Out of the 35 cases: 14 successfully reduced their debt ratio four years out and 11 of these featured a
cumulative improvement in the primary balance over a 5 year period.



Most countries managed to raise tax revenues during the adjustment period. However, what
distinguished the successful cases was a larger reduction in the wage bill (see Charts).



The findings are similar to those in earlier work by Tsibouris, Horton, Flanagan and Maliszewski on a
wider set of countries.3 They found that expenditure adjustment was associated with durable
adjustment but also that it was best done in a multi-year framework.

The real exchange rate quickly appreciated
by around 20 percent following the 2011
devaluation as rapid inflation pass through more
than offset the exchange rate devaluation. Since the
April 2011 devaluation, Maldives has retained a de facto
stabilized exchange rate regime. 7 Although the band is
wide at 20 percent either side of Rf 12.85 per dollar, the
exchange rate has remained at the weakest end of the
band (Rf 15.42 per dollar) and operates like a de facto
peg. The benefits of the devaluation were quickly
eroded by higher inflation in Maldives relative to
trading partners. But over the past eighteen months
Maldives inflation performance has improved and the
real exchange rate has been broadly flat (text figure).

19.
External indicators and the current account
deficit (following data revisions) look somewhat healthier.


The estimated current account deficit, though still quite high, is much smaller than previously
reported and is expected to be 8.1 percent of GDP in 2014 (up a little from 2013). Lower oil prices
will help narrow the current account deficit in 2015.



The MMA has been able to increase its supply of foreign exchange to the market, likely reflecting
higher dollar inflows. Gross official reserves have risen to $614mn, but are low compared to
standard reserve adequacy indicators (around 2.8 months imports) and usable reserves are just
$132mn (0.6 months imports).

Staff’s Position
20.
The external sector assessment is difficult given the large turnover in the parallel fx
market and data issues—but on balance the external sector position seems modestly weak.
Standard indicators would point to an external sector position that is moderately weaker than
fundamentals and desirable policies and a real exchange that that is moderately overvalued. The
Fund’s empirical approaches for smaller countries (EBA lite and a CGER-type methodology)
applied to the revised official data point to a current account gap of around 3 percent of GDP
and a real exchange rate overvaluation of around 5 percent (Box 5). Low reserves levels also
indicate external sector weakness.



7

The de jure exchange rate regime is a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALDIVES



Other considerations, point to less of an imbalance (i.e. only modestly weaker). With a low level of
reserves, the MMA is only able to supply only a small fraction of foreign exchange demand with
the excess satisfied in the parallel market (Box 6), and the premium has remained stable and low
for an extended period. Surveys and anecdote suggest that—even after revisions—tourism
exports likely remain underestimated; but by how much is uncertain within a wide range from
US$100mn-2bn (3-75 percent of GDP), (Box 5). Though if under-recording was very high, imports
would also likely be under-reported, significantly offsetting the effect on the current account.
Nonetheless, underestimation of tourism revenues could easily be sufficient to eliminate the
current account gap.



Fiscal consolidation. The loose fiscal stance explains two thirds of the current account gap.8
Undertaking the fiscal adjustment implied by the 2015 Budget will help halve the gap.

Overall, the external sector position looks modestly weaker than fundamentals and desirable policies
and the exchange rate modestly overvalued. No exchange rate adjustment is warranted at present.
The stabilized exchange rate regime is suitable for Maldives in view of the very high openness of its
goods and services market, the dollarized nature of the economy, and the large seasonal variation in
tourism revenues.
Authorities’ Views
21.
The authorities are committed to maintaining the exchange rate within the current
band and agree that a stabilized regime suits their needs. They view past exchange rate
devaluations as being unsuccessful. In particular, the April 2011 devaluation did not achieve a
durable impact on imbalances. Without an effective incomes policy, wages in the public and private
sectors rose quickly back to previous real levels and the parallel market premium reappeared.
Improving the fiscal position is viewed as the best way to sustain the exchange rate within its current
band. The parallel foreign exchange market has been in place for a long time and appeared with the
rapid development of tourism in the economy. The premium has fallen back to around 3 to 4 percent
but it is structural in nature and unlikely to be eliminated completely. The authorities agreed that
there would likely be no change on Article VIII issues until official reserves levels had increased and
the fiscal position improved, the data revisions to the current account are based on substantial
improvements in methodologies and the new data are much more consistent with other indicators
and developments in the economy. The extent of any under-recording of tourism expenditures is
likely to be small.

Box 5. The Operation of Maldives Parallel Foreign Exchange Market
Maldives has a de-facto stabilized exchange rate regime, while the foreign exchange regime is very
open, there is a long history of an active parallel foreign exchange market, and the premium is
relatively stable. The tourist industry appears to be a key supplier and driver of the parallel market. The
scale of the premium has ranged from around 5 to 15 percent, and during 2014 it fell back to just 3 to 4
percent. The relatively steady premium may reflect the oligopolistic nature of the market.


There are only a few large suppliers of foreign exchange who are able to adjust supply to the parallel
foreign exchange market—based on the observed premium and where marginal costs equal marginal
revenue.



There is a positive relationship between the premium and supply given the profit motive to benefit
from an increased spread. If the suppliers of foreign exchange formed a cartel they could behave as
monopolists and drive up the premium. But in practice, as each supplier’s total holdings of foreign
currency (in Maldives and abroad) is large and the ability to supply foreign exchange to benefit from
any change in the premium is high, the cartel appears unstable and the premium remains bounded
within a narrow stability range but it is not arbitraged away.



The relationship between the supply of dollars and the premium may be non-linear. Occasional hikes
in premia can occur with expectations of a potential devaluation and heightened macroeconomic risk.

Since the global financial crisis, the appearance of a parallel market premium and a shortage of
foreign exchange at the official rate has continued to give rise to exchange restrictions and a
multiple currency practice (MCP). Maldives is an Article XIV member but maintains exchange
restrictions and a MCP under Article VIII Sections 2 (a) and 3 which have been in place since 2009.1/ These
arise from the MMA’s foreign exchange rationing and greater than 2 percent parallel market premium.
Although these measures are non discriminatory, Fund approval is not recommended as they are unlikely
to be temporary and would be eliminated only once official reserves levels are higher and the fiscal
position has improved. The existing restriction arising from rationing has eased, with the MMA increasing
the foreign exchange provided to commercial banks from $3 million to $4 million a week from September
2013.2/

Box 6. Estimates of Tourism Spending and External Sector Assessment
Anecdotal evidence suggests that tourist spending in Maldives may be underestimated (and the current account
deficit overestimated). Unfortunately it is not possible to check the official data against partner countries as these data
are not collected for tourism services. To come up with ball park estimates of actual tourism expenditures, staff used
three approaches:
a) Using the Ministry of Tourism survey to
estimate expenditures (from arrivals and
individuals’ reported spending habits) points
to an estimate as high as $4.3bn (double
official estimates). But the survey has
drawbacks. It only asks about ranges of
spending, it may indistinguishably include
airfares and spending in nearby economies
such as Sri Lanka, it is conducted for one
month in February (high season) each year
and the response rate is low (25 percent).
Given these caveats, the survey is likely an
overestimate of tourist spending.

GDP.
The resulting current account gap is estimated
to be in the range from 0.2 to -3.6 percent of
GDP. EBA lite, suggests the fiscal policy gap
can explain 2 percent of GDP of the current
account gap.
The corresponding REER estimates range from
a small undervaluation to an overvaluation of
up to 5 percent.

The range of possible under-recording of receipts is very large from

high end of these estimates, outflows such as imports would also likely be
under-recorded—with a smaller net effect on the current account.

SUPPORTING MONETARY AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
Background
22.
The policy stance has eased since the start of 2014 with measures that staff view as
being aimed at facilitating government financing. The high minimum reserve requirement was
cut; the MMA took steps to convert the government’s overdraft (6.8 percent of GDP) into a non
tradable long-term bond; administered yields on Treasury bills were lowered; and the MMA halted
liquidity absorbing open market operations. Despite lower yields, banks (and Maldives Pension Fund)
have continued to purchase Treasury Bills, given limited market development, and in preference to
lending. Recently, banks have found it difficult to access correspondent banking services, as overseas
banks reassessed their business models; this has made it difficult to obtain letters of credit and
process remittances.
Staff’s Position
23.
Staff did not support the monetization of the fiscal deficit and welcomes the
authorities’ commitment to resist this going forward. This would help direct monetary policy at
supporting the current exchange rate band. In addition, the MMA should charge rates on
government advances and long-term bonds that exceed T-bill yields. As the fiscal position improves,
greater use should be made of market based financing of government debt. To promote nonbank
participation, the government securities market could be developed, with longer term instruments,
primary dealers, and a secondary market.
24.
Fuller information on the operation of the foreign exchange market would support
policy making. More comprehensive information on money changer activities, with regular data
collection, analysis and closer supervision of large fx operators would assist policy decisions.
25.
A firmer approach to supervision remains necessary. Banks are broadly in compliance
with prudential regulations, though one bank has breached single borrower limits and another
foreign currency exposure limits. Nonetheless, the accuracy of financial soundness indicators
deserves close scrutiny. The MMA has rightly resisted pressure to count capital held offshore when
calculating compliance with single borrower limits. Standards for financial institutions that may in the
future set up in SEZs should be equivalent to those onshore, with similar prudential, supervisory and
reporting requirements, including with regard to AML/CFT.
Authorities’ Views
26.
The authorities were of the view that the MMA measures taken earlier in the year had
helped tackle the large government overdraft legacy. This had helped put policy on a firmer
footing and would make Fiscal Sustainability Law targets attainable going forward. They agreed that
public debt market development was a high priority and were working on ways to open up the
Treasury Bill market to the non-bank private sector and to develop longer term instruments. Since
the beginning of 2014, the MMA had begun to collect more regular information on money changer

MALDIVES

activities. The MMA is also continuously working to strengthen supervision and regulations are being
developed to supplement the legislation on SEZs.

MEDIUM TERM AND OTHER ISSUES
A. Economic Diversification and Service Provision
Background
27.
Maldives’ geography—while a central attribute for the tourism industry—imposes high
costs in terms of public service provision. Over the longer term, the government is considering
ways to develop regional hubs and improve transport connectivity which could also encourage
voluntary resettlement. This would enable higher quality service provision at lower cost in key areas
such as education. However, putting in place such a change will take many years as it requires a
broad national consensus, adequate incentives, and compensation. The government is also planning
two large infrastructure projects—airport expansion and a road bridge between Male and the airport
financed by official bilateral loans. There are environmental challenges from tourism and
infrastructure development. The UN is encouraging the development of a comprehensive long-term
national climate change adaptation strategy for Maldives which could help mobilize grants and
concessional loans. An increased share of renewable energy will help reduce reliance on oil imports.
28.
The SEZs are a key part of government’s strategy for diversification into labor
intensive sectors such as off-port shipping services, IT and financial services. Youth
unemployment is high in Maldives and education attainment at upper secondary level lags behind
other economies (Table 6); and consequently the tourism industry typically recruits many workers
from abroad rather than from Maldives (due to skills mismatch).9 The SEZ scheme which will have
mixed activity (with a 40 percent limit on activity devoted to tourism) will aim at providing job
opportunities for Maldivian workers. However, the details of specific SEZs have yet to be worked out.
Staff’s Position
29.
Careful planning of infrastructure investment scale up will help ensure it adds to
growth. To help maximize the future growth benefits of the planned infrastructure projects and keep
down costs, it will be necessary to avoid over-stretching the economy’s construction capacity.
Financing arrangements should be carefully assessed so that only quality projects with high social
and growth impact are undertaken, with adequate social and environmental safeguards also in place.
30.
Economic diversification into new sectors is welcome but public sector support for
these initiatives needs to be contained, given debt sustainability challenges. Strict ring-fencing
of SEZ tax exemptions is necessary to limit foregone tax revenue and preserve the current relatively

9

Maldives is on track to meet most Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and has already met many of them
(Table 6). Efforts on gender equality and empowering women as well as ensuring environmental sustainability and
effective adaptation to climate change will need to be sustained to reach these MDGs.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALDIVES

simple tax system (which has few exemptions), with adequate reporting of tax expenditures. Beyond
the SEZs, there is scope to reduce the reliance of tourism on imported foodstuffs by developing links
between tourism, traditional fisheries, and small-scale agriculture, in order to raise the domestic
value added from tourism and spread the economic benefits more widely. Boosting access to
financial services and raising connectivity of renewables-generated electricity for small and mediumsize businesses would enhance the business climate and substantially reduce the cost of electricity
generation (among the highest in South Asia) and related subsidies.
Authorities’ Views
31.
Maldives faces unique challenges as small island nation with a dispersed population
across many islands. The tourism sector will remain the growth engine, propelled by private sector
innovation which has successfully capitalized on the natural beauty of the islands, adapted to new
markets and put Maldives on the global destination map. Addressing diversification and climate
adaptation requires unorthodox thinking. The SEZs will help link tourism to other industries and
services. The authorities noted staff’s concerns about the development of SEZs and emphasized that
tax exemptions would be ring-fenced; and regulations would be developed to safeguard offshore
financial sector standards and data provision.

B. Data Issues
Background
32.
Statistics have been strengthened in recent years. Maldives is a member of GDDS and
substantial improvements have been made to price, national accounts and balance of payments
statistics, supported by technical assistance (see Informational Annex).
Staff’s Position
33.
Notwithstanding this improvement, data gaps complicate policymaking. The reliability
of the balance of payments data is uncertain—in part as it is inherently difficult to capture full data
with many transactions occurring outside the country and with no international counterparty data on
tourism services to validate revenue estimates. GDP methodology can be updated, including
finalizing the expenditure measure. The fiscal chart of accounts (under development) is crucial for
budget accuracy. A statistics law providing the legal authority to collect data from the nonfinancial
corporate sector and households would greatly enhance data provision.
Authorities’ Views
34.
Further work is underway to improve the balance of payments and national accounts
statistics and a fiscal chart of accounts is being put in pl ace. The authorities intend to submit a
revised draft statistics law to the Majlis but no timetable has yet been set for this.

STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
Maldives has rapidly grown into a middle income country, driven by tourism
development. Over the past two years, the real economy has picked up. Tourist activity has
recovered, driven by a rapid expansion of new Asian markets and Maldives has performed well
relative to peers. The external sector has broadly stabilized and inflation is contained.
36.
Public debt is elevated, the fiscal deficit has widened and consolidation is necessary to
ensure sustainability. The authorities’ 2015 Budget is an important step toward adjustment,
containing revenue raising measures, better targeting of subsidies and a public employment freeze.
But this may be insufficient to bring debt ratios down and some measures are only temporary. With
limited policy buffers, the risks of fiscal slippages are high and the economy is vulnerable to external
shocks.
37.
Greater and more durable fiscal adjustment through additional expenditure restraint
would place the debt ratio firmly on a downward path. Staff recommend additional adjustment
of 3 percentage points of GDP by 2019, focusing on spending restraint. Establishing a public sector
wage body would help ensure consistency in pay setting across the public sector and restrain the
wage bill. It should be accompanied by firmer control of other current spending. A further rise in
TGST would underpin revenues and help reduce debt. Stronger public financial management,
preceded by a review of baseline expenditures, and compliance with the Fiscal Responsibility Law,
would raise the probability of successful fiscal adjustment.
38.
The assessment of the external position is highly uncertain given data issues, but on
balance it looks modestly weaker than implied by fundamentals and desirable policies.
Following revision, the reported current account deficit is substantially narrower than previously
estimated. And tourism expenditures may still be underestimated and the current account deficit
overstated. The real exchange rate has been broadly stable recently and the parallel market premium
has narrowed. Overall, the external position appears modestly weaker than fundamentals and
desirable policies, and the real exchange rate modestly overvalued (within a large uncertainty range).
The stabilized exchange rate regime remains suitable for Maldives. However, with low levels of
official reserves, the MMA continues to ration foreign exchange to commercial banks and the parallel
market premium is greater than 2 percent leading to a multiple currency practice and exchange
restrictions. Without a timetable for removal of these measures, Fund approval is not sought at this
time.
39.
Support from monetary and financial policies would help build buffers. The authorities’
determination to resist monetization is welcome. Work strengthening financial supervision should
continue, including ensuring consistent and high standards for institutions that choose to operate in
SEZs.
40.
Public service delivery and economic diversification are key medium-term challenges.
Encouraging regional hubs and better connectivity would help support service provision but will take
many years. Careful planning of infrastructure investment scale up will help ensure it adds to growth.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

MALDIVES

Diversification of economic activity into new sectors—such as through SEZs—is welcome but strict
ring-fencing of SEZ tax exemptions is needed to preserve the tax base.
41.
Statistics should be further strengthened. Work should continue on national accounts,
balance of payments and a chart of accounts. A statistics law would greatly improve data provision.

Annex I. Revisions to Nominal GDP
The authorities have also made significant changes to their GDP figures. They have adopted the
methodology of using a market price GDP as their aggregate—instead of the previous approach of
presenting gross value added figures at basic prices (which exclude taxes and subsidies on products
from the estimation of gross output). The adjustment from basic to market prices is consistent with
the purchasers’ price valuation of the components of

of nominal GDP by 13 percent in 2013 (see chart).
The revisions also affect sectoral contributions to GDP and economic aggregates commonly
calculated as ratios to nominal GDP. Ratios for the fiscal deficit, public debt and the current
account all are all a little lower than previously reported. Looking forward, the authorities and staff
agree on the importance of the credibility in final revisions of the GDP data and are collaborating
closely. Technical assistance is being provided by the Fund to support some necessary further
revisions to real GDP data and to more broadly support improvements in GDP methodology.

Annex II. Maldives: Risk Assessment Matrix
Nature/ Source of Risk
Potential External Shocks
Protracted period of slower growth in advanced and
emerging economies



Advanced economies: lower than anticipated
potential growth and persistently lower inflation
due to failure to fully address legacies of financial
crisis, leading to secular stagnation and a further
decline in commodity prices.



Emerging markets: maturing of the cycle,
misallocation of investment and incomplete
structural reforms leading to prolonged slower
growth.

Likelihood/
Direction
High

High
The pickup in tourist activity would prove short-lived
negatively affecting activity, denting fiscal revenue and
widening the deficit. If combined with fiscal slippage, this
could also place pressure on the parallel market premium
and erode the level of MMA official reserves.
Policy actions: Fiscal adjustment would need to be
accelerated. To restore stability tough expenditure control
would need to be in place.

An abrupt surge in global financial market volatility,
as investors reassess underlying risk.

Expected Impact on the Economy
and Policy Response

Continued buildup and eventual unwinding of

growth slowdown and large financial and fiscal
losses.

consequences for Maldives fiscal and external accounts—

Medium
Tourist activity has benefited from increased arrivals from
new markets such as China and other Asian economies that
are part of China’s supply chain. A sharper than expected
slowdown in China would dent tourism from these
destinations. Indirectly any impact on the euro area would
also dent tourism arrivals from core markets.
The effects are milder than for protracted lower growth in
advanced and emerging economies. Policy
recommendations as above.

Persistent strengthening of the US dollar, reflecting
asymmetric exit and relative fundamentals.

Medium

Maldives exchange rate behaves like a defacto dollar peg, a
sustained appreciation in the dollar could reduce
competitiveness .

Further fall in commodity prices (particularly oil).

Medium

Medium
If sustained, lower oil prices would improve Maldives net
export position through lower import costs. If lower costs
are passed on in airfares, tourism demand could increase
and as a remote destination with high travel costs Maldives
could gain. But, these effects would be partly offset if
weaker global demand is driving lower prices.

Potential Domestic Shocks: mild external shocks could trigger these domestic vulnerabilities
Implementation of proposal on SEZs could undermine
the tax base and GMR arbitration adds to contingent
costs.

High

Medium
Financial stability risks in a domestic bank come to
the fore.

High
Market appetite for government debt could weaken if the
fiscal position deteriorates. Policy response: accelerate fiscal
adjustment.
Medium
Though financial soundness indicators have improved in
recent years, it might reflect unsound accounting practices.
In the event of strains in a bank a range of resolution
options would need to be considered and should include
independent external assessment.

Exchange Arrangements

From March 1, 1982 to June 30, 1985, the Maldivian rufiyaa was pegged to the U.S. dollar. Beginning
in July 1985, the exchange rate of the rufiyaa was linked to a trade-weighted basket of currencies,
but the exchange rate vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar remained relatively stable until February 1987. On
March 1, 1987, the rufiyaa was devalued by 29 percent vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. From 1987 to 1994,
the exchange rate of the rufiyaa was adjusted periodically. Since October 1994, the exchange rate of
the rufiyaa remained unchanged at Rf 11.77 per U.S. dollar, until July 25, 2001, when the rufiyaa was
2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MALDIVES

devalued to Rf 12.80 per U.S. dollar. Since April 2011, the rufiyaa has floated in a band of 20 percent
on either side of Rf 12.85 per dollar. In practice, however, the rufiyaa has been virtually fixed at the
band’s weaker end of Rf 15.42 per dollar. The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a pegged exchange
rate within horizontal bands and the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized
exchange rate arrangement. Maldives continues to avail itself of the transitional provisions of Article
XIV, and has not yet accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. It maintains an
exchange restriction subject to IMF approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a) of the IMF’s Articles of
Agreement arising from a shortage of foreign exchange at the official rate which leads to the MMA
rationing its supply of foreign exchange to commercial banks. This results in a channeling of foreign
exchange transactions for current international transactions to the parallel market where
transactions take place at an exchange rate that deviates by more than 2 percent from the official
exchange rate. The greater-than-2-percent exchange-rate spread gives rise to a multiple currency
practice subject to IMF approval under Article VIII, Section 3 and also to exchange restrictions, given
the additional cost involved for obtaining foreign exchange. The extent of rationing has been eased
with an increase in amounts provided to commercial banks.
Last Article IV Consultation

The 2013 Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on February 4, 2013.
Technical Assistance

FAD: FAD main areas of engagement were in Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA)
assessment and providing TA for cash management. A joint IMF/WB Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) assessment was carried out in February 2014 to gauge progress made since the last
PFM Action Plan for 2009-2011, identify remaining weaknesses and future direction. As a follow-up to the
PEFA, the FAD team together with the World Bank also developed a Public Financial Management Reform
Plan (PFMRP) for the GoM in June 2014. This was a broad PFM reform and consolidation plan aimed at
improving the overall policy-making, coordination, implementation and monitoring framework in PFM.
Altogether 3 missions on cash management TA were carried out in FY14. This mainly focused on
developing a cash management manual for the GoM and related activities. On request from the
authorities, the FAD in September 2014 also carried out a review of Chart of Accounts (CoA) at the
ministry of finance and proposed structure for a revised CoA and an action plan to achieve same. In
addition, there was a coordinated FAD/STA mission around the same time to review the mapping of the
government COA to GFSM 2014.
LEG: In October 2003 provided technical assistance on the revision of the Maldives Monetary
Authority Act (MMA Act). A series of missions (March and September 2005, and April 2006) were
provided to revamp the banking law. In August 2009, a mission provided assistance on the MMA Act
(jointly with MCM). A follow-up mission in February 2011 focused on payments law. LEG conducted
an AML/CFT assessment in October 2010 and conducted a desk-based review of the draft AML/CFT
law in May 2012. In 2014 LEG provided advice on the Special Economic Zones Law, offshore banking
legislation and deposit insurance.

MCM: Two missions visited in 2006 on monetary operations, financial market development, and
banking issues. In 2007, a series of mission were provided on debt management, monetary policy
and financial supervision. In 2008, three missions visited on monetary operations and liquidity
management, monetary policy and financial supervision issues. In November 2008 and
March/May/August 2009, a series of mission were provided on research capacity building, bank
supervision, monetary policy and the MMA act. Two missions visited Malé to advise on monetary
operations, liquidity management, and the development of a crisis management framework. In
December 2010, MCM conducted a TA mission on crisis preparedness and management, bank
restructuring, and monetary operations. In May and September 2011, MCM consecutively conducted
missions on the development of debt markets, and on on-site banking supervision. In February 2012,
MCM undertook a TA mission on assessing the foreign exchange operations framework. In 2014,
MCM conducted a series of TA missions on banking supervision in early February and late May. Also,
together with APD another joint mission on developing foreign exchange market was carried out.
MCM also provided advice on deposit insurance schemes.
STA: In May 2007, STA conducted a mission on money and banking statistics. In February and April
2011, STA offered TA on multiple topics covering improvements in balance of payments statistics,
government financial statistics (GFS), monetary and financial statistics (MFS) and national accounts.
In June and September 2011, STA conducted TA missions on improving price statistics and on the
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). In February, May, and October 2012 STA continued
providing TA on improving price statistics. Similarly, in April 2012, a TA mission on improving
national accounts covered constructing GDP from the expenditure side and compiling quarterly
national accounts. Further advice on improving GDP and developing quarterly GDP was provided in
November 2012, January and July, 2014. Between March 2013 and November 2014, STA field five TA
missions on balance of payments statistics, in the context of a project funded by the Government of
Japan. Another TA mission on balance of payments statistics is scheduled for March 2015.
Safeguards Assessment

In line with the Fund's safeguards assessments policy, an assessment of the Maldives Monetary
Authority was concluded in March 2010. In addressing recommendations, the MMA appointed an
external auditor and strengthened controls over foreign payments through the automation of the
authorization process. A Chief Internal Auditor has also been appointed, while capacity in the
internal audit function continues to be improved. In addition, to strengthen the legal framework,
amendments to the MMA Act were drafted in 2011 in consultation with the Fund, and have yet to
be enacted.

IMF–WORLD BANK JOINT MANAGEMENT ACTION PLAN
(As of December 2014)
In view of the macroeconomic challenges facing Maldives and in the wake of a period of political
volatility, the World Bank Group Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for FY14-FY16, presented to its Board in
June 2014, proposes a selective program of engagement focused on deepening dialogue and
support on macro-fiscal issues while strengthening the analytical foundations that would underpin a
future program. To this end, a Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) is under preparation to shed
light on the country’s challenges and opportunities for achieving more inclusive growth, reduced
poverty and enhanced prosperity of the Maldivian people. The SCD will inform policy dialogue and
provide the analytical basis for scoping out the next Country Partnership Framework (CPF). While the
ISN is planned to span over a 24-month period, the preparation of the next CPF could be brought
forward if opportunities emerge to support a full-fledged medium-term government program for
macroeconomic stability and sustainable growth. Under the current ISN, support is being provided
in the areas of: fiscal management, public financial management and debt management; sustainable
growth; social inclusion and service delivery; and environment and natural resource management.
The teams have been holding, and will continue to hold, joint missions and regular briefing
meetings on macroeconomic developments. Public financial management is a key area of
collaboration for these operations as is universal subsidies and social protection reform, where the
Bank is taking the lead on a number of initiatives aimed at improving targeting. The World Bank has
carried out a technical assistance project on fiscal policy in FY 14, and has launched a Public
Financial Management Systems strengthening project for FY 15-20, with the objective to enhance
budget credibility, transparency, and financial reporting of central government finances. It will focus
on strengthening the PFM environment (including enhancing the medium-term fiscal framework
and strengthening debt and cash management) and strengthening budget execution. This work is
carried out in close collaboration with the IMF providing considerable TA assistance in the areas of
PFM and PEFA. The Bank, Fund and Government have jointly undertaken a Public Expenditure and
Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment in mid-2014, followed by a PFM action plan. The Bank is
also providing technical assistance to forecasting tourism flows. The Appendix details the macro-critical
activities that the Bank and IMF will work on over the coming year.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of November 30, 2014)
Asian Development Bank
ADB’s interim country partnership strategy (CPS) for 2014‒2015 was endorsed by its Board of
Directors in October 2014. The interim CPS continues the partnership strategy and focus on ADB’s
prioritized areas and sectors of operations that were inherent in the interim CPS for 2012-2013;
these include: energy, transport, and finance (in particular, micro, small, and medium-sized
enterprises). In support of investments in these areas, ADB is providing capacity building support to
strengthen institutional capacity in various sectors such as tax administration, operations
management, and MSME development; and in agencies such as Maldives Energy Authority and the
Ministry of Finance and Treasury.
Work on the full CPS will commence in early 2015.

Loans and Grants
Since ADB started lending to the Maldives in 1981 and up to 2014-end, it has provided 24 loan and
grant projects to the country with a total approved amount of $209.91 million. As of November-end,
2 loans and grants (in the MSME and energy sectors) were active with a net amount of $45.350
million (Table 1). In October 2014, the ADB Board of Directors approved the Outer Island Sustainable
Energy Development Project; of its total cost, $38.08 million came from Asian Development Fund
(ADF).

Partnerships and Cofinancing
In addition to the ADF funds for the Outer Island Sustainable Energy Development Project, approved
in October 2014, it had cofinancing resources of $72 million, comprising $50 million from the
European Investment Bank, $12 million from the Scaling Up Renewable Energy Program in Low
Income Countries (SREP), and $10 million from the Islamic Development Bank.
By the end of 2013, cumulative direct value-added official cofinancing for Maldives amounted to
$14.2 million for four investment projects and $2.3 million for four technical assistance projects.
Private Sector Operations
In 2008, ADB approved a direct loan of $7.5 million and an equity investment of $4.5 million in the
Housing Development Finance Corporation, which provided funding for critically needed housing in
the country. As of year-end 2013, cumulative approvals in 2 projects amounted to $16.5 million
(including $4.5 million equity investment in loan 7274/2418). Total outstanding balances and
undisbursed commitments to nonsovereign projects in the Maldives amount to $5.7 million,
representing 0.1% of ADB’s total nonsovereign portfolio as of 31 December 2013.
Regional Cooperation
ADB is supporting the Maldives through the study on Regional Economics of Climate Change
(RECCSA), which identifies adaptation measures to climate change impact and recommends cleaner
technologies and options for the country and for the region. ADB-supported studies also focus on

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

strengthening and promoting regional cooperation on climate change by analyzing regional climate
change risks and addressing the issues associated with climate change at the cross-sectoral and
cross-country levels, which are of importance to the Maldives.
ADB also provided assistance in the preparation of the study on Indian Ocean Cargo and Passenger
Ferry to analyze the feasibility of launching subregional passenger and cargo services, connecting
the Maldives to India (Tuticorin and Cochin) and Sri Lanka (Colombo). This will help the Maldives to
increase accessibility and mobility; facilitate trade and regular cargo movement; and improve
logistics, which can consequently open new opportunities for tourism development.
The Maldives also receives capacity building support for customs modernization under the South
Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) program. In May 2014, the Maldives (together with
Sri Lanka), became full members of SASEC (original members were Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and
Nepal). SASEC focuses on planning, preparing, and implementing regional projects in energy, trade
facilitation, and transport.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of January 22, 2015)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Macroeconomic statistics have improved in recent years, with technical assistance from
STA and the Asian Development Bank (AsDB). While data are broadly adequate for surveillance
(Category B) there are nonetheless significant data gaps that complicate policy making and
aspects of surveillance. Remaining shortcomings affect the balance of payments, government
finance, and national accounts statistics. The main official statistical publication is the Statistical
Yearbook of Maldives. APD receives a monthly electronic statistical report, covering a broad range
of economic and financial statistics. It also receives the Quarterly Economic Bulletin (QEB) and
the Annual Report (AR), albeit with a lag, of the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA).
Real sector: National accounts statistics are available only on an annual basis and with a
considerable lag, though the authorities are working on quarterly GDP. While GDP estimates are
made using both the production and expenditure approaches, these estimates are inconsistent.
Furthermore, the base year for constant price estimates is 2003, so that recent changes in the
structure of the economy are not reflected by the base period weights. The AsDB has assisted
the authorities in setting up a framework for compiling more comprehensive national accounts
and STA has provided substantial assistance for improving the annual production and
expenditure GDP measures, and for developing quarterly GDP series.
The CPI was rebased to June 2012=100, with assistance from STA. Weights are based on the
2012 household income and expenditure survey.
Fiscal sector: General government data are reported for publication in the GFS Yearbook and the
latest published data are for 2011. Monthly data on revenue and expenditure are available, but
the reporting system is new, and its reliability is as yet untested. In particular, the consistency of
these data with below-the-line financing numbers provided by the monetary authorities is weak.
Data on external debt are subject to reconciliation with creditors. Data on the operations of state
enterprises are limited.
Monetary sector: APD receives a weekly electronic report on monetary statistics, covering the
balance sheets of the MMA and the commercial banks. Current summary data are published in
the MMA’s Monthly Statistics publication as well as in its QEB and AR. There are inconsistencies
between monetary and fiscal data regarding the financing of the fiscal deficit due to issues of
timing and coverage. An April 2007 STA monetary and financial statistics mission completed the
standardized report forms for the central bank and other depository corporations, and
developed an integrated monetary database that meets the needs of the MMA, STA, and APD. It
became operational in 2010.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

MALDIVES

External sector: The MMA compiles balance of payments data on an annual basis. Coverage has
improved but is still limited in some areas. Travel credits (receipts) are estimated on the basis of
tourism GST receipts and the use of the withholding tax on services provided by nonresidents
improved the coverage of other services (debits). Inward foreign direct investment, including
distributed and reinvested earnings, is estimated with a survey and administrative data. Other
private financial flows are estimated on the basis of the CPIS and BIS data, but coverage needs to
improve. Data on the international investment position are still incomplete as private sector data
are not available. Quarterly data on external debt and debt service are available for the
government and the monetary authority, and to some extent for the banking sector and state
enterprises at the time of the annual consultation missions, but no data are reported for the
nonfinancial private sector. A STA technical assistance mission is planned in March 2015 to
improve data on private financial flows, International Investment Position, and a range of other
specific items.
Notwithstanding recent improvements in the balance of payments statistics, the reliability of the
data is uncertain—in part as it is inherently difficult to capture full data with many transactions
occurring outside the country and no international counterparty data on tourism services to
validate revenue estimates.
Official reserves assets are reported weekly with a (variable) one-week lag. Predetermined
foreign currency outflows (mainly debt service payments) are known and reported to APD at the
time of annual Article IV consultation missions, while other movements of foreign currency assets
are not identified.

II. Data Standards and Quality
Maldives has participated in the General
Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since
October 14, 2011.

No data ROSC available.

III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
The authorities report macroeconomic data to the IMF on a regular and generally timely basis for
publication in the IFS, BOPSY, and GFSY.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION—
DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By
Rachel Van Elkan and
Catherine Pattillo (IMF)
and Satu Kahkonen (IDA)

Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and the International Development
Association (IDA)

Public debt is already very high by international standards and without fiscal adjustment
would be on an unsustainable path. The 2015 Budget, included in the baseline, puts in place
fiscal measures to reduce the primary deficit but these are not sufficient to stabilize the debt
ratio. And there is a risk of expenditure overruns. Maldives public debt problem is largely a
domestic one—total public and publicly guaranteed debt is expected to have reached 74.6
percent of GDP in 2014 while public external debt is 27.7 percent of GDP (mainly with
multilateral and bilateral creditors). Under the authorities’ current policies, public debt
continues to rise (104 percent of GDP in 2034) and domestic financing reaches 76 percent of
GDP in 2034. A staunch fiscal adjustment effort is needed; otherwise Maldives would face a
high risk of overall debt distress driven largely by domestic debt vulnerabilities.1
Fiscal policy mistakes and shocks to tourism exports or foreign direct investment are key
risks that could trigger debt distress. To place public debt on a firmly downward path, staff
proposes an additional focus on expenditure restraint and public financial management
reforms which, together with a further rise in Tourism Goods and Services Tax (TGST), would
place debt ratios on a sustainable path. Overall Maldives is judged to face a moderate risk of
external debt distress, based on an assessment of public external debt, but a heightened
overall risk of public debt distress, reflecting the significant and high vulnerabilities related
to domestic debt. There are also potential additional risks to external debt if the increase in
public debt is financed to a greater extent from external sources than currently assumed.

1

In 2011, Maldives was classified as a medium performer in terms of policies and institutions by the World Bank’s
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), averaging 3.28 over 2011–13. The indicative thresholds for
medium performers are 40 percent for the PV of the debt to GDP ratio, 150 percent for the debt to exports ratio,
250 percent for the PV of the debt to revenue ratio, 20 percent for the debt service to exports ratio and 20 percent for
the debt service to revenue ratio. Thresholds are applicable to public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt (not
to total PPG debt).Previously Maldives was rated as a high risk of external debt distress, the change in risk rating
reflects net repayments of private external debt since the previous assessment and a much lower private external debt
stock.

MALDIVES

RECENT DEBT DEVELOPMENTS
Total public debt has risen rapidly since the 2004 tsunami from around 36 percent of GDP in
2004 to 74.6 percent of GDP in 2014, excluding domestic arrears, above the 60 percent limit in
the Fiscal Responsibility Law (Figure 2 and Table 3).1,2 The increase initially reflected additional
expenditure needs in the aftermath of the tsunami but more recently additional recurrent spending
on wages, social welfare, and subsidies. Under the baseline scenario, public debt would remain on a
rising path over the medium term.
Public debt is held mainly by domestic banks, the
Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA) and official
multilateral and bilateral creditors (text figure).

Public Debt Holdings by Sector

The economy has relied heavily on the issuance of
treasury bills and monetization as well as external
borrowing to finance deficits. There has also been a
buildup in domestic arrears which are estimated at
6.3 percent of GDP in 2013. The DSA baseline assumes
the authorities clear these arrears going forward over a
period of five years.

Private Sector

The stock of external debt is substantially lower than previously projected but has been on a
rising trajectory. Between 2011 and 2013, net repayments of external public and publicly
guaranteed external debt and revised data for the private external debt have reduced the estimated
level of external debt in 2013 from 98 percent of GDP projected in the 2013 debt sustainability
analysis to 32 percent of GDP; PPG external debt is now estimated at 27.6 percent in 2013 down from
44 percent of GDP in the 2013 DSA. Private external debt is now estimated to be just 5 percent of
GDP in 2013 substantially lower than the projection of 53 percent in the previous DSA—this reflects
revisions to the external accounts which have also reduced the scale of the current account deficit
and lower net flows than projected in the past two years. However, these data are still estimates and
remain uncertain. With an open capital account and little reporting private sector external debt data
are subject to large errors and there are likely to be further revisions to debt estimates.
Taken together private external debt and total public debt are estimated at about $ 1.8 bn
(67 percent of GDP) in 2013.

1

Public debt is defined as the net debt of the non-financial public sector comprising central government, State Owned
Enterprises, publicly guaranteed debt and net of government deposits. It does not include domestic arrears.

2

Since the 2013 Article IV Staff Report nominal GDP has been revised upwards. The authorities have adopted market
price GDP as their aggregate (instead of gross value added at basic prices). The revision raises the level of nominal
GDP by 13 percent in 2013.

MACROECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS
The macroeconomic assumptions underlying this DSA have been updated based on
developments in 2013 and 2014. At the time of the IMF’s 2013 Article IV consultation, official data
pointed to very large current account and fiscal deficits. Two years on, the picture is somewhat
different: a recovery in tourism is supporting real growth and Maldives is performing well compared
to peers; substantial data revisions paint a less worrying picture of the current account (with deficits
of 10.6 percent of GDP in 2012 and 6.5 percent of GDP in 2013); external debt estimates are lower;
and while the large fiscal deficit has continued to widen following increases in recurrent spending,
measures in the 2015 Budget and earlier increases in taxes, including the Tourism Goods and
Services Tax (TGST) should help to rein in the deficit. The primary deficit is therefore projected to
narrow–but not sufficiently to bring debt ratios down.
Consistent with these developments, the main changes in the macroeconomic assumptions in
the 2014 DSA compared to those contained in the IMF’s 2013 Article IV Staff Report are: (i) a
lower non-interest current account deficit; (ii) a smaller but still sizeable primary deficit; (iii) a lower
starting point for external debt; and (iv) a somewhat stronger growth path (accompanied by slightly
higher FDI) reflecting a stronger tourism performance and a somewhat lower probability attached to
a twin deficit crisis (which would hit confidence and permanently damage growth prospects).
The baseline scenario is built on current policies,
including the Authorities 2015 Budget measures. This
includes the green tax on tourism (replacing the bednights
tax), increases in import duties, better targeting of subsidies,
and a public employment freeze. The baseline does not
include estimates for revenues from the Special Economic
Zones (SEZs). It also does not include any compensation
amount from the arbitration ruling over the airport
concession.3
Key assumptions: Overall, the baseline macroeconomic
assumptions are a little stronger than the previous DSA.4
The baseline macro scenario includes significant fiscal
adjustment but the primary balance does not improve
sufficiently to prevent a rising debt profile.

development of the tourism sector; estimates of potential output growth (are around
5 percent).5 The tourism sector initially continues to experience a recovery driven by
expansion from new markets (especially China) and a gradual pick up in core markets. New
resorts are likely to be developed and the development of the airport could substantially add
to capacity, sustaining growth into the medium term.6



Inflation. GDP deflator inflation remains low over the next two years reflecting lower oil prices
and generally weaker global commodity prices partly offset by higher import duties and then
rises to around 3.5 percent—close to its long run average.



The current account. Substantial data revisions have reduced current account deficit
compared to the previous DSA.7 The non interest current account deficit narrows in 2015 to
3.7 percent of GDP with lower oil prices and narrows a little to 3.4 percent of GDP in 2019
with improving tourist receipts and some restraint on import demand from the authorities’
planned fiscal adjustment. Thereafter the current account deficit widens a little. Reserves
levels strengthen by 2019.



The fiscal deficit. The primary deficit (under the baseline), improves by 3.7 percentage points
in 2015 significantly boosted by the temporary impact of bringing forward the timing of
extension of resort licenses; and in 2016 revenues strengthen with the full year effect of
higher import duties and the imposition of the green tax. Further consolidation is expected
thereafter from gradual expenditure restraint, lowering the primary deficit to around
2.4 percent of GDP. But this is less than the stabilizing primary deficit (0.8 percent of GDP)
and public debt ratios still continue to drift upwards—reaching 104 percent of GDP in 2034.



Financing. In the recent past, the bulk of the deficit financing has been met from domestic
sources, in particular through the domestic banking system and the pension fund. Interest
rates had risen sharply in the primary market for T-bills in 2012 and 2013. But, from mid 2014
the government has replaced the auction system with a 'tap system' (of fixed interest rates)
which lowered interest costs by about 200bp on average across maturities. This temporarily
stabilized interest cost on domestic debt. And thus far demand for T-bills has been sustained
by the banking sector, against a backdrop of weak lending conditions (with banks reluctant
to lend to sectors where NPLs built up during the crisis). However if debt rises, lower yields
may not be sustained and with global interest rates expected to rise, Maldives yields are
assumed to remain high over the forecast period. In the debt sustainability analysis it is

The real growth measure used in this report is gross value added at basic prices.

Around three quarters of activity is directly or indirectly linked to tourism. Maldives is a high end tourist destination
with around 60 percent of resorts in the 5 star and plus category, and demand is relatively price and income inelastic.
The authorities expect to lease ten new resorts a year. A second runway at the airport will also add to capacity.

Revisions to the balance of payments data are consistent with IMF technical assistance advice. Revisions
substantially reduced the current account deficits from around 20 percent of GDP to single digits in 2012 and 2013.

assumed that the bulk of financing is sourced domestically.8 However, as the debt ratio rises
this may not be sustainable—and raising external financing may become difficult.


Non debt creating financial flows. With limited lending opportunities, Maldives banks have
paid down debt and increased assets abroad since the global financial crisis, leading to a
steady financial account outflow (of around 4 percent of GDP). These outflows are expected
to continue and contribute to the residual in the external DSA.

EXTERNAL AND PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
External debt sustainability. Under the baseline scenario, with a smaller current account deficit to
be financed, the present value of external debt falls back a little to 26.7 percent of GDP and the
external burden remains comfortably below the thresholds. However, the improvement is in part
because it is assumed that the authorities continue to finance public debt predominantly from
domestic sources—a shift in financing mix towards greater external borrowing is an upside risk to
the external DSA. Furthermore, the external debt path is vulnerable to export shocks, a combined
shock to exports, GDP growth, US dollar GDP deflator and non-debt creating flows, and a scenario
where data reverts to historical averages (of a larger current account deficit and slightly weaker
growth). In the historical averages scenario two thresholds would be breached, and a third rises close
to the threshold.
Public debt sustainability. Public debt is already at a very high level and, even if the measures in
the 2015 Budget are effectively implemented, debt ratios continue to rise and are in breach of the
benchmark. Under the baseline, the PV of public debt rises from 70 percent of GDP in 2014 to
99 percent of GDP in 2034. Domestic debt is also highly vulnerable to shocks to the primary balance
and to growth (and there are downside risks to non tourism activity for example if domestic arrears
continue to build). Shocks to public debt or fiscal slippage or a lower growth trajectory than
expected easily push debt onto an unsustainable path.

ASSESSMENT
Current policies still lead to rising public debt levels and further adjustment is needed to build
buffers and reduce the risk of public debt distress. The DSA therefore points to the need for
additional fiscal consolidation measures in the near term.

8

In Maldives while such large domestic financing may have a small effect crowding out domestic activity, it is unlikely
to affect tourism (which accounts for around three-quarters of activity in Maldives directly and indirectly), since the
resorts typically obtain their financing from abroad. The impact on growth is not as adverse as for other economies.

IMF staff’s view is that further fiscal measures are needed to firmly place debt on a downward
path and this should entail better expenditure control and public financial management
reforms. Staff would recommend a further fiscal

debt ratio down (see text figure).
Even with a sustained fiscal consolidation effort, Maldives has a high level of public debt and
would remain vulnerable for a number of years. A deterioration of public finances, or external
shocks to tourism earnings and foreign direct investment, or a dent to confidence against a
backdrop of rising fiscal pressure are all important risks.
External risk rating. Overall, Maldives is judged to face a moderate risk of external debt distress,
based on an assessment of public external debt, but a heightened overall risk of debt distress,
reflecting the significant and high vulnerabilities related to domestic debt. In addition, as public debt
rises there is a risk that domestic financing sources become sated and financing has to be sought
from external sources, thus worsening the external debt outlook. The lowering of the risk rating from
high to moderate largely reflects data revisions and the much lower private external debt stock in
the current DSA compared to projections of the previous DSA—there were significant net
repayments of private external debt during 2011–13.

AUTHORITIES’ VIEWS
The authorities were of the view that the measures in the 2015 Budget would deliver bigger savings
and larger revenue increases than projected by staff (especially related to revenues from the
acquisition of SEZs and resort licenses). They expected the public employment freeze would generate
substantial savings on the wage bill. They expected these to be sufficient to bring debt ratios down
without the need for further revenue raising or other measures. Nonetheless, they concurred with the
external risk rating, though they judged the risks from the shock scenarios to be lower than assessed
by staff.

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Public debt is defined here as the net debt of the non-financial public sector comprising the central government, SOEs, and publicly guaranteed debt. It is net of government deposits (3 percent of GDP). It does not include domestic arrears.
2/ Gross financing need is defined as the primary deficit plus debt service plus the stock of short-term debt at the end of the last period.
3/ Revenues excluding grants.
4/ Debt service is defined as the sum of interest and amortization of medium and long-term debt.
5/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 6 years-- the years around the 2004 Tsunami are excluded as they are a one off exceptional event.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Maldives
On February 11, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Maldives.
The Maldives real economy has picked up. Growth is estimated to have reached 5 percent in
2014 with stronger tourism activity driven by a rapid expansion from Asian markets and a
tepid recovery from Europe. Staff expects growth to be around 5 percent in 2015. Weaker
import prices have pushed down inflation to low levels (1.1 percent in November 2014).
Higher tourism exports and subdued global food and fuel inflation have helped reduce the
current account deficit to around 8.4 percent of GDP in 2014; and following significant data
revisions, the current account is now substantially smaller than previously estimated. Lower
oil prices have improved the outlook for the current account and inflation in 2015. Gross
official reserves have risen to around $614mn (2.8 months imports). Financial soundness
indicators are slowly improving, monetary conditions are loose, but credit growth is subdued
at just 0.5 percent year on year to November 2014.
However, persistent and growing fiscal deficits have driven up the public debt ratio to a high
level. The fiscal deficit increased to an estimated 7.8 percent of GDP in 2013 and, following
increases in recurrent spending, the deficit is likely to have widened further in 2014.
Sustained primary deficits have led to an increase in the public debt level from 52 percent in
2009 to 75 percent of GDP in 2014.
The 2015 budget includes a number of important measures to rein in the fiscal deficit through
revenue raising measures (imposing a green tax, acquiring fees from Special Economic
Zones and raising import duties) and expenditure restraint through a public employment
freeze and better targeting of subsidies. However, further fiscal adjustment measures would
be needed to place debt ratios firmly on a downward path.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,

usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

Growth is expected to remain relatively strong in the near term, though the fiscal adjustment
envisaged in the 2015 Budget will have a mildly negative effect on growth. There is also
some upside potential if lower oil prices are sustained. However, with limited policy buffers,
the economy is vulnerable to fiscal slippages and inward spillovers. In the event of large
fiscal overruns relative to the authorities’ targets, borrowing costs and monetization could
increase, which would weaken the external position.
Over the medium term, while the tourism sector is expected to remain the locomotive for
growth in Maldives, economic diversification to reduce youth unemployment, and improving
the efficiency of public service provision remain key issues. The government has several
long run strategies: (i) developing regional hubs and improving transport connectivity which
could also encourage voluntary resettlement, and would enable higher quality service
provision (though such a change will take many years); (ii) developing Special Economic
Zones to diversify jobs into off-port shipping services, IT, financial services industries and
tourism-support activities such as traditional fisheries and small-scale agriculture; (iii)
undertaking infrastructure development, in particular of the airport, to add to capacity; and
(iv) reducing the environmental impact of tourism and reliance on oil imports by developing
renewable energy.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed that Maldives has reached middle-income status, with a
pickup in the real economy driven by tourism activity, a moderation in inflation, a marked
lowering of the fiscal deficit from its peak in 2009 aided by tax measures, and a stronger
reserves position. Although Maldives’s outlook is favorable, it shares many of the challenges
of other small states, and risks remain, particularly in the fiscal sector.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to fiscal consolidation and the plans
contained in the 2015 budget, including raising revenues, improving the targeting of
subsidies, and a temporary halt in public sector hiring. Nevertheless, they noted that some of
these measures will have only a temporary effect, and that further, durable fiscal adjustment,
with a focus on expenditure restraint, will be needed to place the public debt-to-GDP ratio on
a downward path over the medium term, consistent with the Fiscal Responsibility Law.
Improvements in public financial management and addressing domestic arrears need to
support the fiscal consolidation efforts.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views

of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any
qualifiers used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors welcomed the improvements to the external sector statistics, in line with IMF
technical assistance recommendations, which point to significantly smaller current account
deficits than previously estimated. They considered the stabilized exchange rate regime as
appropriate for Maldives. Directors welcomed the increase in official reserves, and
recommended continued strengthening of the official reserves position.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to avoiding the monetization of the fiscal
deficit, which will help direct monetary policy at supporting the exchange rate regime and
build buffers. They supported plans to make greater use of market-based financing for
government debt, including by developing the government securities market. Directors
welcomed the improvement in financial soundness indicators, and called for continued
efforts to strengthen financial supervision, including measures to ensure uniform high
standards for institutions that decide to operate in special economic zones.
Directors agreed that public service delivery and economic diversification are key
medium-term objectives. They welcomed the proposals for establishing regional hubs and
improving inter-island connectivity. Directors stressed that strict ring-fencing of tax
exemptions for special economic zones will be necessary to preserve the tax base. They also
emphasized that scaling up infrastructure investment should be implemented efficiently in
order to boost growth potential.
Directors welcomed the significant recent improvements in macroeconomic statistics, and
encouraged the authorities to continue to strengthen data quality and availability, including
adopting a statistics law to enhance data provision, to assist policy decisions.

Statement by Hazem Beblawi, Executive Director for Maldives
and Wafa F. Abdelati, Senior Advisor
February 11, 2015
At the outset, we would like to thank staff for their insightful analysis, constructive
discussions, and well-written reports. The Maldives’ authorities highly value the expert
advice of the Fund, much of which they agree with, and the effective technical assistance,
which they have consistently implemented. They consider the report to reflect positively on
developments in the Maldives and particularly appreciate staff’s recognition of the specific
structural challenges that Maldives faces due to its small population disbursed among so
many different islands. This Article IV discussion comes at a time of large data revisions,
which places the country in a much better position compared with the alarming assessment in
the last report. The authorities fully appreciate staff’s difficult position of working with
substantial data revisions. However, it is important to underscore that these data revisions are
due only to improvements in compilation and coverage, which are based on the
recommendations of technical assistance provided by the Fund. The authorities are grateful
for the Fund’s continued support in improving macroeconomic statistics as well as other
areas of technical assistance.
Background. The Maldivian economy is heavily dependent on fisheries and tourism, which
have been the major sources of growth, foreign exchange earnings and government revenues.
Maldives’ economy grew rapidly in the two decades prior to the December 2004 Tsunami,
powered by successful development of its tourism sector. Per capita incomes rose to upper
middle income levels and social conditions improved commensurately. However, the country
was severely hit by a series of natural disasters and external shocks –– the tsunami, the 20072008 food and fuel crisis, and the subsequent global financial crisis. As a result, the pace of
economic activity has been uneven in the past decade and macroeconomic management has
been somewhat complicated by the process of political transition to democracy. A sharp
slump in tourist activity in 2009 and then again in 2012 reflected the slowdown in Europe,
whose share fell from two thirds to one third of tourist arrivals to the Maldives. The picture is
more positive now. The real economy is picking up driven by a recovery in tourism activity1
due to the expansion of new Asian markets, the fiscal position has improved, inflation is very
low, and banking soundness has improved.
Fiscal revenue, which is highly dependent on tourism, declined by about 10 percentage
points of GDP between 2007 and 2009, and the public sector wage bill surged following the
2008 elections, which prompted the authorities to seek a Stand-By Arrangement in December
2009. At that time, the central government fiscal deficit was estimated at around 30 percent
of GDP and a drastic fiscal consolidation was targeted under the program. In the event, the
program was interrupted after the first review, mainly because staff was uncertain that the
1

More recently, Chinese tourists have continued to grow and now constitute the largest single source country for the
Maldives. See “Changing Dynamics in the Maldivian Tourism Industry: Chinese Tourists and Average Length of Stay” by:
Azeema Adam and Aishath Zara Nizar, MMA Research Papers, Volume 1 Number I, June 2014.

authorities’ policies could deliver the envisaged reduction in the fiscal deficit. Nevertheless,
the objectives of the 2009 program were largely achieved, particularly with respect to raising
sustainable budget revenues, reducing the overall and primary fiscal deficit, and significantly
raising international reserves. This experience underscores the authorities’ commitment to
implement significant reforms, even without a program and while going through political
transitions. Moreover––as aptly highlighted in the staff report––the recent balance of
payments revisions point to a considerably lower current account deficit than previously
believed.
Fiscal Policy. The authorities intend to build on the recent fiscal consolidation. The primary
fiscal deficit was reduced from 17 percent of GDP in 2009 to 5½ percent of GDP in 2013
according to staff’s estimates (or 2½ percent according to preliminary estimates of the
Ministry of Finance), which is a remarkable achievement by any measure. It also far
surpasses the episodes of large fiscal consolidation presented by staff in Box 4. This was
achieved by introducing a General Sales Tax in 2011 and later broadening its base and
raising the rate, a new Business Profits Tax in July 2011, as well as raising duties and some
charges. However, the introduction of the universal health program and other social welfare
contributions, which were considered a social priority, have since then contributed to rising
current spending and crowding out capital expenditures.
The 2015 Budget targets an ambitious further consolidation. Revenue measures include a
“green tax” to be levied tourists instead of the bednights tax, raising import duties on some
zero rated items, new resorts licenses and land acquisition fees from the Special Economic
Zones. Meanwhile, a public employment freeze will be implemented and electricity and food
subsidies will be cut, seizing the opportunity of low global oil and food prices and identifying
steps to improve targeting. The authorities expect this package to eliminate the primary
deficit and set debt on a downward and sustainable path as stipulated in the Fiscal
Responsibility Act, introduced in 2013, which aims to limit public debt to 60 percent of
GDP, down from the current level of 75 percent of GDP.
In any case, the authorities are keen to review local government pay structures, and they view
a public pay body as potentially helpful to ensure consistency of wages and salaries across
public service and to move in the direction of public service reform. The authorities consider
strengthening public financial management a key priority that will contribute to achieving
fiscal sustainability. They attach high importance to reducing the long-standing stock of
government arrears and preventing further accumulation. They are accordingly requesting
additional technical assistance from the Fund, particularly in the area of the fiscal chart of
accounts and budget execution. Additional revenue measures could be considered, if needed.
The staff suggests that the authorities undertake additional fiscal measures equivalent to 3
percent of GDP, which would be manageable. The authorities may out-perform staff’s fiscal
projections as has been the case in the past2.

2

The authorities targeted an overall fiscal deficit of 4 percent in 2013, and the last staff report had projected a deficit
exceeding 16 percent of GDP, but staff’s latest estimate places it at under 8 percent.

3
External Sector Assessment. The authorities welcome staff’s revised external sector
assessment. They view the current exchange rate regime to be suitable for Maldives given the
high degree of openness and seasonality of tourism revenues. Past exchange rate
devaluations have been unsuccessful (of which the latest is the 2011 experience) as the rapid
inflation pass-through offset the impact of the nominal exchange rate devaluation.
Continuing to improve the fiscal position is seen as the best way to sustain the exchange rate
within its current band. The authorities particularly appreciate the additional background
work prepared by staff to better understand the functioning of the foreign exchange market
and revise balance of payments estimates, consistent with the authorities’ previous requests.
For their part, the authorities have begun to collect more regular information on the
operations of exchange bureaus.
Monetary and Financial Policies. The Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA) remains
committed to its objectives of maintaining price stability and an adequate level of
international reserves, while promoting non-inflationary economic growth. Although
monetary aggregates have been growing rapidly as the MMA accumulates reserves, private
sector credit growth has remained subdued as banks are cautious in extending new credit.
The authorities consider the reduction of the minimum reserve requirement necessary given
its unusually high level3 and the handling of the government’s overdraft the best way to
facilitate achievement of the targets under the Fiscal Sustainability Law. The policy stance
was eased in 2014 in response to macroeconomic conditions, including very low inflation.
The MMA stopped monetizing the deficit since April 2014, and monetary policy decisions
have not been influenced by government finance considerations. The MMA continues to
absorb liquidity through its overdraft facility while it has only temporarily stopped
conducting Open Market Operations. Steps are being considered to deepen and develop the
Treasury bill market and to introduce longer term instruments. Financial soundness indicators
continue to improve as the strengthening of loan portfolios reflects a revival in the tourism
and construction sectors.
Medium term prospects. The authorities are optimistic that medium-term growth will pick
up following the development of the new airport, implementation of current plans to improve
infrastructure, and investments in the Special Economic Zones. Diversifying the economy
beyond tourism and creating employment opportunities is a high priority. These plans are
intended to boost growth potential and will help build buffers against external shocks. The
authorities are well aware of the external vulnerabilities faced by all small open touristdependent states. The risks outlined in the Matrix are plausible but appear to be over-stated.
The tourism sector has out-performed other peers and Maldives has a broad spectrum of
source countries and still substantial unmet demand by international visitors.
In closing, we welcome the shift to a more positive staff assessment, which reflects important
policy achievements, favorable economic developments, and data revisions as recommended

average local and foreign currency deposits, excluding interbank liabilities and L/C margin deposits.

by the Fund. We look forward to continued close engagement with the Fund as the
authorities tackle remaining challenges.
