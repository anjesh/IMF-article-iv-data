STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. After slowing in 2013, the Slovak economy is gathering momentum as the euro
area and domestic demand recover, the latter complementing the strong export sector
that has made Slovakia one of Europe’s more dynamic economies. Reducing still very
high unemployment remains a key challenge, as does sustaining fiscal adjustment.
Manageable public and private debt as well as a sound banking system limit
vulnerabilities, but Slovakia’s fortunes remain closely tied to external developments,
especially in the euro area, and there are risks from regional tensions since Russia
provides much of Slovakia’s energy and is a reasonably important export market,
including for Slovakia’s trading partners.
Growth and jobs. Despite positive growth, unemployment is very high and reflects large
regional disparities, which are also seen in income levels and infrastructure. Wideranging actions are needed to encourage investment and job creation, reduce
disincentives to working and hiring, enhance skills, and facilitate workforce participation.
Fiscal policy. Fiscal consolidation has continued, allowing exit from the EU’s Excessive
Deficit Procedure (EDP), but domestic debt brakes have started to bite and challenges
remain in sustaining adjustment, in part because of reliance on temporary measures.
Given these factors, as well as potential difficulties in focusing on spending cuts for
future deficit reduction, strengthening revenue collection should be a priority.
Consideration also might be given to refining the fiscal framework over time.
Financial sector policy. Slovakia’s sound, liquid, and well-capitalized banking sector is
well-positioned should corporate credit demand pick up. Household lending has grown
rapidly, and while real estate prices are flat and household debt moderate,
recommendations on loan-to-value (LTV) or debt-to income ratios would help guard
against a build-up of risks. Reducing taxes and fees would address some of the factors
that have inhibited capital market activity.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
Growth is gathering pace in 2014 with signs that domestic demand is recovering to
complement the vibrant export sector that has been a key element in Slovakia’s positive
economic performance since joining the EU ten years ago (Box 1). Fiscal consolidation
progress, moderate debt levels, favorable market conditions, trade and current account
surpluses, and a sound banking system help provide a solid economic foundation.
Nonetheless, unemployment remains elevated and significant regional disparities persist.
External risks include potential weakness in Europe and effects from regional tensions
given energy imports from and exports to Russia.

A. Economic Recovery Gathering Pace

Headline inflation has declined sharply, reflecting lackluster domestic demand, weak
commodity prices, and euro appreciation. Domestic demand has acted as a drag on growth and
core inflation, reflecting weak investment and stagnant private consumption. The impact of
declining energy prices and abating pressure from food prices has been compounded by euro
appreciation and Czech koruna depreciation, which have lowered import prices. Producer price
inflation has been negative since mid-2013 while headline inflation moved into negative territory in
the first months of 2014.

3.
Unemployment remained well above the EU average (Figure 2). Employment contracted
in 2013, but with the working-age population also declining, the unemployment rate stabilized at
around 14 percent. Youth unemployment is near 33 percent and long-term unemployment
represents more than two-thirds of the total, reflecting structural challenges. Regional disparities are
great, with joblessness much higher in central and eastern Slovakia. There was, however, an
encouraging uptick in employment in early 2014. Moderate wage increases and robust productivity
translated into subdued unit labor cost growth.
4.
Fiscal consolidation continued but debt brakes started to bite (Figure 3, Tables 2–3, and
Annex III). The general government deficit declined to 2.8 percent of GDP in 2013 (against a target
of 2.9 percent of GDP), enabling exit from the EU’s Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP). Deficit
reduction, while substantial, was achieved partly through low-quality and temporary measures such
as under-spending EU funds, significant cuts in capital outlays especially by local governments, and
allowing a shift of pension assets from the fully funded second pillar to the public first pillar scheme,
which offset wage bill and other expenditure overruns. Explicit one-off measures in 2013 totaled
0.3 percent of GDP while savings from lower co-financing on EU Funds—by delaying potentially
useful projects—totaled 0.4 percent of GDP. Welcome improvements in VAT collection—Slovakia’s
VAT efficiency has been among the lowest in the EU—started materializing late in 2013 and yielded
about 0.4 percent of GDP. The recent inclusion of the railway company in the general government
per a determination by Eurostat also contributed to the better-than-budgeted outturn. General
government debt rose above a debt brake threshold of 55 percent of GDP in 2013, partly reflecting
Eurostat classification of the newly-created Emergency Oil Stocks Agency (EOSA) as a public unit.
Under the national Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA), breaching this debt threshold triggers some
expenditure cuts during 2014 and the submission of a 2015 budget that freezes much spending
at 2014 budgeted levels.

Box 1. Slovak Republic: Ten Years in the EU1
EU membership catalyzed a remarkable turnaround for the Slovak Republic. The Velvet Revolution
in 1989 led to a peaceful dissolution of Czechoslovakia, but the new Slovak Republic lagged its Czech
neighbor in terms of income level, starting near that of Hungary and Poland and well below the EU average.
Relatively strong growth early in the transition slowed progressively and eventually stalled, as had the EU
accession process. The election of a reform-minded government in 1998 with an ambitious agenda helped
restart EU talks, and Slovakia was able to join the first wave of eastern EU enlargement on May 1, 2004.
Slovakia took an additional step toward further European integration by adopting the euro in January 2009.

EU accession has fostered a rapid catch-up in income. Slovakia’s per-capita income climbed to roughly
75 percent of the EU average in 2012 from less than half in the mid-1990s, outpacing Poland and Hungary
and closing much of the gap with the Czech Republic. Output growth accelerated significantly in the postaccession years, averaging 7.2 percent in 2004–08. After a contraction in 2009, reflecting the large
international trade collapse, economic activity rebounded to a more moderate average growth rate of
2.5 percent in 2010–13. While Slovakia and its neighbors all benefited from sharp increases in FDI, Slovakia
also enjoyed high total factor productivity growth. With substantial investment in export industries
(especially autos and electronics) following accession, net exports became a key driver of Slovak growth,
particularly after 2009, resulting in a current account surplus in 2012–13, following years of deficits due in
part to capital goods imports.

Box 1. Slovak Republic: Ten Years in the EU (concluded)
Integration into the world economy has
deepened substantially. Since the mid-1990s,
the degree of openness of the economy, as
measured by the sum of exports and imports of
goods as a percent of GDP, has risen sharply to
about 170 percent in 2013, and Slovakia’s export
market share in the European Union has tripled.
This expansion was supported by significant
inflows of foreign direct investment and went
hand-in-hand with growing participation of the
Slovak economy in global value chains (GVCs),
especially in the auto industry.

have not addressed unemployment or been
shared uniformly. Very high unemployment during the transition period fell significantly until the 2009
downturn when joblessness rose again, and now remains well above peers. Striking differences among
regions persist in terms of per-capita income and unemployment. These differences are partly the legacy of
historical and geographical conditions, but also reflect investment and growth patterns from the recent past.
While outward migration expanded to new destinations after EU accession (e.g., the United Kingdom), much
of this reversed in the wake of the crisis with the exception of Austria.

The first chapter of the Selected Issues (Ten Years on from EU Accession) provides a fuller discussion.

5.
Market conditions remain favorable. The government had secured more than 65 percent
of its 2014 financing needs by early June, maintains large cash balances (6 percent of GDP at end2013), and has tapped new markets while extending the average maturity of debt. Strong demand
from non-resident investors more than offset some divestment by domestic banks, which hold a
high share of government bonds to total assets among euro area banks. Bond and CDS spreads
remain low and rating agencies have upgraded outlooks to stable.
6.
Robust exports continued to support Slovakia’s external position (Figures 4–5 and
Table 5). Strong competitiveness prompted additional gains in export market shares, consolidating

trade and current account surpluses. However, the country’s negative net investment position
deteriorated marginally and gross external debt rose (Annex IV), mainly reflecting an increase in the
share of non-resident holdings of government debt (now more than 50 percent) as part of the
authorities’ strategy to reduce risks by diversifying the investor base. The external position is broadly
consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings (Box 2).
Box 2. Slovak Republic: Competitiveness
Current account. The current account remained in surplus in 2013, at around 2 percent of GDP. A
decomposition of current account drivers shows that cyclical factors explain much but not all of the recent
improvement.1 There is some uncertainty, however, over balance of payments statistics in light of large
errors and omissions and anecdotal accounts of “branding,” potentially involving overstatement of export
prices.
Real effective exchange rate (REER). A CGER-like methodology using a large panel of heterogeneous
countries provides a mixed assessment of Slovakia’s REER. While the current account approaches

to 9 percent in 2013, the equilibrium real exchange

almost 40 percent. A closer look at CGER-like estimates

suggests that Slovakia’s REER is broadly in line with
fundamentals. Over time, policies targeted at boosting

Capital and financial account. FDI inflows to Slovakia declined in 2013, but are expected to pick up again
in 2014. Large portfolio inflows in 2012 and 2013 reflect the strategy of the Slovak government to mitigate
risks by diversifying the investor base while also extending maturities and lowering funding costs. Overall,
capital flows are expected to remain generally stable although, as noted above, large errors and omissions
complicate the assessment somewhat.
Foreign asset and liability position. External debt rose to a still manageable 83 percent of GDP and the net
international investment position (NIIP) deteriorated in 2013, but at negative 66 percent is in line with peers
in Central Europe. Despite the weakening NIIP, external vulnerabilities are mitigated by the large share of FDI
among liabilities and by recent increases in portfolio liabilities being due mostly to government debt with
long maturities. Staff consider the moderate current account surpluses projected over the medium term,
even while allowing room for the policies noted above to support domestic demand and reduce high
unemployment, as consistent with lowering external debt,.
1

The second chapter of the Selected Issues (Evolution of Drivers of the Business Cycle in Slovakia) considers the structural and
cyclical components of external surpluses.

7.
The banking sector remains sound while lending increased marginally (Figure 7 and
Table 6). Household borrowing, mainly for housing, continued to grow at around 11 percent, while
corporate lending turned just positive, but only due to large transactions of two state-owned

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SLOVAK REPUBLIC

enterprises. Average LTV ratios remain around 70 percent and average property prices have been
flat or slightly falling, but loans with higher LTVs have become more common, reflecting stronger
competition among lenders. Robust net interest margins supported profitability, despite the impact
of the bank levy. Although impaired loans to the corporate sector edged up, nonperforming loans
(NPLs) are low and well provisioned. Banks continue to enjoy stable domestic funding and further
strengthened their capital buffers.

B. Outlook and Risks
8.
Activity is picking up amid a more favorable outlook. Growth is projected to accelerate
to 2.4 percent in 2014 and to 3 percent over the next few years, despite fiscal headwinds. The
forecast reflects an improving external environment as well as more balanced growth as confidence,
investment, and employment improve, enabling domestic demand to replace net exports as the
main driver of growth. Medium-term potential growth is estimated at around 2½ percent, largely
reflecting continued improvements in total factor productivity. As domestic demand strengthens
and energy prices rebound, headline inflation is projected to edge up in the second half of 2014 but
remain subdued over the forecast period. The trade and current account balances will remain in
surplus, reflecting some further gain in export market shares. Unemployment is expected to fall
gradually, owing to higher employment and a decline in the working-age population, but to stay
near 12 percent in the medium term.
9.

Slovakia faces positive and negative risks (Annex I, Risk Assessment Matrix).



On the upside, market sentiment and conditions in key trading partners are improving, and ECB
easing could provide further support. Additional positive impulses could come from residential
and other infrastructure investment, as well as greater absorption of EU funds.



Negative spillovers could come from prolonged low-growth/low-inflation in Europe given the
importance of trade and FDI to Slovakia.1 Slower



Potential escalation of tensions between Russia and Ukraine might affect Slovakia given high
dependence on Russian energy, although Slovakia has sufficient reserves to withstand a shortlived interruption of gas supply. Exports to Russia are 2 percent of GDP, whereas trade and
financial links with Ukraine are negligible. Risks would rise if Germany and the euro area were
significantly affected.



With relatively low levels of public and private debt, declining government financing needs, and
healthy cash balances, bouts of financial market volatility would likely have limited impact.



On the domestic side, prolonged high unemployment could inhibit a recovery in domestic
demand and lead to lower growth, both in the near-term and in the longer-term as the erosion
of human capital could damage potential output.

10.
Policies should be geared toward sustaining growth and supporting domestic demand.
With external surpluses and falling debt levels projected over the medium term, but domestic
demand only recently starting to rebound amid very high unemployment, policy efforts should seek
to encourage investment and job creation. This could be supported by structural policies to unlock
growth, moderately paced fiscal adjustment focused on enhanced revenue collection to fund key
priorities, as well as steps to facilitate access to credit, especially for small firms.
Authorities’ views
11.
The authorities and staff generally agreed on the outlook and risks. The latest
government forecasts are similar to staff projections, although somewhat more optimistic for 2015
growth, even as fiscal adjustment continues. They agreed on the importance of strengthening
domestic demand and foresaw somewhat greater reductions in unemployment. The authorities
concurred on the above-mentioned risks, although a long-lasting interruption of gas supply by
Russia was viewed as unlikely. While banks in Slovakia are considered robust, the authorities flagged
the possibility of broader market volatility if stress tests reveal capital deficiencies elsewhere in
Europe.

STRENGTHENING GROWTH AND EMPLOYMENT
Trade and financial integration have placed Slovakia among Europe’s fastest growing
economies, helping rapidly close much of the gap with European income levels.
Unemployment is very high, however, and large regional disparities persist. Steps to
encourage investment in lagging regions as well as to improve labor market functioning
and enhance skills would help boost employment and strengthen domestic demand,
while preserving the competitiveness that has underpinned Slovakia’s export success.
12.
Slovakia’s export-led growth model has been successful but challenges remain.
Investment and exports by high-productivity multinational firms, especially around Bratislava and
focused on automobile and electronics assembly, have been critical to the country’s relatively strong

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SLOVAK REPUBLIC

growth and provide high-quality jobs, but also make Slovakia more subject to global market
conditions. At the other end of the spectrum, there are many SMEs, but they are often very small
and have limited innovation capacity. Growth has been driven by capital accumulation funded
mainly though FDI, and increases in total factor productivity. The labor income share, as measured
by real unit labor costs, has been on a downward trend amid cost competition from neighboring
countries.
13.
Regional differences are large. Behind rapid catching-up with EU income levels are
sizeable differences among regions, with those outside Bratislava having lower per-capita income,
lower productivity, significant innovation performance gaps, higher unemployment, and limited job
opportunities (Box 3). Low mobility, reflecting high home-ownership and an underdeveloped rental
market, as well as skill mismatches hamper labor market adjustment, and this is compounded by
poor infrastructure and business climate challenges that inhibit investment and job creation in
weaker regions.

Slovakia suffers from very high unemployment, especially long-term and among
youth. Despite the economic rebound in the aftermath of the 2009 crisis, unemployment remains
elevated as productivity has improved, but at the expense of employment. The crisis has
exacerbated persistent long-term unemployment and aggravated youth unemployment, which has
nearly doubled. Joblessness is more acute in the eastern and central parts of the country where
there are limited vacancies. The high unemployment rates in these regions may even understate the
challenge given marginal participation in the labor market by the Roma population (only 20 percent
of Roma men and less than 10 percent of Roma women, according to a World Bank estimate).2
15.
Wide-ranging policy actions are needed to unlock the potential of the Slovak
economy. Given limited vacancies in weaker regions, it is especially important to encourage

investment and job creation. These efforts should be complemented by actions to reduce financial
disincentives to working and hiring, enhance skills, and facilitate the transition from school to work
as well as from unemployment back to the workforce. Over the medium term, action in these areas
could also help Slovakia move up global value chains and diversify its production structure, thereby
improving resiliency to external shocks. Policy and budget priorities should seek to:


Improve infrastructure. With few unfilled jobs in high unemployment areas, strengthening
infrastructure, especially highways such as the main east-west route where faster progress is
needed, is critical to opening up investment opportunities and fostering job creation in lagging
regions. Increased absorption of EU funds in this area and more efficient procurement practices
could help. Facilitating access to rental housing would also enhance labor mobility and regional
integration.



Strengthen the business climate (Figure 6). Slovakia’s regulatory burden compares unfavorably
with other EU countries and regional peers. In addition, corruption challenges are perceived as
widespread and have involved EU Funds.3 Strengthening contract enforcement (e.g., to address
payment delays that particularly affect small firms), improving administrative procedures and
public procurement, as well as enhancing the legal system and strengthening anti-corruption
efforts would create more favorable conditions for doing business. Firms would also benefit
from lower energy costs, which are among the highest in the EU. Reducing regulation in
professional services and retail trade would foster competition with benefits for consumers.

Maintain labor market flexibility. Slovakia’s employment protection legislation, even after the
unwinding of some 2011 reforms, appears broadly in line with that of peers. However, the
decision taken in early 2014 to allow extension of collective bargaining agreements to most
employers in a sector introduces rigidity that could discourage hiring and hinder adaption to
wide regional differences. Consideration should be given to re-introducing the previous
arrangement that allowed firms to opt out of collective bargaining agreements (e.g., Germany

and Italy allow opt-outs) or increasing the threshold number of employees at which collective
agreements would be extended to firms. Also, setting different minimum wages across regions
would better reflect widely varying labor market conditions. Plans for a uniform minimum wage
rise could increase challenges to securing employment for some workers.
Box 3. Slovak Republic: Regional Disparities
Regional disparities are among the highest in
the EU. The gap between the region with the
lowest unemployment (Bratislava) and the highest
(east Slovakia) is the fifth largest in the EU, with only
Spain, Italy, Belgium, and Greece recording wider
differences. In terms of regional dispersion of percapita GDP, only Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania
show greater disparities. More comprehensive
indicators, such as the EU regional competitiveness
index, which covers a wide range of issues (e.g.,
innovation, quality of institutions, infrastructure,
health and human capital), show a similar picture.
Only France, Romania and Greece show as large a
gap between the capital and the second most
competitive region.

Lower labor taxes and improve incentives.
Reducing the high tax wedge that makes it
unattractive for firms to hire and for people with
low skill levels to work should be a high priority
in the budget (¶22). Incentives under the benefit
structure might be improved (e.g., consideration
might be given to tapering general social
benefits over time while continuing to provide
some benefits when beginning work).
Improve the quality of education and training.
Deteriorating PISA scores have highlighted
educational challenges. Consistent with OECD
recommendations, strengthening the quality of
teachers would be appropriate, while vocational
training efforts should seek to improve curricula
to better match workforce needs and create an
effective dual system of vocational training
based on close cooperation with businesses to
ensure substantial practical experience in
workplaces.4

Authorities’ views



530

SLOVAK REPUBLIC



Business climate. The government has passed a resolution on improving the business
environment and has focused initially on facilitating payment of taxes and cross-border trade
(e.g., through simplified customs procedures). A major reform is underway to streamline public
administration and improve service efficiency (the ESO initiative). In addition, the time for
incorporation and granting a trade license has been shortened, and the government intends to
lower relevant fees.



Education. Teacher salaries were raised in 2013 and remain a high priority to attract wellqualified instructors, testing is being strengthened to track school quality, and a new higher
education act is being drafted with a view toward strengthening universities and creating a
closer connection with the private sector. A new vocational educational and training act also is
being prepared to introduce formally a dual system involving workplace experience. Pre-school
education capacities are being enhanced.



ALMPs and incentives to work. Less effective ALMP programs have been eliminated and
emphasis on educational programs and counseling has been increased. One-year relief for firms
from social and health contributions for hiring the long-term unemployed was introduced.
Creation of new jobs for people under 29 years of age is being subsidized using European Social
Funds. The government is considering gradually reducing social benefits after hiring, to increase
disposable income for new hires. Also, the authorities intend to decrease significantly health
contributions for low-income workers. PES reforms are underway to create a three-pillar system
(information counseling services, professional services, and data centralization) by 2020.
Measures to increase Roma inclusion are being implemented.

On the other hand, the authorities did not expect recent changes to the Labor Code and the
extension of collective agreements to have adverse effects on employment. Regional differentiation
of the minimum wage is not viewed as a feasible option, especially in a relatively small country. The
government intends to increase the minimum wage, but expects the impact on wage costs for lowincome workers to be offset by the decrease in health contributions.

SUSTAINING FISCAL CONSOLIDATION
Despite slower growth in 2013, substantial fiscal adjustment was achieved and brought
the budget deficit below the threshold for exiting the EU’s EDP. To achieve further gradual
deficit reduction and move toward the EU medium-term objective, a focus on the revenue
side would be appropriate, but a debt brake under Slovakia’s own FRA instead mandates
a more expenditure-based approach. Implementing spending measures of the required
magnitude is likely to be difficult, and it will therefore be important to continue to
strengthen revenue collection to sustain medium-term adjustment and make room for
priority budget items.
17.
Sizeable fiscal adjustment has allowed Slovakia to exit the EDP. Since 2009, the budget
deficit has been reduced by about 5 percentage points to 2.8 percent of GDP in 2013—just below

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

SLOVAK REPUBLIC

the threshold for exiting the EU’s EDP. Over the period 2010–13 the annual average fiscal effort
reached 1.5 percent of GDP, well above the average fiscal effort of at least 1 percent of GDP called
for by the EU, and was largely pro-cyclical.
18.
From a macroeconomic perspective, gradual adjustment with emphasis on correcting
revenue underperformance would be advisable. Slovakia has an output gap, subdued inflation,
and important spending needs (e.g., to address high

measures.
19.
EU and domestic fiscal frameworks, however, require faster fiscal adjustment, largely
(in the latter case) through expenditure cuts. Given the cyclical position of the economy, EU
commitments would require a positive structural adjustment of at least 0.1 percent of GDP this year.
However, achieving the EU MTO in 2017 would call for much larger consolidation efforts in the
following years. Slovakia’s domestic FRA is more restrictive and emphasizes spending reductions
now. Breaching the 55 percent of GDP debt threshold in 2013 mandates a 3 percentage point cut in
general government expenditure in 2014 (excluding debt service payments, EU funds and cofinancing, EU budget contributions, transfers to the Social Insurance Agency and natural disaster
spending) amounting to 0.4 percent of GDP and submission of a budget that freezes spending (with
the same exemptions) in subsequent years as long as debt remains above 55 percent of GDP.
Compared to a no-policy change scenario, staff estimate that implementation of the FRA would
result in 2015 growth being lower by 0.3 percentage points (i.e., 2.7 versus 3.0 percent).5 Crossing
the next debt threshold at 57 percent of GDP would require submission of a balanced budget and
potentially sharp adjustment with more negative growth effects.
20.
For 2014, additional measures should yield a deficit similar to last year with the impact
of the FRA limited due to contingency buffers.

5

The estimate assumes fiscal multipliers of 0.3 in year one, and 0.1 in year two.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SLOVAK REPUBLIC



Given an expected widening of the deficit in the absence of policy changes, partly due to past
reliance on temporary approaches, the 2014 budget contained measures of about 1 percent of
GDP, intended to deliver a deficit of 2.6 percent of GDP. A little more than half of the savings
would come from public wages and other spending, with much of the rest from continuation of
a special levy on regulated industries and a minimum lump-sum corporate income tax (partially
offset by reducing the corporate tax rate from 23 percent to 22 percent). Roughly half of the
measures in the 2014 budget are one-off or temporary items.6



An adverse determination by Eurostat on carryover of dividends from 2013 into 2014 created a
revenue shortfall (0.5 percent of GDP). Stronger-than-budgeted taxes, especially VAT, and the
mandatory expenditure cuts triggered by the domestic debt brake could address much of the
shortfall. The budget and growth impact of the FRA is limited in 2014 since much of the required
spending reduction can be met by unwinding budgeted but unallocated outlays.



Staff see risks in containing spending, especially on the public wage bill given past overruns.
There are also risks from one-off special levy revenue associated with still-to-be-determined
changes in the ownership structure of a gas company. Staff estimate a 2014 deficit of
2.9 percent of GDP. Debt is expected to remain just above 55 percent of GDP, assuming some
drawdown of healthy accumulated cash reserves, and that the government is successful in
restructuring the oil agency (EOSA) to reverse the contribution to debt in 2013.

21.
Medium-term government consolidation efforts would focus on reducing spending.
Consistent with the FRA’s emphasis on expenditure cuts, the government’s medium-term budget
plan targets much lower outlays (a drop of about 4 percentage points of GDP from 2014 to 2017) to
achieve a 2017 headline deficit of 0.5 percent of GDP and meet the MTO. While the government’s
Stability Program identifies some revenue measures—sustaining improvements in VAT collection
and small amounts from withholding taxes for doctors, expanded use of electronic cash registers,
and more effective social contributions collections—the majority of adjustment would come from
spending cuts, largely unidentified, although the ongoing streamlining of public administration
through the ESO initiative would yield some savings. Under the authorities’ medium-term plan, debt
would remain above the 55 percent of GDP debt threshold through 2015 before falling, although
the share held by non-residents (more than 50 percent) would remain somewhat high.7
22.
Expenditure-based adjustment will be difficult and could put pressure on priority
outlays. Staff’s forecast assumes that the constitutional level FRA is implemented through spending
cuts applied proportionally across expenditure, recent improvements in revenue and especially VAT
collection are sustained, and cash reserves are kept constant in nominal terms after 2014. The debt6

to-GDP ratio would remain above 55 percent through 2015, thus requiring submission of budgets
with spending freezes in 2015 and 2016, although the privatization of Slovak Telekom (more below)
represents a positive risk. Debt would not cross the 57 percent of GDP threshold requiring
submission of a balanced budget. Deficits would be broadly in line with the authorities’ targets and
the MTO would be achieved before 2017, but the implicit structural adjustment in 2015–16 would
amount to almost 1 percent of GDP per year. Challenges in controlling the public wage bill and
substantial cuts to investment spending in recent years, as well as the need to fund priority items to
address unemployment and regional disparities (e.g., investing in infrastructure and reducing the tax
wedge), suggest reliance on spending cuts could be difficult to sustain and undesirable in terms of
key objectives. As an example of the potentially limited appetite for spending cuts, in late June the
Prime Minister announced plans for €250 million (0.3 percent of GDP) in new spending and tax
breaks.

Against this background, strengthening revenue collection should be a priority.
Improving tax collection. Sustaining and making further improvements to address low VAT
efficiency is essential, as is strengthening tax collection and reducing evasion and fraud more
broadly. Implementation of a comprehensive 50-point action plan is intended to address
concerns and efforts have focused in particular on VAT control statements. Estimates suggest
improving VAT efficiency by 1 percentage point could lift revenue by about 0.5 percent of GDP.
Staff stressed the benefits of maintaining the current VAT rate of 20 percent (it was to fall
to 19 percent in 2015 given a 2013 deficit below 3 percent of GDP); doing so would yield about
0.3 percent of GDP. Merging tax, customs, and social contribution collections, which is taking
some time, could reduce administrative costs

and help combat evasion and fraud.
Market value-based real estate tax. Real estate
taxation, based on square meters, yields
about 0.4 percent of GDP, more than
1 percentage point lower than the EU
average. A property value-based real estate
tax could yield substantial revenue and would
be more equitable and less distortive than
other taxes in terms of effects on growth.
Support for low-income households could
mitigate potential social concerns.

Other options could help alleviate pressure on expenditure.
Privatization would lower debt in a growth-friendly way and help avoid the FRA’s spending
constraints. The government’s decision to sell its 49 percent stake in Slovak Telekom could yield
about 1 percent of GDP, potentially lowering debt below 55 percent of GDP and avoiding an
additional year’s spending freeze. More generally, privatization of still sizeable state ownership
could have potential benefits in terms of debt, the budget, and capital market development. The

recent increase of the state role in a key energy

however, and could imply fiscal costs if, as

in its EU Funds execution rate (about 46 percent

until 2015, equivalent to about 7 percent of

use of EU Funds and co-financing is exempted from FRA spending cuts and freezes.



Spending efficiency. Beyond the broader ESO initiative, compared to peers, healthcare outlays
remain inefficient relative to outcomes and could offer room for savings or better care without
adding to costs.

25.
Over time, refinement of the fiscal framework might be considered. Having the FRA on
top of evolving EU fiscal rules has created a complicated framework with some undesirable effects,
as described above. The credibility costs of modifying the framework the first time it becomes
binding would argue against adjusting the FRA now, but in the future the government might
consider whether there is scope to make the FRA less biased toward expenditure cuts and less procyclical, for instance by considering a smoother adjustment path, or even whether the FRA is still
needed given European commitments. If retained, the framework also might be more reflective of
debt vulnerabilities; for example, accumulation of cash balances (pre-funding) increases gross debt
but reduces short-term rollover risks. In addition, contingency provisions might be considered to
address changes in EU statistical definitions such as what is included in the general government.
26.
Further pension reforms would strengthen long-term finances. Reforms in 2012
significantly improved long-term sustainability of the pension system by linking the retirement age
with demographic trends, changing pension indexation, and capping the accrual of pension benefits
for higher earners. Nonetheless, a long-term financing gap persists. Linking pension calculations to a
sustainability factor and shortening the transition period to a higher retirement age could help
address the long-term gap.



Fiscal policies. The substantial adjustment achieved to enable EDP exit demonstrates the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SLOVAK REPUBLIC

government’s ability to meet fiscal targets. The authorities concurred on the need to enhance
revenue collection and in July the parliament approved an amendment to keep the VAT rate
unchanged. They underscored results achieved so far in fighting tax evasion and fraud. Control
statements and an IT system to allow real-time cross-checking of VAT declarations have been
introduced, and roughly half of the measures in their action plan to reduce tax evasion and fraud
have been implemented. Regarding property taxes, the authorities are considering options,
including differentiated rates under the current system, but indicated that a new system cannot
be in place earlier than 2016. They consider prospects good for a relatively rapid sale of shares
in Slovak Telekom and a yield of about 1 percent of GDP realistic, but downplayed further
privatization opportunities. The authorities saw limited vulnerability from non-resident holdings
of government debt, which are mainly long-term investors, but do not plan further increases in
the share.


FRA. Changes to the FRA are not envisioned in the near term, although potential challenges
under the framework were acknowledged. Taking advantage of favorable market conditions for
pre-funding is not possible, spending priorities could be difficult to pursue (e.g., salary increases
for teachers could be constrained by binding FRA limits on local governments), and changes in
EU statistical definitions could affect fiscal policy.



Pensions. A sustainability factor in the calculation of pension benefits may be considered, but the
authorities do not see raising the retirement age more quickly as desirable given relatively low
life expectancy.

MAINTAINING FINANCIAL STABILITY
The banking system remains sound with strong liquidity and capital levels, stable depositbased funding, and improving profitability. Much of the banking sector will come under
ECB direct supervision with the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). Regular stresstesting by the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) indicates resilience to shocks. While
corporate demand for loans has been weak, lending to households has continued to grow
quickly with higher LTVs becoming more common. Domestic capital markets remain
underdeveloped, reflecting high fees and other factors.
28.
The largely foreign-owned banking sector enters the ECB comprehensive assessment
in a strong position. A traditional retail-oriented business model with healthy capital and liquidity
buffers as well as stable domestic deposit-based funding has underpinned banks’ soundness. The
main banks are foreign subsidiaries, but their reliance on external funding is limited. NBS stress tests
indicate that the banking sector is broadly resilient to financial and real shocks. With the SSM, about
70 percent of the banking sector will come under ECB direct supervision although the NBS will
continue to play a crucial role. The recent transposition into national legislation of a number of EU
directives as part of implementation of the Basel III framework has further strengthened the
supervisory powers of the NBS. While the special levy on bank liabilities to fund potential resolution
costs does not seem to have affected lending activity significantly, it is relatively high and should be

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SLOVAK REPUBLIC

reduced and replaced once the system for contributions to the Single Resolution Fund (SRF) is
implemented. Moreover, the proceeds from the levy should be placed in a more well-defined
resolution fund.
29.
Household lending continued to expand rapidly. Strong household credit growth reflects
substantial home refinancing and some equity withdrawals. While borrowing can help support a
recovery in domestic demand, competition among banks has made high LTVs more common (e.g.,
through higher LTV mortgages or topping up regular mortgages with housing loans). Although real
estate prices remain subdued and household debt is not high, this practice could lead to overborrowing by consumers. Adoption of a regulation on LTV or debt-to-income ratios could help
prevent an excessive build-up of risks for borrowers and banks.

Credit to the corporate sector remained sluggish. With interest rates on new corporate
loans among the lowest in the eurozone (and large foreign firms able to draw on parent company
financing), anemic corporate credit primarily reflects weak domestic demand, and may pick up as
consumption and investment recover. The healthy banking sector is well-positioned to lend in this
scenario. Many SMEs, however, do find access to finance a challenge. Insufficient collateral or
guarantees is the most important factor, in addition to information requirements and administrative
burdens.8 Greater use of financial instruments supported by EU Funds including the JEREMIE
initiative to improve access to finance for small firms would help, as would business climate
improvements such as strengthening the legal system, for example to reduce the length of court
insolvency proceedings.

Domestic capital market activity languishes. Few companies are listed on the stock
exchange and trading is limited in both equities and bonds (e.g., there is little to no secondary
market trading in government bonds). Factors include limited issuance, still-embryonic institutional
investors, high transaction costs, taxation and fees, administrative burdens, and poor market
infrastructure. Households’ rather conservative investment decisions, possibly a legacy of the
unfortunate experience with voucher privatization, and investment restrictions for second pillar
pension funds weigh on the demand side. A more efficient capital market could create an alternative
to banks to channel savings to firms, although the relatively small market overall and the large share
of SMEs may hinder prospects somewhat. Cooperation with more established stock exchanges in
the region could also provide opportunities. It will be important to ensure effective supervision of
non-banks as part of capital market development efforts.
Authorities’ views
32.
The authorities emphasized their prudent approach to the financial sector. To preserve
strong bank capitalization, the NBS will require full implementation of the capital conservation
buffer (1.5 percent of risk-weighted assets from August 2014 and 2.5 percent from October 2014).
Furthermore, the NBS intends to introduce a recommendation related to housing loans. Recent ECB
decisions are not expected to have a significant impact on lending since banks already have
adequate liquidity. The government is taking advantage of the JEREMIE initiative and has adopted a
broad strategy for capital market development. The strategy seeks to reduce taxation of investment
income, create a new and more efficient central depository, promote start-ups and long-term
investment by pension funds, modernize the collective investment legal framework, and enhance
financial education.

STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
After slowing, growth is gathering pace and becoming more balanced. Slovakia has
been one of Europe’s more dynamic economies in recent years due to strong exports, but a
weakening external environment contributed to a slowdown in 2013. A pick-up in domestic demand
and more favorable conditions among trading partners are expected to lift growth. Stronger
domestic consumption and investment should support moderate inflation in 2014 after falling prices
early in the year.
34.
Slovakia’s economy faces upside and downside risks. Stronger domestic demand could
enhance confidence and investment, while the outlook in key trading partners could improve
further, including in light of supportive ECB policies. On the other hand, there are still risks to the
recovery in Europe and from the possibility of protracted slow global growth. If geopolitical tensions
involving Russia and Ukraine intensify, Slovakia could be affected by energy supply shocks as well as
through trade channels. Domestically, prolonged high unemployment could hinder recovery of
domestic demand and lower long-term growth potential.
35.
Wide-ranging policy actions are needed to tackle very high unemployment and
regional disparities. Despite sustained growth, unemployment remains elevated, especially for
youth and the long-term jobless and regional disparities are great in terms of income, employment,
and infrastructure. Policy and budget priorities should focus on coordinated actions to encourage
investment and job creation, reduce financial disincentives to working and hiring, enhance skills, and
help people enter or return to the labor market.
36.
Significant fiscal adjustment progress has been achieved. Slovakia’s strong fiscal
commitment is evident from the sizeable adjustment undertaken since 2009 to exit the EDP. Its debt
remains manageable and market conditions have allowed an extension of maturities at lower
interest rates.
37.
Durable fiscal measures are still needed given the budget framework and past reliance
on temporary measures. With economic output still below potential, subdued inflation, high
unemployment, and infrastructure and other needs, gradual adjustment would be advisable.
However, with a debt brake under the FRA crossed, spending cuts triggered and freezes expected,
and the next debt brake calling for a rapid move to a balanced budget with potentially harmful
effects on growth, early fiscal adjustment is needed. EU commitments will also require consolidation.
Based on experience under the FRA and in light of the evolving EU fiscal framework, the government
might consider over time whether there is scope for a more streamlined set of fiscal rules that are
less pro-cyclical, less biased toward expenditure cuts, and reflect debt vulnerabilities better, for
example by taking into account cash reserves.
38.
Expenditure-based adjustment will be difficult. Medium-term plans to substantially
reduce outlays—consistent with the FRA’s emphasis on spending cuts—appear challenging given an
already low share of revenue and spending compared to peers, and difficulties in controlling the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

SLOVAK REPUBLIC

public wage bill. Lower spending also could make it hard to reverse recent cuts in investment
spending and fund priority items to address unemployment and regional disparities.
39.
Strengthening revenue collection should be a priority. Additional revenue would help
sustain medium-term adjustment given likely pressure for higher spending in the future and the
need for infrastructure and human capital investment. Continued progress to strengthen VAT
collection is critical, and recent action to maintain the current VAT rate is especially welcome. A
property value-based real estate tax could yield substantial revenue. In addition to better revenue
collection, privatization of state assets would help reduce debt in a growth-friendly way.
40.
Continued prudence will maintain the strength of the banking system. Sound capital
levels and liquidity buffers, rising profits, and deposit-based funding contribute to the strength of
the banking system, make it resilient to shocks, and should facilitate corporate lending as demand
picks up, complementing strong household lending growth. The ECB’s comprehensive banking
assessment in preparation for the SSM as well as implementation of the Basel III framework to
strengthen the already robust supervisory and regulatory framework should further enhance
confidence. While risks from higher LTV ratios are moderate at this stage, a recommendation on
maximum LTV levels for mortgages and housing loans or debt-to-income levels would be
appropriate. The bank levy should be decreased and replaced once the system for contributions to
the SRF is implemented, and revenues from the levy should be placed in a more well-defined
resolution fund.
41.
Actions could help support non-bank finance and credit to small firms. Reducing high
taxes on investment income and lowering transaction fees by establishing a more efficient central
depository would address some of the factors that have contributed to very limited capital market
activity. Prospects for small businesses could be enhanced by efforts to facilitate access to finance in
addition to steps to strengthen the business environment.
42.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with the Slovak Republic take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the
view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is
meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between
30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the
authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Additional information on the effects of shocks can be found in the second chapter of the Selected Issues (Evolution of Drivers of the
Business Cycle in Slovakia).

Parliament approved maintaining VAT rate.
Reducing tax evasion and VAT efficiency
are top priorities and has benefited from
FAD analysis. An ambitious action plan to
combat tax fraud is being implemented.
Property tax changes are being considered,
but implementation is unlikely before 2016.
Raising the retirement age is not desirable
due to low life expectancy and small
expected savings.

Boosting Growth and Reducing Unemployment





Address high unemployment by lowering
labor taxes, strengthening active labor
market policies (ALMPs), improving
education, and training, and enhancing
mobility
Use EU Funds effectively.
Improve investment climate by
strengthening infrastructure and
governance, lowering administrative
burdens for businesses and ensuring a
predictable legal climate, including with
respect to labor regulations.








The government is committed to reducing
unemployment, has taken steps to
streamline and improve ALMPs and focus
on disadvantaged job seekers, including
through a labor cost subsidy.
Education and training initiatives, including
to create a dual system, are underway.
Efforts to improve government efficiency
and to facilitate financing for SMEs are
underway.
Labor Code changes are unlikely to affect
unemployment.

Preserving Financial Stability




40

Lower the bank levy in line with other
European countries and allocate proceeds
to a well-defined special resolution fund.
Enhance the supervisory framework
through a more well-specified intervention
and resolution framework, in line with
European directives and banking union
developments.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND





The proceeds of the bank levy are available
for resolution if needed and the levy rate
will gradually decline with the
accumulation of resources.
All the recent EU directives (CRD IV/CRR,
etc.) have been transposed into national
legislation. Risks are low and wellunderstood by the NBS.

1/ Public sector is defined as general government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over German bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

SLOVAK REPUBLIC

STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of data provided to the Fund are adequate for
surveillance purposes. From the point of view of macroeconomic analysis and policy making,
significant data improvements have been made, particularly in the national accounts. A data ROSC
mission during February–March 2004 found that the integrity, methodological soundness, and
reliability of the data were satisfactory, despite some shortcomings in the data revision policy. The
main issues remaining are: (i) a significant statistical discrepancy between the supply and demand
sides for GDP; and (ii) weaknesses in the data on prices and volumes of imports and exports. The
Slovak Republic has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since 1996 and
observes or exceeds all related standards.
2.
With regard to timeliness and public access, the authorities in general follow a free and
open data publication policy. Data are promptly released to news services, and are also published
regularly in various monthly and quarterly statistical publications, and on the Internet according to a
pre-announced schedule. Data on core surveillance variables are provided regularly to the Fund, and
with minimal lags: a week or less for foreign exchange reserves; a day for monthly state budget
implementation data; 10 days to a month for consumer prices, reserve money, broad money, and
interest rates; two months for foreign trade data; and about three months for other fiscal, balance of
payments, and national accounts data.

Real Sector and Prices
3.
Despite significant progress made so far, the compilation of the national accounts
statistics still suffers some weaknesses. The quarterly and annual national accounts data exhibit
some statistical discrepancies between the supply side and the demand side. An important
outstanding issue is the compilation of reliable price deflators for imports and exports that would
enable better decomposition into volume and price changes. The statistical authorities are aware of
these issues and improvements are ongoing, as part of the transition to the new European System of
National and Regional Accounts (ESA2010).

Fiscal Sector
4.
The compilation of general government statistics is in transition to the new ESA2010
methodology. The Ministry of Finance has compiled its fiscal accounts according to ESA95 standards
and reports general government net lending/borrowing and gross debt on a quarterly basis. Monthly
reconciliation of government operations above and below-the-line is restricted to state budget
transactions on a cash basis. A modern treasury system has been operating since January 2004. The
system has improved fiscal control and public debt management by allowing the recording of
expenditures at the planning and commitment stages. The ESA 2010 methodology will be
implemented from September 2014.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SLOVAK REPUBLIC

External Sector
5.
External sector statistics are generally of good quality, and are reported on a timely
basis to the Fund. However, errors and omissions in the balance of payments statistics are large and
reported financial account flows are subject to large volatility. The statistical authorities are aware of
these issues and are working to address them. The statistical authorities will start to submit data to the
Fund following the standard of the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and International
Investment Position Manual (BPM6) in September 2014.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
August 27, 2014

This statement summarizes the main developments in the Slovak Republic since the staff
report was issued on July 31, 2014. The information does not alter the thrust of the staff
appraisal.


Growth: Preliminary data for the second quarter of 2014 showed seasonally adjusted
output growing by 0.6 percent quarter-on-quarter and 2.6 percent year-on-year,
consistent with forecast growth of 2.4 percent for the year.



Inflation: In July, headline HICP inflation was -0.2 percent year-on-year, primarily
reflecting declining fuel prices, while core HICP inflation was 0.5 percent. Recent
data suggest somewhat greater downside risks to the forecast of 0.4 percent headline
inflation for 2014, although annual deflation is not expected.



Fiscal policy: Data for the first quarter of 2014 are broadly in line with expectations
for the year and confirm the improvement in VAT collection seen in 2013. While
government debt reached 58 percent of GDP in the first quarter, this mainly reflects
pre-funding, and debt is still forecast to be just above 55 percent of GDP at end-2014.
The first draft of the budget for 2015 and the medium term is largely in line with staff
projections.



Minimum wage: The Finance Ministry has proposed that the minimum wage be
increased from €352 to €380 per month, effective in January 2015. It also has
proposed that employer health contributions for low-wage workers be reduced to help
offset the impact of the minimum wage increase on labor costs.

Press Release No. 14/401
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 2, 2014

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with the Slovak Republic
On August 27, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with the Slovak Republic.
The Slovak economy slowed in 2013, but is gathering momentum as the euro area and domestic
demand recover, complementing the strong export sector that has underpinned the economy in
recent years. While output has climbed each year since the 2009 downturn, unemployment
remains very high—around 14 percent—with about two-thirds of this long-term, and higher
joblessness among youth (around 33 percent). Substantial fiscal adjustment brought the deficit to
2.8 percent of GDP in 2013, enabling exit from the EU’s Excessive Deficit Procedure. Public
debt is manageable and has been easily financed on favorable terms. Private debt is also
moderate, and the banking sector remains sound with strong capital and liquidity levels.
The outlook is favorable with growth of 2.4 percent forecast this year and 2.7 percent for 2015,
although there are downside risks related to the strength of the recovery in Europe and
geopolitical tensions. Inflation turned negative in early 2014, reflecting weak domestic demand
as well as falling food and energy prices, but is expected to return to moderately positive
territory later in the year. The trade and current account balances are forecast to remain in
surplus.
Policy discussions focused on: (i) actions to support growth, reduce high unemployment, and
address regional disparities; (ii) the need for high-quality and durable fiscal measures, especially
on the revenue side, to sustain fiscal adjustment progress, limit the impact of debt brakes, and
make room for budget priorities; (iii) and steps to strengthen further the prudent approach to
financial sector regulation and encourage capital market development.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the improved growth outlook, which reflects a pick-up in
domestic demand, following the strong export performance in recent years. Directors noted,
however, that a slow recovery in Europe and geopolitical tensions constitute important risks to
the outlook. Moreover, Directors agreed that high unemployment and large regional disparities
remain key challenges.
Directors encouraged the implementation of wide-ranging policies to promote investment and
job creation, particularly in lagging regions. They agreed that these policies should focus on
strengthening infrastructure, including through better use of EU funds; and creating a more
favorable business environment by improving contract enforcement, public procurement, and the
legal system, and addressing corruption. Actions are also needed to enhance the functioning of
labor markets by reducing the tax wedge, reforming the benefit structure to make work more
attractive, strengthening education and training, and bolstering public employment services.
Directors recognized the significant fiscal adjustment carried out by the authorities since 2009,
which allowed the Slovak Republic to exit the EU’s Excessive Deficit Procedure. Nonetheless,
they emphasized the need for additional durable fiscal measures to sustain the progress achieved
and put debt firmly on a declining path while protecting growth. In view of the need for
stepped-up investment in infrastructure and human capital, and against the backdrop of
below-EU-average revenue and expenditure levels as shares of GDP, Directors agreed that
strengthening revenue collection, including by reducing evasion and fraud, is crucial. In this
regard, they welcomed recent progress in strengthening VAT efficiency and the decision to
maintain the VAT rate, and encouraged the authorities to consider a property tax based on
market values, which would be more equitable and less distortive than other taxes. Furthermore,
they concurred that privatization of state assets would help reduce debt in a growth-friendly way.
Directors noted that the combination of domestic and EU fiscal rules have created a complicated
fiscal framework. While emphasizing the need to preserve credibility, Directors encouraged the
authorities to consider streamlining the framework over time, after experience has been gathered,
to make it less pro-cyclical and less focused on expenditure cuts.
Directors commended the authorities’ continued prudent supervision of the financial system.
While noting the staff assessment that risks related to the housing market remain moderate,
Directors considered that increasing loan-to-value ratios for mortgages and the sustained growth
of other housing loans warrant attention. They welcomed efforts to encourage domestic capital
market development, which could help support non-bank finance and credit to small and medium
enterprises.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
