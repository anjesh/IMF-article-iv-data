IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Djibouti
On January 30, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Djibouti.
Djibouti’s fundamental development challenges remain to reduce widespread poverty and
unemployment, and diversify its economy to reduce dependence on the ports. Forty two percent
of the population lives in extreme poverty and 48 percent of the labor force is unemployed.
Recent Developments and Macroeconomic Outlook
Djibouti is undergoing an investment boom which would accelerate economic growth.
Aggregate investment is projected to rise from 26 percent of GDP in 2010-13 to 52 percent in
2014-16. GDP growth is expected to rise from 6 percent in 2014 to about 7 percent in 2015-19.
Inflation is projected to pick up from 3 percent in 2014 to 3.3 percent in 2015-19 as the large
investment spending fuels demand for housing and basic services.
High debt-financed public investment spending is exerting considerable fiscal and external debt
pressures. The fiscal deficit, on a commitment basis, should rise from 5.9 percent in 2013 to
12 percent in 2014, and peak at 13.8 percent in 2015. External public and publicly guaranteed
debt is projected to peak at about 81 percent of GDP in 2017-18. Exports, comprising mainly
port services, are expected to increase. However, the current account deficit is estimated to
widen from 23.3 percent of GDP in 2013 to about 28 percent in 2014-15, due to large capital
goods imports financed by loans or Foreign Direct Investments (FDI).
Central bank gross foreign assets are projected to remain strong, permitting full currency board
coverage over the period 2015-19. The authorities have indicated that external and domestic
arrears are being cleared. The central bank made further progress in strengthening its banking
supervision capacity, adopting new instructions on liquidity and the licensing of credit
institutions. However, nonperforming loans increased from 11.4 percent of total loans in 2012 to
16.2 percent at end-June 2014—which the authorities attribute to the introduction of stricter loan
classification requirements.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted that Djibouti is enjoying strong economic growth supported by an
ambitious infrastructure program aimed at reducing widespread poverty and unemployment.
However, the debt-financed investments have increased fiscal and external debt vulnerabilities.
Directors urged the authorities to take steps to ensure a sustainable fiscal and external debt path.
They stressed the need to urgently address major structural bottlenecks to promote sustainable
strong and inclusive growth and diversify the economy. Steadfast commitment to reforms will
be important.
Directors underlined the need for fiscal consolidation. Expanding the tax base and improving tax
administration will be crucial in this effort. More broadly, Directors urged the authorities to
reexamine the fiscal framework, including rationalizing investment incentives and making them
more transparent and efficient. It is also important to contain the wage bill and reform fuel
subsidies in conjunction with plans to design targeted social safety nets to protect the poor and
vulnerable.
Directors stressed the importance of strengthening the capacity of the central government and
public enterprises to select, coordinate, and manage public investment projects. Equally
important is enhancing debt management capacity, including the monitoring of contingent
liabilities. Directors encouraged the authorities to formulate a debt strategy, with Fund technical
assistance, to manage and reduce the external debt burden and improve coordination among
government units responsible for contracting, monitoring, and servicing debt. Directors urged
the authorities to seek concessional financing to the extent possible and take steps to clear
arrears and remain current on Djibouti’s debt obligations.
Directors agreed that the fixed exchange rate regime under the currency board arrangement has
served Djibouti well. They emphasized that safeguarding its stability, including through
adequate levels of reserves, is a top priority. Directors highlighted the importance of
strengthening bank supervision to preserve financial stability. Close attention should be given to
enhancing credit risk analysis and reinforcing instruments to counter money laundering and
terrorist financing. Efforts to deepen the financial sector and promote financial inclusion will be
important.
Directors urged the authorities to implement structural reforms to boost competitiveness, achieve
inclusive and diversified growth, and reduce poverty. Reforms should aim to improve the
business climate, particularly by streamlining business regulation, improving electricity and
water supply, and providing appropriate skills training to labor.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context: The government of Djibouti has launched an ambitious debt-financed
investment program that would spur economic growth but also exacerbate fiscal and
external debt vulnerabilities when there is already a high risk of debt distress. The
authorities consider that this program is the only path towards reducing widespread
poverty and unemployment; Djibouti remains critically dependent on port services and
lacks natural resources and a viable agricultural sector. They concur with staff that strong
growth and fiscal reform are essential to generate the substantial revenues required to
service the public debt and realize the benefits of their investment plans.
Policy priorities
Fiscal consolidation is imperative if the economy is to return to a sustainable fiscal
path. A review of the investment incentive system is essential to expanding the tax base
and increasing the transparency and efficiency of the tax system. Concomitantly,
ongoing efforts to contain the wage bill and reform the fuel subsidy system should be
pursued.
Strengthening public investment and debt management: Djibouti needs to improve
its institutional capacity to appraise, select, and implement viable investment projects at
a pace consistent with its absorptive capacity and resource availability. Public enterprises
that will manage the investment projects should be reformed to enable them to manage
the projects efficiently. A strategy should be developed to manage and reduce the
external debt burden, and debt sustainability considerations should be integrated into
the budget process. Non-concessionary public and publicly guaranteed debt—which
would lead to additional debt service costs over the medium term—should be avoided.
Promoting economic diversification and structural transformation: For the public
investment program to generate growth and jobs in a sustainable manner, the business
environment needs to be substantially improved, in particular by: (i) reducing the cost of
utilities, especially the high electricity tariffs; (ii) providing training in the skills needed in
the labor market; and (iii) reducing corruption, strengthening contract enforcement, and
enhancing access to credit for SMEs.

CONTEXT
1.
Djibouti is undergoing a debt-financed investment boom. Major investments currently in
progress include an extension of facilities at the state-owned ports as well as the building of new
ports, financed in part by private investors; and the construction of a railway linking Djibouti and
neighboring landlocked Ethiopia, and a pipeline to transport potable water from Ethiopia (Annex II).
The government is financing both the railway and water pipeline projects mainly through nonconcessionary foreign debt, aggravating medium-term fiscal and external debt vulnerabilities.

Unemployment Ages 15-24

2.
Poverty and unemployment remain widespread despite economic growth of about
5 percent in 2006–13. The latest poverty profile shows that 41.9 percent of the population lived in
extreme poverty in 2012, compared

primary source of livelihood in most
low-income countries, is miniscule because the climate is unfavorable. The business environment is
challenging, mainly because of high production costs, weak contract enforcement, red tape, and low
access to finance.
3.
Security concerns have risen following the May 2014 terrorist attack. Two suicide
bombers attacked a restaurant popular with Westerners in Djibouti-ville, the capital city. One
expatriate and the two terrorists were killed. The Al-Shabaab terrorist group, which claimed
responsibility for the attack, repeated its threat to conduct similar attacks in retaliation for Djibouti’s
decision to contribute troops to the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), which is fighting
the group.
4.
The government and opposition have signed an agreement to end the deadlock over
the disputed February 2013 legislative elections. The opposition won seats in parliament for the
first time in the elections, ending a 10-year election boycott. The opposition won 10 seats and the
ruling party won the remaining 55 seats. Eight of the 10 elected opposition members of parliament
refused to take up their seats, alleging electoral fraud. After violent protests, the government and
the opposition opened a political dialogue to end the deadlock. Under the agreement signed in

December 2014, the opposition will end its parliamentary boycott; and reforms would be introduced
to establish a free and independent electoral commission to ensure that the 2016 presidential
elections are free and fair.
5.
The authorities have reiterated their interest in a new program, but program
discussions were suspended owing to concerns about a deterioration of debt vulnerability. An
October 2013 program discussion mission was suspended when the authorities informed staff that
two loans had been contracted on nonconcessional terms to finance the railway and water pipeline
projects with Ethiopia (Annex II). Preliminary analysis showed that the loans would significantly
degrade Djibouti’s external debt situation, which was already at high risk of distress.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
6.
The surge of public and private investment is expected to accelerate economic growth.
Aggregate investment is projected to rise from 26 percent of GDP in 2010–13 to 52 percent in 2014–
16, and public investment from 11 percent to 25 percent of GDP over the same period. Staff projects
that GDP growth will rise from 5 percent in 2013, to 6 percent in 2014, and to 6.5 percent in 2015,
and will stabilize at about 7 percent in 2016–19. By 2016, when aggregate investment is projected to
begin to fall, some of the major investment projects should be operational and supporting growth.
Inflation was 2.4 percent in 2013. It is projected at about 3 percent in 2014, and expected to pick up
to about 3–3.5 percent in 2015–19 as the large capital spending fuels demand for housing,
transport, and other services.
7.
High public investment spending is exerting considerable fiscal and external debt
pressures. The loans for the railway and the water pipeline projects will be serviced from the central
government budget until they can be transferred to the relevant public companies when the
projects are operational and generating enough revenues to service the loans. Domestic revenues
are expected to fall as a percentage of GDP in 2016–19 compared with 2013–15 for the following
reasons. First, the activities driving growth will be mostly tax-exempt, implying that growth will not
be accompanied by a concomitant increase in fiscal revenues. Second, rents for the military bases
(nontax external revenues) are fixed by bilateral agreement in nominal terms. As a result, over time,
they diminish as a percentage of GDP. Third, outstanding tax arrears, which account for the rise in
tax revenues in 2013 and 2014, would diminish after 2014 as most arrears are expected to have been
collected. Meanwhile, interest payments on outstanding government debt will increase to
1.6 percent of GDP in 2017–19, and by 2019, these will be accompanied by large debt amortization
payments. The fiscal deficit, on a commitment basis, should rise from 5.9 percent in 2013 to
12 percent in 2014, and peak at 13.8 percent in 2015, financed mainly by external borrowing. As a
result, in 2017–18, external public and publicly guaranteed debt is projected to peak at about
81.5 percent of GDP.
8.
The increase in the rent for the U.S. military base and a grant from the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) will boost revenues. The rent for the base has increased from
US$38 million a year to US$63 million with effect from May 2014. The GCC grant is for US$50 million

a year over four years. It will be used to cover debt service vis-à-vis Arab donors and to finance
social and investment spending.2
9.
Of the US$185 million received from the partial privatization of the ports in 2013,
about US$79 million was allocated to the 2013 budget, US$73 million to 2014, and the
balance of US$33 million to 2015. The allocations covered investment projects, including
government contribution to the Djibouti-Ethiopia railway project and the water pipeline project, and
current spending items such as support for the newly launched health insurance scheme.
10.
The current account deficit is projected to widen from 23.3 percent of GDP in 2013 to
about 28 percent of GDP in 2014–15, because of large capital goods imports financed by the
project loans or FDI. These high imports will exceed an expected increase in export revenue, mainly
from port services. The real effective exchange rate is assessed to be moderately overvalued
(Annex III).

Declining international oil prices are expected to bode well for the Djibouti economy
but would eventually reduce fiscal revenues.3 All fuel products consumed in Djibouti are
imported. Thus, the fall in oil prices would

current domestic administered price for
diesel, the main fuel product, is eliminated.
Thus, no fiscal revenue is forgone below this international price. However, as the base for fuel taxes
in Djibouti is the international price of oil, declining international oil prices below the US$87
threshold would reduce fiscal revenues. The decline in international oil prices is not expected to
have an immediate impact on inflation in Djibouti because prices of fuel products are administered.
A lowering of these administered prices would result in a fall in the general price level, due to the
large weight of fuel products in the CPI.

2

Only US$22 million of the US$50 million intended for 2014 has been allocated to the 2014 budget because the full
amount is not expected to arrive in time. The remaining US$28 million will be added evenly to the US$50 million
intended for 2015–17.
3

The final impact of a decline in international oil prices on fiscal revenues will depend on whether or not, and the
extent to which, domestic administered prices are lowered. Staff estimates that any possible decline in fiscal revenues
would be limited.

Currency board coverage is being met. Currency board coverage is projected at
110 percent at end-2014, falling to 105 percent in 2015–19, compared with 107 percent in 2013.
Central bank gross foreign assets should fall from US$411 million in 2013 to US$388 in 2014, as
privatization revenues—kept at the central bank—are drawn down. Gross foreign assets are
projected to increase by about 30 percent between 2015 and 2017, boosted by US$200 million in
grants from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC); and fall in 2018 and 2019, as government deposits
at the central bank are drawn down. It is expected that currency board cover will not fall below the
105 percent floor set under the previous ECF. Under the currency board arrangement, the central
bank is legally required to provide full cover for base money. Besides performing this basic function,
the central bank normally does not intervene in the foreign exchange market. As a result, gross
foreign reserves are largely delinked from the domestic foreign exchange market. External arrears
have been accumulated. As of end-November 2014, the stock of external arrears (excluding
technical arrears) stood at about US$4.7 million or about 0.3percent of GDP. The authorities have
indicated that external and domestic arrears are being cleared.
13.
The financial sector remains stable but vulnerabilities persist. The central bank (BCD)
made further progress in strengthening its overstretched banking supervision capacity, adopting
new instructions on liquidity and the licensing of credit institutions. The banking sector is dominated
by the two leading banks although their market share—currently 67 percent of assets—has been
declining because of competition from the new banks. Eight of the 10 banks in operation, including
the two leading banks, have now met the increased minimum capital requirement of one billion FD
(US$5.6 million), following the expiration of the end-January 2014 deadline. Neither of the two
banks that have failed to meet the minimum capital requirement is likely to pose systemic risks,
given their low market share. Another bank, which had been in distress, is under receivership. This is
also unlikely to pose systemic risk, because the bank’s market share is small. Nevertheless,
nonperforming loans increased from 11.4 percent of total loans in 2012, to 16.2 percent at endJune 2014—which the authorities attribute to the introduction of stricter loan classification
requirements. The nonperforming loan provisioning rate fell from 82 percent in 2012 to 60 percent
in June 2014, and all the banks exceeded the single borrower limit as at end-June 2014.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS: PROMOTING INCLUSIVE
GROWTH ALONG WITH FISCAL AND EXTERNAL
SUSTAINABILITY DURING AN INVESTMENT BOOM
A. Job Creation and Poverty Reduction
14.

A number of factors account for widespread poverty and unemployment in Djibouti.



Investment has been narrowly concentrated. Although the current development model—
which exploits Djibouti’s strategic location along one of the world’s busiest shipping routes—has
transformed Djibouti into a vibrant service economy centered on port activities, it has fostered
reliance on a single sector catering mainly to Ethiopia, leaving the economy vulnerable to
external shocks. In addition, services—the main driver of growth in recent years—and
construction activities account for only about 13 percent of formal employment. Much of the
current investment boom is also narrowly concentrated on port and transportation services,
reinforcing the need for reform to broaden the base and spread the benefits of growth (See
Annex 1: Risk Assessment Matrix).



The business environment has been challenging. Djibouti ranked 155th out of 189 countries
on the World Bank’s Doing Business 2015 Index. The country ranked 171 or lower in getting
electricity, getting credit, and enforcing contracts. These are major obstacles, especially for
labor-intensive small businesses. On the control of corruption index of the Worldwide
Governance Indicators, Djibouti’s percentile rank (out of 200 countries and territories) improved
steadily to 51.5 in 2008 and then deteriorated to 41.6 in 2013.



Djibouti’s demographics pose additional challenges. First, the low labor force participation
rate, because of the low female participation rate, increases the dependence on the working
population. Second, the population is relatively young—almost 75 percent is less than 35 years
old—meaning a large proportion of the labor force are job market entrants who lack the
experience (and skills) needed for employment. Youth unemployment standing at about
60 percent is much higher than the overall unemployment rate of 48 percent. Third, large-scale
migration, exacerbated by refugees fleeing conflict in neighboring Somalia, is exerting additional
pressure on basic social services and on the already tight job market.



The domestic skills base is weak. More than a third of the labor force has no education; those
with some education have been trained mainly for white-collar jobs, resulting in a significant
skills mismatch.



Financial inclusion remains low. Despite a relatively high bank deposit-to-GDP ratio of
80 percent, and private credit-to-GDP ratio of 30 percent, the bulk of the population and most
small and medium size enterprises lack access to banking services. These are still concentrated
on a few enterprises and individuals. Only about 14 percent of the adult population has a bank
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

DJIBOUTI

account. Interest rate spreads are high, with the average deposit and lending rates at about
2 and 12 percent respectively. The high lending rate reflects banks risk aversion. Absent reliable
credit and financial status information to support loan applications, banks impose a high lending
rate or demand large collateral. Micro-finance remains underdeveloped. The Djibouti Savings
and Credit Fund, the main micro-finance institution, has, since 2012, been under conservatorship
by the central bank due to management problems.

15.
The authorities have articulated their overarching framework for addressing the
country’s development challenges in Vision Djibouti 2035. Vision Djibouti 2035 envisions
Djibouti as Africa’s commercial and logistics hub. It aims to triple per capita income, and reduce the
unemployment rate from 48 percent to 10 percent, by 2035. The vision consists of five pillars:
(i) peace and national unity, (ii) good governance, (iii) economic diversification, (iv) human capital
development, and (v) regional integration. A rolling five-year Accelerated Growth Strategy for
Promoting Employment (SCAPE) and a National Employment Policy 2014-19 have been developed
to realize the vision. The employment policy emphasizes youth and female employment, and the
development of small and medium enterprises.
16.
The authorities are pursuing several initiatives to improve electricity and water supply.
High electricity costs and limited water supply are regarded as major constraints to investing in
Djibouti.

Electricity:


Geothermal project, sponsored by a consortium of seven donors. The recruitment process for
the consultant to oversee the project is underway. The project is expected to be completed in
2018.



A second power interconnection with the Ethiopian electricity grid (which now supplies about
65 percent of Djibouti’s electricity consumption).



A second thermal plant in Djibouti-ville, the capital city.



Wind-generated electricity project: A joint venture is being considered. The first phase is
expected to be completed in 2017.



A solar project.

To avoid possible duplication and inefficient use of scarce resources in these initiatives, the EU is
undertaking a study to develop a strategic vision for the energy sector.
Water supply: Two major initiatives are being launched. The first is the water pipeline that will be
constructed between Djibouti and Ethiopia, permitting the importation of 100,000 cubic meters of
water a day free of charge from Ethiopia (Annex 2 contains more details). The second initiative is a
€45 million water desalination plant which will be built with a €40.5 million grant from the EU. The
remaining €4.5 million will be provided by the Djibouti government or other donors. The project is
expected to generate 45,000 cubic meters of water a day and to be completed in 2018.
17.
A number of poverty alleviation and social welfare initiatives have been launched. First,
compulsory health insurance will be introduced for all government employees starting in 2015. The
cost is being covered from the government budget and with additional funding from the African
Development Bank. Health insurance will be extended subsequently to other beneficiaries. Second,
the government has announced the construction of 5,000 social housing units. Third, connection

13

DJIBOUTI

fees and consumption tariffs for water supplied by the state-owned water company have been
lowered for poor neighborhoods. Fourth, a stone cutting project that employs 2,800 unskilled
workers has been launched. Last, the authorities are developing a social register (database) to
identify the poor and facilitate coordination of poverty alleviation initiatives.

Reform priorities
18.
Rationalizing development initiatives and improving donor coordination. To ensure
efficient resource allocation, development initiatives should be pursued within a well-defined global
or sectoral strategy, especially in sectors with multiple initiatives such as electricity. Staff welcomes
the authorities’ plans to improve coordination of donors and government institutions.
19.
Improving the business environment and competitiveness. Reducing red tape, stepping
up anti-corruption efforts, and improving contract enforcement through administrative and judicial
reforms should help create a more business friendly environment. Moreover, improving the supply
of basic utilities and reducing the cost of electricity would boost competitiveness.
20.
Reform of educational curricula and training programs. The emphasis should be on
ensuring that the labor force is trained for the needs of the job market, and that Djibouti nationals—
rather than expatriates—take the jobs created during the investment boom.
21.
Economic diversification. Diversification is essential to exploit opportunities in sectors with
high growth and employment potential such as tourism and fishing, and reduce the risks associated
with relying on a single sector (services) catering mainly to one client (Ethiopia). To this end,
improving the business climate is indispensable.
22.
Promoting financial inclusion and stability. Given the importance of financial stability for
financial inclusion, staff stressed the need to strengthen banking supervision, reduce credit
concentration, and monitor non-performing loans. Staff urged the authorities to increase the
number of onsite bank inspections, focusing on internal risks and controls. Furthermore, staff
reiterated the importance of strengthening the AML/CFT framework, particularly elements related to
the financing of terrorism, the supervision of cross-border activities, and the detection of crossborder transportation of currency. Staff strongly encouraged the authorities to adopt the following
measures to facilitate access to credit for individuals, and small and medium enterprises (SMEs):


Accelerate the implementation of the national strategy for modernization of payments and
credit reporting systems (project document has been completed with World Bank assistance).



Set up a framework for mobile payments to make financial services accessible to low-income
groups.



Operationalize the SME Partial Credit Guarantee Fund (project study has been completed with
World Bank assistance).

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DJIBOUTI



Diversify sources of SME financing by establishing an appropriate regulatory framework for
specialized financial institutions such as leasing and Islamic financing institutions. (The
authorities have requested Fund technical assistance to improve the regulatory framework for
Islamic banking.)



Simplify the taxation system to encourage SMEs to migrate to the formal sector.



Simplify access to land and improve mortgage procedures.

23.

Authorities’ views:

The authorities generally concur with staff recommendations. They highlighted the various ongoing
economic reforms and initiatives—aimed at improving water and electricity supply, providing safety
nets for the poor, and providing improved training for the labor force—to reiterate their
commitment to economic diversification, job creation, and poverty reduction. They consider Vision
Djibouti 2035 and its Accelerated Growth Strategy for Employment Creation as a well-defined
overarching framework for development. They expect that the recently established committees will
improve coordination and management of development initiatives. The authorities agree with staff
that financial stability is critical for economic stability and growth in Djibouti, and that central bank
supervisory capacity required further strengthening. While accepting that higher commercial bank
provisioning requirements should be enforced, they perceive the deterioration of nonperforming
loans as largely due to changes in classification procedures.

B. Fiscal Sustainability
24.
The current fiscal stance appears unsustainable. The current fiscal stance is unlikely to
generate the substantial revenues needed to service the growing public debt and to help translate
the benefits of the investment boom into sustained and inclusive growth. The main elements of
current fiscal policy are (i) generous tax exemptions for investors; (ii) tax exemption or low tax rates
on fuel and basic food imports; and (iii) a hiring freeze in the public sector outside the education
and health sectors (resulting in decline in the wage bill as a percentage of GDP). As a result of tax
exemptions on investment, while the investment boom is expected to generate growth, the impact
on revenues over the medium term would be modest, with the share of tax revenues to GDP
declining and large budget deficits arising over the medium term. To ensure fiscal sustainability,
reforms are required in public management, tax policy—especially the investment incentive
framework—and debt management.
25.
Public management capacity is lagging behind investment spending. This is reflected in
difficulties in effectively coordinating development projects, and the lack of appropriate appraisal for
some projects. The institutional arrangement, including revenue sharing, for the joint railway project
with Ethiopia—which is expected to be operational in 2015—has still not been finalized. Staff
welcomes the authorities’ decision to set up a committee to assess the macroeconomic implications
of the mega investment projects and expects that the committee would provide much-needed
information on the projects’ expected economic impact. Regarding public financial management,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

DJIBOUTI

the authorities informed staff that a resident expert provided by the US government has been
working with staff of the Ministry of Budget to set up the medium-term budget framework which is
expected to be operational in 2015. Lastly, the authorities informed staff that they have launched a
public enterprise reform program covering ten enterprises including the water company (ONEAD)
that will manage the water pipeline project, and the monopoly electricity provider (EDD).
26.
Investment risks loom large while contingent liabilities are expanding. Delays in
implementing projects for which loans have been contracted would be costly to the budget. This
holds for the delayed water pipeline project—the government would be obliged to service the loan,
including the commitment fee of 0.5 percent on the undisbursed amount. Also, a rise in world
interest rates would increase servicing costs for debt subject to variable interest rates. Meanwhile,
the total amount of explicit public guarantees to the non-financial public sector is projected to
increase from US$265 million (15 percent of GDP) in 2013 to over 60 percent of GDP over the next
few years. This amount excludes debt contracted by public companies without explicit government
guarantees and liabilities of public financial companies, which also represent implicit contingent
liabilities to the government. With few exceptions, requests by public enterprises for government
guarantees are approved even though the central government is unable to evaluate, monitor or
manage the projects.
27.

Other risks linger.



Political and security risks: Renewed political unrest could raise spending pressures, and
undermine revenue collection efforts. Further terrorist attacks in Djibouti could delay or disrupt
economic activity, particularly investment.



Global recession. A recession in donor countries could result in reduced aid inflows. A global
recession, leading to a decline in world trade and shipping, could reduce the use of Djibouti’s
ports, and ultimately hurt government revenues. It could also undermine the ports’ ability to
service the debt contracted to fund their ambitious investment program.

Reform priorities
28.
Fiscal consolidation is imperative to: (i) reduce the large fiscal deficits, (ii) generate the
resources required to service the growing public debt and create liquidity buffers, (iii) rationalize
expenditure to create fiscal space to finance poverty alleviation initiatives, and (iv) reduce aid
dependence. Over the medium term, in light of the authorities’ commitments, there is little scope for
reducing investment expenditures, or for further tightening of current expenditures (dominated by
wages) beyond the current freeze on public sector employment outside the education and health
sectors. Consolidation would therefore have to focus on increasing revenues through fiscal reform,
and reform of public enterprises to increase their profitability.
29.
Strengthen public management capacity. The timely execution of the investment projects,
and, when operational, the capacity to generate revenues to meet their operating costs and service
the associated loans are critical for fiscal sustainability. At present, the required public management

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DJIBOUTI

capacity is limited. Considering these constraints, staff recommended that the authorities:
(i) undertake only economically viable investment projects, integrated in an overarching
development framework to ensure consistency with Djibouti’s development objectives; (ii) prioritize
the execution of the projects, taking into account absorptive capacity and resource constraints; and
(iii) reform the public enterprises that will administer the mega investment projects to improve their
efficiency and profitability. Staff stressed the importance of expediting the setting up of the
institutional framework for managing the joint railway project with Ethiopia—including the revenuesharing arrangement—before the railway becomes operational. In the area of public financial
management, staff urged the authorities to: (i) implement the action plan for the medium-term
budget framework to improve budget planning; and (ii) establish the treasury management system
to ensure timely payment of government financial obligations and avoid accumulation of arrears.
The authorities concurred with staff views and recommendations.
30.
Reform the investment incentive system. There is broad consensus that the investment
incentive system creates an uneven playing field for investors, has been abused—some firms
operating in the free zone are not engaged solely in export activities and others shift activity to the
free zone to avoid paying taxes—and entails large fiscal costs. Thus, with current policies the fiscal
benefits of the investment boom are likely to be modest, with the share of tax revenues in GDP
projected to decline over the medium term. The authorities assured staff of their commitment to
reform the investment incentive system towards greater transparency and efficiency, and that
reform proposals would be deliberated at the proposed tax conference (paragraph 31).
31.
Other reforms to generate revenues. The authorities and private sector stakeholders
pointed out that the tax base is narrow, comprising mainly firms not benefiting from fiscal
exemptions and formal sector employees. Recognizing the need for reform, the authorities plan to
organize in 2015 a tax conference (Assisses Fiscales) to deliberate reform proposals with various
stakeholders. The reform proposals are yet to be developed. Meanwhile, the authorities and the
private sector have set up a high-level Public-Private Partnership forum to discuss fiscal and other
issues of common interest. The authorities informed staff that a new strategy has been developed
for the monopoly telecommunications sector, with World Bank assistance. The strategy recommends
opening up the mobile telephone market to a second operator. Staff would welcome this decision,
as its implementation would generate fiscal revenues, and over time, help broaden the tax base.
Last, the authorities stated that the legislation is being drafted to unify administration of the VAT
and other taxes for large taxpayers, as recommended by an FAD technical assistance mission. The
authorities indicated that a large taxpayers’ directorate—rather than a unit—is now planned.
32.
Policies to protect the poor and vulnerable population from high cost of living. In the
wake of the global food price hikes of 2007-2008, the authorities removed import duties on five
basic foodstuffs to help protect the welfare of the poor. They also acquired land in Ethiopia to
cultivate crops and sell the products back in Djibouti at subsidized prices. Furthermore, to restrain
domestic prices, the authorities introduced a negative tax adjustment to the existing taxes on

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

DJIBOUTI

kerosene, gasoline and diesel. The negative tax adjustment lowers—but does not eliminate—net
taxes collected on the products.4 The authorities informed staff that the fall in world fuel prices has
obviated the need for this implicit subsidy on gasoline, and reduced the negative tax adjustment on
diesel and kerosene. Nevertheless, this could be reversed by a rise in world prices. In line with past
staff advice, the authorities reiterated their commitment to eliminate the negative tax adjustment
mechanism, and set up a safety net program to protect the poor from any ensuing price increases.
They stated that they have developed a timetable for the removal of fuel subsidies and are awaiting
the preparation of the social register to set up the safety net program, which would involve cash
transfers.
33.
Authorities’ views. The authorities acknowledge the scale of the fiscal challenges facing the
economy and concur with staff that reform is indispensable to help address them. Their reform plans
are based on the following pillars. First is reform of public enterprises and the budget framework.
They have launched a public enterprise reform program to improve the performance of key
enterprises including the enterprise that will manage the water pipeline project. They are also
working towards implementing the medium-term budget framework by 2015. The authorities
recognize their limited capacity in public management at present, and underscore the importance of
technical assistance to enhance it. Second is tax reform. The authorities share staff concerns about
the limitations of the tax regime, especially the investment incentive framework. They expect the
fiscal conference planned for 2015 to generate concrete reform recommendations that would pave
the way for a more efficient and transparent regime. Third is subsidy reform. The authorities remain
committed to reforming the fuel subsidy system and intend to put in place social safety nets to
protect the poor. Last is the need to restrain spending. Given their commitment to their investment
strategy, the authorities plan to maintain the hiring freeze in the public sector outside the education
and health sectors.

C. Deb Sustainability and External Stability
34.
Debt vulnerabilities have increased significantly over the past two years. In 2013–14,
the public sector contracted US$1 billion (70 percent of 2013 GDP) in external loans. This included
the two non-concessional loans signed by the central government to finance the railway and water
pipeline projects, which are to be disbursed over 2014-2019. As a result, total public and publicly
guaranteed debt is expected to exceed 80 percent of GDP in 2017 (see the DSA annex).
35.
The updated DSA indicates elevated solvency risks as well as potential near-term
liquidity tightness. There are significant and protracted breaches of the present values of the debtto-GDP and debt-to-exports thresholds. Liquidity ratios breach nearly all the thresholds. External
debt ratios are most sensitive to exchange rate depreciation (which is unlikely under the currency
board arrangement), and shocks to exports and tightening of the financing terms (some loans have
4

An FAD technical assistance mission estimated the forgone revenues due to the negative tax adjustment at about
2 percent of GDP for 2012.

floating interest rates). Djibouti remains at a high risk of external debt distress. Given the significant
share of debt with floating rates, the central government budget is sensitive to potential tightening
of global liquidity. At current US LIBOR rates of about 0.5 percent, the interest rate bill is projected
to reach 1.1-1.6 percent of GDP in 2015-2019. To date, no provision has been made for liquidity
buffers.
36.
Debt service capacity is not mainstreamed into the budget planning process, and is
undermined also by limited coordination among relevant agencies. The absence of liquidity
management leads to repeated arrears accumulation. Responsibility for financial planning,
monitoring, and negotiation is spread between the external debt directorate in the Ministry of
Budget, the external financing directorate in the Ministry of Economy and Finance, and other units in
the two ministries, with some overlap in functions and no clear lines of subordination.5 The absence
of a medium-term strategy and limited coordination among public finance institutions undermine
transparency and effective debt monitoring. Central bank involvement in debt management is
crucial, given the risks to external stability caused by excessive borrowing.

Reform priorities
37.
Develop a strategy to reduce and manage the external debt burden. Any public or
publicly guaranteed borrowing on non-concessional terms would lead to additional debt service
costs over the medium term and should be avoided. In addition, any new debt-financed investment
should be based on a rigorous assessment of near-term financing costs and potential medium-term
benefits. The assessment of debt service capacity and debt sustainability should be integrated into
investment management and budget planning. The budget should provide for sufficient liquidity
buffers to cover volatile debt service costs and avoid accumulating arrears. Last, alternative options
for promoting investment other than direct government debt-financed participation should be
considered, noting the risks involved in public-private partnerships in particular.
38.
Strengthen coordination among government units involved in debt management and
monitoring. Expedite the setting up of the Debt Committee consisting of the ministry of budget,
the ministry of economy and finance, and the central bank.
39.
Tighten monitoring of government contingent liabilities by: (i) developing rules for
issuing government guarantees; and (ii) introducing a monitoring system for debt incurred by public
companies without government guarantees.
40.
Authorities’ views. The authorities acknowledge the risks attached to their current
financing strategy. However, they believe this strategy would be viable if it could generate growth
and attract large FDI inflows. They stated that external and domestic arrears are being cleared and
that, to improve debt management, they are considering setting up a debt committee comprising
the ministry of budget, the ministry of economy and finance, and the central bank. The authorities
5

underlined the importance of government guarantees as they reduce public enterprises’ financing
costs.

STAFF APPRAISAL
41.
The authorities are fully committed to their investment strategy, despite the
concomitant increase in fiscal and external debt vulnerabilities. They view the strategy as vital
for the country’s development in the face of widespread poverty and unemployment and the
absence of natural resources and a viable agricultural sector.
42.
Fiscal as well as structural reforms are essential to generate the high economic growth
and substantial revenues needed to return the economy to a sustainable fiscal and external
debt path and realize the benefits of the investment boom. While the scaling up of investment is
expected to generate growth, its medium-term impact on revenues is likely to be modest due to
weaknesses in the fiscal regime and in public management. Accordingly, a wide range of reforms is
required to enhance the capacity of the central government and public enterprises to raise the
revenues needed to return the economy to a path of fiscal and external debt sustainability. At the
same time, deep structural reforms are needed to ensure that growth reduces poverty and
unemployment and generates widespread benefits.
43.
Improving public capacity to manage investment projects is key. Enhancing public
management capacity will help ensure that only viable investment projects are undertaken based on
absorptive capacity and resource availability. Public enterprises charged with managing investment
projects should be reformed to improve their capacity for the task. The institutional arrangement for
managing the joint railway project with Ethiopia should be finalized before the railway becomes
operational. Improved coordination of the various ongoing initiatives, especially in the electricity
sector, would help avoid duplication. Staff welcomes the setting up of a committee to assess the
macroeconomic implications of investment projects as a step to fill the gaps in analyzing the impact
of the investment projects. Implementing the medium-term budget framework would improve
budget planning.
44.
A debt management strategy is needed. The strategy should seek to manage and reduce
the external debt burden, avoid any public and publicly guaranteed debt that could lead to
additional debt service costs over the medium term, and integrate assessment of debt service
capacity and debt sustainability into the budget process. Coordination among government units
involved in contracting, monitoring, and servicing debt should also be improved. The authorities
should remain current on Djibouti’s existing obligations. Clearance of existing arrears should be
incorporated into the budget. The budget should provide for sufficient liquidity buffers to cover
volatile debt service costs and avoid accumulating arrears.
45.
The investment incentive system and overall fiscal framework should be revamped.
Staff recommends a review of the investment incentive system, in light of the widespread perception
that it has not yielded the desired outcomes while generating large fiscal costs. Staff urges the

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DJIBOUTI

authorities to proceed with the fiscal conference which should provide a forum to examine reform
possibilities for the incentive system in particular, and the fiscal framework as a whole, and introduce
the reforms needed for fiscal sustainability and growth.
46.
Fiscal consolidation is indispensable. The current levels of fiscal deficits cannot be
sustained. However, the scope for further expenditure cuts is limited given the tightening of current
expenditures already envisaged. This unsustainable situation highlights the urgency of fiscal reform
to broaden the tax base and reduce leakages. Over the next few years, it is also important for the
investment projects to begin to generate revenues, and thus help cut the deficits.
47.
Economic diversification remains a priority. Much of the scaling up of investment is
focused on port and transportation infrastructure catering mainly to Ethiopia, reinforcing the risk
associated with reliance on a single sector with one client. Structural reforms aimed at economic
diversification towards sectors with high growth and employment potential would help reduce this
risk. The key priorities are: (i) reducing the high electricity costs which—despite the importation
since 2011 of much cheaper electricity from Ethiopia—have not been reduced for businesses;
(ii) improving the business environment, especially through strengthening the protection of property
rights and contract enforcement, and reducing red tape.
48.
Educational curricula and training programs require reform with an emphasis on skills
training, rather than academic training. This would help to develop the skills that are in demand
in the job market, thereby improving the ability of Djibouti nationals to fill the jobs created during
the investment boom.
49.
Strengthening bank supervision is critical for financial stability. Further strengthening
of central bank supervisory capacity is needed to deal with the expanding banking sector.
Enhanced banking supervision would enable the central bank to improve monitoring the quality of
commercial bank lending, enforce higher provisioning requirements for such loans, and encourage
commercial banks to improve their risk management capacity.
50.
Facilitating access to credit for individuals and labor-intensive micro, small and
medium enterprises would help foster inclusive growth. Strengthening banking supervision will
foster financial stability. Developing the overall financial infrastructure by modernizing the payments
and credit reporting systems, and providing partial credit guarantees for small and medium
enterprises, would promote access to financial services and contribute to inclusive growth.
51.
Targeted social safety nets are needed to protect the poor and vulnerable population
from economic hardship. Poverty alleviation policies have been largely untargeted, with limited
impact on intended beneficiaries despite the high incidence of poverty. Staff welcomes the ongoing
preparation of the social register that will provide the database for developing safety net programs
and urges the authorities to expedite the process.
52.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV Consultation be held on the standard 12month cycle.

Annex II. Major Medium-Term Central Government Investment
Projects
The government plans to spend about US$900 million (60 percent of GDP) on two large investment
projects in 2014-2018.
The railway project
The electrified railway project involves the construction of a 756 km railway line, stretching from
Addis-Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, to Doraleh port in Djibouti. The Djibouti segment of the railway
line costs US$550 million, and the loan contracted is about US$492 million. Ethiopia is financing its
own segment of the railway line. The Djibouti government will provide the remaining US$58 million,
of which US$28.5 million had already been provided in 2013 from the privatization revenues.
Construction of the Djibouti segment is already underway without well-defined institutional
arrangements for managing the project. The Djibouti authorities expect that the project will
generate the following benefits: (i) reduced travel time, (ii) job creation, and (iii) revenue generation
through increased port traffic. Furthermore, they anticipate that the railway line will transform
Djibouti into the main port for landlocked South Sudan’s imports and oil exports via Ethiopia.
Staff believes that the railway project is likely to generate economic growth, jobs, and, in the longrun, fiscal revenues for Djibouti if it is implemented and managed within a well-defined institutional
arrangement for revenue sharing with Ethiopia. Such an arrangement is yet to be put in place.
Furthermore, staff does not have the necessary data to quantify the possible positive
macroeconomic impact and assess whether the expected benefits are sufficiently large to justify the
project cost.
The water pipeline projects
The project involves the construction of a pipeline between Djibouti and Ethiopia to permit the
importation of 100,000 cubic meters of water a day free of charge from Ethiopia. The total cost of
the project is US$340 million of which about US$322 million is a loan from China. The Djibouti
government will provide the additional financing (US$18 million). The current daily demand for
water in Djibouti-ville, the capital city, which is home to about 60 percent of the national population,
is estimated at 80,000 cubic meters a day. Information on the demand for the entire country is
unavailable. The current supply of water is estimated at 36,000 cubic meters a day. Much of the
current supply comes from underground sources which are of poor quality and are being depleted.
Water from other sources suitable for domestic use is virtually nonexistent. The daily demand is
projected at 114,500 cubic meters in 2020 and 144,000 cubic meters in 2030. An estimated
50 percent of water supply is lost due to the dilapidated state of the distribution network. A longdelayed €46 million Euros desalination project is expected to be initiated in 2014 and completed by
end-2016.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Staff believes that the water pipeline will generate large social benefits by reducing or eliminating
the shortfall in the demand for water which has been a potential source of political unrest. The
pipeline could also induce investment that has been deterred by insufficient water supply. However,
it is unlikely that the revenues generated directly from the project will cover the related debt service
obligations unless certain politically difficult decisions are taken, notably water tariff increases, and
requiring non-state actors—especially foreign military bases located in the country—to source water
from Djibouti’s state-owned water company instead of generating their own water supply.
Furthermore, the terms and institutional arrangements for accessing the water reserve will need to
be clarified with Ethiopia. Lastly, the state-owned water company that will take over the operation of
the pipeline and the servicing of the loan requires restructuring.

Annex III. External Sector Assessment and Competitiveness
The current account deficit is forecast to remain large over the medium term reflecting sharp
increase in capital imports. However, most of investment imports are linked to external project loans
or direct investment flows and may not be realized if disbursements are delayed. Taking into
account this financing, real effective exchange rate is assessed to be moderately overvalued. Going
forward, the current account could narrow due to increased exports capacity without major
adjustment of the REER. In order to mitigate significant external vulnerabilities, the government
should continue reforms targeted at improving business environment, promote exports
diversification and reduction domestic costs. It is also important to build sufficient buffers of foreign
exchange reserve.
The current account gap will exceed 27 percent of GDP in the near term, but is projected to
fall back to low double-digits after the construction boom is over. Massive capital goods
imports will greatly exceed an

maritime services is forecast to
accelerate to about 15 percent in real terms on average in 2014-2019 as construction of new port
facilities will allow to ease capacity constraints. Constructions of the new railroad will generate a new
stream of export revenues, however for the next decade most of the incomes will be used to cover
debt service.
Limited exports diversification and minimal local production makes the outlook dependent
on the economic performance of the neighboring Ethiopia and the global commodity prices.
While export revenues are concentrated in trade and transportation services, local production of key
consumption goods (such as food) as well as the main factors of production (including water and
energy) is almost non-existent. Current account remains prone to food prices and energy shocks.
Public borrowings, predominantly project loans, remain the main source of financing. Most of
the investment projects are either directly financed by the government, or by public enterprises
under the explicit government guarantee. Due to limited investment opportunities and
underdeveloped financial system within the country, banks prefer to accumulate assets abroad or
transfer them to the parent companies, draining capital from Djibouti. Information on private debt

32

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DJIBOUTI

by nonfinancial enterprises is limited. Overall, the threat of sudden stops in capital flows is perceived
to be low.
Major improvement in competitiveness and business environment in particular, are
prerequisites for the projected increase in FDI flows. To unlock private investments and benefit
fully from its main competitive advantage—geographical position—Djibouti needs to realize major
improvements in business environment, increase labor efficiency and reduce costs of other factors
of production such as energy. Despite recent steps made by the government to facilitate start of
new businesses and access to financing, Djibouti remains behind its peers (See paragraph 13Djibouti: Business environment and Governance Indicators).
Accounting for the structure of external financing and the drivers of external demand, the
real effective exchange rate (REER) is assessed to be moderately overvalued. In 2013, the REER
index based on consumer price inflation remained broadly unchanged (figure above) as compared
to the previous year. At the same time, as current account remains above the level consistent with
the medium-term fundamentals (estimated at

financed through accumulation of public
and publicly-guaranteed debt or FDI inflows. Net of imports associated with the major on-going
and projected investments, estimated gaps would be much lower. This is not captured in MB or
EBA estimates.



Price elasticity of exports and imports is very low. Demand for Djibouti’s main exports—port
services and the use of its land for military bases—stems from Djibouti’s geo-strategic location.
At the same time, internal production of the main import items such as food and manufactured
goods is non-existent due to unfavorable climate and a range of other of supply-side
constraints.



Djibouti remains dependent on aid flows, which should be captured in the assessment of the
gaps. Current account projections are highly sensitive to the assumptions on loan
disbursements. As discussed above, after the frontloaded scale-up in investments, the current
account is projected to fall to about 13 percent by 2019 and further to about 10 percent in the
long term without major movements in the REER.



Sufficient reserves buffers are needed to deal with shocks. Under the baseline, reserves coverage
ratio will stay at around 105 percent of the sum of the broad money and the government
deposit at the central bank, which is slightly above legally required full coverage. Reserves
imports coverage ratio is projected to fluctuate between 3 and 5 months of imports below the
6 months benchmark for countries with fixed exchange rate regime.

Annex IV. Investment and Growth
Public and private investment in Djibouti soared recently, but the potential impacts of these
investments on growth have not been carefully evaluated and there are doubts that these
investments reduce poverty and unemployment. Investment is expected to reach an unprecedented
48 percent of GDP in 2014 and rise further to 55 percent of GDP in 2015.

Indeed, Djibouti has followed the example of many other African countries such as Ghana, Ethiopia,
Tanzania, and Zambia in non-concessional borrowing for public investment, although these
countries have lower debt-to-GDP ratios than Djibouti. Most of these countries signed loan
agreements with the China Exim Bank and China Development Bank for investment in the energy
and transportation sectors. For instance, Ghana issued 750 million Eurobond and borrowed US$292
million from Exim Bank in 2007, and then, at end-2011, Ghana and China Development Bank
negotiated a “Master Financial Agreement” worth US$3 billion.
Public investment and growth
The country has engaged in massive public investment projects (see Table 1). In capital- where
capital is scarce, such as Djibouti, public investments are expected to have high return, but the
impact on growth is often uncertain, especially because of deficiencies in public financial
management. In the Public Investment Management Index (PIMI), Djibouti ranked 50th out of
71 developing countries, of which 40 countries are LICs. In turn, the impact on debt sustainability of
non-concessional borrowing depends on the impact of investment on growth.

Foreign direct investment and growth
Djibouti has seen not only a boom in the level of public investment, but also in foreign direct
investment. FDI decreased during the global crisis, but it reached an unprecedented level in 2013
and is expected to remain at high levels in the coming years.

The impact of the previous surge of FDI on growth has been positive, but negligible on
employment and poverty. The share of FDI in total investment increased from 11 percent in 2003
to about 50 percent in 2007–08 while the annual real growth averaged 5.2 percent during 2006–09.
FDI flows can affect economic growth through many channels such as increases in investment and
employment, foreign exchange, and tax and customs revenues. Here, also, the impact on growth
cannot be taken for granted. According to the literature, FDI flows may generate negligible
investment spillovers in countries with less-developed financial markets and weaker institutions.
Studies also show the importance of human capital for the technology spillover of FDI flows. For
instance findings in Wang and Wong (2009) suggest that FDI promotes growth only when there is a
threshold level of human capital in the host country.

Safeguards Assessment
A safeguards assessment of the Banque Centrale de Djibouti (BCD) was conducted in 2012 in the
context of an augmentation of access under the previous ECF arrangement. It found that limited
progress had been made since the last assessment. Fundamental governance and oversight gaps
persisted, including the absence of an internal audit function. Statutory compliance was not
monitored, and transparency of financial reporting remained limited. The straightforward nature of
the BCD’s operations, and the currency board arrangement, mitigated these risks to some extent.
The assessment recommended the BCD formalize Board and Audit Committee oversight, introduce
an internal audit mechanism, improve financial reporting transparency through publication, and
clarify the roles and responsibilities in servicing and repayment of IMF loans between the BCD and
the Ministry of Finance (now Ministry of Budget) in a memorandum of understanding agreement.
The memorandum of understanding has been signed. The 2013 management letter has been
published; however, staff has been unable to obtain a copy of the complete set of 2013 financial
statements, including the disclosure notes.
Exchange arrangements
Djibouti has a currency board arrangement. The Djibouti franc is pegged to the U.S. dollar at the
rate of DF 177.721 = US$1. Djibouti is an Article VIII member and maintains an exchange system that
is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions.
Article IV Consultation
The staff report for the 2013 Article IV consultation was discussed by the Executive Board on July 3,
2013.
FSAP Participation
The FSAP, including the assessment of the AML-CFT framework, was approved by the Board in June
2009. Key findings were (i) the banking sector does not appear to pose an immediate systemic
threat, but it is vulnerable to a deterioration of credit quality and interest rate movements; (ii) the
BCD’s regulatory and supervisory framework is rudimentary and not well suited to handle the entry
of new banks; (iii) the BCD should introduce a reserve requirement and bolster its capacity to
provide emergency liquidity support, (iv) the BCD should, in cooperation with the banking
community, develop a comprehensive modernization strategy for the national payments system that
responds to the needs of the growing economy; (v) the assessment of AML/CFT noted
a combination of weak capacity to address ML/FT and multiple vulnerability factors. The BCD has
started to implement some of these recommendations. It has adopted measures to strengthen
banking supervision and regulation, including onsite and offsite bank inspections. Furthermore, the
BCD has reinforced prudential measures by increasing the minimum capital requirements and
reducing the single-borrower limit.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
General: Data provided to the Fund are broadly adequate for surveillance. There are, however, serious
shortcomings especially in the areas of national accounts and the balance of payments (BOP), and to
a lesser extent, in external debt and fiscal data. These data shortcomings are due to capacity
constraints. Djibouti began participating in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) in
February 2012.
National accounts: The authorities do not compile national accounts data, mostly because of low
implementation capacity. An initiative has been launched to compile national accounts data. In the
first phase, GDP estimates have been generated for 2008–12. In the second phase, a system of
national accounts will be established. A population census was completed in 2009, followed by a
poverty survey in 2012. A poverty profile was subsequently developed. A budget-consumption
survey has been undertaken which should lead to the revision of the CPI basket weights.
External sector: Substantial progress has been made in improving BOP statistics in line with
recommendations made by Fund TA missions over the past few years, including a November 2011
BOP mission to assist the authorities in improving the compilation of BOP and IIP statistics and in
preparing an effective transition from BPM5 to BPM6. Problems were identified in compiling trade
statistics, coverage of direct investment transactions in the BOP, and estimating workers’
remittances; improvements could also be made to several items such as freight transportation,
investment income, transactions related to foreign military bases, and other investment of private
sector (use of IBS data). Despite the introduction of a new system for the management of external
debt in 2002, debt statistics continue to be provided irregularly and with a delay.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DJIBOUTI

Government finance: Fiscal data are available on a monthly basis with a lag of about three months.
These data do not cover extra-budgetary accounts and public enterprises. Foreign-financed capital
expenditure is reported regularly. However, additional efforts are needed to improve the
compilation and coverage of fiscal data, particularly at the institutional level, in order to fulfill the
recommendations made by a government finance statistics mission in 2001. The Ministry of Budget
is reporting neither annual data for dissemination in the GFS Yearbook nor high-frequency data for
publication in the International Finance Statistics (IFS).
Monetary accounts: Monetary statistics are generally adequate and cover the central bank and the
aggregated balance sheet of all commercial banks. Djibouti received three monetary and financial
statistics missions (2004–09) on compiling monetary and financial statistics in accordance with the
Fund’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). Over this period, the BCD has implemented
some of the recommendations, particularly those concerning the establishment of a sectorization of
the economic entities of Djibouti. However, most of the recommendations have not been
implemented, mainly because of staffing constraints at the BCD.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITYANALYSIS
Approved By
Daniela Gressani and
Dhaneshwar Ghura (IMF)
and John Panzer (IDA)

Prepared by the International Monetary Fund
The International Development Association

Debt risks have increased significantly after the government of Djibouti contracted large
nonconcessional loans in 2013. The current DSA confirms the high risk of external debt
distress assigned earlier. There are significant and protracted breaches of the PV of debtto-GDP and the PV of debt-to-exports thresholds. Liquidity ratios breach the relevant
thresholds as well, indicating not only elevated solvency risks, but also potential liquidity
tightness in the near term. In order to avoid a downgrade to ‘in debt distress’, the
government would need to clear the existing arrears of $4.7 million in the near term and
avoid accumulating new arrears.
External debt ratios are most sensitive to exchange rate depreciation; shocks to exports;
and tightening of the financing terms, which is particularly relevant because a significant
share of debt has variable interest rates. The debt sustainability analysis suggests that
borrowing space is extremely limited, and any further nonconcessional borrowing will
exacerbate the already high risk of debt distress.

DJIBOUTI

BACKGROUND
1.
Total public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt declined slightly to 56.8 percent of GDP by
the end of 2013. A slight decline in the external debt-to-GDP ratio was driven by the GDP growth; the
nominal stock was up by US$42 million and stood at 48.3 percent at the end of 2013. Domestic debt
increased as advanced dividend payment by the state bank was converted into a loan. However, this trend
is expected to be reversed, driven by disbursements under the new external loans. In 2013 the government
contracted two large loans for the total amount of about US$900million (60 percent of GDP). These loans
are provided by the Export-Import Bank of China to finance the construction of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti
railway and a water pipeline from Ethiopia (see Annex II of the Staff Report and Table 1 below).
Disbursements are concentrated over 2014–17. As a result, the external debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to
exceed 80 percent of GDP in 2017.

1/ The estimates does not take into account commitment fees. For the railroad project loan LIBOR is assumed to remain fixed at 0.5 percent - the
level of interest rates at the time, when the loan was contracted.

2.
Domestic debt remains a small portion of the total debt stock. Domestic debt increased in
2013 as advanced dividend payment by the state bank was converted into a loan. The government
continues clearing the old stock of domestic arrears according to the schedule set at the beginning of the
2008 ECF; however, new domestic arrears were accumulated. The exact amount of the total outstanding
stock of domestic arrears is unclear. It is assumed that new domestic arrears were cleared by the end of
2014.
3.
The major scaling-up of investment will exert considerable fiscal pressures in the near term.
The government interest rate bill is projected to increase to at least 1.6 percent of GDP in 2018–19, from
0.3 percent in 2013; including at least 0.7 percentage point associated with the interest rate on the
disbursed amounts and commitment fees paid on undisbursed amounts under the water pipeline and the
railway loan agreements.

4.
As of November 2014, the stock of arrears (excluding technical arrears) on PPG external
debt amounted to US$4.7 million (less than 0.3 percent of GDP and 1 percent of the total debt stock).
About half of these arrears have been outstanding for less than 3 months and represent missed payments
to Arab funds covered by the GCC grant agreement.1 The remaining portion of arrears (including arrears to
Paris Club members) is expected to be repaid by February 2015.

MACROECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS
5.
The scaling-up of investment is expected to accelerate economic activity starting in 2014,
but also to result in widening of the fiscal and current account deficits over the medium term.


GDP growth was revised up to about 7 percent in 2016–17, compared with 6.5 percent in the
previous DSA (Table 3) under the assumption that ongoing investments will create new
production and export capacity. It is projected to moderate to 6 percent in the long term,
slightly higher than the previous DSA (5.8 percent).



The current account gap is projected to reach 27 percent of GDP over 2014–15, because large
capital imports will exceed the expected increase in exports, mainly port services. Most of the
projects have already secured financing in the form of debt (mainly PPG), FDI, and capital grants.



Net FDI inflow (mainly the development of port-related activities) is projected to fluctuate
around 8–11 percent of GDP per annum.



Inflation forecasts were revised upward to 3–3.5 percent over the next five years, from
2.5 percent assumed under the previous DSA.



Given data on the loan agreements signed since the last review and data on loans under
negotiation, in the current DSA update the grant element of new public borrowings remains at
about 25 percent.



It is projected that the central government will reduce usage of external financing after 2019 and
increase borrowing from the domestic market to cover its remaining budget financing needs.
The real interest rate of new domestic debt is set at 2 percent.



Effective interest rates on external debt are projected to remain elevated in 2014–15 because of
a large share of relatively expensive loans, and to decline gradually to 2.7–3 percent in the long
term, assuming a constant LIBOR rate. However, the effective interest rate on the railway project
loan, which is linked to six months LIBOR, could increase.

6.

The current DSA uses a discount rate of 5 percent, up from 3 percent used in the previous DSA.

EXTERNAL DSA
7.
Under the baseline, total nominal public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt is
projected to exceed 80 percent of GDP with the present value (PV) of debt-to-GDP ratio almost
reaching 75 percent over the medium term2 (Table 4). Disbursements are projected to significantly
outpace the repayments over the next five years, leading to rapid buildup of the debt stock (Figure 1).
Under the baseline scenario, the present value (PV) of the external debt-to-GDP ratio and the PV debt–toexports ratio remain above their respective thresholds beyond 2025 (Figure 2). PV of debt-to-revenues
ratio is breached temporarily over the medium term. Debt service ratios remain below indicative thresholds
under the baseline, but are breached under most of the stress tests.

8.
The updated DSA shows that exchange rate depreciation and combined shock are likely to
have the most significant effect on debt ratios (Table 5). The bound tests indicate that a one-time
30 percent nominal depreciation in 2014 leads to an increase in the PV of the external debt-to-GDP ratio
above 100 percent and to prolonged breaches of the relative threshold. The combined shock may push the
PV of the external debt-to-revenue threshold beyond 200 percent, at least in the medium term. The shock
to new public sector financing on less favorable terms (200 basis points on all new financing in 2012-34)
could be used as a proxy for the potential effect of high floating rates on the railway project loan in the
medium term. Under this shock, the PV of the debt-to GDP ratio rises to 85 percent in 2017, and debt
service-to-revenue ratio breaches its threshold in 2019.

2

Because information on the stock and flows of the private external debt is limited, the current DSA uses simplified
assumptions about the evolution of the private external debt. These projected flows, together with capital grants, are
behind large negative residuals in the summary of the drivers of net changes in external debt (Table 4).

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DJIBOUTI

PUBLIC DSA
9.
The dynamic of the total public debt mainly reflects that of external debt as the share of
PPG domestic debt remains small (Table 6). Overall public debt is projected to increase from 57 percent
in 2013 to about 85 percent in 2017 and remain well above the 38 percent benchmark for the next
10 years. Simulations under the baseline scenario show a significantly stronger debt position as compared
to fixed primary balance and historical scenarios, which could be explained by i) projected acceleration of
economic growth in the medium term; and ii) expected improvement in the fiscal position (taking into
account privatization proceeds received in 2013), which is not captured by these alternative scenarios.
According to stress tests, public debt indicators are most vulnerable to exchange rate shock: a one-time
30 percent depreciation in 2014 leads to a major increase in all key ratios and has the most significant
impact on the debt-service-to-revenue ratio.

CONCLUSION
10.
Djibouti remains at a high risk of debt distress, and both solvency and liquidity risks
increased significantly since the last DSA. There are significant and protracted breaches of thresholds for
the present values of the external debt-to-GDP and the debt-to-exports ratios. Under the baseline scenario,
both ratios are sensitive to exchange rate depreciation. The DSA also indicates that Djibouti may face
liquidity pressures in the near future. Debt service indicators are sensitive to most standardized stress tests,
including higher cost of financing and exchange rate depreciation.
11.
The debt sustainability analysis suggests that the borrowing space is extremely limited.
Policy advice would be to minimize issuance of government debt guarantees and encourage private sector
participation in direct financing of investment projects. Any PPG borrowing on nonconcessional terms
would lead to additional debt service costs over the medium term and should be avoided.
12.
The authorities acknowledge high risk attached to the current financing strategy. They
believe, however, that this strategy may be viable if it generates growth and that it will crowd in sufficient
inflow of FDI. They claim that both domestic and external arrears are being cleared. The setting up of a
Debt committee comprising the Ministry of budget, the Ministry of economy and finance, and the central
bank, is being considered. The authorities have also underscored that provision of government guarantees
can significantly reduce the cost of financing.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Statement by Ngueto Yambaye, Executive Director for
Djibouti and Mr. Abdoulaye Tall, Senior Advisor
January 30, 2015
I. Introduction
Djibouti has made significant stride recently in achieving high growth rates and reducing
poverty. The authorities’ policies, in particular improvements to the investments climate
and socio-political stability, helped usher a boom in foreign direct investment and
financing for major infrastructure projects.
Djibouti’s strategic location, as a preferred port outlay for landlocked east African
countries, and at a critical juncture for global maritime and trade routes, provides it with
unique opportunities and also challenges. The authorities are determined to leverage
Djibouti strengths to enhance the region’s growth prospects and address the high
unemployment and poverty rates.
As noted by staff, extreme poverty and unemployment rates remain high, at 41.9 and 48
percent respectively in 2012. Translating high economic growth rates into job creation,
particularly for the youth, remain an essential priority for the authorities. To that regard,
they recently adopted a strategic framework to turn Djibouti into an Emerging market
economy status, Djibouti Vision 2035 and the Accelerated Growth Strategy for
Employment Creation, which lays out the governments’ long term priorities, and will
inform medium term reforms, and current policies.
Djibouti’s authorities are appreciative of the Fund’s constructive policy dialogue and the
technical assistance provided over the years in furthering their growth and
macroeconomic stability agenda. As well reflected in the report, the authorities have
implemented, to a greatest extent, Fund’s previous Article IV consultations advice- Cf.
Annex V of the staff report, and there is a broad agreement between the authorities and
Fund staff on the challenges facing Djibouti going forward. To help support their reforms
efforts, and increase the traction of the Fund’s advice further, the authorities reiterate
their interest in a program with the IMF.
II. Recent Developments and Outlook
Economic growth accelerated in Djibouti, driven by the scaling up of investments in
priority infrastructure projects. Inflation remained subdued and significantly below the
rate registered in comparable economies, including due to the strong currency board
anchor. The current account deficit is expected to initially deteriorate while capital
investment and heavy equipment imports are absorbed, and to gradually revert as the
projects’ production cycle mature.
Fiscal policy sought to further the authorities’ growth and poverty reduction agenda,
while containing fiscal risks. The implementation of fiscal and tax administration

2
reforms, increased revenues from the leasing of military bases, as well as lower oil prices
and improved recovery of tax payment arrears, helped generate higher fiscal revenues.
On spending, the authorities moved forward with investment for key water, transportation
and energy projects, while containing non priority spending. The investment in the major
water generation and transport project will contribute to reducing the severe drinking
water shortages, and help achieve one of Djibouti’s Millennium Development Goals. The
regional electric power interconnection and railroad projects will help strengthen
Djibouti’s competitiveness, while reducing the cost of doing business related to high
electricity and transportation costs.
While the authorities sought to improve the share of investment in the budget, they also
strived to contain non-priority spending. Hence, public sector hiring was limited to
education and health sectors in an effort to control the wage bill. On social spending, the
authorities benefited from the technical expertise, and support from the World Bank in
designing and implementing well targeted social safety nets for the poor and vulnerable
households notably in Djibouti-ville and in fragile rural areas. In this vein, progress was
made towards building a registry of the poor to better target social spending.
As regards monetary policy, the authorities’ continued to maintain the coverage of base
money in foreign reserves at a level comfortably above the full coverage legal
requirement of the currency Board. They took steps to enhance the supervision of the
financial system, with the issuance of new instructions and prudential regulation, notably
for commercial banks. Although there has been no recent deterioration of the banking
system’s health indicators, the authorities are closely monitoring the compliance of the
financial system to prudential regulation, including in particular the provisioning for nonperforming loans, as well as the banks’ loan concentration. The authorities have stepped
up onsite inspections, and are prepared to forcefully act should risks increase.
On structural reforms, the authorities continued to make progress towards improving
public sector efficiency, particularly of public utilities. In this vein, they initiated a
comprehensive public enterprise reform program covering the ten largest public
enterprises. They also initiated reforms to streamline business regulation with the view to
improving further the climate for business.
III. Policies Going Forward
Job Creation and Poverty Reduction
The authorities broadly share staff’s diagnostic and recommendations for reducing the
widespread poverty and unemployment. The Government recently launched its
homegrown strategic development plan, Djibouti Vision 2035 after extensive
consultations with the private sector, civil society organizations, and development
partners, including the World Bank. The plan recognizes the essential role of the private
sector as an engine for growth, and calls for reforms to improve the climate for business,

3
as well as substantial investments in infrastructure to reduce the cost of doing business,
particularly in the area of electric power, water, transport, and telecommunication.
Economic diversification is another key axis of the strategy to create jobs and reduce the
economy’s vulnerability to shocks, with tourism development and the promotion of small
and medium sized enterprises as immediate priority action areas.
In order to promote economic growth and poverty reduction, the government plans to
improve the governance and efficiency of public social transfers, improve access to
finance for the poor, and promote stronger linkages between training programs and
employers to better match the needs of companies.
Fiscal Sustainability
The authorities recognize the fiscal risks highlighted by staff, and remain committed to
fiscal consolidation with the view to achieving its jobs and poverty reduction objectives
while preserving fiscal sustainability. The reforms planned will be multi-pronged. To
increase revenues and improve the transparency and efficiency of the tax code, they are
convening a fiscal forum this year that is expected to make a comprehensive proposal,
including with regard to closing tax loopholes, reviewing the cost effectiveness of
generous investment tax incentives, and improving the fairness of the tax code.
On spending, the authorities plan to continue restraining non-priority spending, including
by pursuing the hiring freeze outside of the health and education sectors aimed at
containing the wage bill. They are committed to ensuring that investments are properly
appraised going forward and contribute to achieving their development objectives. They
will further seek to revert to a balanced budget, and will implement reforms aimed at
strengthening the fiscal policy framework, including by adopting a medium term fiscal
framework.
The authorities plan to deepen reforms aimed at improving the governance and balance
sheets of public enterprises to ensure that the scaled up public investments in
infrastructure are sustainable in the long run. Amongst other reforms, they plan to
improve the competiveness of the telecommunication industry by considering the entry of
additional operators in the sector, and to strengthen the management of the water
company, ONEAD.
The authorities are committed to improving spending efficiency and public financial
management, with the valuable technical assistance provided by the Fund and other
development partners.
External and Financial Stability
The Central Bank of Djibouti will continue to ensure that the coverage of base money is
comfortably above the legal target. The authorities welcome the IMF’s assessment that
Djibouti’s external stability is well anchored, and will continue to strengthen the

4
regulation of the financial sector and supervisory capacity. They will also enforce
prudential regulation, including the higher provisioning requirements for commercial
banks, and the AML/CFT framework.
Promoting financial inclusion is also priority reform area for the authorities. With the
support of the World Bank, they plan to modernize the payment system, and improve
access to financing, particularly for small and medium sized enterprises, and the poor.
Debt Sustainability
The authorities take good note of staff’s advice on debt sustainability especially on nonconcessional borrowing contracted after the previous ECF program had expired. The
limitations of the Debt Sustainability analysis methodologies are well recognized by the
Fund, in the context of small emerging economies like Djibouti where a handful of
projects could lead to a substantial change in the debt sustainability profile. The
authorities also welcome staff’s own recognition that the DSA models which are country
specific are not well equipped to assess the impact of projects with a regional dimension.
Notwithstanding these caveats, the authorities take note of the concerns expressed by
staff and will take appropriate measures to preserve debt sustainability. As
abovementioned, they are taking steps to ensure that debt-financed investments are
properly appraised, and generate the revenues needed to service the debt, while crowding
in FDI. Even though they note that the DSA’s stress test scenario of an exchange rate
shock is highly unlikely given the currency board’s arrangement, the authorities plan to
continue efforts aimed at diversifying the economy to promote job creation and broaden
the productive basis of the economy. They are also strengthening further debt
management capabilities, including through better coordination between the agencies
involved and improved integration into the budget planning of debt service-related
liquidity needs.
IV. Conclusion
Djibouti’s authorities have been implementing an ambitious policy agenda aimed at
turning Djibouti into an emerging market economy, while reducing unemployment and
widespread poverty. They have a track record of implementing sound policies which
benefited from Fund’s advice.
Djibouti continues to face significant challenges in mitigating fiscal risks, while pursuing
their inclusive growth strategy. The authorities’ had been actively seeking an IMF
supported program as they are convinced that the Fund’s advice would have had more
traction in the context of a program. Based on their overall strong track record of
implementing Fund advice, and given that they have already implemented the prioractions approved by the Board for a new program arrangement, Directors’ support for the
Fund to engage program discussions with the authorities at the earliest will be greatly
appreciated.
