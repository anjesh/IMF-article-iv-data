IMF staff team. Messrs. Mazarei (Head), Kock, Wieczorek, and Ms. Morsy (all MCD),
Mr. Sun (SPR), and Mr. Westphal (FAD). Mr. Ross (the Fund’s resident representative in
Pakistan) assisted the mission. Mr. Di Tata (MCD) participated in the initial meetings, and
Mr. Geadah (MCM) participated in the discussions on financial sector issues. Mr. Ahmad (OED)
also participated in the discussions. Ms. Kahkonen (World Bank) and Mr. Parvez (Asian
Development Bank) participated in the discussions on structural issues.

•

The last Article IV consultation was concluded on December 17, 2007. Pakistan has accepted
the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. Since February 1, 2009, Pakistan’s exchange
regime has been classified as a float. An exchange restriction arising from a limit on advance
payments for imports is to be eliminated by January 31, 2010. In addition, cash margin
requirements (introduced in May 2008) on letters of credit (LCs) for certain imports give rise to
an exchange restriction.

•

On November 24, 2008, the Executive Board approved a 23-month Stand-By Arrangement
(SBA) for Pakistan under the Emergency Financing Mechanism in the amount of
SDR 5.169 billion, or 500 percent of quota. A first purchase of SDR 2.067 billion, or 200 percent
of quota, was made on November 26. At end-January 2009, Fund credit and loans outstanding to
Pakistan amounted to SDR 2.811 billion, or 272 percent of quota. All the end-December 2008
quantitative performance criteria and the structural benchmarks for the first review were met. On
March 3, 2009, Pakistan imposed cash margin requirements on LCs for certain imports not
previously subject to these requirements, which resulted in nonobservance of the continuous
performance criterion against imposing or intensifying exchange restrictions. The authorities
plan to reverse this intensification by end-June, 2009 and are requesting a waiver of
nonobservance for the missed performance criterion. On this basis and on the strength of
program commitments expressed in the attached Supplementary Memorandum of Economic and
Financial Policies (SMEFP), staff recommends the completion of the first review and the
approval of the second purchase under the SBA (SDR 568.54 million or 55 percent of quota).

Data. Pakistan has participated in the GDDS since 2003. Economic data are broadly adequate for
surveillance and program monitoring.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
In October 2008, the authorities embarked on a stabilization program for 2008/09–09/10
aimed at restoring financial stability while protecting the poor. This program, supported by
an SBA arrangement, envisages a significant tightening of fiscal and monetary policies to
bring down inflation and strengthen the external position, and includes several structural
measures in the fiscal and financial sectors.
Initial developments since the approval of the program have been generally positive. The
exchange rate has been broadly stable, enabling the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to buy
foreign exchange on a net basis. As a result, gross reserves have strengthened from
$3.5 billion at end-October to $6.7 billion as of February 20. Despite the somewhat improved
confidence, credit and broad money demand growth have been lower than projected.
Policy implementation has been good and the program remains on track. All quantitative
performance criteria and the structural benchmarks for the first program review were met.
The end-December fiscal deficit target, which proved challenging, was achieved through a
combination of revenue and expenditure measures. However, the recent modification of cash
margin requirements on letters of credit (LCs) for certain imports resulted in nonobservance
of the continuous performance criterion against imposing or intensifying exchange
restrictions. The authorities plan to reverse this intensification by end-June and, on this basis,
request a waiver of nonobservance for the missed performance criterion.
Banks have weathered the crisis well thus far, but should be monitored carefully. The
worsening macroeconomic environment is affecting banks’ asset quality and profitability.
The global economic and financial environment has deteriorated significantly since the
start of the program. While oil import prices are lower, exports are falling, external
financing is more difficult, and there are increasing risks to remittances.
The authorities agreed with the mission on a revised macroeconomic framework (with
lower growth and inflation) and supporting policies for 2008/09 and beyond. The
authorities will adhere to the program’s fiscal target for 2008/09 and continue with further
fiscal adjustment in 2009/10. There should be scope for the SBP to lower its discount rate if
inflation abates, the external reserve position continues to improve, and the government can
sell its T-bills to banks and nonbank private investors. Exchange rate flexibility will continue
to facilitate external adjustment.
Pakistan needs additional external assistance to reduce risks, and provide for greater
development and social spending. The upcoming donor meeting provides an important
opportunity for mobilizing additional assistance.
In light of performance to date and the authorities’ policy intentions, staff recommends the
completion of the first program review and the approval of the waiver of nonobservance
for the missed performance criterion.

5
I. BACKGROUND
1.
Following the successful implementation of two Fund-supported programs during
2000–04, Pakistan enjoyed a relatively robust economic performance. During 2007, the
country continued to perform well in terms of growth owing to favorable global economic
and financial conditions and expansionary economic policies, but inflation rose and external
imbalances began to emerge. At the conclusion of the 2007 Article IV consultation, Directors
encouraged the authorities to strengthen the fiscal program for 2007/081 to complement
monetary tightening, particularly by reducing energy subsidies and capital spending. Looking
beyond 2007/08, Directors stressed that further fiscal consolidation would be required to
reduce inflation and the external current account deficit while lessening pressures on real
interest rates. They noted that the tax revenue-to-GDP ratio was low by international
standards, and recommended to press ahead with reforms to increase revenue and enable a
reduction in the fiscal deficit while allowing for higher spending on infrastructure and
poverty alleviation. The authorities have generally responded positively to Fund advice but
the implementation of advice on some structural reforms has been slow (Box 1).
Box 1. Effectiveness of Fund Advice
The Pakistani authorities have generally agreed with Fund advice, but implementation has
been slow. In early 2008, the authorities started to adopt some of the policies recommended by
the Fund to address Pakistan’s macroeconomic imbalances, including monetary tightening and
a fiscal consolidation, particularly by reducing energy subsidies and capital spending. But,
various considerations, including political constraints, slowed their implementation, especially
on tax reforms. In the fall of 2008, the authorities developed a home-grown adjustment
program, very much in line with Fund policy advice.

2.
The macroeconomic situation has deteriorated significantly since 2007/08 on
account of both external and domestic factors. The increase in oil and food prices, and
adverse security developments exacerbated external imbalances. Growing fiscal deficits,
owing in large part to increasing energy subsidies and financed by the central bank, fuelled
inflation, while international reserves declined sharply and confidence waned.
3.
In October 2008, the authorities embarked on a stabilization program for 2008/09–
2009/10 aimed at restoring financial stability while protecting the poor. This program,
supported by the SBA approved on November 24, envisages a significant tightening of fiscal
and monetary policies to bring down inflation and strengthen the external position, as well as
several structural measures in the fiscal and financial sectors. Strengthening the social safety
net is a key priority under the program.

Fiscal year starts July 1st.

4.
In addition to stabilizing the macroeconomic situation, the program aims at
addressing some of Pakistan’s long-standing economic problems. In particular, it calls for a
comprehensive tax reform to raise budgetary revenue, and create greater fiscal space for
public investment and social spending. The authorities also plan to phase out electricity
subsidies, and to tackle the problem of inter-corporate (circular) debt in the energy sector.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
A. Overview
5.
Initial developments since the approval of the program have been generally
positive.2 The exchange rate has been broadly stable, enabling the SBP to buy foreign
exchange on a net basis (Figure 1). As a result, gross reserves have strengthened from
$3.5 billion at end-October to $6.7 billion as of February 20. There has also been a strong
positive response from the T-bill market to the 200-basis point increase in the SBP discount
rate implemented in mid-November, which brought the cumulative increase since
January 2008 to 500 basis points. T-bill auctions through end-February have been
consistently oversubscribed, with wide participation of banks, and enabled the government to
retire some of its debt to the SBP. T-bill rates came down from a peak of 14 percent
(weighted average) in mid-January to just below 13 percent at end-February.
6.
Domestic activity has weakened while inflation has been falling more rapidly than
expected, and the external current account deficit has been narrowing. A combination of
domestic factors (energy shortages, high interest rates) and external factors (weakening
global demand for textiles) resulted in a decline of nearly 6 percent in large-scale
manufacturing output during the first half of 2008/09 (Figure 2) and a sharp drop in exports
in recent months. On the positive side, agricultural output will benefit from a bumper wheat
crop in 2008/09, and significant increases in the rice and cotton crops should more than
compensate for the decline in sugar cane production. With falling food and energy prices and
lower economic activity, headline inflation has dropped faster than expected. In January,
headline CPI inflation declined to 20.5 percent (year-on-year), its lowest point
since May 2008. Although core inflation is still around 19 percent (year-on-year), monthly
core inflation dropped from a peak of 2.3 percent in July to 1.1 percent in January.3 Despite
the decline in international oil spot prices, the external current account through December did
not show a decisive improvement because of deferred payments for oil contracted at higher
prices, but the trend in imports pointed to an underlying improvement in the current account,
2

For a detailed discussion of the early developments following the approval of the SBA, see the staff report for
the Interim Review under the Emergency Financing Mechanism.

The weekly Sensitive Price Index (SPI) which tracks utility rates, transportation, and prices of food and other
household items for low-income groups increased at a year-on-year rate of 24 per cent (in late February),
reflecting the lingering effect of large food price increases in the first half of 2008. This high increase in SPI is a
source of concern for vulnerable groups.

7
notwithstanding lower exports. Also, inflows of remittances have thus far proven resilient,
and capital outflows have been lower than projected.
7.
In mid-December, the authorities removed the stock market price floor which had
been in place for 3½ months. The feared massive capital outflows did not materialize.4 After
the initial sharp drop, the Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) 100 Index bottomed out in late
January, following a cumulative decline of nearly 70 percent from its April 2008 peak. The
stock market has since rebounded by about 20 percent but, like most other capital markets, is
volatile. The recovery was supported only to a small extent by the National Investment
Trust’s State Enterprise Fund (NITSEF) of Rs. 20 billion (0.15 percent of GDP), which was
created to buy shares in eight public enterprises. The NITSEF, which is funded through
borrowing from domestic banks with government guarantee, has been active since early
January, and as of mid-February it had invested Rs. 7 billion.
8.
The global economic and financial environment has deteriorated significantly since
the SBA approval. To date, the global crisis has had mixed effects on Pakistan. As noted
earlier, the decline in fuel and food prices has had a moderating impact on inflation and has
helped strengthen the external current account. It has also contributed to the reduction of
energy and food subsidies, but it has had an adverse impact on output, exports, fiscal revenue
base, and current transfers. And, higher risk aversion will reduce foreign investment in
Pakistan: privatization receipts of $1.7 billion projected in the 2008/09 budget (a major
component of projected foreign financing) are unlikely to materialize, and market access
remains constrained (Box 2).
B. Program Implementation
9.
All quantitative performance criteria through December 2008 were met. The
authorities demonstrated an impressive degree of program ownership. Despite downward
pressures on the revenue side, they maintained a tight fiscal policy stance to fend off the risk
of resurging inflation and set the stage for a sustainable easing of interest rates down the
road. At the same time, the SBP capitalized on the upward pressure on the rupee to build a
cushion above the program net foreign assets (NFA) targets (SMEFP, Table 1).
10.
The end-December fiscal deficit target, which proved challenging, was achieved
through a combination of revenue and expenditure measures. Additional revenue from the
Petroleum Development Levy (PDL) largely compensated for the shortfall in revenue from
direct taxes, excises, and the sales tax on imports collected by the Federal Board of Revenue

4

Aggregate market capitalization (AMC) was Rs. 1.86 trillion or $23.5 billion on December 31, 2008; down by
61 percent (in rupee terms) from the peak of April 18, 2008; however, two-thirds of this drop was already
reflected in the end-September 2008 AMC data.

8
Box 2. Pakistan and International Financial Markets
Investor perceptions of Pakistan’s sovereign debt improved following the SBA approval, but
the subsequent changes, while positive, have been modest. Secondary markets are relatively
illiquid and primary debt markets remain virtually closed for countries rated below investment
grade, making it difficult for Pakistan to reestablish its market access. There has been some
recovery in the sovereign credit risk indicators as perceptions of liquidity risk have improved,
but concerns about political uncertainty, the public finances, and external sustainability have
not subsided. The adoption of the program and the broadly positive developments thus far have
significantly reduced implementation risk, but the underlying risks to the economic and
financial outlook remain high, and Pakistan’s economic policies are expected to remain
resource-constrained. Moreover, tail risks, including those related to the global economic
environment, have increased significantly.
•

The Pakistan’s EMBIG spread moderated from the peak of 2222 bps in December to
1914 bps at end-February, but remain volatile (an average for February was 1964 bps).

•

Five-year credit-default swaps (CDS) premium moderated from 3886 bps in
mid-October to 2850 bps in early February but still indicates high default risk.
However, the CDS market is relatively illiquid and does not reflect subtle changes in
risk perception.

•

Pakistan’s sovereign debt rating by Moody’s/S&P is B3/CCC+ (as of end-2008).
Moody’s rating, which puts Pakistan in the same category as Lebanon, was cut from
B2 to B3 in October, and has been reconfirmed in December, but the outlook was
changed to negative. S&P raised Pakistan’s rating to CCC+ in December; this upgrade
incorporated the first purchase under the SBA as a factor alleviating the prospects of
near-term debt service stress.

•

The amortization of the Eurobond in February ($500 million) was widely anticipated
and any residual positive impact that could have occurred in its aftermath has been
offset by recent political uncertainties, which sent the KSE into a temporary decline
after several weeks of recovery.

(FBR).5 More recently, the authorities have also introduced regulatory duties (10–25 percent)
on several imported luxury and nonessential goods. In addition, the authorities maintained
spending below the program’s projections, particularly on development projects.
11.
Despite the somewhat improved confidence, credit and broad money demand
growth have been slower than originally envisaged (Figure 3). Although reserve money
grew faster than projected (reflecting a strong build-up of NFA that offset a contraction in the
net domestic assets (NDA) of the SBP due to fiscal consolidation), broad money and private
5

Although, the authorities maintained a premium between domestic and international petroleum prices, the
retail prices of petroleum products were significantly reduced to pass in part the benefit of lower oil prices to
consumers. On December 1, the retail prices of gasoline and diesel were reduced by Rs. 9 and Rs. 4 per liter to
Rs. 57.7 ($0.73) and Rs. 48.0 ($0.61), respectively.

9
sector credit growth were below program projections.6 Specifically, private sector credit
growth was just below 13 percent (year-on-year), compared with 17 percent in the program.
Weak private sector growth reflects lower credit demand owing to the slowdown in
economic activity, increased risk aversion by banks, and a flight to quality (a shift in lending
to government and public enterprises) which has helped banks remain in a generally good
financial condition (Box 3).
12.
Measures taken to improve liquidity management and monetary policy
implementation fostered demand for T-bills and ensured orderly market conditions.
The Ministry of Finance (MoF) and the SBP now issue a calendar of T-bill auctions with
indicative volumes on a quarterly basis. Despite large oversubscription, the volumes of
T-bills sold in primary auctions do not exceed significantly the announced volumes. Cut-off
rates and allocation of T-bills among the 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month maturities (now
being decided solely by the MoF) have been geared toward managing cost, minimizing the
rollover risk, and building a yield curve. Open-market operations (OMOs) have been
conducted mainly with a view to smoothing liquidity conditions, and the overnight repo rates
have been markedly more volatile since September. Banks have accessed the SBP discount
window for liquidity needs with increased frequency in recent weeks. In general, however,
bank liquidity has been comfortable since October and, on a net basis, OMOs have recently
been conducted to absorb excess liquidity.
C. Structural Reforms under the Program
13.
All structural benchmarks for the first program review have been met (SMEFP,
Table 2). The authorities also observed the World Bank’s upfront conditionality for the
proposed Poverty Reduction and Economic Support Operation (PRESO) loan, which raises
expectations of an improved follow-through on structural reforms in general.7
•

The authorities adopted a tax policy and tax administration action plan. The plan
envisages the integration of the income tax and sales tax departments and the
replacement of the current general sales tax with a broad-based Value-Added Tax
(VAT). A technical assistance mission from the Fund (scheduled for April) will help
with the design of the VAT law, the revisions in the income tax legislation, and the
possible introduction of a carbon tax (SMEFP, ¶13–14).

6

Reserve money grew by 6.5 percent (year-on year) through end-December (5.8 percent in the program), while
broad money grew by 8.7 percent (9.6 percent in the program). Overall, the demand for rupee-denominated
assets has strengthened since October 2008, as evidenced by an increase in rupee deposits relative to foreigncurrency deposits. However, some of the effects observed through December reflected banks’ efforts to improve
performance indicators by the end of the financial year (which coincides with the calendar year). Preliminary
figures for January show a drop in deposits and weaker broad money growth. Relatedly, the spreads between
lending rates and deposit rates widened from 660 bps in January 2008 to nearly 780 bps in January 2009, with
weighted average lending and deposit rates at 14.66 and 6.88 percent, respectively.

7

The PRESO loan of $500 million is expected to be approved by the World Bank before end-March.

10
Box 3. Pakistan—Banking System Stability Assessment
Based on the recently conducted Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) update, the
banking system appears to be generally well-capitalized and liquid. Aggregate financial
soundness indicators improved since the 2004 FSAP. However, the worsening macroeconomic
environment affected adversely bank profitability and asset quality in 2008. Tighter
provisioning requirements reduced profits in 2007, and interest margins in 2008 were squeezed
by increases in the policy rate and the minimum deposit rate for savings accounts. Gross
nonperforming loans (NPLs) rose from 7.7 percent of total loans in June 2008 to 9.1 percent in
December 2008, mainly on account of growing non-performing consumer and textile sector
loans. The ratio of net NPLs to net loans increased from 1.3 to 2.5 percent in the same period,
and provisioning has remained generally adequate. This level of NPLs is manageable given the
improved capital position of the banking system, with capital adequacy ratios (CARs) having
risen from 12.1 to 12.2 percent of risk-weighted assets over the same period. The improvement
in CARs reflected mainly the increased share of T-bills and other low-risk assets in bank
portfolios. A few banks representing less than 10 percent of system assets face financial
pressures, which are to be addressed through mergers or fresh injection of equity. Progress by
these banks in resolving their problems is monitored closely by the SBP.
Stress tests conducted by the IMF/World Bank staffs with June 2008 data indicated that most
banks—including all large banks—would remain solvent in severe crisis scenario. However,
some small and mid-sized banks would face insolvency under these simulated crisis conditions.
In the worst case scenario, the capital injection needed to restore the CAR of the twelve largest
banks to the minimum regulatory CAR of 8 percent was 2.3 percent of GDP. This relatively
benign outcome reflects the low credit-to-GDP ratio and the relatively high capital buffers prior
to the simulated crisis. The main sources of risk for the vulnerable banks are a major
deterioration in credit quality, mainly in the textile industry, and a sharp drop in equity prices.
Default on the largest exposures puts significant strains on solvency given the large
concentration of these exposures in some banks. The SBP has obtained similar results on the
basis of end-September data.
Direct exposure of the banking system to currency depreciation was found to be generally
small, and indirect exposures through the unhedged exposure of bank clients limited.
Lending in foreign currencies is restricted to trade-related purposes by SBP regulation.
Exporters have foreign currency cash flows to cover debt service, but importers may be
vulnerable in the event of a sharp depreciation that depresses import demand. Residents’
foreign-currency accounts constitute less than 8 percent of total deposits in commercial banks.
•

The authorities reached understandings with World Bank staff regarding the
elimination of tariff differential subsidies by end-June 2009. Electricity tariffs were
increased by 1 percent effective February 1, and will be raised further by a
cumulative 4 percent by end-June (SMEFP, ¶17).

•

The SBP has prepared a contingency plan for handling problem banks. As required,
the plan sets out criteria for liquidity support, assessment of problem banks, and
intervention procedures. The SBP has actively encouraged the owners of the few
problem banks to proceed with mergers or fresh capital injections (SMEFP, ¶22–24).

11
•

The provision of foreign exchange by SBP for imports of furnace oil ceased on
February 1. These transactions were moved back to the interbank market.8

14.

Progress has also been made toward the end-March 2009 benchmarks:9

•

The authorities and World Bank staff have agreed on reforming the Benazir Income
Support Program (BISP) by introducing a scorecard as an objective targeting
mechanism for identifying poor households. The roll-out in 16 districts (pilot phase)
has started, with the roll-out in all the 130 districts expected to be finalized between
December 2009 and June 2010. BISP disbursements will start shortly, but delays in
the BISP roll-out and the government’s decision not to scale up Bait-ul-Mal (an
existing cash transfer program) will likely result in lower-than-projected spending on
social transfers in 2008/09 (Box 4; SMEFP, ¶12).

•

The authorities have accelerated the preparation of a plan to deal with the circular
debt. The circular debt (inter-corporate debt in the energy sector) has risen on a net
basis from Rs. 51 billion (0.4 percent of GDP) in mid-October to close to
Rs. 189 billion (1.5 percent of GDP) as of March 6. The authorities’ plan involves the
issuance of Term-Finance Certificates (TFCs) at Karachi Interbank Offered Rate
(KIBOR) + 175 bps to cover Rs. 98 billion in outstanding liabilities of Pakistan
Electric Power Company (PEPCO) to its suppliers, which should enable a significant
increase in electricity production that is needed to help the recovery in the industrial
sector. The TFCs will have a 5-year maturity with government guarantee. Financial
schemes to raise funds through the sale/lease of government property are also being
considered to cover the remainder of the circular debt (SMEFP, ¶18).
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Near-Term Economic Outlook and the Macroeconomic Framework

15.
The authorities and staff reached understandings on a revised macroeconomic
framework for 2008/09–09/10. The outlook for the remainder of 2008/09 remains difficult,
in particular for the manufacturing sector. As a result, the growth projection for 2008/09 was
revised downwards to 2.5 percent, from 3.4 percent in the original program. A further
downward revision was deemed unwarranted at this stage, given the strength of agricultural
output and the good performance of the services sector (Figure 4). Nevertheless, the revised
growth projections are subject to significant downside risks and real GDP growth in

The interbank market supplied all foreign exchange for furnace oil imports (presently accounting for about
20 percent of petroleum product imports) prior to July 8, 2008.

9

Regarding the structural benchmark for end-June 2009, the authorities indicated that a single treasury account
had already been created but the consolidation of the government funds in that account would not be feasible by
end-June. This issue will be taken up in the discussions for the second review.

12
Box 4. Social Protection in Pakistan
In spite of sustained economic growth over the last decade, poverty remains high. According to
the World Bank, the poverty rate declined from 34 percent in 2001 to about a quarter of Pakistani
households in 2005/06. The poor and non-poor alike remain vulnerable to risks such as health,
disability, unemployment, and sharp increases in the price of food. Poverty reduction is complicated
by the deficiencies in the social safety net, as well as under-investment in health and education.
In response, the government launched the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP) in
September 2008 to provide cash grants to the poorest families. Under the BISP, each eligible
family is to receive Rs. 1,000 per month. The FY 2008/09 budget allocated Rs. 34 billion
(0.3 percent of GDP) to BISP. However, until recently BISP lacked an objective targeting
mechanism, with beneficiaries being identified by the Members of the National Assembly.
In late January 2009, the authorities agreed with the World Bank on a reform of BISP through
the introduction of an objective targeting mechanism. This reform is based on a scorecard system
for identification of poor households. The roll-out of the scorecard system in at least 16 districts (a
pilot phase) is expected to be completed by May 2009, while the roll-out to all 130 districts is to be
completed between December 2009 and June 2010. The roll-out will need to be paced according to
capacity and ability to implement in the face of political and security constraints. The number of
benefiting families is to reach 5 million in 2009/10 and 7 million in 2010/11. To ensure proper
targeting of BISP transfers, the authorities envisage using the new scorecard system to scrutinize
beneficiaries that were identified under the pre-scorecard selection process.
In addition to BISP, there are two other nation-wide cash transfer programs with different modes
of financing and delivery, but similar objectives:
•

Bait-ul-Mal: Spending on Bait-ul-Mal has increased substantially over the last decade and the
number of beneficiaries increased from about 200,000 in 1998 to about 1.4 million in 2007.

•

Zakat: This program is financed by private contributions. However, these contributions have
declined substantially over the last decade.

Also, there are several small programs that provide social welfare and care services to persons with
disabilities, child laborers, and others. Moreover, a public works program provides employment
opportunities in small-scale rural and urban projects. Pakistan also uses a wheat subsidy to address
food price shocks. The province of Punjab has also recently launched its own cash transfer program.
The effectiveness of these programs is hampered by low coverage of the poorest households and
substantial leakage of benefits to non-poor households. The World Bank estimates that these
programs cover only 5 percent of the population. Moreover, around 32 percent of Zakat benefits and
25 percent of Bait-ul-Mal benefits accrue to non-poor households. Their effectiveness is further
diminished by benefits being small and infrequent, and by governance issues.
Consolidation of safety net programs and better funding could help to enhance their
effectiveness. Given the similar nature of BISP and Bait-ul-Mal, one option would be to merge the
two programs in 2009/10, and use at least a part of the resources for Bait-ul-Mal to scale up BISP;
another option would be to increase their complementarities.

13
2008/09–09/10 could be by 0.5–1.0 percentage points lower. With a continued strong
performance in agriculture and electricity sector reforms, which are expected to improve
supply conditions in the large-scale manufacturing, growth is projected to pick up to
4 percent in 2009/10.10 Under conservative assumptions for the remainder of 2008/09 (food
and energy prices remaining flat, and core inflation of one percent per month), year-on-year
headline inflation would decline to 10 percent by June 2009 (compared with 20 percent in the
program), and to 6.5 percent by June 2010. This accelerated pattern of disinflation will cause
average annual inflation to drop from 20 percent in 2008/09 to 6 percent in 2009/10.11

The external current account deficit is projected to narrow in 2008/09 and 2009/10,
but there are downside risks. The projected external current account in 2008/09 is slightly
better than originally envisaged, with lower imports expected to outweigh a weaker export
performance (Figure 5). A further improvement is expected in 2009/10, mainly on account of
the full-year effect of lower oil prices. However, the projected improvement in the current
account may not materialize if exports drop sharply or private transfers decline.
The financial account surplus is now expected to be slightly lower than originally
projected, due mainly to the worsening environment for foreign direct investment (FDI)
and privatization-related inflows. Disbursements of official budget support from China, a
commodity support loan from Saudi Arabia, and higher disbursements under short-term oil
import facility from the Islamic Development Bank would offset delays in disbursements
from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. In addition, net private capital flows
would be better than envisaged as the expected sharp outflow of foreign capital from the
stock market did not materialize. Consequently, the overall external balance for 2008/09 is
now projected to be better than programmed by about $500 million, whereas, despite the

The resolution of the circular debt is expected to boost electricity production, which at present is not capacityconstrained but the backlog of payments to power providers results in load-shedding. Significant investment
will be needed to increase electricity production over the medium term (see ¶33). The authorities’ plans
emphasize tapping renewable energy sources, nuclear power, and cross-border provision of electricity within
the region; see: http://www.mowp.gov.pk.
11

The expectation of a rapid decline in inflation is also reflected in the yield curve, which remains flat, while
12-month T-bills were more heavily oversubscribed in recent auctions compared to shorter-term maturities.

14
large anticipated improvement in the current account, the balance-of-payments improvement
projected for 2009/10 would be limited to $700 million because of the downward revision in
the projected official and private capital inflows.
B. Policies for the Remainder of 2008/09 and 2009/10
18.
The authorities agreed that consolidating the gains made in macroeconomic
stabilization remains the key priority. In this context, discussions focused on (i) the
appropriateness of the fiscal program and the deficit targets for 2008/09 and 2009/10; and
(ii) the monetary policy stance. The following considerations featured prominently in the
policy discussions:
•

The availability of external financing. Securing the programmed amount of external
financing (mostly privatization proceeds) for the budget will be challenging (see ¶19).
A donor conference, tentatively scheduled for April 17 in Tokyo to be co-hosted by
the Government of Japan and the World Bank, will provide an opportunity to seek
additional external assistance.

•

The scope and desirability of fiscal easing in light of the weakening economic
activity. The authorities do not see scope for relaxing the fiscal stance and have opted
for an unchanged fiscal deficit target as a cornerstone of their stabilization efforts.

•

The scope for modifications in interest rate policy. The discussions on interest rate
policy sought to balance the objectives of further reducing the still high (albeit rapidly
declining) inflation and ensuring non-SBP financing of the budget with the need to
provide adequate credit to the slowing economy. The authorities agreed that it was
premature to reduce interest rates at this stage, but saw the need to reassess interest
rates down the road in order to stimulate a pick-up in economic activity.

•

The impact of the economic downturn on the banking sector. The SBP has been
monitoring conditions in the banking sector closely; concerns arise about bank asset
quality because high interest rates and the economic slowdown have made banks
vulnerable to an increase in nonperforming loans in their corporate loan portfolio.

Fiscal policy
19.
In the near term, fiscal policy will be challenged by the shortfalls of revenue and
external financing. The slowdown in economic activity is affecting the revenue base and is
likely to result in a shortfall in the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) collections relative to the
original 2008/09 program target.12 The authorities indicated that they intended to limit this

12

January revenue data indicate that the shortfall in revenue collected by FBR has increased, but PDL collection
has been on track to meet the revised annual target. Preliminary FBR data for February indicate a further
increase in the revenue shortfall.

15
shortfall through administrative measures, including tax audits;13 additional revenues from
the PDL; and possibly the introduction of a carbon tax (SMEFP, ¶9). To help increase the
revenue-to-GDP ratio by 0.6 percentage points in 2009/10, the authorities are also planning
to broaden the tax base across all sectors of the economy, including by reducing the scope of
tax exemptions and zero-rating. However, the timing of these reforms will depend on the tax
administration’s capacity to process refunds. Other revenue measures, such as the
introduction of a carbon tax or a gross asset tax, are under discussion, but are yet to be
approved. External budget financing (including project financing) will likely fall short of the
original program projections by $1.9 billion or 1.2 percent of GDP, due mainly to the
absence of external privatization proceeds. As the global environment is not expected to
improve rapidly, a similar shortfall is projected also for 2009/10. To compensate for this, the
authorities will be seeking external bilateral support. In addition, the MoF intends to tap
nonbank sources of domestic financing, following several successful placements of Pakistan
Investment Bonds (PIBs) and Ijara Sukuks since September (SMEFP, ¶10).
20.
The authorities recognize that in the current circumstances the room for
countercyclical fiscal policy is very limited. Consequently, they remain firmly committed to
achieving the program’s original nominal fiscal deficit (excluding grants) target for 2008/09
(Rs. 562 billion, or 4.3 percent of the revised GDP—Figure 6). The fiscal deficit target for
2009/10 has been set at 3.4 percent of GDP, consistent with the fiscal effort of 0.9 percentage
point of GDP envisaged in the original program; any further adjustment would be overly
procyclical and could only be justified if the risks of higher inflation or a of resurgence of
SBP financing of the government were imminent.
21.
The authorities indicated that they stood ready to further restrain spending in case
this was necessary to offset any revenue shortfalls. To this end, the authorities had begun to
prioritize and rationalize development spending.14 Further contingency measures may need to
be identified to avoid last-minute expenditure compression in case of a larger-than-expected
revenue shortfall. Development spending for 2009/10 will be reviewed in the context of the
Medium-Term Budget Framework, which is under preparation (SMEFP, ¶16).15 Room for
expenditure cuts in other areas is very limited owing to the high share of interest and security
spending, the need to provide for adequate operation and maintenance, and increased outlays
under the strengthened social safety net (Box 4). Regarding the latter, cash transfers to the
poor are projected to increase from 0.4 percent of GDP in 2008/09 to 0.6 percent in 2009/10.
Moreover, the recently announced wheat procurement program for 2009–10 may involve
expenditures that exceed Rs. 40 billion (0.3 percent of GDP) already included in the fiscal
13

The authorities have started implementing a comprehensive auditing system, targeting in a first step about
500 large taxpayers. It is also expected that strengthening of audits will improve voluntary compliance.
14
15

About two-thirds of development spending in the 2008/09 budget are domestically-financed.

The authorities remain in close consultation with the World Bank on the rationalization of development
spending. In this regard, the MTBF is expected to take into account the recommendations of the ongoing public
expenditure review (expected to be completed in March).

16
framework for 2009/10, unless international wheat prices rebound to the current price
support level.16
Monetary Policy
22.
Discussions focused on clarifying monetary policy objectives and measures to
strengthen its effectiveness in the context of the reforms envisaged under the program.
Under crisis conditions, monetary policy has been subject to several competing pressures.
The SBP has had to use its policy discount rate to defend its international reserves position,
bring down inflation, and ensure that interest rates are high enough to encourage demand for
T-bills. At the same time, it has used OMOs to stabilize bank liquidity. Measures taken under
the program helped re-focus monetary policy on a narrower set of goals. Notably, the
adoption of the pre-announced T-bill auction calendar has de-linked government debt
management from monetary policy operations. Looking forward, the SBP staff indicated that
this, together with steps to increase the operational independence of the central bank, would
help establish short-term interest rates as the operational target and focus on price stability as
the primary monetary policy objective.17 To this effect, market conditions permitting, the
SBP intends to implement an explicit corridor for short-term interbank rates effective
August 1, 2009.
23.
The authorities and the staff agreed that at this juncture there was no clear-cut
case for an immediate change in interest rates. In the November 2008 MEFP, the
authorities had committed to considering a further increase in the discount rate in January
2009; however, given the evolving domestic and international economic situations, the SBP
did not see the need for a further increase at that point.18 At the same time, the SBP considers
it premature to reduce the discount rate at this juncture, as core inflation remains elevated. In
the discussions, the authorities hinted at the desirability of interest rate cuts—after further
progress in reducing inflation—as a countercyclical measure. Staff agreed that there was no
immediate need to increase interest rates and that current trends suggested that easing
monetary conditions might be desirable and possible, provided that international reserves
remain adequate, inflation continues to decline and the budget could be financed through
T-bill placements in the commercial banks. Staff cautioned, however, that given the expected
external financing shortfall, the authorities may need to raise more funds in the domestic
market. They also remarked that large financing needs resulting from the wheat procurement

16

The authorities envisage procurement of 6.5 million tons of wheat from the 2009 harvest (projected at
25 million tons) at the current support price of nearly $300 per ton (Rs. 950 per 40 kg). In February,
international wheat prices in official bulk transactions were between $230 and $240 per ton (FOB).
17

An interagency committee was established in January to review the proposed amendments to the SBP Act of
1956 with a view to strengthening the operational autonomy of the SBP.
18

17
program and placements of TFCs to address the circular debt issue could also hinder the
decline in interest rates.19
Exchange Rate
24.
Notwithstanding a sizable nominal depreciation in 2008, the rupee remains slightly
overvalued in real effective terms (Box 5). The real effective exchange rate (REER)
depreciated steadily over the first three quarters of 2008, but has appreciated since September
before stabilizing recently at end-2007 levels. The recent REER appreciation reflected large
inflation differentials, as well as cross currency movements of the U.S. dollar against
Pakistan’s major trading partners since September. The macroeconomic balance approach
suggests that in real effective terms the rupee is presently about 5–10 percent above the level
consistent with Pakistan’s current account deficit norm of 3.6 percent of GDP. Other
approaches point to similar results.
25.
Since the inception of the program, intervention in the foreign exchange market
has been largely aimed at achieving the NFA targets, but more recently the focus has
shifted somewhat toward exchange rate stability. Staff recommended that the
SBP continue to pursue a flexible exchange rate policy and intervene mainly to build up
official reserves. As the program NFA targets for the remainder of 2008/09 appear well
within reach, the SBP was encouraged to accumulate higher than programmed international
reserves as a safety cushion against heightened risks to the balance-of-payments outlook. The
authorities generally agreed with the staff’s recommendation, but noted that setting overambitious reserve targets may adversely affect market expectations, given the increased
uncertainty about balance-of-payment flows (including from official sources). Staff
cautioned about creating firm expectations of exchange rate stability, and noted that
excessive focus on exchange rate stability may clash with the introduction of the explicit
interest rate corridor.
Financial sector issues
26.
The authorities recognized the importance of risks from the deteriorating economic
outlook and the need to continue monitoring developments in the banking system very
closely. Credit concentration among a few borrowers is a source of concern and stress tests
clearly identified a deterioration in credit quality as an important risk, that may materialize as
a result of the economic downturn, as it did in other countries. It was noted that the
legislative changes aimed at strengthening the SBP’s enforcement powers and the new
bankruptcy law under preparation will contribute to enhancing financial sector stability
(SMEFP, ¶26).

19

Nonetheless, using TFCs to regularize the energy sector companies’ relations with commercial banks is a
positive development from the point of view of bank liquidity and credit availability.

and higher than Sri Lanka’s, but below
export growth in China and India.
The Pakistani rupee is assessed to be slightly above equilibrium using CGER estimates.
In real effective terms, the rupee is now close to its 2007 level, despite a large nominal
depreciation against the U.S. dollar in 2008. Its more recent appreciation is less significant than
that of most of its neighbors, and reflects in large part high inflation differentials with trading
partners. The macroeconomic balance (MB) approach suggests that the current level of real
exchange rate is about 5–10 percent above the level consistent with the equilibrium current
account deficit (“current account norm”) of around 3.6 percent of GDP. Preliminary estimates
based on the equilibrium real exchange rate approach suggest that the rupee is around
2 percent above equilibrium. The external sustainability approach estimates that in real
effective terms, the rupee is about 7 percent above the value needed for the current account
deficit to decline to the level that stabilizes the ratio of Pakistan’s net foreign liabilities to GDP
at its 2007 level.1

27.
The discussions also focused on measures adopted recently by the SBP to help
corporate borrowers service their debt to commercial banks. Specifically, the SBP has
announced a relief package for the industrial sector (mainly textiles) that allows the banks
and development finance institutions (DFIs) to defer for one year the repayment of principal
outstanding under Export-Oriented Projects schemes, including the Debt Swap Facility and
the Long-Term Financing Facility (LTFF). Subsequently, the SBP also offered similar relief
for the refinancing of loans under the SBP Export Finance Scheme (EFS). Staff cautioned the
SBP on expanding the scope of its quasi-fiscal operations by relaxing the rules governing
these schemes, and stressed the need for increased transparency in this area.
28.
The authorities have also eased some regulatory provisions to help banks amortize
the losses incurred during the KSE closure (SMEFP, ¶27–28). Staff expressed concern
about a loosening of prudential regulations at a time when the economic downturn is likely to
put stress on banks’ financial positions.
C. Exchange Restrictions and Trade Policy
29.
Cash margins on letters of credit give rise to an exchange restriction. A measure
establishing cash margin requirements on LCs for certain imports had been introduced in
May 2008, prior to the approval of the SBA. This measure was recently modified to apply to
LCs for imports of goods that were not previously subject to such requirements. Staff
concluded that the imposition of cash margin requirements on LCs gives rise to an exchange
restriction subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a) and that the recent
modification of this measure results in an intensification of this restriction and in a breach of
the continuous performance criterion against imposing or intensifying exchange restrictions.
The authorities have been working with staff to address this matter and will issue a regulation
to reverse this intensification by end-June 2009. On this basis, the authorities request a
waiver for the nonobservance of the continuous performance criterion.
30.
Pakistan’s trade policy has been mainly geared towards export diversification in the
nontraditional sector, by reducing the cost of doing business and enhancing productivity and
competitiveness in manufacturing. The government has also made efforts to enhance market
access for Pakistan’s exports—particularly to development partners. Recent initiatives
include duty free access to the U.S. market for goods manufactured in the designated
Reconstruction Opportunity Zones, and more preferential access to the EU market.
D. Safeguards Assessment and AML/CFT Issues
31.
The Safeguards Assessment update is substantially completed. The update report
indicates that the operational environment at the SBP has been strengthened since the last
assessment, but that action is needed to address the absence of operational independence and
to enhance controls over program data reporting. The safeguards assessment also pointed to
the need to improve further the SBP’s financial control systems. SBP staff acknowledged
these concerns, which will be addressed gradually. Specifically, an inter-agency committee will

20
complete its work on how to strengthen the operational independence of the SBP by endApril 2009, and a new central bank law will be submitted to Parliament by December 2009.
The SBP is also planning changes in the voting structure of its Audit Committee, steps to
enhance internal controls, and the establishment of a Board committee to centralize risk
management. SBP staff had some reservations regarding the implications of the International
Financial Reporting Standards features that have not yet been adopted in Pakistan. In
particular, they expressed concern that mark-to-market valuation requirements could expose
the SBP to pressures for transferring unrealized profits to the budget. However, necessary
mechanisms to preclude such distribution are proposed to be included in the forthcoming
amendment of the SBP Act.
32.
Pakistan faces significant risks of money laundering and terrorism financing.
Several steps have been taken to strengthen its anti money laundering and combating of
financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regime, but the scope of preventive measures needs to be
expanded and enforcement should be more stringent. An Anti-Money Laundering Ordinance
has been promulgated, a financial intelligence unit has been established, and a wide range of
terrorism financing activities have been criminalized. The regulations issued by the SBP and
the Securities and Exchange Commission provide a good basis to improve protection against
money laundering and terrorism financing and enhance transparency. However, further
efforts are needed to establish the autonomy of money laundering offenses and complete the
list of predicate offences, Also the criminalization of financing of terrorism organizations
(other than prohibited ones) remains ambiguous and the scope for freezing assets is too
narrow. Further, available legal powers to prosecute money laundering and terrorism
financing are not being properly used.
E. Medium-Term Outlook and Debt-Sustainability Analysis
33.
The authorities laid out an ambitious medium-term framework but recognized that
the economic downturn will delay the transition toward the targeted growth path. Real
GDP growth is projected to recover to 4 percent next year, and to 7 percent a year by
2013/14. Headline inflation is expected to decline rapidly to 6 percent by 2009/10. The
current account deficit is envisaged to narrow to more sustainable levels as fiscal
consolidation continues and the real effective exchange rate adjusts gradually to its
equilibrium level. This, together with improved market access, a recovery in foreign direct
investment, and increased financing from official sources would enable the SBP to maintain
the reserve cover of about three months of imports over the medium term. Growth will be
sustained by structural reforms and increased public investment, especially in the energy
sector, and improved access to water for agriculture. With the current account adjustment
dictated by external sustainability constraints, much of the investment will be financed from
domestic sources. It is assumed that mobilization of private savings, in combination with a
considerable increase in the revenue-to-GDP ratio (see below), will permit a significant
increase in domestic investment, which would be facilitated by well-targeted public
investment, public-private partnerships, and improved financial intermediation.

21
34.
A significant increase in revenue as a share of GDP remains the cornerstone of the
medium-term framework. In this regard, the introduction of a broad-based VAT, which
constitutes the most important tax policy reform, is scheduled for 2010/11. An increase in the
revenue-to-GDP ratio to above 14 percent of GDP by 2013/14, together with a sharp
reduction in subsidies and ill-targeted development spending, would be needed to create
fiscal space for high quality public investment and an adequate increase in outlays on poverty
reduction. In the context of the 2009/10 budget preparation cycle, the authorities are working
on their first fully-fledged Medium-Term Budget Framework (MTBF); this should strengthen
the predictability of funding and bring credibility and stability to their budget plans. The
authorities intend to use the MTBF to determine the development budget envelope in the
context of well-specified and fully-costed programs, including those aimed at alleviating
poverty, as described in Pakistan’s second Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (SMEFP, ¶16).
35.
Pakistan’s debt dynamics did not change substantially compared with the
assessment made at the time of approval of the SBA (Appendix I). Under the baseline
scenario, the external debt outlook has improved slightly as a result of the lower current
account deficits but the debt trajectory remains unchanged. Domestic public debt is expected
to rise somewhat owing to lower privatization proceeds.
36.
Downside risks to the relatively benign debt sustainability outlook are significant.
The external debt ratios are sensitive to higher current account deficits, lower FDI inflows,
and large exchange rate depreciation. Domestic debt ratios are sensitive to shocks to the
primary fiscal balance, growth, and interest rates, as well as to contingent fiscal liabilities
that could arise during the projection period.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
37.
Pakistan’s stabilization program is on track. Fiscal consolidation and improved
coherence between fiscal and monetary policies are bringing under control the factors that
led to large imbalances in recent years. As a result, headline inflation has declined, the
exchange rate has been broadly stable, the international reserve position has strengthened,
and the demand for treasury bills has rebounded. Performance under the program has been
satisfactory, and all the quantitative performance criteria through December 2008 were met.
38.
Structural reforms have progressed broadly as envisaged. A contingency plan for
handling problem banks has been prepared and is being strengthened; an action plan to
reform tax policy and administration has been adopted and will be implemented with
technical assistance from the IMF and the World Bank; and tariff differential electricity
subsidies will be fully eliminated by the end of June 2009. The authorities have also designed
a plan to address the stock of circular debt, which should ease the constraints on economic
growth originating in the energy sector. Stronger incentives are needed to arrest the accrual
of circular debt.

22
39.
Looking ahead, with the weaker global outlook and slower domestic activity, the
risks to Pakistan’s economic and financial prospects have risen notably. While Pakistan is
benefiting from the decline in petroleum prices and the external current account deficit is
narrowing, the decline in the demand for exports and uncertainty about workers’ remittances
are important risks to the external outlook. Weakening bank credit to the private sector and
dimmer prospects for external private finance are also constraining growth. Political risk is
also higher.
40.
Fiscal policy has come along well, but remains under pressure. Staff recognizes that
the fiscal targets for December 2008/09 were met with great effort under difficult
circumstances. Staff commends the authorities for adhering to the program’s fiscal target for
2008/09 and the fiscal adjustment for 2009/10. The fiscal program for these two years,
however, contains ambitious revenue targets in the context of slowing economic activity. The
widening revenue shortfall in the third quarter of 2008/09 suggests that meeting the revised
revenue target for 2008/09 will be challenging. Accordingly, an early identification of
additional contingent revenue and expenditure measures would help avoid the need for a
sharp last-minute expenditure compression.
41.
There is a pressing need to strengthen the social safety net. Social protection is a
key element of the authorities’ program. The roll-out of the scorecard system under the BISP
has started, and the number of families benefiting from BISP cash transfers should increase
considerably in the coming two fiscal years. Looking ahead, it is important to review the
other components of the social safety net to identify overlaps and gaps in the system.
Consideration could also be given to merging the cash transfer component of the Bait-ul-Mal
system with the BISP, as well as eliminating gaps and overlaps between the federal and
provincial programs to free resources for scaling up BISP.
42.
Over the medium term, higher budget revenues are critical for creating fiscal space
for development and social spending. Government revenue are low by international
standards, which constrains capital accumulation, spending on maintenance, and social
outlays. Against this background, a vigorous implementation of the government’s ambitious
tax reform agenda is essential. Specifically, the replacement of the General Sales Tax with a
broad-based VAT in 2010/11 is a key reform. The establishment of the MTBF will also be an
important step for strengthening the public finances.
43.
The SBP’s monetary policy stance is appropriate, and needs to remain flexible to
address risks. Staff agrees with the authorities’ intention to keep interest rates on hold for the
time being in order to lock in the gains made in lowering inflation and avoid financial
pressures. Looking ahead, there should be scope for lowering interest rates, provided that
inflation continues to decline, international reserves are further strengthened, and the
government avoids recourse to SBP financing.

23
44.
The envisaged strengthening of the SBP’s policy framework is welcome. Looking
forward, the SBP will need to ensure that the introduction of the explicit interest rate corridor
does not constrain the objective of strengthening its external international reserve position. In
addition, the operational independence of the SBP needs to be enhanced, and its quasi-fiscal
operations should be transparently accounted for and eventually eliminated.
45.
The AML/CFT regime is not yet effective. To ensure its effectiveness, Pakistan
should prepare a ML/FT risk analysis, adopt a national AML/CFT strategy, and consolidate
the institutional framework.
46.
Exchange rate flexibility should continue to facilitate external adjustment. The
CGER estimates suggest that the Pakistani rupee is slightly overvalued. Arguably, the
exchange rate has been too stable recently, and more flexibility may be needed in the future
to deal with uncertain inflows. Intervention needs to remain largely geared to achieving the
program’s NFA targets but, conditions permitting, any excess NFA accumulation will
constitute a useful self-insurance against risks to the balance-of-payments outlook.
47.
Pakistan’s financial system has weathered the crisis thus far, but needs to be
monitored carefully. The FSAP stress tests and the authorities’ own updates are encouraging.
Nevertheless, with the slowing in economic activity and rising NPLs, the risks to the system
are rising. In this connection, the recent formulation of plans for dealing with problem banks
is welcome. At the same time, care should be taken that the changes introduced to the
regulatory framework and the extension of the refinancing period under the SBP’s discount
credit schemes do not prevent a timely assessment of potential problems and result in
unintended regulatory forbearance.
48.
Pakistan needs additional external assistance to reduce risks and provide some
scope for countercyclical policies by allowing greater development and social spending.
The program is financed for 2008/09 and 2009/10, but financing constraints leave little room
for countercyclical spending. The upcoming donor meeting provides an important
opportunity for mobilizing additional assistance.
49.
In light of performance to date and the policy intentions expressed by the
authorities in the attached LOI and SMEFP, staff recommends the completion of the first
review under the SBA. Noting the authorities’ commitment to reverse by end-June 2009 the
intensification of the exchange restriction related to cash margin requirements on LCs for
certain imports, staff supports the authorities’ request for a waiver of nonobservance of the
continuous performance criterion against imposing or intensifying exchange restrictions as
the measure giving rise to the restriction is minor and temporary.
50.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation for Pakistan take place within
24 months subject to the provisions of the decision on consultation cycles in program
countries.

APPENDIX I. PAKISTAN: DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
A. External Debt Sustainability Analysis
1.
Pakistan’s external debt burden has been relatively moderate in recent years as a
result of successive debt relief undertaken in the late 1990s and early 2000s. At end
FY 2007/08, external debt stock stood at around 26½ percent of GDP (Table 1), and debt
service was about 15 percent of exports of goods and services. Most of its debt were public
sector debt—owed largely to official creditors, and there were limited private sector debt.
2.
The debt ratio is projected to rise temporarily due to significant increase in external
financing from official creditors (including the Fund) to help Pakistan with the recent
balance of payments pressure. The debt stock would be around 32½ percent of GDP during
2008/09–2010/11, and then gradually decline about 27½ percent of GDP by 2013/14.
3.
The debt service burden would increase but remain manageable during the
projection period. Debt service as a ratio of exports of goods and receipts is projected to
increase to 20 percent under the baseline scenario. This increase is sizable but debt service
burden will decline markedly following repurchase of outstanding Fund credits.
4.
The relatively benign debt outlook under the baseline scenario is subject to serious
downside risks. They include risks from higher non-interest current account deficit, lower
growth, higher depreciation, higher interest rates, as well as lower FDI flows (Figure 1). The
standard bound tests show that debt ratios are sensitive to shocks to higher current account
deficits, large depreciation of exchange rate, and lower FDI inflows given the large financing
needs. For example, if non-interest current account deficits are higher by half of the ten-year
standard deviation, the debt as a ratio to GDP would rise sharply and be over 10 percentage
points higher than under the baseline scenario. Combined shocks to growth, current account,
and depreciation could vault the end-period debt stock to around 45 percent of GDP,
significantly higher than under the baseline scenario.
B. Public Sector Debt Sustainability Analysis
5.
Pakistan’s public sector debt burden declined through 2006/07, but has been rising
since then, reflecting the expansionary fiscal stance. At end FY 2007/08, the public sector
debt stock stood at 57.4 percent of GDP (Table 2), with domestic public debt (31.2 percent of
GDP) slightly exceeding external public debt (26.2 percent of GDP). Interest payments
(4.7 percent of GDP) are a significant burden for the budget, accounting for 32.6 percent of
total revenue (excluding grants) and 26.3 percent of current expenditures. Interest payments
on domestic debt accounted for only 12 percent of total interest expenditure, partially
reflecting that official creditors account for the bulk of total external debt.
6.
The public debt ratio is projected to decline gradually, reflecting fiscal
consolidation and lower interest rates in line with macroeconomic stabilization. The stock

46
of external public debt will increase temporarily in 2008/09 owing to external financing from
official creditors (including the Fund) to address Pakistan’s recent balance of payments
pressure. The total stock of public debt is projected to decline gradually to 47½ percent of
GDP by 2013/14.
7.
The burden of interest payments on the budget would be halved. The ratio of
interest payments to total revenue (excluding grants) would decline from 31 percent in
2008/09 to 14 percent in 2013/14, despite an increase in interest expenditure on external
public debt by about 65 percent in U.S. dollar terms.
8.
The relatively benign outlook for public sector debt under the baseline scenario is
subject to significant downside risks. The standard bound tests show that risks from shocks
resulting from higher interest rates or lower growth are moderate, as they would slow down
rather then reverse the medium-term decline in the public debt ratio (Figure 2). However, a
primary balance shock as well as a 30 percent devaluation and a contingent liabilities shock
would lead to a perceptible increase in the public debt ratio.

g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency
(e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Exports and imports of goods and services
7/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP)
remain at their levels of the last projection year.

ATTACHMENT I. PAKISTAN: LETTER OF INTENT
March 16, 2009
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
The Pakistani authorities held discussions with Fund staff for the first review under the
Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) and the 2009 Article IV consultation. Based on these
discussions, we have updated our economic program for the remainder of 2008/09 and
2009/10, as reflected in the attached Supplementary Memorandum of Economic and
Financial Policies (SMEFP). In support of this program, our authorities request the Executive
Board of the Fund completes the first review and approve the second purchase under the
SBA of SDR 568.54 million.
Although our economic stabilization program is off to a good start, we are fully aware of the
challenges ahead. The sharply deteriorating global environment will affect Pakistan’s
domestic economy, trade, and external financing. The government believes that the policies
set out in the attached SMEFP are adequate to achieve the objectives of the program.
However, it stands ready to take additional measures appropriate for this purpose, and will
consult with the Fund in accordance with the policies of the Fund on such consultations. The
Government of Pakistan will provide the Fund with information it may request to monitor
progress in implementing its economic and financial policies.
We have recently modified cash margin requirements on letters of credit for certain imports,
which resulted in nonobservance of the continuous performance criterion against imposing or
intensifying exchange restrictions. We will issue a regulation to eliminate this restriction by
end-June, 2009 and, on this basis, we request a waiver of nonobservance for the missed
performance criterion.
We also consent to the publication of this letter, the attached SMEFP, the addendum to the
Technical Memorandum of Understanding, and the related staff report.
Sincerely yours,
/s/
Shaukat Tarin
Advisor to the Prime Minister on Finance,
Revenue, Economic Affairs and Statistics

ATTACHMENT II. PAKISTAN: SUPPLEMENTARY MEMORANDUM ON ECONOMIC AND
FINANCIAL POLICIES FOR 2008/09–2009/10
March 16, 2009
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This memorandum supplements our Memorandum on Economic and Financial
Policies (MEFP) for 2008/09–09/10 of November 20, 2008. It describes policy
implementation to date and lays out additional policies agreed in the context of the first
review under the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA).
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
2.
Our stabilization program is off to a positive start. Headline inflation has
decreased from 25 to 20½ percent, the exchange rate has been broadly stable, the
international reserves position has strengthened and, following the November discount rate
increase, demand for Treasury bills has rebounded. All quantitative performance criteria
through end-December 2008 (Table 1) were met and the implementation of the structural
reform agenda is broadly on track (Table 2).
3.
The deteriorating global economy is posing additional challenges for Pakistan.
The world economy has slowed more quickly than envisaged, reducing demand for exports
and carrying a risk of declining capital flows. Further, domestic economic activity has
weakened. As a result both internal and external factors have made the environment for our
economic stabilization program less favorable.
4.
There are pressures on the budget. As a result of the slowdown in imports and
domestic demand, budget revenues have been lower than projected in the first half of
2008/09 and this trend is expected to continue, however, this was largely offset by revenues
from Petroleum Development Levy (PDL). Disbursement of multilateral program financing
has been slow and projected privatization receipts for the 2008/09 budget are unlikely to
materialize.
5.
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has tightened the monetary stance to reduce
inflation and strengthen the external position. Increased confidence and improved terms
of trade have helped stabilize the rupee at around Rs. 80 per U.S. dollar since mid-October
2008 and enabled the SBP to rebuild its gross international reserves to $6.9 billion at
end-January, well above target.
III. POLICIES FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2008/09 AND FOR 2009/10
6.
The government and the SBP remain committed to address Pakistan’s economic
problems despite the challenges posed by the global economic and financial crisis.
Consolidating macroeconomic stabilization is essential for the economy, and financing
constraints leave little room for countercyclical fiscal policy to counter slowing economic
activity given the inherited economic imbalances. Hence, although growth is expected to be

53
lower, and inflation is trending downwards, policies will continue to be geared to reducing
the fiscal deficit, lowering inflation, and strengthening the external position. Nevertheless,
improving and expanding the social safety net will continue to be central to the program.
These policies will set the stage for higher investment and growth over the medium term and
ensure vulnerable groups are protected. The success of our program also hinges on timely
and generous support from the international community.
7.

The program is built around the following revised economic parameters:
•

Real GDP growth of 2½ percent in 2008/09 and 4 percent in the following
year;

•

Annual average consumer price inflation of 20 percent in 2008/09 and
6 percent in 2009/10; and

•

A current account deficit of 6 percent of GDP in 2008/09 and 4½ percent in
2009/10.
A. Fiscal Policy

8.
We plan to maintain the path of fiscal adjustment in 2008/09–09/10. Our budget
deficit target for 2008/09 remains unchanged. The shortfall in tax revenue will be
compensated by additional revenue and expenditure measures to achieve an unchanged
deficit target of Rs. 562 billion (4.3 percent of revised GDP). Fiscal consolidation will
continue in 2009/10; the budget deficit is to be reduced by 0.9 percentage points to
3.4 percent of GDP. This consolidation is facilitated by the elimination of the fuel and
electricity subsidies in 2008/09. Further, tax policy measures and the ambitious tax
administration reform will increase the revenue and assure achievement of the 2009/10
deficit target, while creating fiscal space for strengthening our social safety net.
9.
Revenue effort will play a key role in achieving the deficit target. The Federal
Board of Revenue is targeting collection of Rs. 1,300 billion (10.0 percent of revised GDP)
in 2008/09 including an additional yield of Rs. 65 billion on account of stepped-up auditing
and enforcement. The authorities are also considering the levy of a carbon tax. Any shortfall
in tax revenues will be compensated by revenues from the PDL, tax administration measures,
and expenditure control measures.
10.
The government will use non-SBP domestic sources to meet its financing needs.
This approach is based on careful advance planning of quarterly budgetary borrowing
requirements. Moreover, the Ministry of Finance (MoF) has taken several measures, in
coordination with the SBP, to expand and enhance available financing options for the budget.
To this end the MoF also successfully issued three Ijara Sukuks, 3 to 30 year tenor Pakistan
Investment Bond, and interest rates on National Savings Scheme instruments have been
increased, which have resulted in significant extra demand. In addition, T-bill auctions have
been successful with significant reductions in the cut-off yields.
11.
Treasury-bill auction management has improved. To increase transparency and
planning, Treasury-bill auction calendars were issued in November and December, and will

54
continue to be issued on a quarterly basis. As a step toward separation of public debt
management from monetary policy operations, a volume-based auction approach has been
adopted. Pre-announced auction volume targets will be observed and the accepted amount
will generally be in line with the target to provide market participants with confidence to plan
their investment. This approach complements the government’s planning of its budgetary
borrowing requirement and facilitates liquidity management by the SBP.
12.
Strengthening the social safety net is a key program objective. To this end, a
poverty scorecard has been adopted to improve targeting of the Benazir Income Support
Program (BISP).
•

The roll-out of the scorecard system for the selection of beneficiary families has started,
and is expected to be completed in 16 districts as a pilot program by end-May 2009. The
roll-out of the scorecard to all 130 districts is planned to be completed between
December 2009 and June 2010. As the roll-out of BISP turned out to be more
complicated than originally envisaged, BISP disbursements did not take place in the first
half of the fiscal year. However, we have now approved 1.5 million beneficiary families
using the pre-scorecard targeting system and expect to disburse the budgeted amount of
Rs. 34 billion. In addition, we are continuing the implementation of Bait-ul-Mal with a
budget of Rs. 6.7 billion and the province of Punjab has commenced its own cash transfer
program with an envelope of Rs. 17 billion in FY 2008/09. The Small Public Works
Programs of Rs. 28 billion also provide a social safety net for the rural and urban poor
through small-scale employment opportunities.

•

Looking forward, the number of families benefiting from BISP cash transfers will be
increased to 5 million in 2009/10 using the new scorecard system, implying budgetary
expenditure of Rs. 65 billion. For 2010/11, an increase in the number of beneficiary
households to 7 million is envisaged. In addition, the province of Punjab is expected to
continue its own program in FY 2009/10. The government is also considering reforming
other components of the social safety net system, including the merger of the cash
transfer component of Bait-ul-Mal with the BISP.

13.
An action plan to strengthen tax administration was adopted in January and
steps to improve revenue collection have already been taken. Most notably, the sales tax
and income tax administrations were integrated on functional lines at the HQ level to
enhance the effectiveness of tax administration. The full integration at the field level will be
completed by end-December 2009. A detailed integration plan is being prepared as stipulated
in the Action Plan. Other measures include the introduction of a unique tax payer
identification number, strengthening of the Large Taxpayer Unit, and improved tax audits.
The World Bank is providing technical assistance to implement further tax administration
reforms, including strengthening of the refunds system for the General Sales Tax (GST).
14.
The government is pursuing a major tax reform agenda. A key step will be the
replacement, starting in 2010/11, of the GST with a broad-based VAT. At the same time, the
government is exploring options to increase revenue in 2009/10. In particular, sales, excise,

55
and income tax laws will be reviewed to minimize exemptions and zero-rating. The timing of
these reforms hinges on the capacity of the tax administration to process refunds. To support
tax policy reforms, the government has requested Fund and World Bank technical assistance.
15.
The MoF has taken measures to strengthen payment control while work on a
Single Treasury Account is progressing. A key improvement is the introduction of a
system preventing accumulation of unspent balances in accounts outside the Federal
Consolidated Fund (FCF). All new budget releases are made through assignment accounts
that are part of the FCF. To avoid destabilizing outflow of deposits from the banking system,
remaining unspent balances (outside the FCF) will be allowed to be gradually reduced and
eliminated. This process will take longer than earlier expected and will not be completed by
June 30, 2009.
16.
The MoF is working to establish a Medium-Term Budget Framework (MTBF).
A calendar for the preparation of the MTBF has been established and the initiating document
for medium-term budget preparation has been submitted to line Ministries. The MTBF will
be submitted to the Cabinet in March/April 2009 together with the draft strategy paper. The
document will provide a framework for the budget process, inform its strategic directions,
establish resource envelopes, and identify policy reforms needed to fulfill the medium term
fiscal consolidation objectives.
17.
In collaboration with the World Bank, the government has finalized a schedule
for electricity tariff adjustments to eliminate tariff differential subsidies by end-June,
2009. As a first step under this plan, tariffs were increased by 1 percent effective
February 1, 2009. Tariffs will be raised further to result in a cumulative increase of 4 percent
by end-June. Changes in the fuel cost component of electricity tariffs (the fuel adjustment
surcharge) will continue to be reviewed on a monthly basis and adjusted as needed. The
Asian Development Bank is also supporting power sector reforms jointly with the World
Bank.
18.
We plan to resolve inter-corporate debt in the energy sector (circular debt). As a
first step, we have prepared an issue of government-guaranteed Term Financing Certificates
by Pakistan Electric Power Company (PEPCO) to settle amounts it owed to banks and
suppliers. Further, we are preparing a plan to address ongoing losses on account of
operational and collection losses of distribution companies, PEPCO and an independent
power producer.
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
19.
Monetary policy will aim at lowering inflation. The SBP will calibrate monetary
policy to balance concerns about the slowdown in economic activity, subject to the overall
objective of lowering inflation. Provided that the expected decline in inflation materializes
and market confidence remains positive, there could be scope for a more accommodative
monetary policy stance. However, the SBP stands ready to adjust policies if inflation
resurges or if international reserves come under pressure. We will continue to avoid SBP
financing of the budget.

56
20.
The SBP will further improve its monetary policy framework. Market conditions
permitting, the SBP remains committed to introduce in July 2009 an explicit corridor for
overnight money market rate to enhance market signaling, strengthen the effectiveness of
liquidity management, and reduce volatility in short-term market interest rates (see ¶19 in the
MEFP). Use of an explicit interest rate corridor in support of the operational target will
improve the transmission of a change in the policy rate (SBP discount rate) to the economy
and so help achieve the objective of price stability.
21.
The SBP will continue to pursue a flexible exchange rate policy. The exchange
rate will continue to reflect market conditions and facilitate adjustments to achieve a
sustainable external balance and macroeconomic stability. Interventions will be largely
aimed at achieving the program's net foreign asset targets. The flexible exchange rate policy
will be facilitated by phasing out SBP provision of foreign exchange for oil imports,
according to the schedule in the program. As a first step, the SBP has ceased providing
foreign exchange for the import of furnace oil as of February 1, 2009.
C. Financial Sector and Safeguards Issues
22.
Stress tests by the Financial Sector Assessment Program Update mission, using
June 2008 data, and updated by the SBP using September data, indicated that banking
system in general was resilient. Most banks, including all large banks, would remain
solvent, but some non-systemic banks would face insolvency under a severe crisis scenario.
The capital injection needed to restore the capital adequacy ratio of the twelve largest banks
to the minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratio of 8 percent was 2.3 percent of GDP in the
worst case scenario. This relatively low level reflects the low credit-to-GDP ratio and the
relatively high capital buffers. The main sources of risk for the vulnerable banks were a
major deterioration in credit quality, mainly in the textile industry and exposure to the equity
market. Default of the largest exposures put significant strains on solvency given the large
concentration of exposures in some banks. The SBP has obtained similar results on the basis
of end-September data. A few banks representing less than 10 percent of system assets face
financial pressures, which are being addressed by the SBP and their owners through mergers
or fresh injection of equity. Progress by these banks in resolving their problems is being
monitored closely by the SBP.
23.
The financial sector has so far weathered the storm well, but the outlook calls for
careful monitoring. Provisional figures for December 2008 show gross non-performing
loans (NPLs) have increased from 7.7 percent of total loans in June 2008 to 9.1 percent in
December 2008, while net NPLs to net loans increased from 1.3 to 2.5 percent in the same
period. However, the capital position of the banking system has improved, with the capital
adequacy increasing from 12.1 to 12.2 percent of risk-weighted assets.
24.
Measures to improve banking resolution and banking supervision are being
implemented. In December 2008, the SBP adopted a problem bank management and
contingency plan for dealing with problem banks. The document includes criteria for
liquidity support, assessment of bank problems, criteria for use of scarce resources,

57
assessment of existing legal powers and intervention procedures. The effectiveness of the
SBP’s powers to enforce its banking supervision policies will also be strengthened and
amendments to the banking legislation to this end have been drafted and will be submitted to
Parliament before end-June 2009.
25.
A draft revision of the SBP law has been prepared and it will form the basis for
strengthening the operational independence of the central bank. The recently established
inter-agency committee, which includes the MoF, is expected to propose measures to
strengthen the operational independence of the SBP, based on the draft SBP law, by
end-April 2009. A new central bank law will be submitted to Parliament by December
2009.
26.
A new bankruptcy law is under preparation. It will help rehabilitation of viable
companies and expeditious resolution of other highly indebted companies thus paving way
for banks to clear their long outstanding loans. A review committee is finalizing the draft law
which it will submit to the MoF by end-July 2009.
27.
The SBP has adjusted the rules on collateral and valuation of securities.
Regarding recognition of Forced Sale Value (FSV) of certain collateral, in 2007, SBP
withdrew the benefit of the FSV for determining provisioning requirements in order to create
a cushion in the balance sheet of banks. Recognition of FSV of collateral is permissible in
most countries. In 2009, SBP has allowed partially the FSV benefit (up to 30 percent) of
pledged stock as well as residential and commercial properties. Regarding valuation of
securities, the imposition of a floor on the stock prices at stock exchanges last August,
impeded price discovery for 3½ months in 2008. Accordingly, the Securities and Exchange
Commission of Pakistan (SECP) allowed companies to delay recognition of any losses on
securities (available for sale) in their income statements until end-December 2009. Losses
need to be recognized immediately in capital positions, without routing them through their
income statements. Any gains or delays in loss recognition from this treatment cannot be
used to pay cash or stock dividends. Further, companies are also required to gradually
realize losses in their income statement on quarterly basis and ensure full realization of the
impairment by end-2009. SBP has allowed the banks the option to follow instructions issued
by SECP regarding recognition of impairment on their capital position, but encouraged early
recognition in income statements.
28.
The National Investment Trust’s State Enterprise Fund (NITSEF), created to
take advantage of market conditions to invest in eight government-owned/controlled
companies, has begun its operations. It has an initial capital of Rs. 20 billion. The
participating institutions comprise banks, the State Life Insurance Company and the
Employees Old Age Benefits Institution, which lent funds to NITSEF against a government
guarantee. As of mid-February, the NITSEF had invested Rs. 7 billion. The NITSEF makes
its purchases through the Stock Exchange at best available price. It will disclose its financial
statements, investment strategy, and purchases on a quarterly basis on a dedicated website.

58
29.
The safeguards assessments of the SBP’s financial control systems pointed to the
need to improve SBP’s internal controls further. It recommended changes in the voting
structure of the Audit Committee, improving internal controls, and establishing a Board
committee to centralize risk management across all bank activities. The SBP intends to
implement changes in these areas to change the voting structure of its Audit Committee in
April 2009, to improve its internal controls by end-June 2009, and establish a Board
Committee to centralize risk management by end-December 2009.
IV. PROGRAM RISKS AND MONITORING
30.
The program remains subject to considerable risks. The economic situation in
trading partner countries could deteriorate further and result in lower demand for exports,
workers’ remittances, and private capital flows. The recovery of domestic and external
demand could take longer than anticipated, which would further undermine the revenue
targets. As economic activity weakens, the risks to the domestic financial sector increase.
31.
The program will remain subject to quarterly program reviews and quarterly
performance criteria as specified in Table 1 for the remainder of 2008/09. The attached
addendum to the Technical Memorandum of Understanding adds a definition of external
payments arrears and provides for reporting of information on new liabilities incurred or
guaranteed by the government in settling the circular debt, The adjustors, defined in the
TMU, dated November 20, 2008, remain applicable.
V. PROGRAM FINANCING
32.
The program requires additional financing to reduce its risks and enhance
growth prospects. As noted, while the program is financed for 2008/09, financing
constraints leave little room for countercyclical policy and there is a need for additional
financing to finance social safety expenditure, development spending and enhanced security
needs. The upcoming donor meeting in late March/April is pivotal for mobilizing additional
financing, supporting our adjustment efforts, and reducing risks to the program.

Exchange System

On May 19, 1999, the dual exchange rate system was unified, with all international
transactions conducted at the interbank market exchange rate (FIBR). The Fund classifies
Pakistan’s exchange rate regime as floating. Pakistan has accepted the obligations of
Article VIII. It maintains a restriction subject to F7und approval in the form of a 25 percent
limit on advance payments for imports of goods and various cash margin requirements
imposed on letters of credit.

Last Article IV Consultation

The last Article IV consultation (Country Report 08/21) was discussed by the
Executive Board on December 17, 2007.
IX.

Safeguards Assessments

In accordance with the Fund’s safeguard assessment policy, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP)
was subject to a full safeguards assessment under the Stand-By Arrangement that was
approved in November 2008. This update assessment included a safeguard mission to the
SBP in late January 2009. The assessment found improved transparency of the audited
financial statements, coupled with stronger governance oversight by the Central Board and
the Audit Committee. The SBP embarked on a modernization program that saw the
implementation of a new organization structure, IT systems, and the recruitment of a
qualified professional staff. However, prompt action is needed to safeguard central bank
independence via amending the SBP Act, and expedite its transition to the inter-agency group
formed by the authorities to facilitate its enactment. Also, staff noted the need to strengthen
controls over program data reporting to the Fund through an independent review mechanism.

ANNEX II. PAKISTAN: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
Thomas Buckley, Senior Country Officer, Telephone: (202) 473-0075
1.
Pakistan is among the largest recipients of World Bank financial assistance. In
FY2007, World Bank support to Pakistan totaled US$985 million, making it the seventh
largest borrower in the world. The World Bank Group program in Pakistan consists of an
integrated package of financial support, including IBRD lending, concessional IDA credits
and IFC investments, along with complementary analytical and advisory services.
2.
The Bank Group’s Board of Directors endorsed a new Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) for Pakistan on June 1, 2006, covering fiscal years 2006 through 2009. The CAS
outlines the Bank’s strategic approach to helping Pakistan achieve its development goals over
a four-year period. Despite recent good economic performance, Pakistan’s development
challenges remain formidable. The strategy addresses the key challenge of sustaining rapid
growth in order to further reduce poverty. This will require accelerating human development
so that the poor can participate in and benefit from growth. Sustained growth will also require
sound macroeconomic management along with improvements in the investment climate,
including regulatory reform and significant investment in infrastructure.
3.

The CAS is designed around three main pillars:

•
Sustained Growth and Improved Competitiveness: The principal focus of this
pillar will be to support investments and reforms needed to improve the business
environment for trade and investment and sustain rapid, private sector–led growth. The Bank
will provide support to key sectors such as agriculture and infrastructure, and help the
government strengthen macroeconomic management through improving public expenditures
and supporting ongoing tax reforms.
•
Strengthened Governance and Service Delivery: Priorities in this area will be to
support further reforms and investment to increase efficiency, transparency, and
accountability in the use of public resources, while supporting cross-cutting reforms needed
to improve service delivery at all levels of government—with particular attention to health,
education, water and sanitation, safety nets, and municipal services.
•
Improved Lives and Protection of the Vulnerable: The Bank will focus on
increased investment in the education and health sectors to help build the skilled, healthy
work force needed to sustain strong growth. This area of the CAS also features targeted
interventions to help the poor, including strengthened safety nets and targeted interventions
and community-based approaches in rural areas.

7
4.
In line with Pakistan’s recent performance and the government’s request for increased
Bank Group support, the CAS outlines a substantial increase in the volume of lending to
Pakistan through FY2009. The expansion in lending will take place primarily in
infrastructure (mainly in energy, water, and transport) and human development. One priority
will be to continue to assist in addressing the impact of the October 2005 earthquake—up to
US$1 billion will be used to support reconstruction and recovery. Overall, a flexible lending
program of up to US$6.5 billion is set forth in the CAS. About half of this amount
(US$3.1 billion) will take the form of IDA credits. Policy-based lending will account for up
to half of planned financial support.
5.
The IFC strategy in Pakistan, as expressed in the CAS, seeks to increase investments
with a target range of US$500–600 million during the FY2006–09 period. IFC activity will
focus on three main sectors: financial, SME and infrastructure. IFC has also initiated a
substantial TA program in Pakistan to build capacity and address constraints of the SME,
infrastructure and financial sectors.

ANNEX III. PAKISTAN: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
Further improvements in the availability and timeliness of key economic statistics would help
policy analysis and formulation. The Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes
(ROSC)—Data Module, a Response by the Authorities, and a Detailed Assessment Using the
Data Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF) were published on the IMF website in
December 2004. A ROSC reassessment focusing on monetary statistics was conducted in
November 2006 and published on the IMF website in February 2007.
2.
Pakistan participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since 2003,
meeting the recommendations for the coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of most GDDS
data categories. For subscription to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS),
Pakistan will need to disseminate (a) monthly data on central government operations with a
timeliness of one month; (b) quarterly data on the national accounts, employment and
unemployment, wages/earnings, and external debt, all with a timeliness of one quarter;
(c) more detailed breakdown of data on central government debt and external debt; and
(d) update and expand the metadata on compilation and dissemination practices.
3.
In 2004, the Federal Bureau of Statistics (FBS) completed a revision of the national
accounts statistics to bring them in line with the concepts and definitions of the 1993 System
of National Accounts (1993 SNA). As noted by the December 2004 data ROSC, informal
economic activities need to be better captured, while newly emerging activities, such as in the
information technology sector, continue to pose challenges. The FBS is currently working on
producing quarterly national accounts (QNA), which would be completed with a rebasing of
the national accounts to the year 2005/06. With respect to labor market statistics, the FBS has
recently started to compile quarterly employment/ unemployment data (although not with the
frequency required for subscription to the SDDS) and is investigating the feasibility of
disseminating data on wages/salaries.
4.
The FBS produces three price indices: the CPI, the wholesale price index (WPI), and
the sensitive price indicator (SPI). The CPI and WPI are compiled on a monthly basis. The
SPI is compiled on a weekly basis and consists of 46 essential commodities that are consumed
by the lowest income group. The concepts and definitions of the CPI and WPI follow
international guidelines. Plans have been made to introduce the classification of individual
consumption by purpose (COICOP) and to complete the work to develop a Producer Price
Index (PPI), with base year 1999/2000; an IMF mission also provided some advice in this
regard.
5.
The concepts and definitions used in compiling government finance statistics are
broadly based on the GFSM 1986, except that privatization proceeds are included below the

9
line. The scope of central government data is further limited because it does not cover the
activity of extrabudgetary funds. Classification and sectorization in source data follow GFSM
1986 standards to a limited extent. The classification of expenditure deviates from GFSM
1986 methodology because the economic and functional classifications are mixed in reporting,
in particular, with defense and government administration expenditures not clearly identified
according to economic classification. The basis of recording GFS is on, or close to, a cash
basis. Transactions are recorded on a gross basis. Corrective transactions are not necessarily
made in the original period, as required by GFSM 1986. The authorities have indicated their
intent to adopt the methodology of GFSM 2001 over the medium term, and are in the process
of improving government finance statistics in the context of the Project for the Improvement
of Financial Reporting and Auditing (PIFRA). Budgetary central government operations data
are regularly reported for publication in the GFS Yearbook, and use the GFSM 2001
framework. However, no data are reported on transactions in nonfinancial and financial assets
and liabilities. The authorities do not report higher frequency data for inclusion in the IFS.
6.
The ROSC mission found that the scope of the monetary statistics is comprehensive.
The classification and sectorization of the monetary survey compiled by the State Bank of
Pakistan’s (SBP) Statistics Department for reporting to the IMF and for internal use are
broadly in line with the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). The basis for
recording flows and stocks is largely consistent with the MFSM, and the SBP has indicated its
intention to adopt the MFSM in order to further improve monetary statistics. The ROSC
mission that conducted the reassessment of monetary statistics in November 2006 found that
the authorities had implemented the MFSM guidelines on the sectorization of institutional
units, classification of financial instruments, and the recording of securities repurchase
agreements (repos). Also, a new reporting framework for other depository corporations has
been designed and is being implemented. Further progress is needed in resolving
discrepancies in the data on interbank positions between the SBP and scheduled banks. The
SBP is in the process of implementing the Standardized Report Form framework for reporting
monetary data to the Fund.
7.
Starting in the third quarter of 2003 (July–September), Pakistan’s balance of payments
statements have been prepared according to the methodology of the Balance of Payments
Manual, fifth edition (BPM5). A 2007 Fund technical assistance mission made
recommendations to more closely align some recording practices with the BPM5, including in
the areas of residency, sectorization, and consistency across related data sets. Based on these
recommendations, a number of improvements have been made. Differences between the two
sources of trade data (customs records for FBS and exchange records for SBP) for exports and
imports have been widening. Most of the differences can be reconciled ex post (see SBP’s
Second Quarterly Report for FY2006), and the authorities are working to narrow these
differences before the publication of the data.
8.
Annual international investment position data are compiled and published on the SBP
website. Data are available back to 2003.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Pakistan
March 30, 2009

1.
This statement provides information on economic and political developments since
the staff report was circulated to the Executive Board on March 17. This information does
not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
Political Developments
2.
A Supreme Court ruling in late-February sparked political unrest. The ruling
barred former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his brother Shahbaz Sharif, Chief Minister of
Punjab, from holding public office. This decision triggered public protests and renewed calls
for reinstating Iftikhar Chaudhry as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. (Mr. Chaudhry was
removed from that position in November 2007.) To end the unrest, the government
announced on March 16 a set of measures, including the reinstatement of Mr. Chaudhry and
a review of the Supreme Court decision that banned the Sharif brothers from public office.
These measures were successful in lowering political tensions.
Economic Developments
3.
As foreshadowed in the staff report, economic activity continues to slow. Largescale manufacturing output has now declined by 5½ percent in July 2008-January 2009
compared with the same period 12 months earlier.
4.
Inflation was slightly higher in February reflecting base effects and a spike in food
prices. Headline inflation increased to 21.1 percent (y/y) in February from 20.5 percent in
January, while core inflation remained at 18.9 percent (y/y). The weekly Sensitive Price
Index (measuring inflation for the low income groups) shows a decline to 19.1 percent (y/y)
in the week ending March 19 from 26.1 percent in February (y/y), which points to lower
inflation in March.
5.
A significant contraction in imports contributed to an improvement in the current
account balance, which recorded a small surplus in February. Exports were down by
5.4 percent in February 2009 (y/y), while imports contracted by 36.8 percent, with significant
declines in nearly every category, including petroleum imports. Remittances increased by
27.6 percent, but the data may also include some capital transactions. The improvement in
the current account coincided with the repayment of the $500 million Eurobond in February,
which resulted in a deficit in the financial account. Gross foreign exchange reserves of the
SBP amounted to $6.7 billion on March 24.

2

6.
Despite the political tensions, financial markets have been calm. The demand for
T-bills has been strong and the weighted average yield has declined to 11.8 percent on
March 25 (from just below 13 percent at end-February). Stock prices have continued to
rebound, and as of March 24 were 37 percent above the level registered in late January.
On March 24, MSCI Barra announced that Pakistan’s equity market will be included in the
MSCI Frontier Markets Index at the next semi-annual index review on May 29, 2009.
The exchange rate has remained stable since end-February 2009. The SBP has intervened in
the foreign currency market mainly on the buying side.
7.
The slowdown in economic activity affected tax revenue. Tax revenue collections by
the Federal Bureau of Revenue slowed in January–February, but the resulting revenue
shortfall was largely offset by collections of the Petroleum Development Levy. Efforts to
reduce circular debt (inter-corporate debt in the energy sector) continued. As a first step, the
Pakistan Electric Power Company arranged a Rs. 81 billion loan from a consortium of
commercial banks to help settle its liabilities to other energy companies.
8.
On March 26, 2009, the World Bank Board approved a Poverty Reduction and
Economic Support Operation for Pakistan in the amount of $500 million.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with
Pakistan
On March 30, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Pakistan. 1
Background
Since the last Article IV Consultation in December 2007, Pakistan has been facing significant
economic difficulties. With sharp increases in oil and food prices, and adverse security
developments, Pakistan has experienced a significant widening of the fiscal deficit, owing in
large part to increasing energy subsidies, and major pressures on its balance of payments. As a
result, inflation rose considerably and international reserves declined sharply.
To address these challenges, in October 2008, the authorities embarked on a stabilization
program for 2008/09–09/10 (July-June) aimed at restoring financial stability while protecting the
poor. This program, supported by a Stand-By Arrangement (SBA), envisages a significant
tightening of fiscal and monetary policies to bring inflation down and strengthen the external
position, and includes several structural measures in the fiscal and financial sectors.
Initial developments since the approval of the program have been generally positive. The
exchange rate has been broadly stable, enabling the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to buy
foreign exchange on a net basis. As a result, gross international reserves have increased from
US$3.5 billion at end-October to US$6.7 billion as of February 20. Despite the somewhat
improved confidence, credit and broad money demand growth have been slower than
envisaged under the program.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2

Policy implementation has been good and the program remains on track. All quantitative
performance criteria and the structural benchmarks for the first program review were met. The
end-December fiscal deficit target, which proved challenging, was achieved through a
combination of revenue and expenditure measures.
Social protection is a key element of the program. In this context, the authorities pressed ahead
with the strengthening of the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP), which provides cash
grants to the poorest families. The expansion of BISP will increase the spending on social
transfers from 0.4 percent of GDP in 2008/09 to 0.6 percent of GDP in 2009/10.
Banks have weathered the crisis well thus far, but should be monitored carefully. Based on the
recently conducted Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) update, the banking system
appears to be generally well-capitalized and liquid. Aggregate financial soundness indicators
improved since the 2004 FSAP, although the worsening macroeconomic environment affected
adversely bank profitability and asset quality in 2008. Gross nonperforming loans rose from
7.7 percent of total loans in June 2008 to 9.1 percent in December 2008 but capital adequacy
ratios stayed around 12 percent of risk-weighted assets over the same period.
The global economic and financial environment has deteriorated significantly since the start of
the program. In light of these developments, the authorities agreed with the mission on a
revised macroeconomic framework (with lower growth and inflation) and supporting policies for
2008/09 and beyond. The authorities have chosen to adhere to the program’s fiscal target for
2008/09 and continue with further fiscal adjustment in 2009/10. There should be scope for the
State Bank of Pakistan to lower its discount rate if inflation abates, the external reserve position
continues to improve, and the government can sell T-bills to banks and nonbank private
investors.
Pakistan needs additional external assistance to reduce risks, and greater development and
social spending. The upcoming donor meeting planned for April provides an important
opportunity for mobilizing additional assistance.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for the progress achieved under the
stabilization program. Directors observed that fiscal consolidation and improved coherence
between fiscal and monetary policies have helped to tackle the roots of large imbalances, while
structural reforms have progressed broadly as envisaged. As a result, the exchange rate has
broadly stabilized, inflation has come down, and foreign reserves have strengthened.
Directors noted the increased risks stemming from the subdued global outlook and slower
domestic activity. Weaker demand for exports and uncertainty about workers’ remittances entail
important risks for the external position, while tight domestic credit and dim external private
financing prospects could constrain growth. Directors also observed that political risk had risen
recently.

3

Directors commended the authorities for adhering to the program’s fiscal deficit target
for 2008/09 under difficult circumstances and supported the envisaged fiscal adjustment
for 2009/10. Referring to the ambitious revenue target, they encouraged the authorities to
identify additional contingency fiscal measures to avoid last-minute expenditure compression.
Directors stressed that, over the medium term, higher revenues will be critical to create fiscal
space for development and social spending. They welcomed the action plan to reform tax policy
and administration. Directors emphasized in particular the need to replace the general sales tax
with a broad-based value added tax. They also commended the planned establishment of a
medium-term budget framework.
Directors welcomed the focus on social protection in the authorities’ program. They were
encouraged by the progress under the BISP, which envisages a considerable increase in social
transfers in the coming years. Directors underscored the importance of reviewing other
components of the social safety net, with a view to possibly merging existing cash transfer plans
with the BISP, and eliminating gaps and overlaps between the federal and provincial programs.
Directors indicated that the monetary policy stance was appropriate. They agreed that interest
rates should be kept on hold for the time being in order to avoid financial pressures and to
further consolidate disinflation. Directors saw some scope for lowering interest rates in the
future, provided that inflation further declines and international reserves continue to strengthen.
They stressed the need to continue to avoid central bank financing of the government.
Directors welcomed the envisaged strengthening of the SBP’s policy framework. They
emphasized that the operational independence of the SBP needs to be enhanced, and its
quasi-fiscal operations transparently accounted for and eventually eliminated.
Noting the staff’s assessment that the rupee may be slightly overvalued, Directors observed that
the exchange rate had remained broadly stable in recent months. Looking ahead, they saw the
need to maintain exchange rate flexibility in order to strengthen external competitiveness and
respond to a volatile external environment.
Directors noted that Pakistan’s financial system has weathered the crisis well. They welcomed
the recent formulation of contingency plans for dealing with problem banks. Directors
encouraged the authorities to monitor developments closely and to assess potential problems
on a timely basis.
Directors welcomed the intention to address the circular debt in the energy sector, which should
help ease constraints on economic growth originating in the energy sector, though noting that
further steps are needed to arrest new accrual. They also welcomed the intention to eliminate
electricity subsidies.

4

Directors encouraged the authorities to further strengthen the regime for addressing money
laundering and the financing of terrorism. In addition, they noted the need for effective
implementation and consolidation of the institutional framework.
Directors emphasized the need for additional external assistance to strengthen the economy
and to provide scope for greater development and social spending. The upcoming donor
meeting should provide an important opportunity for mobilizing additional external assistance.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 30, 2009

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Completes First Review Under Stand-By Arrangement with Pakistan and
Approves US$847.1 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the first
review of Pakistan's economic performance under a program supported by a 23-month StandBy Arrangement (SBA). The completion of the review enables the immediate disbursement
of an amount equivalent to SDR 568.5 million (about US$ 847.1 million), bringing total
disbursements under the program to an amount equivalent to SDR 2.64 billion (about
US$3.93 billion).
The Executive Board also approved Pakistan’s request for a waiver for the non-observance of
the continuous performance criterion on non-imposition or intensification of exchange
restrictions, on the basis of the authorities’ plan to reverse the intensification by end-June.
The SBA was approved on November 24, 2008 (see Press Release No. 08/303) for an
amount equivalent to SDR 5.169 billion (about US$7.7 billion). The arrangement entails
exceptional access to IMF resources, amounting to 500 percent of Pakistan's quota.
Following the Executive Board's discussion on Pakistan, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“Pakistan’s economy is gradually recovering from the macroeconomic and external
imbalances of 2007–08. Policy steps taken by the authorities under the SBA-supported
stabilization program, which aims at restoring financial stability while protecting the poor,
have been instrumental in this regard.
“The program is firmly on track. The end-December fiscal deficit target, which proved
challenging, was achieved through a combination of revenue and expenditure measures. The
authorities also made good progress toward addressing the circular debt problem in the
energy sector. And, they are taking important steps toward expanding the Benazir Income
Support Program in order to provide targeted cash transfers for the poor households.

“Initial developments under the program have been positive. The exchange rate has been
broadly stable, enabling the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to nearly double its gross reserves
since late 2008. Inflation has been falling more rapidly than expected and the external current
account deficit has been narrowing. T-bill auctions have been consistently oversubscribed,
following the 200-basis point increase in the SBP discount rate last November, and the
government has retired some of its debt to the SBP. However, despite improved confidence,
credit and money growth have been slow.
“Looking ahead, despite the achievements made in recent months, domestic economic
activity has weakened and the global environment has deteriorated significantly.
Accordingly, the near-term growth outlook has been revised downward, and economic
performance is subject to downside risks.
“Banks have weathered the crisis well, but need to continue to be monitored carefully as the
worsening macroeconomic environment may affect banks’ asset quality and profitability.
The SBP’s contingency planning will help detect and address emerging risks.
“Given the limited scope for countercyclical fiscal policy, the authorities have chosen to
adhere to the program’s fiscal target for 2008/09 and to continue with fiscal adjustment in
2009/10. They also aim to raise government revenues over the medium term to allow for
more public investment and social spending. The authorities’ medium-term fiscal strategy
will depend on the success of the envisaged ambitious tax reforms.
“The SBP discount rate remains on hold, but there could be scope in the future to lower it if
inflation abates further, the external reserve position continues to improve, and the
government can sell its T-bills to banks and nonbank private investors. Exchange rate
flexibility will continue to facilitate external adjustment.
“Pakistan needs additional external assistance to reduce risks, and provide for greater
development and social spending. The upcoming donor meeting provides an important
opportunity for mobilizing additional assistance,” Mr. Portugal said.

Statement by Mohammad Mojarrad, Executive Director for Pakistan
and Ehtisham Ahmad, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
March 30, 2009

Since the program was approved in late November 2008, conditions have been increasingly
difficult for Pakistan, with a worsening of the external environment, and a slowing of growth and
activity levels in the country. Political tensions have also played a role, as have renewed terrorist
attacks, including recently in Lahore. Yet, the Government has worked hard to implement the
program and has met all the quantitative performance criteria, reflecting the extent of program
ownership. The recent political agreement that led to the restoration of the judiciary and
affirmation of the rule of law augur well for the future, and the country’s ability to adapt to the
economic and security challenges facing the region. The discussions with the Fund staff on the
prospects for the immediate future were very helpful, and the Pakistan authorities would like to
thank staff for their hard work and constructive attitudes in Dubai during the program review and
the Article IV discussions.
The Fund-supported program clearly had an impact on business confidence, and as described in
the staff report, the market determined exchange rate has been broadly stable. Gross reserves
have increased, inflation has fallen, and T-bill rates have tended downwards. There has been a
strong response to T-bill auctions and the Government has retired some of the stock of its debt to
the State Bank of Pakistan. The removal of the floor on the stock market in mid-December led to
an expected correction, but there was no massive capital outflow as had been feared by some.
Indeed, the stock market index has risen since then, albeit with some volatility as explained by
staff.
The decline in activity levels has had a negative impact on revenues, particularly linked to lower
volumes of traded goods. Nonetheless, the end-period deficit target was achieved by careful
management of spending by the Ministry of Finance, as well as additional revenues from the
Petroleum Development Levy. Following a conference held in Lahore in December with key
stakeholders—including the business and academic communities, and senior federal and
provincial officials—a plan to significantly raise the tax to GDP ratio was approved by the
Government. This involves a thorough revamp of the tax administration, with assistance from the
World Bank. Difficult decisions to establish a functional administration for the Federal Bureau of
Revenue (FBR), merging the separate income and sales tax administrations have been taken, and
the implementation of an Inland Revenue component of the FBR launched.
The Government also intends to proceed with an ambitious tax reform agenda based on the full
implementation of the VAT, and reform of the income tax. However, a full VAT with minimal
exemptions, to be implemented by the FBR, will involve agreement with the provinces
concerning the treatment of services, which have been assigned to them under the Constitution.
Options in this regard are being examined, drawing on international experience. Additional taxes
are also under consideration, including a possible Carbon Tax for environmental purposes.

2
A key element of the Government’s economic strategy is the social safety net, and agreement has
been reached with the World Bank on its design and the targeting of poor household for cash
transfers under the Benazir Income Support Program. The proposed methodology is being tested,
and if successful, will be rolled out rapidly. Under the existing zakat system in place since 1984
(see Box 4 of the staff report), local communities identify the needy—including widows and
orphans without family support—and disbursements are made outside the budget and without
central government involvement. The transfer is small, and together with local identification of
the target group, the chances of misappropriation are minimized.
The authorities have embarked on the implementation of the plan to deal with crircular debt.
Proposals in this area are described in ¶14 of the staff report, and the Term-Finance Certificates
to settle power company debt described as part of the plan are to be issued by the end of the
month.
The Government had committed to avoid recourse to central bank financing under the program—
and this has been achieved since the inception of the program, along with a reduction in the stock
of government debt to the SBP. The FSSA’s remarks that SBP liquidity management is linked to
the central bank financing of the government are no longer valid. The Ministry of Finance and
the SBP now operate a volume-based auction approach to non-bank financing through the
issuance of T-bills. A calendar of T-bill auctions is issued with indicative volumes on a quarterly
basis—this is in line with the twin goals of providing confidence to the market participants to
plan their investments, and facilitating effective government planning of its borrowing
requirements, and liquidity management by the SBP. Despite large oversubscription, the sales of
T-bills have been in line with the announced volumes, in keeping with the announced strategy.
As indicated by staff, Pakistan’s financial system has weathered the crisis so far, but continued
vigilance is required. The banking sector appears to be generally well-capitalized and liquid. The
stress tests of the banking sector have indicated that most banks, including all large banks, would
remain solvent under a severe crisis scenario, although as indicated in SMEFP ¶22 some nonsystemic banks may face insolvency under such scenarios. A few banks representing less than 10
percent of the system are indeed facing financial pressures, and these are being addressed by SBP
and their owners through mergers or fresh injections of equity.
The Pakistan authorities are not convinced by the methodology used by staff in claiming that the
rupee remains slightly overvalued in real effective terms despite the sizable depreciation in 2008,
as alternative methodologies give different results. SBP estimates using the Fund’s methodology
do yield a small appreciation of the rupee in real terms during October 2008-February 2009
(using panel data for Pakistan’s trading partners). However, the alternate macro-balance approach
suggests that the exchange rate is close to the equilibrium real exchange rate. SBP estimates have
been shared with staff and the authorities would welcome any technical comments on data used
or methodology.
As stated in SMEFP ¶21, the SBP continues to pursue a flexible exchange rate policy, and the
exchange rate continues to reflect market conditions. SBP interventions have been targeted at
achieving the program’s NFA targets. While exchange rate volatility has been reduced from 8.4

3
percent (twelve months to date) to 4.8 percent since the inception of the program, this is largely
the result of the increased confidence that has emerged since the inception of the program and is
above the IMF’s threshold used to define a de facto peg.
On the AML/CFT regime, the government and the SBP would like to reiterate that they are
taking all possible steps to strengthen the regime, including the promulgation of the Anti Money
Laundering Ordinance, establishment of the FMU, strengthening of Prudential Regulations, and
capacity building in the SBP and banks in AML-related matters. The authorities remain
committed to the full implementation of the AML/CFT regime.
Prior to the agreement with the Fund, and in order to protect reserves, the government had
instituted cash margin requirements on letters of credit on a number of commodities. During the
review by the Ministry of Industries in early March, a large number (approximately 20) of the
commodity groups were removed from the cash margin requirement, but some, including for the
hard hit automobile industry, were added. The Ministry of Industries has agreed to lift the
additional requirements by the end of June 2009, and the Pakistan authorities request a waiver of
the continuous performance criterion in this regard.
Pakistan continues to face enormous challenges in providing gainful employment to its large
population, and this is exacerbated by the prospects of lower job opportunities abroad for an
increasing cohort of working age. The authorities are very appreciative of the efforts of the
Japanese Government, together with the World Bank, to host the Friends of Pakistan Meeting in
Tokyo in April, and to several governments and international agencies that have agreed to attend
this event. This is an important step in helping Pakistan to overcome its severe infrastructure
constraints, and assist in effectively providing social services and safety nets to its population—
particularly the poor and needy. As we indicated in the last Board meeting on Pakistan, the
authorities may request a higher access under the program should the conditions warrant. They
remain firmly committed to the program and look forward to continued support from
Management and the Board.
