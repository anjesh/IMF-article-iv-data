•

The Article IV consultation discussions started in August 2005 and were completed in June 2006.
The teams included Mr. van den Boogaerde (head, 2005), Mr. Snoek (head, 2006), Ms. Dabán, and
Ms. Lacoche (all AFR); Mr. Mattina, Mr. Hélis, and Mr. Buissé (all FAD); Ms. Redifer (PDR); and
Mr. Camard, the IMF’s resident representative in Chad. The August 2005 mission met with the
president and the prime minister; subsequent missions met with the ministers of Finance, Economy
and Planning, and Petroleum; the national director of the Bank for the Central African States; other
senior officials; private sector representatives; and donors.

•

The last Article IV consultation was held on March 19, 2004, at which time the Executive Board
also discussed the Ex Post Assessment of Performance under IMF-supported programs.

•

The Executive Board approved a three-year PRGF arrangement for SDR 25.2 million (45 percent of
quota) in February 2005. Expenditure overruns and uncertainty about the fiscal outlook stemming
from differences with the World Bank over oil revenue management have stalled the completion of
the first review under the PRGF.

•

Chad reached the decision point under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
Initiative in May 2001, at which time the net present value (NPV) of the debt-to-exports ratio was
214 percent and committed HIPC debt relief amounted to US$170 million (29 percent of the end2000 NPV debt stock). Attainment of the completion point has been delayed, mainly because of
unsatisfactory fiscal performance.

•

Chad has accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of
Agreement; its exchange system remains free of restrictions for current international transactions.
Chad is a member of the Central African Economic and Monetary Union (CEMAC). The staff
reports on the regional discussions on the common policies of the CEMAC (Country Report No.
06/317, June 20, 2006), which is an integral part of the current Article IV consultation with Chad,
and the CEMAC Financial System Stability Assessment (Country Report No. 06/320, June 15,
2006) were discussed by the Executive Board on July 10, 2006. A recent data ROSC mission noted
severe weaknesses in macroeconomic statistics.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Rising oil revenue provides an opportunity to accelerate development in one of the
poorest countries in the world. However, management of these resources poses major
challenges for Chad’s weak administration and political system.

•

Despite the sharp rise in oil revenue, weak public finance management and budget
segmentation have resulted in increased domestic debt and arrears. In 2005 oil
revenue rose to almost 8 percent of GDP, the overall domestic fiscal surplus increased,
and earmarked oil deposits were accumulated. However, the non-oil budget faced
serious financing constraints, including a sharp fall in budget support, resulting in
additional central bank (BEAC) borrowing and new arrears.1

•

In January 2006, the authorities unilaterally amended the petroleum revenue
management law (PRML), breaching agreements with the World Bank under the
oil pipeline project. Consequently, the World Bank froze Chad’s oil offshore escrow
account, which led to an interruption in oil revenue receipts. In April, the World Bank
and the authorities reached an interim agreement, focusing on the use of petroleum
revenue in 2006 and steps to strengthen public financial management. A subsequent
agreement in July, which led to the lifting of all contractual remedies, dealt with the use
of an expected temporary surge in oil revenue in 2007. Discussions on a new petroleum
revenue management program (PRMP) covering all oil revenue will begin latter this
year and be finalized in the context of the preparation of a new Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper (PRSP) in 2007.

•

Oil revenue is projected to rise from 14 percent of GDP in 2006 to 45 percent of
GDP in 2007, before falling to an average of less than 20 percent of GDP during
2008–09 and then falling more gradually until the fields are exhausted by the early2030s.

•

Against this background, the Article IV consultation discussions focused on the
impact of the oil windfall on recent macroeconomic developments, with an
emphasis on competitiveness and inflation, structural factors that constraint nonoil sector growth, and fiscal management and the challenges posed by the oil
revenue outlook.

o

The oil revenue will only lead to lasting poverty reduction if its use takes into
account macroeconomic and administrative absorptive capacity. A key prerequisite in this regard will be the formulation and annual updating, in close
cooperation with the World Bank, the Fund, and other partners, of a realistic
medium-term expenditure framework.

o

Fiscal policy should be set within a framework for long-term fiscal sustainability,
including a policy to save part of the initial peak in oil receipts. Policies to

promote non-oil growth and measures to increase non-oil revenue should support
this strategy.
o

Public finance management (PFM) is in urgent need of strengthening. It is
important that Chad builds up a track record of sound policy implementation and
political stability to secure the crucial external support for the government’s
action plan to strengthen PFM.

The authorities wish to resume discussions on the first review under the PRGF
arrangement in the near future. They feel that a close relationship with the Fund in the context
of the PRGF arrangement is critical in view of the extraordinary macroeconomic challenges as
well as to ensure progress toward the HIPC completion point. Satisfactory implementation of the
revised 2006 budget and measures to improve PFM would facilitate resuming discussions on
completing the first review under the PRGF arrangement later this year. Such discussions would
have to include a new medium-term macroeconomic framework taking the new revenue outlook
into account and a convincing structural reform agenda.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Chad is one of the poorest countries in the world. Landlocked and largely desert with a
low population density, it has suffered repeated periods of armed domestic conflict since
independence in 1960. Weak institutions and a lack of infrastructure, have further hindered
economic development. In the 1990s annual per capita GDP growth averaged only 0.4 percent,2
despite progress in macroeconomic stabilization and reform under Fund-supported reform
programs. However,

After a period of relative political stability beginning in the early 1990s, the last two
years have seen several coup attempts.4 Attacks from across the Sudanese border occurred in
late 2005 and early 2006. Chad harbors about 250,000 refugees and 50,000 internally displaced
people from the Darfur conflict and about 40,000 refugees from the northern part of the Central
African Republic. President Deby won in the elections on May 3, 2006, which were boycotted by
the opposition, and was inaugurated for a third term on August 8; efforts to engage the
opposition in forming a government of national unity were unsuccessful.

Rising oil revenue provides an opportunity to accelerate development, but also poses
major challenges for Chad’s weak administration and political system. The management and
use of oil revenue was therefore a central theme in the discussions for the Article IV consultation
(Box 1).5 Expenditure overruns and uncertainty about the fiscal outlook—stemming from the

differences between the authorities and the World Bank over petroleum revenue management—
have also stalled the completion of the first review under the PRGF arrangement, approved in
February 2005 (Box 2).
Box 1. The Petroleum Sector and Petroleum Revenue Management
Chad is among the newest and smallest African oil producers. Construction of the Chad–Cameroon pipeline and
the development of the Doba region oil fields began in 2001. Production started in 2003, and the pipeline reached its
maximum capacity of 225,000 barrels per day by the end of 2004. Average daily production has since declined
because of unexpected water flows, and, unless exploration identifies other economically viable reserves, production
is expected to continue declining over the next 15–20 years. Doba oil trades at a US$10–12 discount from Brent
crude. Oil revenue consists of exploration fees, signature bonuses, income tax on oil companies, dividends, and
royalties; recently concluded exploration agreements in other areas also envisage payments in oil.

The World Bank played a catalytic role in developing the oil sector; as a condition for its participation, the loan
agreement on the pipeline project includes a petroleum revenue management plan (PRMP) to ensure
transparent use of oil revenue for priority sectors. Under the PRMP, all revenue from the project should pass
through an offshore escrow account. After deduction of debt service to the World Bank and the European Investment
Bank, direct revenue (royalties and dividends) is earmarked as follows: (i) 10 percent for a Future Generations Fund
(FGF); (ii) 72 percent of royalties and 76.5 percent of dividends for priority spending;1/ and (iii) 4.5 percent of
royalties for the Doba region. The remainder—13.5 percent of royalties and dividends—is not earmarked.
Furthermore, 42.6 percent of expenditure not financed by earmarked oil revenue needs to be allocated to priority
spending to ensure additionality compared to the 2002 budget. An autonomous joint government-civil society
oversight body (the Collège) authorizes and monitors oil-financed priority spending. Indirect oil revenue, mainly
income taxes, was not earmarked under the PRMP. The PRMP was the basis for the Petroleum Revenue Management
Law (PRML).
Chad modified the PRML in January 2006. The revision abolished the FGF, widened the definition of priority
sectors (to include justice, territorial administration, and security), increased the share of non-earmarked oil revenue
from 13½ to 30 percent, allowed the list of priority sectors to be changed by decree, and extended the law to all oil
fields. The unilateral change contravened the loan agreement, and the World Bank suspended all disbursements in
Chad and froze the flow of oil revenue from the escrow account.
The relations between the World Bank and Chad were normalized in July 2006. In April, an interim agreement
focused on the use of oil revenue in a revised 2006 budget and on measures to strengthen public finance management
and oversight. In July, the parties reached agreement on the use of oil revenue in the 2007 budget, including on
allocating at least 70 percent of all budgetary resources (excluding oil revenue in excess of absorptive capacity) to an
extended list of priority sectors, including governance. The list, as well as the design of a new PRMP, will be revised
during an update of the PRSP in 2007.
1

Priority sectors are health and social welfare, education, infrastructure (including energy), rural development
(agriculture and livestock), environment, and water resources.

arrears. By end-December 2005, the performance criteria on the non-oil primary balance, external
arrears, and new external debt were met, but the criterion on the wage bill was exceeded by a large
margin. Reflecting weaknesses in PFM, the composition of payments on domestic debt is difficult to
ascertain, but there are indications that the performance criterion on repayment of conventional debt was
not met as repayments were offset by the use of BEAC advances. The three measures constituting
structural performance criteria for end-December 2005 were not observed, but two were implemented, at
least partially, with delays (Table 12).

II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Growth has slowed after an initial surge from development of the oil sector.
Construction of the oil pipeline and exploitation infrastructure—financed by a temporary surge
in foreign direct investment as the current account deficit widened sharply—and rising oil
production pushed average total real GDP growth to over 16 percent during 2000–04 (Table 1
and Figure 1). In 2005 non-oil GDP rebounded sharply, reflecting more favorable weather
conditions for agriculture following a drought in 2004 and recovery in cotton ginning, which
benefited from an increase in cotton producer prices. However, overall growth slowed to
12 percent as oil production stagnated. Modest non-oil growth and a decline in oil output will
likely leave real GDP unchanged in 2006 (Table 1).6

6

Data provision for surveillance purposes is still adequate overall, although severe weaknesses and shortcomings in
most macroeconomic statistics affected staff’s analysis; a recent ROSC data module made recommendations for
improvements (Appendix III).

9

5.
External sector developments were also dominated by the oil sector. Following the
completion of the construction phase of the oil project, the current account deficit declined, as
investment-related investment imports fell, and oil exports started (Table 6). The terms of trade
improved by 112 percent during 2002-05 with a further gain of 24 percent projected for 2006 and
the current account balance shifted from a deficit of 100 per cent of GDP in 2002 to a surplus of
1 percent of GDP in 2005 (Table 1 and Figure 1).

Inflation, which is very sensitive to developments in food prices, has been higher
than in other members of CEMAC. A rise in inflation to an annual average of 8 percent in
2005 (double the CEMAC average), mostly reflected the impact of the 2004 drought on food
prices during the first half of 2005 (Figure 2). However, the decline in prices that started in
August-September 2005—reflecting the excellent harvest—was short-lived. Inflation rebounded
again in the first half of 2006; very sharp price increases for a few items within the food category
and charcoal in March appear to have reflected security concerns and related supply disruptions.

The real effective exchange rate appreciated by 2 percent in 2004-2005 (Figure 3).
Indications are that, during the last few years, drought-affected fluctuations in consumer prices
had some impact on the appreciation, but the main factor was the depreciation of the US dollar
against the Euro.7 The upward trend of the real effective exchange rate has eroded some of the
competitiveness gains from the 1994 devaluation, although to a lesser extent than in the CEMAC
region as a whole. Non-oil exports have remained relatively stable in percent of GDP; a decline
in cotton exports through 2004 (reflecting financial problems of the state-owned cotton
company) being offset by higher exports of livestock.

After stagnating in 2003–04, broad money grew by 32 percent in 2005, well above the
18 percent increase seen in the CEMAC as a whole and four times the program rate. While the
increase at the regional level was driven by oil-related liquidity, in Chad it largely reflected a
sharp expansion in net domestic assets of the banking system, driven by a rebound in credit to
the cotton sector (Table 5). However, during the 12 months to May 2006, broad money growth
slowed to 19 percent.

only two are rated “good” by the Banking Commission of Central Africa (COBAC); moreover,
the system remains vulnerable because of overexposure to parastatals.

Public spending increased following the start of oil revenue, which reached almost
8 percent of GDP in 2005. Non-oil revenue also improved, bolstered by improved revenue
administration and growth in the formal sector, stimulated by oil-related investment in recent
years.10 However, a sharp drop in donor budget support—as reform momentum slowed and
performance under the PRGF weakened—partly offset the higher domestic revenue.11 The net
increase in resources financed higher spending, including investment, helping to offset a decline
in donor-financed investment. The overall domestic surplus (on a commitment basis, excluding
foreign-financed investment) was therefore only slightly higher than before oil revenue started.

The increase in non-oil revenue, as a percent of non-oil GDP, in 2004 reflected the impact of the drought on the
informal agriculture sector, which lowered non-oil GDP but had little impact on tax collections in the formal sector.
The increase was largely reversed in 2005, as the excellent harvest and a rebound in the cotton sector increased nonoil GDP.

11

Total external assistance, including project assistance, declined from 15 percent of GDP in 2003 to less than
10 percent of GDP in 2005.

13

11.
Despite the rise in revenue, domestic debt and arrears continued to accumulate.
Expenditure control was complicated by poor budget discipline and weak public finance
management (PFM), including:
•

failure to observe legal time limits for entering into commitments at the end of the fiscal
year, resulting in payments being carried over to subsequent years;

•

excessive payments outside normal budgetary procedures, including automatic debits on
treasury accounts with commercial banks; and

•

use of different budget codes by the Budget and Treasury Departments, which
complicates budget monitoring, and focuses fiscal management on the day-to-day
balances in the treasury accounts, without adequate attention to commitments.

12.
Fiscal management was also complicated by segmentation of the budget and cash
management resulting from earmarking provisions under the PRML (Box 3). Reflecting the
earmarking provisions, the overall domestic surplus on the consolidated budget reflected widely
divergent developments in sub-budgets:
•

The overall domestic surplus occurred entirely on the “oil budget.” Capacity constraints
delayed priority sector investment and there were also delays in making payments on
these projects. As a result, the balance in the oil revenue accounts at the BEAC rose to
about 1.5 percent of GDP by the end of 2005.

•

Pressures arose on the ordinary budget. Although non-oil revenue rose and the ordinary
budget received its 13.5 percent share of rising oil revenues, this was more than offset by
the decline in budget support. Current expenditures rose, reflecting higher staffing and
wage incentives in education

ordinary budget incurred substantial new arrears. These were largely cleared in early2005. Despite the subsequent circumvention of the PRML’s earmarking rules, as the
ordinary budget “borrowed” the equivalent of 2.4 percent of GDP from the oil accounts,
new arrears were incurred and the stock of arrears increased.13
Box 3: Chad’s Budget Framework
Chad’s overall budget links different categories of resources to specific expenditure. These linked
revenue and expenditure streams go through separate budgets and bank accounts, without adequate flexibility
in transferring resources to allow optimal cash management. In addition to the self-financing “donor budget,”
the “sub-budgets” are:
•

The “ordinary budget,” which consists mainly of the government’s operational expenditure, debt
service, and some domestically financed investment. An important share of this budget covers priority
spending, though usually less than the mandated 42.6 percent (see Box 1).

•

The “oil budget,” which consists of priority spending funded by earmarked oil revenue; these
transactions are executed through separate commercial bank accounts. While the PRML allows
earmarked oil resources to finance current priority spending, the government in 2004 and 2005 preferred
to focus this budget on priority sector investment.

•

The “HIPC budget,” whose resources arise from the difference between debt service due before and
after HIPC relief, is earmarked for priority spending. The government had accumulated 0.8 percent of
GDP in arrears to the HIPC budget at end-2005—which had similar supplier arrears—but reduced this
share to 0.4 percent of GDP by end-May 2006.

13.
During January-May 2006, fiscal
developments were again characterized
by arrears and payments outside
normal procedures. The revenue
shortfall arising from the freezing of the
oil escrow account was initially offset by
the repatriation of resources in the FGF,
revenue from exploration licenses, and
initial income tax payments by the oil
companies. The 2006 budget did not
become operational until April; wages
were paid and discretionary expenditure
focused on clearing 2005 arrears. The
intensification of rebel attacks in March
and April prompted exceptional security
spending of about 1.2 percent of GDP. In

addition, payments outside regular procedures were substantial. External debt service was halted,
but arrears of 0.4 percent of GDP at end-April, to the Fund, the World Bank, and the African
Development Bank (AfDB), were cleared by mid-year.
14.
Progress in alleviating Chad’s serious growth constraints has been modest. Access to
education, health, potable water, and agricultural inputs improved, and the length of paved roads
increased from 600 km to 900 km during 2004–05. However, progress in World Bank–
supported reforms in the electricity and cotton sectors remained limited, as did progress in civil
service and military sector reform.14 Chad ranks as one of the lowest countries in both business
climate and governance indicators, and there has been little follow-up on corruption cases.15
Completing the analysis of the 2004 household survey will allow a fuller assessment of progress
toward the Millennium Development Goals; however, it will take time for oil-financed priority
spending to be reflected in poverty indicators.
15.
Poor fiscal performance in recent years, together with inflation pressures, have
prevented Chad from meeting the convergence criteria established by the Central African
Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC).

Given the delay in reaching the completion point under the HIPC Initiative, debt relief is
declining. Available IMF interim relief had been used by the end of 2005, while assistance from
Paris Club creditors was suspended at end-September 2005, following the delay in completing
the first review under the PRGF arrangement. The AfDB provided interim assistance until early2006 and World Bank interim assistance will reach its ceiling in 2007. Chad’s external debt was
equivalent to 47 percent of GDP at end-2005, and the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio is estimated
at 37 percent after HIPC relief. External debt service after HIPC relief was more than 7 percent
of non-oil revenue in 2005.
III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
16.
The discussions were held against the backdrop of the authorities’ wish to amend
the PRML and, more recently, a dramatic change in the medium-term outlook for oil
revenue. Discussions on the PRML, initiated by the government in April 2005, ultimately led to
Chad’s unilateral change in the law in early January 2006, followed by contractual remedies by
the World Bank and subsequent discussions on how to address both sides’ concerns. At the start
of the discussions, most revenue was expected to fall under the PRML earmarking system for
several years to come. However, early in 2006, it became clear that the rapid increase in
international oil prices during 2005 would lead to very high income tax receipts from oil
companies, which are not earmarked under the PRML (Box 4). It was also recognized that
strengthening public expenditure management and improving policy implementation would be
essential to manage this unanticipated windfall and facilitate donor support.

Under Chad’s tax legislation, profit tax is paid in advance in equal quarterly installments. The advance is
equal to income tax liabilities over the previous year and is netted against the actual tax liability to be paid on
March 31 of the following year.

Petroleum revenue management
17.
Faced with mounting financing needs on the ordinary budget, the authorities
perceived the original PRML as overly rigid. They questioned the justification for the Future
Generations Fund (FGF) given the country’s high current needs, pointing out that growing
balances in the FGF were accompanied by new domestic borrowing. They further noted that
the 2003 PRSP identified more priority areas than the PRML, including enhancing security
(police and gendarmerie), de-mining, decentralization, and strengthening of the judiciary.16
Finally, they felt that the arrangements lacked flexibility to counter the impact of declining
budget support or to accommodate new priority needs, such as those stemming from the large
numbers of refugees, while the earmarking had led to a complex and difficult-to-manage
system.
18.
While recognizing the authorities’ concerns, the staff noted that the difficulties also
reflected weaknesses in PFM and a failure to adhere to established budget execution
procedures. Against this background, staff argued that PFM would need to be strengthened to
protect priority spending before a possible revision of the PRML. Moreover, more time would
be needed to assess the operation of the PRML, which had only become fully effective by mid2004. In the meantime, staff recommended that the authorities use the full flexibility under the
PRML to shift priority current expenditure to the oil budget to reduce pressure on the ordinary
budget. When the authorities insisted on a rapid revision of the PRML, the World Bank and
Fund staffs proposed an accelerated structured review of the law; however, by that time,
preparations for amendments had already advanced, with the changes becoming effective in
January 2006.
19.
The subsequent discussions focused on addressing the fiscal problems, while
ensuring the efficient and effective use of oil revenue for poverty reduction. At the time of
a multidonor mission in April 2006, which included Fund staff, a broad range of external
partners agreed that, given the high needs for security expenditure following the rebel attacks
and for clearance of 2005 arrears, the 2006 budget could only be financed by allotting a larger
share of oil revenue to general budget financing, as allowed under the amended PRML.
Moreover, it was agreed that the list of priority sectors eligible for oil-revenue financing should
be extended to better reflect the development needs identified in the PRSP.
20.
There was also broad agreement on the urgent need to strengthen PFM, including
monitoring poverty-reducing expenditure. The authorities concurred that fiscal management
capacity was inadequate. They felt that assistance to build capacity in preparation of the start of
oil revenue had been less successful than expected, but agreed that frequent changes in senior
civil service positions and weakening budget discipline had also played an important role.
Based on technical assistance from a broad range of donors and the IMF, they had prepared an

19

action plan to strengthen PFM (the PAMFIP), implementation of which would be accelerated.17
The plan would be supported with measures to reinforce budget discipline, including by
enforcing the application of existing rules and regulations.
Medium-term policies
21.
The medium-term fiscal policy discussions focused on the broad management
challenges posed by the new oil revenue outlook. The key issue is how to ensure that the oil
revenue leads to a lasting reduction in poverty and higher economic growth, while maintaining
macroeconomic stability and fiscal sustainability in a politically difficult environment and
given weak technical capacity. The projected profile of initially very high revenues falling to
low levels over a relatively short time further complicates the policy challenges. The staff
elaborated a number of key principles, which could serve as an input in the authorities’
deliberations in finalizing the 2007 update of the PRSP and in revising the PRML:
•

Expenditure should be kept within the economy’s absorption capacity. Therefore, the
authorities and Chad’s development partners should include macroeconomic and
administrative absorption capacity considerations in the formulation of projects and
sectoral development plans in the context of a medium-term expenditure framework
(MTEF). Although the World Bank has the lead in this area, Fund staff should
participate in the elaboration of the 2007-09 MTEF, which should be finalized in the
near future to allow adequate preparations for the 2007 budget. At a minimum the
MTEF should include an envelop of expenditure and indicative targets for non-oil
revenue for 2007-09 consistent with the main macroeconomic and fiscal aggregates
and the government’s policy objectives.

•

Expenditure plans must be geared to long-term fiscal sustainability. That is, policies
should aim at ensuring that, when oil revenue runs out, non-oil revenue is able to
finance the recurrent costs of oil-financed investments. A crucial element would be
raising the currently very low non-oil revenue-to-GDP ratio. In addition, expenditure
levels should be carefully phased over the medium term and a buffer built against
possible shortfalls.

•

Fiscal policy should be supported by sound PFM practices, through the adoption of a
unified budget and asset management system that covers all government operations and
that will be executed through a treasury single account at the BEAC.

•

Fiscal policy implementation should be transparent and accountable, through the
routine dissemination of fiscal policies and outcomes; the strengthening of oversight

between Chad and donor representatives, led by the World Bank and including Fund staff, in May 2006. Key

preparing a single budget nomenclature, and strengthening customs administration.

20

institutions and audits, including an enhanced ex-post oversight role for the Collège;
and corrective actions to address detected irregularities.
•

The poverty reduction strategy, including the determination of the priority sectors,
should be based on the PRSP. However, the 2003 PRSP needs to be updated, including
for the revised revenue outlook.

•

Finally, reforms to promote development of the non-oil sector should continue, so that
the non-oil sector can generate the resources needed for poverty reduction policies once
the oil revenue runs out. Key elements include improving the efficiency of basic
utilities, reforming the cotton sector, building a modern infrastructure in the finance
sector and other areas, and removing barriers to trade.

22.
The authorities agreed with the broad outlines of the medium-term strategy. They
pointed out that a full assessment of development priorities and policies to promote private
sector development would be undertaken as part of the PRSP update, which is expected to be
completed in the second half of 2007. However, they felt that is was premature to discuss a
quantitative medium-term macroeconomic framework ahead of detailed discussions about the
petroleum revenue outlook, the 2007-09 medium-term expenditure framework, and the design
of a stabilization policy which, under the July agreement with the World Bank, are planned for
September 2006.18 While stressing Chad’s extensive social needs and the population’s
expectations of immediate benefits from oil revenue, they recognized the danger of exceeding
technical and macroeconomic absorption capacity and the need to ensure long-term fiscal
sustainability. The authorities agreed that oil revenues in excess of immediate needs and
absorptive capacity should be saved for future use, but stressed that any such policy should be
flexible to allow for unexpected emergencies and other needs.
23.
The authorities concurred with the conclusion of the first regional CEMAC Article
IV consultation that the regional monetary union and the exchange rate peg had served Chad
and the other CEMAC countries well in the context of weak domestic institutional
arrangements for monetary management and a fragile domestic banking system. The authorities
and staff agreed that, taking into account recent export performance, there were no indications
that the present level of the exchange rate was hampering development of the non-oil sector;19
however, political instability, poor infrastructure, slow progress in structural reform and an
image of weak governance remain critical impediments to private sector development.

At that time, the staff will, jointly with the World Bank, also update the debt-sustainability analysis.

The staff analysis underlying the staff report on the regional discussions with the CEMAC indicated that the
current CAF franc exchange rate was close to its equilibrium level. The large terms of trade gains for Chad since
2002 and the development of the oil sector tend to suggest an appreciation of the equilibrium exchange rate for
Chad, but a definitive conclusion is premature and an assessment would need to take into account existing
structural weaknesses.

21

24.
The authorities agreed on the need to promote development of the non-oil sector.
Discussions focused on the key areas for reform identified in the PRSP and the Fund-supported
program:
•

On trade reform, the staff recommended that the authorities be guided by
recommendations of the recent Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS), including
on overhauling customs administration, the removal of tariff exemptions and temporary
surcharges on imports, and the elimination of export taxes.20

•

There has been little progress toward reform of the cotton sector and the privatization
of the state-owned cotton company. The authorities are looking forward to donor
assistance with the preparation of a poverty and social impact analysis, which, together
with a broad review of previous studies, would form the basis of a resumption of
reform.

•

The electricity sector continues to be characterized by supply shortfalls and high costs
and the state-owned electricity company depends on budget subsidies. The authorities
indicated that they intend to accelerate discussions with the World Bank on reforms,
which will also include the telephone company. Further expanding the road network
will also have priority.

•

On the financial sector, the authorities agreed with the main recommendations of the
recent regional FSAP and shared the staff’s concern about the fragility of the system;
they intend to cooperate with the COBAC in seeking improvements. In the short-run,
they intend to discuss the implications of moving toward a single treasury account with
the banks, with a view to avoid liquidity problems.

Short-term policies
25.
The discussions on short-term policies focused on a revised 2006 budget. The
supplementary budget, approved by parliament in July, incorporates oil revenues of 14 percent
of GDP, with the increase of 6 percent of GDP from 2005 largely reflecting income tax
receipts. Expenditures would rise correspondingly so that the non-oil primary deficit (on a
commitment basis) would increase from 5 percent of GDP in 2005 to 11 percent of GDP in
2006. The staff and the authorities agreed that there was little room to accommodate additional
expenditure needs identified by the multidonor mission in April 2006. However, the budget
allows for a significant acceleration of domestically-financed investment in the second half of
the year, especially in road building where absorption capacity is felt to be less constraining.
The bulk of the increase in spending for the year as a whole reflects (i) exceptional military
expenditure (almost 2 percent of GDP), most of which has already taken place; (ii) subsidies to
the electricity and cotton parastatals (1.4 percent of GDP) which would be eliminated by 2008
under World Bank-supported reform programs; and (iii) more accurate budgeting of utility

costs to avoid arrears. The budget also provides for clearance of 2005 domestic arrears;
financing would include advances from the BEAC (1 percent of GDP), use of the end-2005
balances in the oil revenue accounts (mainly from the FGF—1.3 percent of GDP) and budget
support from the AfDB (almost 1 percent of GDP).
26.
Taming inflation in the rest of 2006 is a concern. The authorities agreed that inflation
developments should be monitored closely and that macroeconomic statistics must be
strengthened to identify possible absorption and competitiveness problems as expenditure rises.
However, they agreed with staff that the increase in prices in the first-half of 2006 reflected
primarily supply side developments and security concerns, with only a minor contribution from
the growth of non-oil GDP and the recovery in private sector credit:
•

Higher inflation largely stemmed from higher prices for a small number of foods and
charcoal, whose distribution appears to have been hampered by rising insecurity.

•

Total public expenditure has been largely unchanged from 2003, despite a shift from
foreign–financed projects to domestic spending.

•

While monetary expansion was rapid in 2005, this followed stagnation in previous
years, and velocity was only slightly lower in 2005 than in 2002. Moreover, the rise in
broad money was driven by an increase in net domestic assets, which in turn reflected
financing of the cotton sector. In addition, broad money growth slowed in the first half
of 2006 (Table 5).

Technical assistance
27.
Chad urgently needs technical assistance in PFM and other areas to ensure
adequate management of the expected oil resources. The authorities appreciated the Fund’s
extensive assistance to improve PFM. However, further assistance is urgently needed to
implement the PAMFIP—for which there is broad local ownership—strengthen customs, and
effect other improvements. The staff also recommended that the authorities react promptly to
the draft data ROSC report with a view to develop a plan to strengthen the statistical database.
Resumption of the PRGF-supported program
28.
The authorities requested a rapid resumption of the PRGF-supported program
after the resolution of the dispute with the World Bank. The staff agreed on the need for a
continued close relationship, particularly given the complicated challenges facing the
authorities and the temporary nature of high oil revenue. Satisfactory implementation of the
revised 2006 budget and measures to improve PFM, as well as implementation of key structural
reforms, could facilitate the resumption of the discussions on the first review in the near future.
The authorities agreed with this approach and invited the staff to closely monitor budget
execution and the efforts to strengthen PFM in the coming months.21 The HIPC completion

23

point could be reached after at least six months of satisfactory performance under the PRGFsupported program.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
Chad faces daunting challenges in taking full advantage of the opportunities
provided by oil revenue. Political stability will be essential to allow oil wealth to be used
effectively for poverty reduction and growth and to enable the authorities to focus on policy
implementation, including sound fiscal management. In this regard, the staff welcomes the
authorities’ intention to complete a comprehensive update of the PRSP during 2007.
30.
Public financial management is in urgent need of strengthening to allow the
transparent, efficient, and effective use of public sector resources. The staff supports the
authorities’ program of action in this area, which warrants strong assistance from the
international community. The government, in turn, should commit to steady enforcement of
laws and regulations and continuity in key administrative positions to promote lasting capacity.
31.
While recognizing the population’s extensive needs and high expectations, the staff
urges the authorities to take full account of the existing absorptive capacity in managing
the anticipated oil revenue windfall. It is essential that the government reorient budget
formulation and implementation away from annual targets and more towards long-term fiscal
goals, and develop a medium-term expenditure framework consistent with macroeconomic
stability and administrative constraints. The staff welcomes the government’s intention to save
oil revenues for future years consistent with these principles and stands ready to provide
assistance in developing the appropriate policies. The 2007-09 medium-term expenditure
frameworks should be elaborated in time for the formulation of the 2007 budget.
32.
A key element in the PRSP should be a new PRMP, incorporating the revised
revenue outlook and aimed at supporting lasting poverty reduction and growth. The new
PRMP, which would be in place for the 2008 budget, should promote long-term fiscal
sustainability and macroeconomic stability, by keeping expenditure in line with Chad’s
absorptive capacity, and saving a share of oil revenue to insure some future financing of public
spending as oil would be exhausted over time. It should also contribute to the implementation
of the PRSP and include provisions for monitoring an effective execution of expenditure.
Moreover, the new PRMP should promote best PFM practices through the implementation of a
unified and sound budget and assets management system. In addition, the new PRMP should
foster transparency and accountability.
33.
Despite the expected reductions in fiscal and financing pressures, there is no room
for complacency; the implementation of ambitious structural reforms remains critical.
Chad’s temporary oil windfall should be used to develop a non-oil sector that can support the
continuation of the poverty reduction strategy when oil runs out. In the public sector, such
efforts should include strengthening non-oil revenue as well as pursuing civil service, military,
and public enterprise reform. The staff urges the authorities to intensify their efforts, in close
cooperation with the World Bank and other partners, to implement the needed reforms in the
electricity and the cotton parastatals quickly, also with a view to eliminating budgetary

24

subsidies. The staff also encourages the authorities to implement the reforms in the trade
system recommended by the recent DTIS. Finally, to improve the business climate and Chad’s
external standing, it will be important to strengthen judiciary and anticorruption efforts,
including pursuing corruption cases identified by oversight institutions.
34.
Chad’s membership in the CEMAC and its fixed exchange rate regime has
provided an important nominal anchor for macroeconomic policies. However, the risks
that the oil windfall could lead to some real appreciation of the exchange rate give additional
urgency to structural reforms to improve competitiveness. The rebound in inflation in the first
half of 2006 was concentrated in food prices and may have been driven by security concerns.
Nevertheless, the staff recommends that the authorities closely monitor price developments and
improve statistical information on prices and wages.
35.
Chad’s macroeconomic statistics are in urgent need of upgrading. The staff urges
the authorities to quickly follow-up on the recommendations of the recent data ROSC. A key
element in this regard is to provide adequate resources to the statistics institute. The staff
recommends that the authorities seek technical assistance in strengthening the statistics,
especially with regard to national accounts and prices.
36.
Satisfactory execution of the revised 2006 budget and implementation of measures
to strengthen PFM would help bring the PRGF-supported program back on track.
Progress in these areas would facilitate a resumption of discussions on the first review under
the PRGF arrangement and on a new medium-term macroeconomic program and a convincing
structural reform agenda later in the year.
37.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Chad will be held in 24
months in accordance with the provisions applying to countries under Fund
arrangements.

Performance Criteria

End-Dec. 2005

1/ Performance criteria for program indicators under A and B; indicative targets otherwise.
2/ The non-oil primary balance is the difference between total non-oil revenue, excluding grants, and total expenditure, excluding interest on domestic and external debt and externally financed
investments.
3/ Excluding revenue from the privatization of public enterprises and from the concession of exploitation or exploration permits of oil fields (CFAF 2 billion in 2005).
4/ Conventional debt refers to BEAC, Contonchad, CNPS, CNRT, ASECNA, CBT, “France Cable et Radio”, Alcatel, subscriptions, contributions to international organizations, arrears on rents,
and legal commitments. Estimates show payments, net of increase in the BEAC advances. Negative amounts indicate that increase in BEAC advance exceeded repayment on other restructured debt category.
Because of weaknesses in PFM, the composition of payments on domestic debt is difficult to ascertain. The Debt Department and the Treasury have been working on procedures to improve information
on domestic debt payments.
5/ Excluding external payments arrears incurred pending debt rescheduling.
6/ Excluding debt relief obtained in the form of rescheduling or refinancing.

Measures

Partially done with delay. The first quarterly report was published with a few months, delay, and
the second quarterly report included only partial information. The third report was published
with delay. The fourth report has not yet been published.

Not done. The MTEFs for 2006-08 for all priority sector ministries were prepared, but they were
not adopted and transmitted with the budget based on the revised PRML that was approved by
the National Assembly on February 20, 2006.

Done. The Investment Strategy was approved by the Investment Committee chaired by the
Prime Minister on April 27, 2005. The Future Generations Fund was eliminated by the
amended Petroleum Revenue Management Law (PRML), and its deposits were repatriated to
Chad by the end of 2005.

Non-observed. The creation of a payroll and civil service roster using the computerized system
for the administrative management of civil servants and payroll was not implemented as
originally envisaged by end-December 2005, owing to the need to strengthen the security
features of the payroll software.

Non-observed; the authorities took some actions, including the measurement of the stock of
the state’s domestic arrears, including all treasury arrears, and an internal audit. The terms of
reference for an external audit of domestic arrears has been elaborated but not yet approved;
the audit is expected to be completed with the European Union’s assistance by end-September
2006.

Non-observed, but implemented with a delay: The report on the first quarter of 2005 was
published with a three-week delay (on May 18, 2005), and the report on the second quarter
with a one-day delay. The third report was published with a two-week delay. The fourth report
was produced on time.

the joint staff assessment of the country’s annual progress
report.

Status
In progress. PRSP adopted on June 4,
2003, and transmitted to the Fund and
the World Bank on June 6, 2003. It was
endorsed by the Board of the Fund on
November 17, 2003. The first
implementation progress report was
finalized in December 2004 and
validated in January 2005. This report
indicated mixed progress in PRSP
implementation, as reflected in the
Bank/Fund Joint Staff Advisory Note
(EDB/05/63,6/13/05). The second
annual progress report on
implementation has been finalized at the
end of 2005 and has been transmitted to
the Government for approval. The
Chadian authorities have decided to
proceed with a revision of the 2003
PRSP during 2006, aiming at completion
in early 2007.

Macroeconomic Stability
Continue maintenance of macroeconomic stability and
satisfactory implementation of the PRGF-supported program.

Governance
• Make satisfactory progress in strengthening public
expenditure management to facilitate the identification and
tracking of poverty-related spending, as evidenced by the
implementation for at least six months of the simplified and
computerized expenditure circuit and of a functional
expenditure-tracing system for primary education services.

Delayed. A new PRGF was approved on
February 16, 2005. The first review has
been delayed, reflecting severe cashflow crisis registered in 2005 and the
uncertain fiscal outlook for 2006. The
authorities wish to resume the PRGFsupported program as soon as possible.
In progress. Simplified expenditure and
its limited computerization circuit
introduced in January 2002. The
Integrated Finance Management
Information System was implemented.
Interface of treasury operations, the
payroll, the technology department, and
the administrative and
finance departments and the
implementation of the SYGASPE are not
yet implemented, and require additional
external financing. According to

•

Adopt a new law on public procurement code and its
application decrees; publish a quarterly bulletin on public
procurement; complete audits by internationally reputed
firms for the five largest public procurement contracts
granted in 2001; adopt the Budget Settlement Law for 2000
before the adoption of the Budget Law for 2002, and,
similarly, adopt the Budget Settlement Law for 2001 before
the adoption of the Budget Law for 2003; and nominate the
judges for the commercial courts in the five largest cities.

•

Adopt a governance strategy and action plan in consultation
with IDA and the IMF and implement it for at least one year.

In progress. The procurement code was
signed by the head of state in December
2003, and implementation decrees were
adopted and published. Eight quarterly
bulletins on public procurement were
issued. Bidding commissions were set
up in priority sectors, and are being set
up in other sectors. The audits of the five
biggest contracts awarded in 2001, 2002
and 2003 were completed by Ernst and
Young and the Court of Account.
Budget Settlements laws
for 2000–2004 were presented to
Parliament and adopted by the
Parliament (except for 2000, due to
incomplete information on investment
spending). Commercial courts in
N’Djamena and Bongor were built, and
those of Moundou, Sahr, and Abéché
are being finalized (only the N’Djamena
court is operational). Judges for the
courts have been appointed by decree.
In progress. The governance strategy
and action plan were adopted in August
2002. The customs reform plan, adopted
in early 2003 but not fully implemented
due to scarce financing, has been
incorporated in the donor-supported plan
for modernizing the State’s finance
management (PAMFIP).

condoms sold in 2000.
•

Increase the treated cases of genital ulcers to at least 30,000
a year, up from 12,000 in 1998, and the treated cases of
purulent urethritis to at least 40,000 a year, up from 21,000
in 1998. Decrease the prevalence of syphilis among
pregnant women from 6 percent in 1998 to, at most, 4
percent.

Education
• Increase the gross enrollment rate to at least 61 percent for
girls and 89 percent for boys, up from 50 percent and
85 percent, respectively, in 1998–99.
Reduce the repeater rate from 26 percent in 1998–99 to, at most,
22 percent.
Basic infrastructure
Ensure that at least 50 percent of the all-year road network can
be used throughout the year (80 percent of the network cannot
be used for three to five months during the rainy season).
Rural development
Increase access to potable water to at least 32 percent, up from
27 percent in 2000.
•

Increase the share of agricultural families equipped with
plows from 24 percent in 2000 to at least 26 percent.

•

For livestock holders, increase the number of water points by
at least 10 percent, relative to 1,138 water points in 2000.

Status
Completed. At end-2004, DPT3
vaccination rate was estimated at 47
percent. Assisted-delivery rate in public
health centers and hospitals was
estimated at 24 percent at
end-2004.
Completed. MASOCOT sold 3168
million in 2003, an increase of 41.5
percent.
Completed. The treated cases of genital
ulcers reached 44,545 per year. The
treatment of purulent urethritis reached
73,419 cases per year. It is notable that
in 2003–2004 there was a net reduction
in the number of genital ulcers and
purulent urethritis because health
centers treated 274,113 cases of HIV
each year since 1999.
Completed. Gross primary enrollment
rate (GPER) was 69.3 percent for girls
in 2003–2004 and 105.7 percent for
boys.
Completed. The repeater rate declined
to 22.05 percent in 2003–2004.
Completed. At end-2004, 61 percent of
all-year road network could be used
throughout the year, up from 43.5
percent at end-2001.
Completed. Access reached 32 percent
at end-2003 and 36 percent at end2004.
Completed. In March 2005, the Ministry
of Agriculture cut the selling price of
plows: all plows were bought, and the
26percent target was achieved.

Completed. The number of water points
increased by 19.5 percent. There were
1,360 water points built at end-2004.

Annex I: Short- and Long-Term Measures to Strengthen Public Finance Management (PFM)
The mission assisted the authorities in forming a comprehensive and operational action
plan for improving PFM over the next three years.22 The mission cooperated with Bank
staff and donor-financed experts. The plan is expected to form the basis of an update of the
PAMFIP, for which several donors have committed support and whose short-term measures
allow the authorities to establish the track record in PFM that would allow discussions on
completing the first review under the PRGF arrangement to begin. This plan draws from
(i) the PFM action plan presented by the government during the recent multidonor mission;
(ii) the “discussions framework” agreed by Chad and the World Bank in the context of the
interim agreement; and (iii) discussions with the Chadian authorities during this mission.
I. Short-Term PFM Measures
The implementation of the PFM measures would require significant and coordinated
technical assistance, and most of them can only be completed over the medium term. In the
short term, reform progress could be through the following actions:
Restore budget discipline
•

Before the end of June 2006, prepare a revised budget for 2006 that incorporates all
indirect oil revenue and additional expenditure needs identified by the Multi-donor
Mission (MDM) (M1, O1, A1.b23). Status of implementation: Law 025/PR/2006
signed by President Deby on July 19 together with implementing decree
611/PR/PM/MF/06.

•

By early June 2006, issue a ministerial order by the prime minister with a realistic
timetable for 2007 budget preparation, giving the sector ministries sufficient time to
adapt their budget programs to available budget envelopes. For the 2008 budget, a
similar ministerial order should be issued by the end of December 2006, including
adequate deadlines for macroeconomic framework completion, budget circulars
dissemination, and medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) and program
budgets updates (M3, O2, A2.a,b). Status of implementation: Circular 843/PM/06
signed by Primer Minister Yoadimnadji on June 13, 2006.

•

To limit budget overruns, restrict exceptional expenditure procedures (PSOP) to
transportation and mission costs, external debt and wage payments, and exceptional
cases (July 2006) (M7, O4, A4.a). A circular issued by the prime minister should

43

remind the administration of this issue. Status of implementation: Circular
006/PM/CAB/06 signed by Prime Minister Yoadimnadji on June 30, 2006.
•

Engage external auditors with EU financing to audit treasury-verified domestic
payment arrears, with the aim of finalizing a settlement plan for arrears and domestic
debt by the end of September 2006 (M8, O1, A1.a,b). Status of implementation: Bid
received from an audit house on August 3. The EC Delegation is checking that the bid
complies with EU rules, but the contract should be approved shortly. The auditing
team is expected to arrive in late August.

•

Adopt a MTEF for 2007–09, consistent with both Chad’s absorptive capacity and the
2007 budget, to be presented to parliament along with the 2007 budget (October
2006) (M1, O1, A1). Status of implementation: First version provided with the June
16, 2006 Lettre de Cadrage. Refinement expected following refinement of ministerial
program budgets provided on July 20, 2006.

•

Put in place the opening of credits for the 2007 budget on January 1, 2007, to start
budget execution at the beginning of the fiscal year (M3, O2, A2.c).

Improve cash management
•

Prepare and implement a monthly cash-flow plan, based on monthly commitment
plans for at least the health, education, and infrastructure ministries. The Treasury
Committee will be responsible for updating the plan regularly and prepare the
minutes of its weekly meetings, to be submitted to the minister of finance within
48 hours (June 2006) (M7, O1, A1.a,b). Status of implementation: The cash-flow
plan was completed on June 15, 2006, and updated on June 29, July 25, and August 4.

•

Gradually reestablish the treasury single account at the BEAC by (i) the disbursing
all indirect petroleum revenue in the current account at the BEAC, from June 2006;
(ii) stopping the opening of new treasury accounts with the commercial banks in
N’Djamena as of end-July 2006; (iii) close all treasury accounts with the commercial
banks that have a positive balance or that are not subject to a convention on debt
repayment (or other binding contract for treasury transactions), by end-September
2006; (4) sign a plan by end-December 2006, to suspend transactions through
accounts with the commercial banks and pay off credit balances, with the aim of
closing all accounts with the commercial banks before end-June 2007. In addition, an
updated list of all government accounts in commercial banks, and the respective
reconciliation statements, should be made available no later than end-September
2006 (M7, O2, A2.a-d). Status of implementation: The June 30 payment of income
tax by the oil consortium has been deposited to the BEAC; the General Directorate
of the Treasury has instructed the consortium that future payments must be deposited
into the BEAC.

44

Limit the use of uncompetitive biddings and streamline procurement
•

Get procurement plans, prepared by priority line ministries, approved by the general
public procurement office (end-June 2006) (M14, O1, A1.e). Status of
implementation: Procurements plans have been provided for four ministries. Priority
sector ministries are said to have provided plans for oil-financed contracts to the
College, which have not yet received by staff.

•

Issue an instruction by the prime minister restating that all noncompetitive bidding
not in compliance with the procurement code is forbidden and should stop
immediately (M14, O1, A1.a). Status of implementation: Circular
008/PR/SGG/OCMP/) signed by Primer Minister Yoadimnadji on August 1, 2006.

Monitoring budget execution
•

By September 2006, audit government oil bank accounts transactions (escrow
accounts and commercial bank accounts), and check the 2005 tax returns filed by oil
companies by end-December 2006 (M12, O1, A1; M10, O1, A1.d).

•

Review the budget nomenclature and its codification–including a fully fledged
functional classification—to ensure consistency with a consolidated budget, and
identify functions and subfunctions linked to the poverty reduction priorities defined
in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper. A decree with the revised nomenclature
should be issued by end-December 2006. (M3, O3, A3.a-g).

•

Expand the computerized system (SYDONIA++) for custom administration—at least
on the operations conducted in N’Djamena customs offices, which represent
90 percent of customs activities—to produce monthly statistics on imports and
exports using harmonized code, on a detailed and consolidated basis, and by type of
tax. The customs directorate should also prepare, and submit to the minister of
finance, monthly reports showing reconciliation with treasury data (December 2006)
(M3, O6, A6.a).

•

Establish a computerized mapping table to reconcile the current treasury accounting
system with the budget integrated system of expenditure (CID) in order to track
spending from commitments to payments and facilitate producing the four-phase
tables (December 2006) (M3, O5, A5.c(i)).

II. Long-Term PFM Measures
The main medium-/long-term objective agreed to with authorities is updating and
modernizing the current framework for preparing, executing, and monitoring a consolidated
public sector budget by end-December 2008, so as to reduce budget fragmentation and
optimize budget allocations.
This objective will require in particular to:

45

Budget preparation, execution and monitoring
•

Entrust the Ministry of Finance (MOF) with full responsibility for preparing and
implementing a unified budget management system through the consolidation of the
ordinary, oil, HIPC, and, when possible, donor budgets. Finance decisions on donorfinanced projects should move from the Ministry of Planning to the MOF (2007).

•

Improve tax and customs revenue collections. Although efforts have been made to
collect tax and customs revenue, there is still some untapped tax revenue that could
raise the level of receipts (only about 50 percent of local enterprises are taxed)
(2007).

•

By end-December 2007, have an established mechanism for better forecasting,
accounting and controlling wages, pensions, and utility charges for each ministry that
represents a large fraction of public expenditure.

•

In addition to short-term measures on the “exceptional expenditure” procedures and
the cash management plan, develop a strategy to gradually reduce the causes of
payments arrears by regulating the use of budget appropriations; introducing
mandatory mid-year budget review, limiting appropriation carryovers from year to
year; and meeting, then shortening, the additional authorized accounting period
(2007).

•

Expand the treasury’s accounting system to include all government finance
transactions. In particular, it should be expanded to reflect all operations related to the
oil revenue offshore account and donor-financed project funds, in a timely and
reliable manner (2007).

•

Streamline the ex ante control chain, by removing redundant controls exercised by
finance comptrollers and the Collège, and strengthen ex post controls, especially onsite audits, by (i) coordinating the activities of agencies responsible for these controls,
(ii) developing methodologies based on risk analysis, (iii) giving preference to
auditing delivery of goods and services and combating corruption, and (iii) ensuring
the sequencing, quality, and usefulness of reports and the effective application of
sanctions (2007).

•

In addition to closing the treasury accounts in the commercial banks, finalize the
reestablishment of the Treasury Single Account (TSA) at BEAC, by integrating oil
revenue bank accounts (2007) and, if possible, donors project accounts in TSA
subaccounts at the BEAC (2008).

•

Develop a new fully computerized treasury accounting system compatible with the
CID and other Ministry of Finance applications, so as to be able to prepare
comprehensive, reliable and timely budgets and finance reports tracking expenditure
from commitment to payment (December 2008).

46

•

Review the legal and accounting framework for PFM, setting a new budget organic
law and public accounting regulations, including, for example, strict budget
preparation rules and a timetable, harmonized budget and accounting classifications,
responsibilities for expenditure and revenue forecasting, and responsibilities and
processes for budget execution, control, and audit (December 2008).

•

By end-December 2007, update the current computerized system for registering
commitments and payment orders (CID), including the new budget classification
component, and by end-December 2008, develop interfaces with the payroll,
pensions, and external and internal debt management systems.

Budget execution oversight and audits
•

Establish control and audit procedures for tracking, at each stage of the expenditure
cycle, a well-defined sample of poverty reduction spending. The sample would be
defined on a risk-analysis basis. The controls and audits embedded in the tracking
system could be performed by internal control bodies and, if necessary, with the
assistance of reputed external auditors. The civil society participation would be
ensured through Collège involvement in the audits, and the organization of regular
meetings for presenting and discussing the results of the initiative, with the
participation of line ministries and donors (2007).

•

Publish the annual reports prepared by the audit bodies (Collège, Inspection Generale
des Finance, Ministry of State Control, and National Audit Office), and include in all
control and audit reports an assessment on the implementation of previous
recommendations (2007).

Oil revenue management
•

Strengthen fiscal transparency, including through the Collège’s enhanced role in
assessing the implementation of priority sector programs as a whole and in increasing
public awareness on the use of oil revenue (2007).

•

Review the PRML to implement a simpler and transparent oil revenue management
system, covering indirect oil revenue (2007).

Annex II. Letter from Minister of Finance Tolli to the Managing Director
REPUBLIC OF CHAD
OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC
OFFICE OF THE PRIME MINISTER
MINISTRY OF FINANCE
GENERAL SECRETARIAT
No. 206/MF/SG/06
N’Djamena, July 31, 2006
Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund (IMF)
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Mr. de Rato:
I am pleased to confirm Chad’s intention to cooperate with the International Monetary Fund
in the area of economic policy.
The first review of the program supported by the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF) could not be held at the end of September 2005 as planned because of expenditure
overruns and delays in concluding discussions on the 2006 budget law. These delays
stemmed from uncertainty surrounding the revision of the Petroleum Revenue Management
Law (PRML) and the ensuing difference of opinion with the World Bank. The World Bank
and the government of Chad have now concluded a memorandum of understanding
concerning the management of oil revenue.
On July 19, 2006, the National Assembly approved the supplementary budget for fiscal 2006
(Table 1). This budget law takes into account the provisions agreed to with the IMF and the
World Bank, as well as the conclusions and recommendations contained in the aide-mémoire
of June 20, 2006 prepared by the visiting Fund mission. The policies and measures
underpinning the budget are described in the cover letter to the budget law when it was
submitted to parliament. The budget law also takes into account the memorandum of
understanding concluded with the World Bank. Moreover, for 2007, that memorandum calls
for the allocation of 70 percent of budgetary resources to the sectors it identifies. The revised
PRSP now being prepared, which is expected to be completed in 2007, will provide a new
framework for the management of oil revenue based on the projected revenue trend.
Management of the windfall in oil revenue expected in coming years poses a major
challenge; it will be necessary to craft a mechanism for including in expenditure an amount
sufficient to make a lasting contribution to poverty reduction in Chad. Accordingly, it will be
necessary to build the technical capacities of the staff of the government of Chad to ensure

48

that the additional resources are used efficiently and rationally, because exceptional revenue
raises complex macroeconomic and fiscal management issues.
The government of Chad requests IMF support to meet the challenges it faces in carrying out
this program. The government hopes that discussions on the PRGF-supported program will
resume as soon as possible. Chad’s economic policy incorporates the fundamentals of the
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies attached to the government’s letter of
February 4, 2005. Moreover, the government agrees fully with the conclusions and
recommendations stated in the aide-mémoire of June 20, 2006. It will request IMF assistance
for implementation and assessment of this policy, as reflected in the supplementary budget
for 2006 and the general agreement concluded July 13, 2006, and is taking due account of the
objectives and structural measures set out in the attached Tables 2 and 3.
Speaking on behalf of Chad, I am convinced that the policies and measures contained in the
Fund missions aide-mémoire and incorporated into our supplementary budget are sufficient
for the rapid resumption of discussions on the PRGF-supported program. However, in the
first half of this year it has become clear that considerable doubts remain, particularly about
the security situation and spending on security and other needs. Should the situation take a
very different turn from the one adopted as a basic assumption in our discussions with recent
missions, the IMF will be consulted on any macroeconomic and fiscal measures that may
prove necessary. It will also be consulted concerning any other measure that may
substantially alter Chad’s economic performance in 2006, and will be given periodic updates
of the cash flow plan. Data required for assessing the progress of implementation of the
economic and financial policy will be reported to the IMF regularly.
Sincerely yours,
/s/
Abbas Mahamat Tolli
Minister of Finance

VIII. Safeguards Assessments
The Bank of the Central African States (BEAC) is the regional central bank of the Central
African States, of which Chad is a member. A safeguards assessment of the BEAC
completed on August 30, 2004, found that the BEAC had implemented a number of measures
to strengthen its safeguard framework since the 2001 safeguards assessment, but that further
progress needs to be made in key areas.
The main recommendations of the assessment, applicable to the BEAC as an institution,
include (i) preparation of finance statements in full accordance with an internationally
recognized accounting framework, initially the European Central Bank guidelines;
(ii) publication of the BEAC’s full finance statements, together with the auditor’s report,
starting with the 2003 finance statements; (iii) formulation of Board-approved formal
guidelines under which the BEAC governor is authorized to make exceptional advances to
BEAC member countries; (iv) annual review by the BEAC internal audit department of the
process of program data reporting of member countries to the IMF; (v) implementation of a
risk-based audit approach, and finalization of a charter, for the internal audit function; and
(vi) systematic follow-up of all recommendations pertaining to the BEAC’s system of
internal controls to be coordinated by the internal audit department, with regular reporting to
the Audit Committee and the BEAC governor.

56

Other priority recommendations of the assessment, but of a country-specific nature, were:
(i) the BEAC should clarify with its member countries that hold foreign reserves outside the
BEAC the statutory basis and circumstances for doing so, to avoid an apparent conflict with
the BEAC statutes and to ensure full transparency of reporting of reserves by the member
country; (ii) the BEAC and its member states are encouraged to establish a mechanism to
prevent overdue payment to the Fund and facilitate timely payments through advance
acquisitions of SDRs and an authorization to debit the SDR account of the member; and
(iii) the BEAC should cooperate with its members to reconcile and confirm the treasury
balances to ensure that the balances reported by the BEAC in respect to credit to government,
as reflected in the accounts of the treasuries, are in agreement with the BEAC.
IX.

Exchange Rate Arrangement

Chad is a member of the BEAC. The exchange system common to all members of the BEAC
has been free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions.
The BEAC common currency is the CFA franc, which was formerly pegged to the French
franc. Repurchase of the CFA franc banknotes exported outside the BEAC was suspended on
August 2, 1993. Effective January 12, 1994, the CFA franc was devalued by 50 percent in
foreign currency terms, and the exchange rate was adjusted from F 1 = CFAF 50 to F 1 =
CFAF 100. Since January 1, 1999, the CFA franc has been pegged to the euro at the fixed
rate of EUR 1 = CFAF 655.97. On June 5, 2006, the rate of the CFA franc, in terms of the
SDR, was CFAF 440.25 = SDR 1.
X.

Article IV Consultations

Chad is on the standard 12-month cycle. The last discussions for the 2003 Article IV
consultation were held in N’Djamena during October 29–November 11, 2003. The staff
report (IMF Country Report No. 04/115) was discussed by the Executive Board on March 19,
2004.

APPENDIX II: Chad: Relations with the World Bank Group
I. Partnership in Chad’s Development Strategy
1.
Oil provides a major opportunity for Chad to diversify its economy and break free of
poverty, as long as the additional resources from oil are well managed, in particular, to avoid
the “paradox of abundance” in which large inflows of oil revenue weaken the government’s
incentive to control its spending and undertake reforms, to the detriment of long-term growth
and poverty reduction. To ensure that petroleum revenue support rapid poverty reduction,
Chad, with assistance from the Bank, set up a unique regulatory and institutional framework
for checks and balances in the use of petroleum revenue. The National Assembly adopted on
December 30, 1998, a Petroleum Revenue Management Law (PRML) to regulate the use of
the government revenue from the exploitation of the oil fields of Miandoum, Komé, and
Bolobo, which started in July 2003.
2.
Under the PRML, the bulk of direct oil revenue (royalties and dividends) would be
allocated to road construction, health, education, rural development, and water and
environment (priority sectors), with activities deemed to enhance poverty reduction. The
PRML established an oversight committee, the Collège de Contrôle et de Surveillance des
Ressources Pétrolières (CCSRP), with representatives of the government, Parliament, and
civil society, to monitor the use of petroleum revenue. In addition, the law established a fund
for future generations (FFG), which received 10 percent of the direct revenue, to be saved for
the future. This regulatory approach was regarded as very innovative, and provided the
framework under which the Bank and other donors continued to provide significant finance
and technical support to Chad.
3.
In late December 2005, the Government of Chad, without consultations with the Bank
and other donors, revised the PRML and specifically (i) abolished the FFG and the provided
for the repatriation of its balance by decree; (ii) expanded the list of priority sectors financed
by earmarked oil revenue to include energy, justice, territorial administration, and domestic
security, and entrusted the Government with the authority to revise the list of priority sectors;
(iii) increased the share of oil revenue allocated to the general budget from 13½ percent (the
original 15 percent net of the FFG) to 30 percent; (iv) extended the coverage of the PRML to
all oil fields to be developed in Chad; and (v) extended the mandate of the members of the
Collège from three to nine years.
4.
While there were some positive aspects of the revision (the extension of the coverage
of the PRML to all oil fields), the modifications and the process of the revision largely
compromised the original objectives of the PRML. Thus, in response, on January 6, 2006,
World Bank management suspended disbursements on Bank projects and froze transfers
from the off-shore oil revenue escrow account. Subsequently, the Bank and the Government
entered into a dialogue to resolve the impasse, and during January 29–February 1, 2006,
delegations of the World Bank and the Government met in Paris to discuss options for
reengagement. Following these meetings, a multipartner mission (March 24–April 6, 2006),
with the participation of key partners (France, Germany, and the United States and AfDB,

60

EU, IMF, UNHCR, UNDP, and the World Bank), enabled Chad and its partners to share
views and reach a common understanding on the major challenges in the implementation of
the poverty reduction strategy, including the refugee situation in Darfur and security
concerns. This prepared the groundwork for further high-level discussions the Bank and the
Government of Chad. On April 25, 2006, the two parties signed an interim agreement that
paved the way for a series of phased actions by both parties for the resumption of
cooperation. The World Bank lifted the suspension of disbursements on its portfolio in Chad.
On its side, the Government agreed to (i) adopt a 2006 revised budget law that will specify
that 70 percent of oil revenue will be used for priority poverty programs (excluding security);
and (ii) take parallel actions to strengthen the monitoring, transparency, and accountability of
oil revenue as well as public finance resources and development assistance more broadly.
The two parties also agreed to prepare a comprehensive agreement to guide the management
of oil resources in Chad.
II. World Bank Country Assistance Strategy
5.
Chad’s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) was formally endorsed by the
Boards of the World Bank and the Fund on November 13, 2003, and November 17, 2003,
respectively. Good governance, sound macroeconomic management, and rapid economic
growth are among the five strategic axes of the PRSP. The strategy underlines the need for
strong and sustained growth in the non-oil sector, improved human capital, improved living
conditions for vulnerable groups, and preservation of the environment. The World Bank’s
assistance program in Chad is laid out in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), which was
endorsed by the World Bank Board on December 11, 2003. The CAS supports two key
strategic objectives in line with Chad’s PRSP: (i) strengthening governance, including public
resource management; and (ii) ensuring inclusive, broad-based growth as the country
embarks on oil production.
The IDA Portfolio of Projects
6.
The current IDA portfolio of projects (Annex 1) supports investments in key sectors
for social and economic services (health, education, energy, rural development, and
transport). Recently closed projects have supported capacity building for public expenditure
management, management of the petroleum sector, local development, and environmental
management; and the exploitation of Chad’s petroleum resources.
7.
Support to the reform program: The Bank provided three quick-disbursing policy
reform operations for a total of US$85 million from 1996 to 1999 in support of the
government’s reform program. These reforms have largely focused on transparency and
accountability in expenditure management, public procurement system, and promoting
sustainable growth and reducing rural poverty. The last adjustment credit, the Institutional
Reform Support Credit (IRSC) of US$25 million, was approved by the Board on November
30, 2004, and closed in December 2005. The IRSC, building on the previous credits (SAC IV
and SAC V), supported reforms to (i) improve public sector governance through enhanced
transparency, rule of law, and participation; (ii) promote a more efficient use of resources

61

through better management, improved procurement, and civil service reform; and (iii)
promote sustainable growth in the rural sector by reforming the cotton sector. The
implementation of these reforms benefited from the Management of the Petroleum Economy
Project (GEEP), an IDA-supported capacity building and technical assistance project that
closed in 2005.
8.
Contribution to the Petroleum Sector: The Bank Group has made a substantial
contribution to the development of the oil sector in Chad. On June 6, 2000, the Executive
Board of the World Bank approved the Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project, for
which it provided an IBRD loan equivalent to US$39.5 million to the Republic of Chad, as
well as US$14.2 million in A-Loans and up to US$42.7 million in B-Loans from the
International Finance Corporation to the oil transportation company in Chad. A
complementary IDA-funded Petroleum Sector Management Capacity-Building Project,
aimed at promoting environmentally and socially sound management of the petroleum sector,
was approved simultaneously for US$23.7 million. In complement, the Management of the
Petroleum Economy Project, in the amount of US$17.5 million, aimed at building capacity
for public finance management, was approved in January 2000. The IBRD and IDA projects
associated with the pipeline construction closed in June 2005. Successor capacity-building
projects have been under preparation.
9.
Projects under preparation: Two capacity-building projects are under preparation
to further strengthen the management of public finance and the petroleum sector, which are
scheduled for presentation to the Board of Executive Directors in FY07. The FY06–07
lending program also includes an Urban Development Project. Support to the cotton sector
reform program, a budget support operation, and the demobilization and reintegration of
armed rebels and soldiers are also under consideration.
Non-Lending Activities
10.
In addition to these lending activities, the World Bank has been carrying out
nonlending activities, including (i) annual public expenditure reviews since 2002, a Country
Finance Accountability Assessment (2004) and, jointly with the IMF, the HIPC monitoring
of progress in public finance management (PFM), which laid the ground for the preparation
by the Government, in 2004, of a comprehensive action plan for the reform of PFM; (ii)
technical support for the implementation of a medium-term expenditure framework and
program budgets in the priority sectors; (iii) the preparation of an education status report; (iv)
a Poverty and Social Impact Analysis of the consequences of the reforms in the cotton sector;
and (v) a Diagnostic Trade Integration Study finalized and disseminated in November 2005.
The Bank is also providing technical assistance to the PRSP Steering Committee for PRSP
implementation and monitoring, jointly with other donors, and has launched a Development
Policy Review/Poverty Assessment to be completed in FY07. This work will provide an indepth assessment of economic and policy issues and strategic choices for promoting growth
and poverty reduction over the medium-term. The Bank will produce a CAS progress report
in FY07.

62

III. Bank-Fund Collaboration
11.
The IMF takes the lead in the dialogue on the macroeconomic framework, the setting
of macroeconomic objectives and targets, and revenue mobilization, notably tax polices. The
Bank leads the policy dialogue in critical sectors such as education, health, electricity, water,
rural development and transport. The Bank also leads the dialogue in cotton sector and
energy sector reforms, in close collaboration with the Fund. The Fund focuses, in particular,
on monitoring the fiscal impact of some key reform measures, for example, the increase in
the wage bill and government subsidies to Cotontchad and the electricity company. In
addition, the Bank has taken the lead in assessing the poverty and social impact of reforms
undertaken in the cotton sector, as mentioned above. The dialogue pertaining to many areas
of policy reforms, including on governance, oil revenue management, and public finance
management is shared by the Bank and the Fund. In all these areas, the Bank and the Fund
maintain close dialogue, with each institution focusing on specific components.
12.
The Bank and the Fund share the responsibility on the monitoring of HIPC Initiative
completion point triggers, with the Bank taking the lead on triggers in the health, education,
rural development, and infrastructure sectors, and the IMF taking the lead on macroeconomic
performance, with shared responsibility for monitoring governance-related triggers. The
Bank and the Fund also collaborate closely on the dialogue pertaining to the PRSP.

APPENDIX III: Chad: Statistical Issues
While data provision for surveillance is still adequate overall, staff’s analysis was affected by
shortcomings in balance of payments, government finance, and monetary statistics. A ROSC
data module mission that visited N’Djamena during May–June 2005, found that Chad’s
statistical system continues to be weak and suffers from a shortage of both finance and
human resources. More specifically, the ROSC mission identified a number of weaknesses,
such as inadequate funding for the INSEED, weak source data for national accounts,
insufficient coverage of government finance and monetary statistics, improper sectorization
of public entities in all datasets, absence of dissemination of government finance statistics by
the Ministry of Economy and Finance, and generally limited data and metadata accessibility.
The compilation of macroeconomic statistics is decentralized, involving several government
ministries and the national directorate of the BEAC. The statistics directorate at the National
Institute of Statistics, Economic, and Demographic Studies (INSEED) is in charge of the
national accounts and the consumer price index (CPI), as well as the production and
dissemination of statistics on the population and certain social indicators. The Ministry of
Finance is responsible for compiling fiscal data. The BEAC is responsible for monetary
statistics and the balance of payments statistics. The CPI is published biweekly, and other
data are disseminated by the authorities on a periodic basis. Each month, the BEAC
disseminates Chad’s available monetary and finance statistics through its website
(www.beac.org) and re-disseminates other macroeconomic statistics on a regular basis.
During the recent ROSC mission, the authorities expressed a strong interest in reforming the
statistical system but said they lacked the resources—both human and finance—to do so. An
important step in this direction was the implementation of a new set of national accounts in
line with the System of National Accounts 1993 (1993 SNA) in 1998. The adoption in 1999
by the government of a law to regulate and enhance statistical activity provides a new
impetus for collecting and disseminating statistical data.
Chad has also adopted the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) as its statistical
development framework; statistical metadata have been posted on the Fund’s Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board since September 2002. However, Chad has not made annual
updates to the metadata and, as a result, plans for improvements are outdated.
Real Sector
In early 1998, the authorities started compiling a new set of national accounts, conforming
with the methodological requirements of the 1993 SNA, and retained 1995 as a base year.
Notable improvements include the compilation of an input-output table that incorporates
nonmarket household production and improved coverage of informal activities. However,
there remains a need to refine the data-updating process, notably to account for structural
changes in the economy. According to the ROSC assessment, source data for national
accounts compilation remain a weak area, which is related to inadequate funding for the
compiling agency. In addition, dissemination of data and metadata to the public could be

64

improved by more timely releases and more detailed information. The only price index
available is the CPI, which is based on outdated 1972 weights. It is therefore important that
efforts aimed at producing a harmonized consumer price index for the Central African
Economic and Monetary Community countries be continued with the assistance of the
regional statistical office (AFRISTAT), and that the planned household consumption survey
be completed.
Public finance
Chad has not yet been able to resume reporting of detailed data for publication in the
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. Annual fiscal data to 2001 have been reported and
published in the International Finance Statistics (IFS) but include significant discrepancies
between the deficit and total financing. The 2000 multisector mission noted that there was no
comprehensive and systematic compilation of government finance statistics. The quarterly
Tableau des Opérations Financières de l’État, compiled by a working group, mainly for the
purpose of the Fund-supported program, is based on several disparate sources. The mission
recommended that systematic procedures be established for the compilation of government
finance statistics, based, to the extent possible, on a unified set of accounting and
administrative records that would be implemented only after a comprehensive review of the
public accounting system.
Monetary sector
The BEAC regularly reports monetary, interest rates, and exchange rate statistics for
publication in IFS, but their timelines needs to be improved. There are significant delays in
the compilation of data by the national agency of the BEAC, and its communication to the
headquarters of the BEAC. In addition, the coverage of monetary statistics for Chad is
limited to the central bank and active commercial banks. Microfinance corporations, a
growing source of finance in Chad, are excluded, together with other units in the finance
sector. The monetary and fiscal indicators on net credit to government cannot be reconciled,
owing to differences in the institutional coverage of units in general government and the
public sector. In addition, accuracy is affected by large cross-border movements of currency
among CEMAC member countries. About 34 percent of banknotes issued in Chad by the
national BEAC directorate circulate in Cameroon, while currency in circulation in Chad
includes some 15 percent of banknotes from Cameroon and 6 percent of notes from the
Central African Republic.
In addition to the recent ROSC data module and the May 2005 multisector statistics missions
to Chad, STA has provided technical assistance in monetary statistics on a regional basis to
the BEAC, including support of the BEAC’s migration path to the Monetary and Finance
Statistics Manual. The migration will involve an expansion in both the institutional coverage
and the availability of detailed information by instrument. STA has participated in regional
BEAC monetary statistics workshops and offered its regional training seminars in monetary
and finance statistics biannually in French at the Joint Africa Institute.

65

Balance of payments
As in other CEMAC countries, the national agency of the BEAC is responsible for the
compilation of the balance of payments statistics for Chad. The poor quality of the balance of
payments statistics appears to be related to inadequate staffing and provision of finance and
physical resources dedicated to balance of payments compilation. The foreign trade data,
compiled by the DSEED on the basis of customs declarations, are known to be unreliable,
and to suffer from coverage problems; in addition, they are believed to be inconsistent with
those used in the compilation of national accounts. Consequently, they are not fully used by
the BEAC in the compilation of balance of payments data. Data on exports are estimated
based on data provided by line ministers. Even considering the difficulty of collecting data
on informal border trade between Chad and its neighboring countries, many improvements
could be made on such items as imports, cotton and cattle exports, freight, and public
transfers. Tighter coordination among the CEMAC, DSEED, and other agencies is required
in order to improve the data coverage. The 2000 multisector technical assistance mission, the
first STA mission to Chad in 10 years, provided a thorough assessment of requirements in the
area of balance of payments statistics. It found the compilation system and procedures for
balance of payments statistics, recently revised to conform to the Balance of Payments
Manual (fifth edition) (BPM5), to be conceptually sound but flawed in their application,
owing to the absence of documented sources and methods, understaffing, and lack of
training. In all of these areas, the mission made specific recommendations. This situation
implies that the authorities’ commitment to strengthen the human and technical resources
needs to be reconfirmed
Poverty indicators
In early 2003, with assistance from the World Bank, the government launched a household
survey on income and expenditure. The results of the survey will provide definitions of a
poverty line and the main poverty indicators (incidence, depth, and severity).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
CHAD
Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the African Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by David Andrews and Michael Hadjimichael
December 11, 2006
1.
This supplement reflects discussions with the authorities during a mission to
conclude the 2006 Article IV consultations from October 26 to November 15.24 It
presents an update on developments since the issuance of the attached staff report and
provides a description and analysis of the medium-term macroeconomic framework, the
budget for 2007, and an updated Debt Sustainability Analysis (Country Report No. 05/74),
for which adequate data were not available at the time the staff report was issued. The staff
appraisal has been updated in light of these discussions and recent developments.
V. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
2.
Chad’s political and security situation is precarious. The armed opposition
escalated attacks after the end of the rainy season in August, prompting the government to
declare a State of Emergency and the UN to declare security phase IV for Eastern Chad and
Phase III for N’Djamena. The conflict is also becoming more regional in character; the
Darfur war is spilling over into eastern Chad, causing many casualties and additional refugee
flows, while rebel activity in the north-east of the Central African Republic reportedly
includes Chadian groups.
3.
The growth outlook for 2006 is better than anticipated at the time of the staff
report, but inflation remains a concern. The higher real GDP growth in 2006 (1.3 percent)
reflects higher non-oil growth offsetting a somewhat larger fall in oil production than
envisaged earlier. The main cause of the high inflation (15 percent during October 2005–06)
was a 67 percent rise in meat prices over the same period, which was attributed to higher
meat exports to neighboring countries following avian flu concerns and a shift from imports
to domestic supply by oil-sector workers. Excluding meat, inflation amounted to 4.4 percent
in the 12 months to October.
24

The mission consisted of Mr. Snoek (Head), Mr. Camard (Resident Representative), Mr.
Melhado, Ms. Lacoche (all AFR), and Mr. Buissé (FAD). The mission worked closely with a
concurrent World Bank mission.

2
4.
The settlement of an income tax dispute with two of the three companies in the
consortium producing Chad’s oil resulted in additional revenue equivalent to 8 percent
of non-oil GDP (most of which was paid in October).25 The extra revenue coupled with the
release of funds from the World Bank controlled escrow account allowed a further expansion
in most categories of expenditure, raising the non-oil primary deficit to 16.6 percent of GDP
in 2006, compared with a target of 11.2 percent of GDP. The general wage increase was
extended retroactively to the first half of the year (contributing to an expected excess in the
wage bill compared with the end-2006 target of 0.3 percent of GDP). New exceptional
security expenditure is estimated at 2.5 percent of GDP, bringing the annual total to
4.3 percent of GDP. Spending on other transfers and goods and services was also increased.
Some allocations for capital spending that were cut in the June 2006 revised budget were
restored; and domestically-financed capital spending increased by 1.3 percent of GDP.
Despite these increases in spending, the authorities expect to repay the 2005 exceptional
advances from the central bank (BEAC) and some other domestic debt. A second revised
budget for 2006, reflecting the above changes would result in an end-year surplus in the oil
revenue account of about 1.7 percent of GDP. On the structural side, steps are being taken to
close the 2006 budget year promptly to avoid excessive expenditure carry-overs; to improve
monitoring of the utility costs; to enhance coordination with the procurement office; and to
strengthen the Ministry’s oversight role. However, the move towards a Treasury Single
Account is slow. Chad has also not maintained a balance in its SDR account equivalent to at
least three months of Chad’s financial obligations falling due to the Fund.
5.
The authorities intend to establish an oil-revenue stabilization mechanism before
end-2006. The mechanism is consistent with the medium-term expenditure needs of Chad,
which are frontloaded. It would be lodged at the central bank (BEAC) and would include an
oil account that is fully integrated in the budget process. Annual transfers from the oil
account, which would be made progressively during the year, would be limited to amounts
approved in the budget and could only be changed after parliamentary approval of a revised
budget.26 Initially, the arrangement agreed with the staffs of the World Bank and the IMF
would continue to provide for a separation of tax and royalty flows to reflect the current
petroleum revenue management law and facilitate the oversight body’s (college) monitoring
the use of oil royalties. The arrangement could be reviewed and simplified following
discussions on a new oil revenue management program—including a revised role of the
college—in the context of the preparation of an updated poverty reduction strategy paper
during 2007.
25
26

Unless otherwise stated, all ratios to GDP are to non-oil GDP.

The annual planned withdrawals will determine the maximum amount of oil revenue that
may be transferred to the treasury to finance programs that have been included in the relevant
budget law.

3
VI. THE MEDIUM-TERM MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK
Chad: Oil Outlook 2003-09
6.
The discussions on the
medium-term macroeconomic
framework focused on the
sustainable use of the expected oil
revenue. Based on prudent oil price
projections and expectations of a
gradual decline in oil production, the
government’s oil revenues are
expected to rise to 31 percent of GDP
in 2007 before falling to about
8.5 percent of GDP on average in the
following two years (Figure).27 The
staff recommended that the bulk of
the 2007 oil revenue be saved—and
Revenue (in percent of nonoil GDP)
Production (million barrels)
Prices (Brent's budget US dollars/barrel)
thus not transferred to the budget—
for gradual use over the long term. This approach would promote long-term fiscal
sustainability by allowing time to raise low non-oil revenues, to improve public financial
management to better manage higher expenditure, and to help ensure that spending is in line
with absorptive capacity. While agreeing with these broad principles, the authorities argued
that the country’s immense development needs, and the population’s expectations of
immediate benefits from the oil revenue, called for resources to be used more quickly to
address urgent legitimate needs, especially in building the country’s infrastructure, which
would promote higher growth in the future. Based on these discussions, the medium-term
framework allows for a further small increase in the non-oil primary deficit (excluding
exceptional security expenditure) in 2007, that would be followed by subsequent adjustments
in 2008-09, notably in current spending. External grants and concessional project assistance
are expected to decline further from 7.6 percent of GDP in 2006 to 6.3 percent in 2007 and
5.1 percent in 2009, but would still remain an important component to finance the spending
program.

Real non-oil growth is projected to be robust over the medium term, in part
reflecting the higher level of government expenditure. Specifically, non-oil growth is
expected to rise to about 6 percent by 2007, and then stabilize around 4.5 percent in
subsequent years. Government savings, driven by the oil windfall, would substantially
27

The lower projection for 2007 compared with Box 4 of the staff report (over 40 percent of
GDP) reflects lower projections for prices and production based on recent developments and
the large advances on 2006 income taxes paid by the oil companies following the resolution
of the recent tax dispute.

4
increase in 2007, but decrease sharply in subsequent years mirroring the decline in oil
revenues. Government investment would increase over the medium term in line with the
medium-term expenditure framework. The external current account would register a small
surplus in 2007, but it is expected to deteriorate over the medium term as oil revenues
decrease and imports, fueled by the expansion of economic activity, increase. The framework
is based on a decline in inflation to the CEMAC target by end-2007.
8.
The authorities’ medium-term fiscal policies aim at a substantial medium-term
adjustment and subsequent continued fiscal consolidation. The framework would be fully
financed through 2009, assuming the projected aid inflows which remain sizable. During this
period, the savings from the exceptional oil revenue in 2007 would be gradually used up;
additional oil revenues above the present estimates would be saved. This would be supported
by policies to strengthen non-oil revenue, which is projected to increase from 7.9 percent of
GDP in 2006 to 8.5 percent in 2009, and, on the expenditure side, civil service and military
reform and structural reform in the cotton and electricity sectors to gradually eliminate large
subsidies (amounting to 2 percent of GDP in 2007). The medium-term fiscal framework also
includes a gradual repayment of domestic debt (a settlement plan will be prepared following
the completion of an European Union-financed external audit).
9.
A joint Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) shows that even though
Chad’s debt situation has improved considerably in recent years, the outlook remains
fragile and Chad faces a high risk of debt distress. While the baseline scenario appears
sustainable, it entails significant risks, including further delays in Chad’s receipt of full debt
relief associated with the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative. In particular, the debt sustainability outlook would
deteriorate significantly if export values were to drop through a sharper-than-expected
decline in oil prices, or if fiscal discipline were not to prevail in the near to medium term.
10.
The 2007 budget was formulated in line with this medium-term framework.28
The authorities’ initial budget proposal for 2007 entailed significantly higher spending, but
they agreed on the need to plan expenditures in line with the principles laid out above.
Current expenditures in 2007, excluding exceptional security outlays, would exceed the 2006
expected outturn by about 1 percent of non-oil GDP. This rise reflects subsidies to
CotonTchad and the electricity company,29 higher outlays for education and health
considered appropriate by the World Bank, as well as an overall increase in goods and
services (especially utilities) and transfers, which were under funded in the past. Given the

the Memorandum of Understanding between Chad and the World Bank of July 2006.

29

Partly to pay CotonTchad’s previous debt and to support the operations of a new energy
station at Farcha.

5
security outlook, the budget includes a contingency for exceptional security expenditure of
1.1 percent of GDP (compared with an expected level of 4.3 percent of GDP in 2006),
which would result in a non-oil primary deficit of about 14.5 percent of GDP. Overall
investment expenditure would decline by about 0.7 percent of GDP compared with 2006, as
an increase in domestically-financed capital spending would be more than offset by a fall in
foreign-financed investment. The non-oil deficit would allow the accumulation of an amount
equivalent to 15 percent of non-oil GDP in the oil revenue account.
11.
Absorptive capacity and the maintenance of macroeconomic stability were key
considerations in the development of the budget for 2007. Half of the domesticallyfinanced capital spending concerns road infrastructure (of which much is co-financed by
donors), where donors’ sector specialists feel that macroeconomic and technical absorption
capacity constraints are less acute, stemming from the high import content of the spending
and the proven government’s capacity to execute road projects. Preservation of
macroeconomic stability is also supported by the containment of current spending, notably
the wage bill, and the nature of projects aimed at raising the quality of public spending.
VII. STAFF APPRAISAL
12.
The regrettable resurgence of conflict has again underlined the daunting
challenges to Chad’s effective use of oil revenues. Large expenditure overruns in 2006,
which in part reflected higher security expenditures, are a cause for concern. The authorities’
agreement on a mechanism to save future excess oil revenues is welcome, but political
stability will be essential to allow this oil wealth to be channeled to the priority sectors.
13.
The 2007 budget and the medium-term fiscal framework are fully-financed, but
the fiscal outlook is subject to several risks. Specifically, risks arise from frontloading
public spending, particularly when the assessment of absorptive capacity is hampered by the
limited availability of data. The current unsettled environment also poses risks to the 2007
budget. While the staff understands the urgent needs and high expectations, the government’s
strategy of high up-front expenditure will require vigilance to ensure spending does not
exceed absorptive capacity constraints, as well as tight controls on new medium-term
investment projects to ensure fiscal sustainability. The medium-term framework will need to
be reassessed in case new security expenditure exceeds the budgeted amounts.
14.
Strengthening public financial management remains crucial to ensure the
quality and control of expenditures. The staff urges the authorities to make rapid progress
with implementing the action plan in this area, in close cooperation with the World Bank and
other donors. In addition to improvements in all areas of fiscal administration, a key element
will also have to be the strengthening of the capacity to prepare comprehensive medium-term
fiscal frameworks to ensure fiscal sustainability. As the size and number of multi-year
investment projects increases, close control over long-term commitments, including for
counterpart funds, will be necessary.

6
15.
Chad’s debt situation has improved, but remains fragile and the country still
faces a high risk of debt distress. To strengthen Chad’s debt outlook it is important to attain
the HIPC completion point and maintain macroeconomic discipline. The outlook would
deteriorate substantially in the event of large drop in oil prices affecting export values or if
fiscal discipline were not to prevail.
16.
Provided the 2007 budget is approved as agreed and security stabilizes,
discussions on the first and second reviews under the PRGF arrangement could resume
in early 2007.

CHAD: ASSESSING EXTERNAL AND PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
17.
This assessment presents a joint IMF-World Bank debt sustainability analysis using
the standard debt dynamics templates for low-income countries (LICs) to analyze, on the
basis of available data, the sustainability of Chad’s external and public sector debt.
Debt sustainability assessment
18.
Even though Chad’s debt situation has improved appreciably in recent years, the
outlook remains fragile and Chad faces a high risk of debt distress. While the baseline
scenario appears sustainable, it entails significant risks, including the possibility of further
delays in Chad’s receipt of full debt relief under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative. Moreover, the alternative scenarios and
bound tests indicate that in the event of adverse shocks Chad’s debt burden indicators would
deteriorate substantially. In particular, the debt sustainability outlook would deteriorate
significantly if export values were to drop through a sharper than expected decline in oil
prices, or if fiscal discipline were not to prevail in the near to medium-term.
Recent debt developments
19.
Chad is eligible for the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. It reached
the HIPC Decision Point in 2001, at which time creditors agreed to a common reduction
factor of 30 percent, resulting in HIPC debt relief of $170 million in NPV terms. While the
full relief will only be delivered at the HIPC Completion Point, Chad became eligible for
interim HIPC relief, from the Paris Club creditors and the IMF, IDA, and the AfDB Group.
But as the Completion Point is delayed, Chad’s may reach the ceilings on the provision of
interim HIPC relief for some creditors. Nonetheless, Chad’s debt situation has improved
considerable over the past few years, thanks to the strong growth in overall GDP stemming
from the oil sector and the reduced reliance by the government on external financial support.
At end-2005, its external public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt stood at CFA 880 billion
($1.6 billion) or 27 percent of GDP, which compares with CFA 732 billion but 53 percent of
GDP at end-2002. In NPV terms, the debt was only two thirds this amount since it is largely
concessional: 90 percent is due to multilateral institutions and the remainder to bilateral
creditors (see Staff Report Table 8).
Baseline assumptions
20.
The economic baseline scenarios informing the DSAs are much influenced by the
expected evolution of Chad’s oil production. This is expected to peak in 2007, followed by a
gradual decline to one fifth that level by 2030, based on current proven oil reserves. At the
same time, oil prices are expected to decline. That, together with investment cost recovery by
companies, results in a sharp decline in oil revenues for the government (see Box 1). Other
key assumptions are shown in Tables 1a and 1b. The baseline assumes a steady increase in

11
non-oil GDP growth as oil production declines. The main source of growth is the agricultural
sector which will benefit from the infrastructure investments financed from oil revenue. With
the help of envisaged measures, non-oil revenues will grow as a percent of GDP, and
compensate for the decline in oil revenues so that the non-oil primary balance can cover debt
service. In sum, the baseline includes a substantial medium-term adjustment and subsequent
continued consolidation. As for debt service, the baseline assumes that Chad will reach the
HIPC Completion Point at end-2007.30 The baseline scenario shows relatively large residuals
in 2006 and 2007, which are the result of the assumption that much of the oil revenue will be
used to accumulate reserves. In subsequent years, as these reserves are drawn down, the
residual declines and turns negative.

External public and publicly guaranteed debt DSA
21.
For external public debt, the baseline scenario assumes that the large fiscal surpluses
in 2007 and 2008 when oil revenue peaks are saved and drawn down in subsequent years in
line with the economy’s absorptive capacity. Throughout the forecast period, Chad continues
to roll over maturing debt to help finance investment needs for poverty reduction identified in
the PRSP, but borrows only on concessional terms. Moreover, Chad’s anti-poverty policies
would attract a steady flow of grants from external donors. The result is that the NPV of debt
remains in a range of 15-20 percent of GDP, based on an average rate of growth of real GDP
30

If Chad were to receive MDRI in 2008, the amount would be on the order $1.2 billion
which translates into $574 million in NPV terms which is 9 percent of GDP and 18 percent
of exports.

12
of about 4 percent for the period (see Tables 1a and 2a). Likewise, in terms of exports, the
NPV value of debt behaves moderately, staying within a range of 50-100 percent.
7.
The external debt sustainability analysis includes a comparison with two alternative
scenarios, one where key variables are kept at their historical averages (calculated only over
2000-2005 due to data availability), and another where new public sector loans are contracted
on less favorable terms. The NPV-of-debt ratios increase under these scenarios but not
disconcertingly so (Table 1b). Under the first one, A1, the current account deficit continues
at the high level of 35 percent level which it achieved in the past on average thanks to the
build up of the oil sector. Even though direct investment inflows and real GDP growth are
commensurately higher, a gradual build up of debt occurs. Scenario A2 assumes that the
interest on new borrowing is 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline, and the result is
a higher NPV value of the debt stock.
8.
In addition to the alternative scenarios, the baseline projections for external public
debt were subjected to six standard bound tests (Figure 1 and Table 1b). Not surprisingly,
Chad’s debt position is most sensitive to the external shock consisting of a one-standard
deviation drop in exports proceeds in 2007 and 2008, as could result from a roughly
20 percent drop in oil prices (Test B2). The GDP drop—one standard deviation below the
high historical average (Test B1)—does not show much change from the baseline, the reason
being that real GDP growth in the baseline in 2007 and 2008 is already at that level.
Public debt DSA
9.
In addition to its external public debt, Chad has only limited domestic public debt,
equivalent to about 6 percent of GDP at end-2005, and the baseline expects the share of
domestic debt in total to remain roughly the same (Table 2a). On that assumption, an analysis
of the sustainability of total public debt confirms broadly the conclusions of the previous
analysis, namely that Chad’s debt situation remains fragile. If the assumptions of the baseline
materialize, debt appears sustainable, with the NPV of debt remaining in the 20–30 percent
range (Table 2b and Figure 2). The standard “no reform” alternative scenario would be
“primary balance unchanged from 2006”. However, given the very large and temporary
surplus in that year, staff opted for a “no reform” scenario that shows primary expenditures
remaining at their high 2007 level despite the subsequent decline in oil revenue (shown as
“no reform” in Figure 2 and as A2 in Table 2b). The most extreme stress test turns out to be
the scenario of “permanently lower GDP growth” (A3) which causes NPV of debt to GDP
and to revenues to rise sharply.
Threshold comparison
10.
A standard component of a LIC DSA is to assess the external debt burden indicators
in relation to policy-dependent thresholds reflecting the key empirical finding that a LIC with
better policies and institutions can sustain a higher level of external debt. The LIC DSA
framework therefore classifies countries into three performance categories—strong, medium,
poor—as assessed by the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA).

13
Corresponding to these categories, the framework establishes three indicative thresholds for
each debt burden indicator. Chad’s CPIA score in 2005 was 2.9 which is in the bottom
quintile and therefore characterizes Chad as a poor reformer with correspondingly low
threshold values (Box 2).31 As noted above, under the baseline scenarios most indicators
remain below these thresholds. However, several alternative scenarios and bound tests
produce ratios that breach those thresholds (see Figures 1 and 2). In addition serious risks
attach to the baseline scenario, especially whether Chad will proceed as rapidly to the HIPC
Completion Point as envisaged, and whether fiscal discipline will prevail in the near term. On
balance, therefore, Chad appears to face a high risk of debt distress.

1./ The thresholds used for Chad indicate the level of debt indicators at which countries with a similar evaluation of policies
and institutions would have at least a 25 percent chance of having a prolonged incident of debt distress in the coming year.
Chad lies with the bottom quintile of countries ranked by the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment
Index (CPIA).

Conclusions
11.
Chad’s debt situation has improved in recent years but remains fragile and the
country still faces a high risk of debt distress. To further solidify the debt situation, it is of
utmost importance that Chad reaches soon the HIPC Completion Point. This will require
maintaining macroeconomic stability in the face of sharply fluctuating oil revenues in the
near to medium term. It also requires speedy progress with the structural reform agenda
reflected in the HIPC Completion Point Triggers. Such policies would permit the gradual
diversification of the economy that is essential to ensure growth over the long term.

31

Using the 2003-05 average of the CPIA would not change Chad’s performance category in
terms of policies and institutions. Information on the CPIA 2005 is now publicly available on

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that NPV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments devided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are derived over the period 2000-2005 due to data availability.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 21, 2006

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with Chad
IMF I
On December 18, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Chad.33
Background
A three-year PRGF arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF) was approved for Chad in February 2005 in an amount equivalent to SDR
25.2 million (45 percent of quota). Chad reached its decision point under the Enhanced
Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative in May 2001. Attainment of the
completion point has been delayed, mainly because of unsatisfactory fiscal
performance. Reflecting expenditure overruns and uncertainty about a final agreement
with the World Bank on oil revenue management, the first and second reviews under the
PRGF arrangement have been delayed.
Despite some progress in macroeconomic stabilization and reform under Fundsupported programs during the 1990s, Chad’s indicators on business climate,
governance, and socio-economic conditions still remain among the lowest in the world.
Although the oil sector accounts for almost half of GDP, and has led to high growth rates
during 2001–04, the bulk of the population still heavily depends on cotton, livestock, and
small-scale agriculture.
In recent years, the resumption of armed conflict in the region has deteriorated the
political and security situation. Real growth has slowed following the completion of the
oil pipeline and a fall in oil production owing to technical problems. In 2006, real GDP is
33

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions
with members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and
financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments
and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the
basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. This PIN
summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the December
18, 2006 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

2
expected to grow by 1.3 percent, reflecting higher non-oil growth offsetting a somewhat
larger fall in oil production than envisaged earlier. Real non-oil growth is expected to rise
to about 6 percent by 2007, in part reflecting a higher level of government expenditure,
and then to stabilize around 4.5 percent in subsequent years. Inflation increased to an
annual average of 8 percent in 2005 owing to a drought in 2004, and, despite a better
harvest, remained high in 2006 because of increasing meat prices. Mainly reflecting the
appreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar, the real effective exchange rate
appreciated. After stagnating in 2003–04, broad money grew by 32 percent in 2005
owing to a rise in credit to the cotton sector, but monetary expansion slowed down to
about 28 percent by late 2006. The financial health of the banking system appears
broadly satisfactory, although vulnerable because of its overexposure to government
deposits.
On the fiscal front, the start of oil revenue supported higher domestic spending during
2004–05, partly offsetting a sharp shortfall in budget donor support as reform
momentum slowed and performance under the PRGF weakened. Despite the net rise in
resources, domestic debt and arrears continued to accumulate, reflecting poor budget
discipline and weak public finance management. Fiscal management was also
complicated by the segmentation of the budget and cash management.
Budget execution in 2006 has been affected by a number of factors. In January, the
authorities’ unilateral modification of the Petroleum Revenue Management Law agreed
with the World Bank resulted in contractual remedies by the Bank, including the blocking
of the offshore oil revenue escrow account. The loss of revenue was partly offset by the
start of income tax payments by the oil companies in March 2006. The dispute with the
Bank was settled in July and, in October, the settlement of an income tax dispute with
two of the three companies in the consortium producing Chad’s oil resulted in additional
revenue equivalent to 8 percent of non-oil GDP. This allowed a further expansion in
most categories of expenditure—including on exceptional security expenditure following
heavy fighting with rebels—raising the non-oil primary deficit to 16.6 percent of GDP in
2006.
Reflecting high oil prices, and the agreements to restore normal relations with the Bank,
Chad’s fiscal outlook has improved substantially. Under the agreements the authorities
have prepared a draft budget for 2007 that allocates at least 70 percent of all budgetary
resources to priority sectors (excluding security). The budget is formulated in the context
of a medium-term expenditure framework, aimed at maintaining macroeconomic stability
and fiscal sustainability. In support of this, the authorities formulated an action plan to
strengthen public financial management, that is supported by donors. Long-term oil
revenue management policies would be discussed in the context of an update of the
PRSP during 2007.

3
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted Chad’s efforts in maintaining macroeconomic stability and in
channeling resources to priority sectors despite a difficult political and security
environment. Nonetheless, poverty remains widespread, and the economy continues to
face major impediments to growth, including inadequate infrastructure, a poor business
climate, limited public financial management capacity, weak governance, and the
resurgence of armed conflict in the region. In addition, political instability and capacity
constraints have contributed to delays in support from donors.
Against this background, Directors urged the authorities to seize the unique—but likely
short-lived—opportunity created by the oil revenue windfall to move decisively to
establish the foundations for more sustained growth and lasting poverty reduction. They
recognized that the authorities face daunting challenges in ensuring the efficient
management of revenues while safeguarding macroeconomic stability and medium-term
fiscal sustainability. Directors accordingly welcomed the authorities’ intention to establish
a mechanism to save future excess oil revenues, urging them to ensure that it is fully
operational by the end of March 2007, when substantial oil revenue is to be received.
They underlined that political stability will be essential to allow the oil wealth to be
channeled to the priority sectors. Directors also stressed the crucial importance of
actions to strengthen budgetary management, improve the quality and transparency of
expenditures, and enhance absorptive capacity. Equally, noting the transitory nature of
the oil revenues, Directors called for accelerated efforts to develop the non-oil sector.
Directors considered the 2007 budget and the medium-term fiscal framework broadly
supportive of macroeconomic stability, but noted that the fiscal outlook is subject to risks
arising from the frontloading of public spending and the unsettled security environment.
They encouraged the authorities to remain vigilant to ensure that spending does not
exceed absorptive capacity, and to impose tight controls on new medium-term
investment projects to ensure fiscal sustainability. Accordingly, a considerable part of
the 2007 oil revenue will need to be saved for use in subsequent years.
Directors underlined the importance of strengthening public financial management,
including the steadfast enforcement of laws and regulations, in order to avoid a
recurrence of unplanned spending and to raise the quality of public investment. The
authorities’ action plan in this area should be rapidly implemented, for which Directors
urged donors to provide strong support.
Directors noted that the debt situation has improved but Chad still faces a high risk of
debt distress. To strengthen the debt outlook, it will be important for Chad to aim to
attain the HIPC completion point as soon as possible while maintaining macroeconomic
discipline.

4
Directors welcomed the authorities’ plan to complete a comprehensive update of the
PRSP during 2007. A key element in the PRSP should be a new Petroleum Revenue
Management Program (PRMP) that incorporates the revised revenue outlook, and
includes provisions for monitoring an effective execution of expenditures and for
promoting best practices in public financial management.
Directors considered that implementation of ambitious structural reforms will be crucial
for diversifying the economy. Chad’s temporary oil windfall should be used to promote
the development of the non-oil sector so that it can support the continuation of the
poverty reduction strategy when oil runs out. In the public sector, such efforts should
include strengthening non-oil revenue as well as pursuing civil service, military, and
public enterprise reform. In close cooperation with the World Bank and other partners,
the authorities should quickly implement the needed reforms in the electricity and the
cotton parastatals, with a view to eliminating budgetary subsidies. It will also be
important to carry forward the reforms in the trade system recommended by the recent
Diagnostic Trade Integration Study.
To improve the business climate and Chad’s external standing, Directors called for
strengthening the judiciary and anticorruption efforts. They also welcomed the
authorities’ intention to strengthen Chad’s financial sector, in line with the
recommendations of the recent regional FSAP and in cooperation with the Banking
Commission of Central Africa.
Directors noted that Chad’s membership in the Economic and Monetary Community of
Central Africa and its fixed exchange rate regime have provided an important nominal
anchor for macroeconomic policies. However, the oil windfall could lead to some real
appreciation of the exchange rate. While noting that the rebound in inflation in 2006 was
concentrated in food prices, Directors encouraged the authorities to monitor price
developments closely and improve statistical information on prices and wages.
Directors encouraged the authorities to upgrade macroeconomic statistics and follow up
on the recommendations of the recent data ROSC.

Statement by Laurean W. Rutayisire, Executive Director for Chad
December 18, 2006

I. Introduction and Background
On behalf of my Chadian authorities, I would like to thank the staff for the frank and
constructive discussions held in N’Djamena, as well as for the well-written set of reports on
Chad. The reports provide a candid assessment of the country’s economic situation and the
challenges ahead. My Chadian authorities are fully committed to pursuing sound economic
and financial policies and to implementing structural reforms aimed at strengthening the
country’s economy, improving growth and reducing poverty in a sustained manner. Notably,
my authorities would like to assure that the coming oil wealth contributes effectively to
reducing poverty. They are hopeful that they can count on the continued support of the
international community, both at the financial and technical levels, to carry out successfully
the needed reforms.
Chad is a vast, landlocked country, with large arid and semi-arid zones, which has faced
extremely difficult conditions since its independence in 1960, including repetitive periods of
domestic armed conflict. The combined effects of poverty-related problems and frequent
droughts have contributed to make this country one of the most impoverished countries in the
world. As shown in the United Nations’ 2005 Human Development Index, Chad ranks 173
among the 177 countries considered.
After experiencing a period of relative political stability in the 1990s, Chad’s security
situation deteriorated in the last two years, with spillover effects from the neighboring Darfur
(Sudan) Crisis which has caused displacement of thousands of refugees into the Chadian
territory. More recent attacks from across the Sudanese border occurred in late 2005 and in
early 2006, then escalated in August, leading the government of Chad to declare a State of
Emergency and the UN to declare security phase IV for Eastern Chad and Phase III for
N’Djamena. It is also worth noting that the Darfur situation continues to have humanitarian
consequences and budgetary implications for Chad. During this difficult period, support from
some development partners has been critical to helping contain the conflict and its
humanitarian and economic implications, and avoid that it becomes more regional in scope.
Chad has held successfully Presidential elections in May 2006. Subsequently, efforts to
engage the opposition in forming a government of national unity have been made though
unsuccessfully.
The petroleum era has created high expectations amongst the population for a rapid
economic development and for provision of adequate social services. Driven by the oil
pipeline construction from 2001 and the initiation of oil production in 2003, real GDP growth
averaged 11 percent in 2001-03 and reached a record level of 30 percent in 2004. Despite this

2
recent period of rapid growth, my authorities are fully aware that the petroleum era may be
short-lived based on current proven reserves, and the contribution of oil revenue to the
government budget is expected to remain relatively small.
The decision of the authorities to amend the Petroleum Revenue Management Law early this
year was not an expression on their part to oppose to the principle of transparency which they
had proven to be committed to, nor was it a rejection of the principle agreed-upon with the
Word Bank to make use of oil resources mainly for priority spending. They have clearly
explained the need to adjust the mechanism that governs the management of these resources notably with the elimination of the Fund for Future Generations (FFG)– on the grounds of
required high long-term investment yields to meet Chad’s daunting economic and social
infrastructure needs. Moreover, faced with issues out of their control, notably the recent
deterioration of the security situation, they sought merit to have the list of priority sectors to
be expanded to include security-related areas identified in the 2003 PRSP. These actions not
only led to the World Bank’s decision to suspend its operations with Chad and to the freezing
of the Chadian government’s oil escrow account, but also contributed to delaying the
execution of the 2006 budget. With agreements reached in April and July 2006 between the
government and the World Bank, my authorities are committed to using the oil resources
wisely and to strengthening the public financial management.
Despite the progress made by Chad in many economic areas under Fund-supported
programs, the country still has to address considerable challenges to achieving sustainable
and lasting poverty reduction. Among them is the need to consolidate security, enhance
budget and cash management, increase access to financial services, and cope with exogenous
shocks such as droughts and low international prices of agricultural products. Infrastructure
remains deficient in many areas, including social sectors, transportation, energy and
telecommunications, leading to difficulties in sustaining appropriate policy and structural
reform implementation.
My authorities are cognizant of the fact that Chad’s economic and financial situation remains
fragile and vulnerable to external shocks. They also recognize the importance of following
prudent macroeconomic policies and implementing structural reforms that can help improve
the absorptive capacity of the economy. To address the numerous problems facing the
country, assistance from the international community remains critical. Such renewed support
will help the country achieve highly needed sustained growth required to meet the MDGs.
II. Economic Developments in 2006
In the real sector, economic developments in 2006 have been largely driven by buoyant
non-oil sector activity, which is growing at an annual pace of 5.1%, while oil production
declined from 63.3 in 2005 to 55.4 million of barrels in 2006 because much more water was
found in the wells than expected. The oil production decline was more than offset by broad-

3
based non-oil sector activity reflecting the recovery of grain production following the
previous year drought, and strong activity in manufacturing and transportation. While real
GDP has grown by 1.3% percent, the 12-month point-to-point CPI in October 2006 stood at
15 percent, resulting from an increase in meat and other food products. For a few food
categories and charcoal, security concerns and related supply disruptions appeared to have
played a role in the increase of inflation.
Regarding the fiscal area, Chad has registered a revenue shortfall arising from the freezing
of oil escrow account, which was initially offset by the repatriation of resources in the FGF,
revenue from exploration licenses, and initial income tax payments by the oil companies. The
release of oil revenue from the World Bank-controlled escrow account later this year,
coupled with income tax revenue from the settlement of a dispute with two foreign oil
companies has improved the government’s cash position. Since then, public sector wages
were paid on time and the implementation of oil-financed projects has resumed. The non-oil
primary deficit implied in the supplementary 2006 budget mainly reflects additional
expenditures warranted by the new exceptional security situation, as well as increases in
capital spending. Nevertheless, my authorities remain committed to improving the execution
of prioritized expenditures.
On the financial sector front, Chad’s financial system is among the least developed in the
region. However, the microfinance sector, though still small, has been gaining importance in
recent years. The emergence of microfinance contributed to the improvement in the
population’s access to financial services. The authorities attach a great importance to its
development and consider it as a key tool for the implementation of their poverty reduction
strategy. In compliance with the CEMAC regulations, which are now being applied to
microfinance institutions, my Chadian authorities have set up a professional association for
these institutions as well as a department for microfinance issues within the Ministry of
Finance. The related licenses issued by this department are being verified and validated by
the regional banking commission, COBAC.
Concerning petroleum management, the economic and security situation has prompted my
authorities to revise the mechanism initially established regarding the allocation of oil
resources. They are committed to put in place an oil-revenue stabilization mechanism which
is consistent with the medium-term expenditure needs of the country. For the reasons laid out
above, these expenditures are frontloaded. The mechanism would be lodged at the BEAC and
would include an oil account that is fully integrated to the budget process. The College that
oversees the management of oil resources will pursue its tasks. The arrangement could be
reviewed and simplified following discussions on a new oil revenue management program,
including a revised role of the College.
As regards structural reforms, while progress in alleviating growth constraints —
especially in the electricity and cotton sectors— has been modest, access to education, health,

4
water, and agricultural inputs has improved, and the length of paved roads increased from
600 km to 900 km during 2004-05. The modest progress in growth-enhancing structural
reforms is due to the fact that the country has to address the security problem as a matter of
greater priority. Indeed, my authorities are of the view that an improved security situation is
essential to allow oil wealth to be channeled to growth-supporting and priority sectors.
The cotton sector, an important non-oil segment of the Chadian economy, continues to
experience difficulties. The financial situation of the publicly-owned cotton company,
CotonTchad, has continued to deteriorate further, owing to the decline in world prices, the
weakening of the US dollar, the increase in producer prices decided to support this
vulnerable segment of the population, and decreased financial support to the company on the
part of the state, which itself lacks resources.
My authorities recognize that, despite achievements, much remains to be done, especially on
the structural front, to improve non-oil sector growth prospects and significantly reduce
poverty. They are appreciative of the technical assistance received from the Fund, and they
expect to benefit from additional support, especially in public financial management,
customs and other areas, to ensure adequate management of the expected oil and non-oil
resources.
III. The Medium-Term Macroeconomic Framework
Building on the progress achieved thus far, my authorities are determined to cope with the
many challenges ahead, including those related to the petroleum era. In so doing, they are
hopeful that the international community will be supportive of their efforts.
Regarding the outlook for 2007, based on prudent oil price projections and expectations of
gradual decline in oil production, my authorities reached an agreement with the World Bank
on three pillars, namely a medium-term framework, a public finance management, and an oil
revenue stabilization mechanism. My authorities agreed with the Fund on the broad
principles of the approach to promote long-term fiscal sustainability, which allows time to
raise the currently low non-oil revenues, improve public financial management, and ensure
that spending is in line with absorptive capacity.
To this end, the 2007 budget was formulated in line with the medium-term framework. The
initial budget for 2007 entailed higher spending, but the authorities agreed on the need to
plan expenditures in line with the agreed principles. They also agree that the absorptive
capacity and the maintenance of macroeconomic stability are key to the successful execution
of the 2007 budget. Thus, they will pursue efforts to contain current spending, notably the
wage bill. My authorities have also expressed the desire to improve the composition of
expenditures, effectively continuing to give more weight to the priority sectors, with the view
to reduce poverty.

5
With regard to the macroeconomic objectives set over the medium-term, real non-oil growth
is estimated to be robust over the medium term, reflecting in part the higher level of
government expenditure. Inflation is expected to decline in line with the CEMAC target by
end-2007. Government savings, driven by the oil windfall, would substantially increase in
2007, then decrease in subsequent years due to the decline in oil revenues. Government
investment is also expected to increase over the medium-term, in line with the medium-term
expenditure framework. The latter will be fully financed through 2009, assuming the
projected aid inflows to remain important. As savings from the exceptional oil revenue in
2007 is anticipated to be gradually used up and additional oil revenues above the present
estimates to be saved, the authorities intend to implement policies aimed at strengthening
non-oil revenue.
IV. Conclusion
As the joint Bank-Fund DSA shows, Chad’s debt situation remains unsustainable. The
baseline scenario, although seemingly sustainable, entails significant risks well highlighted in
the exercise. Therefore, skillful debt management on the part of my authorities is necessary.
The authorities expect to repay some domestic debt as well as the 2005 exceptional advances
from the BEAC, which are interest-costly. However, support from the international
community in the form of debt relief will remain critical. In this regard, my authorities look
forward to the Board support of their efforts, so as to enable the resumption of the PRGF
program as soon as possible and, hence, lay the ground for efforts towards the HIPC
completion point and qualification to the MDRI.
