EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Outlook and competitiveness. Malta joined EMU on January 1, 2008: a key milestone in the authorities’
strategy of boosting competitiveness through economic opening. Largely as a consequence of liberalizing
reforms, Malta has experienced a three-year-long expansion reflecting strong foreign direct investment,
export diversification, and value-added upgrading. Growth (3.8 percent in 2007) has been underpinned
by fiscal adjustment, privatization, and public sector streamlining. Tourism and new high value-added
exports supported cost and noncost competitiveness, trimming the current account (5½ percent in 2007)
and trade deficits. Growth is expected to decelerate to 2¼–2½ percent in 2008–09 as the external
environment weakens. There are some downside risks as traditional export sector declines could outpace
the emergence of new export activities, especially if reforms slow down.
Policy issues. The authorities intend to press ahead with fiscal, financial, and structural reforms in the
early period of the recently inaugurated legislature. Further fiscal consolidation and public sector
streamlining will be key.
•

Fiscal policy. The authorities are appropriately cutting spending to keep the 2008 budget on
track—including passing through higher fuel import costs while protecting low-income
households. Achieving the authorities’ medium-term objective (MTO) of structural fiscal
balance by 2010 based on expenditure retrenchment will require tackling the high cost of
subsidies, payroll and entitlements, and reinforcing the fiscal framework.

•

Financial sector. The banking system is well placed to weather global turmoil as banks have
healthy liquidity and a good funding profile. However, exposure to the slowing housing market
and low and uneven provisioning call for close supervisory vigilance. The authorities are
reviewing mechanisms for crisis prevention and resolution in light of recent international
experience, in collaboration with foreign supervisors.

•

Structural reforms. Reform of the public enterprise sector and administered price-setting
mechanisms will be essential to mitigate market distortions and redirect public spending toward
growth-oriented investment. Enhancing the competition framework and wage-bargaining
flexibility would help fight inflation and increase competitiveness.

I. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
1.
Malta successfully adopted the euro on January 1, 2008: a crucial milestone in
the authorities’ growth-oriented reform agenda. This agenda appropriately aims at
leveraging Malta's strengths and income-generating potential through closer integration in the
European and global economies. As the cost-competitiveness of traditional low value-added
exports wanes, market liberalization and EU membership are intended to facilitate upward
shifts in the value-added and quality export ladders. This is a promising but demanding
strategy. It will require enhancing market-based flexibility and reducing the inefficiencies
created by an overextended public sector. Robust fiscal savings are needed to provide a stable
macroeconomic setting, reduce debt, and maintain the tax burden low—as the authorities
intend—while investing in education and infrastructure.

Largely as a consequence of liberalizing reforms, Malta has experienced a threeyear-long expansion underpinned by foreign direct investment (FDI) and export
diversification. In the context of buoyant EU activity, growth accelerated to 3.8 percent in
2007 while the current account deficit declined to 5½ percent of GDP. Growth has been
driven both by rising productivity and labor supply mobilization. Increased female
participation helped raise the employment rate, while unemployment reached record lows.
This reflected booming new manufacturing and services export activities, and a revival of
tourism. Strong FDI (29 and 13 percent of GDP in 2006 and 2007, respectively) provided
welcome know-how and global market access. Employment and income gains supported
domestic demand.

However, while economic liberalization has started to pay off, it is far from
complete and a less favorable external environment will test the economy’ resilience.
Despite recent positive economic performance, productivity is still low and the large public
enterprise sector is a source of market distortions and budgetary strains—particularly since
administered prices have lagged import price increases. The growth contribution of net
exports became negative in the two quarters to 2008:Q1 as several export companies (textile
and tobacco) closed down, and semiconductor sales (about half of goods exports) remained
weak. During this latter period, activity was supported by domestic demand, notably
government spending. Going forward, traditional manufacturing exports may experience
further declines against the backdrop of softer external demand and an increasingly
competitive global environment, despite subdued unit labor cost growth. Thus, Malta’s
competitiveness and economic prosperity will hinge on a stable macroeconomic framework
and continued reforms to facilitate the reorientation toward high-growth export activities—
buttressing FDI and investor confidence.
5.
The March 2008 general elections returned to office the ruling Nationalist Party
with a narrow parliamentary majority. During the preelectoral period, the authorities
continued with important liberalizing initiatives and fiscal consolidation, but some
controversial reforms were delayed—including restructuring of the loss-making public
shipyards.
II. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
6.
The authorities emphasized their determination to proceed with reforms. They
agreed that the initial period of the new legislature offered the opportunity to press ahead
with crucial medium-term oriented reforms, thus anchoring investors’ expectations. In this
connection, they reiterated the 2008 budget deficit target of 1.2 percent of GDP (although

5
premised on a more favorable macroeconomic scenario than staff’s), the MTO of structural
budget balance by 2010 based on expenditure retrenchment, and the intention to meet
remaining EU accession commitments. Regarding the latter, the authorities are unbundling
and opening to private participation the fuel and LPG operations of the public energy
company (Enemalta), and have recently announced their intention to restructure and privatize
the shipyards shortly.
7.
Policy discussions focused on the following areas, essential for success within EMU
and economic stability.
Cementing fiscal consolidation. Despite substantial fiscal retrenchment, the public
finances remain fragile. Reinforcing the fiscal position is a core policy priority to
ensure the domestic stability of Malta, highly vulnerable to external shocks and with
volatile growth. In this vein, staff supported the authorities’ target of structural budget
balance by 2010 and argued for a surplus thereafter as a desirable policy buffer.

•

Strengthening the banking sector. The impact of international financial turbulence
on the domestic banking sector is assessed to be small. However, lending
concentration, real estate exposures, and thin provisioning pose risks. Malta is
actively participating in EU-wide efforts to strengthen mechanisms for crisis
prevention and resolution.

•

Improving economic efficiency. Reducing the role of the public sector is key. The
authorities intend to reinvigorate, early in the legislature, their privatization and
liberalization agenda, and reduce subsidies. The agenda could usefully be extended to
competition policy and wage indexation, which however is not currently
contemplated.

6
A. Outlook: Competitiveness and External Stability
8.
Improvements in cost fundamentals affecting competitiveness continued in 2007
(Figure 1, Box 1). After large competitiveness losses through 2004, ULC increases have
generally been below trading partners’ reflecting productivity gains and wage moderation.
These trends continued in 2007, resulting in a ULC-based real depreciation of 1 percent
relative to the rest of the euro area. On a multilateral trade-weighted basis, however, the
ULC-based REER appreciated by 1.2 percent, highlighting Malta’s vulnerability to euro
appreciation—non-EMU countries account for 65 percent of goods exports. Labor cost
growth has remained low (Figure 2) as the end of the agreed wage moderation period in the
public sector appears not to have affected the private sector so far. Going forward, ongoing
investment is likely to sustain productivity gains, while labor cost growth is expected to
remain contained by slowing activity. All said, staff sees only a moderate competitiveness
gap, based on CGER-type analyses, in the range 3–7½ percent.

Noncost competitiveness trends—central to the authorities’ strategy—have been
particularly positive. Terms-of-trade (TOT) gains and FDI-driven export diversification,
especially into new services sectors, epitomize these trends.1 The export structure is rapidly

1

TOT gains averaged 0.9 percent annually in 2005–07, partly reflecting export quality and value-added
upgrading. TOT-adjusted GDP grew 5.2 percent in 2007. TOT-adjusted GDP is computed by deflating exports
by the import deflator and measures the volume of goods and services an economy can command.

7
Box 1. Competitiveness
Early this decade, Malta’s narrow economic base (tourism, electronics) was shaken by the
decline in tourism following the 9/11 events and the bursting of the dot-com bubble, while
traditional manufacturing (e.g., textiles) came under pressure from low-cost competitors.
Moreover, wage-inflation pressures led to large REER appreciation. EU entry in 2004 marked
the start of a reversal (Figure 1). Updated national statistics show ULC growth below
competitors (and euro area) during most of the 2004–07 period, stemming from sizable
productivity gains and relatively subdued labor costs.
In recent years, FDI has driven the redeployment of resources toward new export activities
(Figures 3, 4). Within manufacturing, airplane maintenance, and a tripling of generic
pharmaceutics output helped cushion the decline of goods exports (Box Figure A below). Also,
new services exports have emerged (Box Figure B), such as online gaming (9 percent of GDP),
IT, call centers, and other business services (10 percent of GDP) and financial services
(3 percent of GDP). Tourism rebounded recently owing to the airport opening to low-cost
airlines, and harbor improvements enhanced cruise tourism. This reorientation has led to
substantial terms-of-trade (TOT) gains (despite weak semiconductor prices), reflecting upward
shifts in export quality and value-added. TOT gains are especially visible in services (Box
Figure C), which exhibit high price elasticity relative to trading partners’ income.
However, competitive pressures on traditional manufacturing remain, with output and
employment losses of 60 percent in textiles through 2004–07 amid factory closures. Given the
high import content of lower value-added manufactures, downsizing has caused a long-term
downward trend in goods exports and imports (Box Figure D). Some manufactures
(e.g., semiconductors) are counteracting competitive pressures by moving to higher skill and
technology products. In the short run, the main risk lies in a faster-than-expected winding down
in traditional manufacturing—adversely affected by euro appreciation, given the predominant
weight of non-EMU export destinations (65 percent in goods).
The positive trends in Malta’s competitiveness are partly captured by CGER-type estimates,
which staff updated and extended in light of 2007 outcomes; new forecasts; and revised
historical trade, current account, and international investment position (IIP) statistics.2 3

2

Malta significantly revised its statistics in 2007–08 with assistance from Eurostat and the IMF to increase
consistency with ESA95 and SDDS, resulting in a more benign external competitiveness assessment than in the
last Article IV consultation.

3

The methodology follows Exchange Rate Assessments: CGER Methodologies (by Lee, et al, IMF Occasional
Paper 261, 2008).

8
Box 1. Competitiveness (Concluded)
•

The macroeconomic balance approach indicates a competitiveness gap of around
3 percent, versus 10–15 percent last year—reflecting better-than-expected current
account outturn and data revisions. Closing this gap would bring the underlying current
account (estimated at -2.4 percent of GDP) to an estimated long-run equilibrium level of
-0.8 percent of GDP.

•

The external sustainability approach indicates that stabilizing the net international
investment position at current levels would require a competitiveness improvement of
7½ percent.

among the mission’s interlocutors that changes
in export structure were an equilibrium response to a higher REER—a hypothesis supported
by sustained improvements in the goods and services trade balance despite a broadly stable
ULC-based REER (after a large appreciation early in the decade).
10.
Staff’s central scenario envisages growth decelerating temporarily to 2¼–2½
percent in 2008–09 reflecting unfavorable external conditions (Table 1); the authorities
see a shallower slowdown. Staff does not project a growth contribution of the external
sector in the short term on account of weak

power of the tourism sector weakens with the global environment, and base effects from the
recent electricity price hike fade. Output is estimated to have reached its trend level in 2007,
although the envisaged slowdown will reopen a modest gap in 2009, contributing to moderate
inflation. The authorities envisage a more supportive external environment and thus project

better export performance. There is broad consensus that investment will support activity,
reflecting planned FDI projects.5 There was also agreement that, over the medium term,
activity will recover swiftly toward trend, sustained by FDI, emerging export activities, and
terms-of-trade gains.
11.
In staff’s view, the decline of traditional export sectors poses short-term risks,
underscoring the need to maintain cost competitiveness and reform momentum. The
authorities see this decline as having largely run its course; any tail effects would likely be
offset by the ongoing rapid growth of new exports. Staff, on the other hand, saw the risks to
its scenario somewhat tilted to the downside. In the short term, given the small size of the
economy, even modest additional export losses in some individual companies subject to
intense international competition could significantly disrupt output and employment. Staff
emphasized the need to prevent wage growth from running ahead of productivity, while
accelerating reforms that foster the ongoing economic transformation. Competitiveness
pressures within EMU might otherwise lead to a period of lackluster growth as has occurred
in some euro area countries.

Long-term external sustainability risks are tempered by envisaged large FDI
inflows and a strong net international investment credit position (Tables 2 and 3). The
authorities pointed out that the current account deficit had been amply overfinanced by FDI,
supported by Malta’s history of stable institutions and internationally harmonized business
environment—enhanced by EU and EMU membership. Staff’s external sustainability
analysis also points to a robust external balance sheet (Table 4). However, staff emphasized
the need for fiscal and financial policy buffers given the volatility associated with the
economy’s small size and its reliance on continued positive investor sentiment.

5

Projects include the construction of an IT park by TECOM—strategic investor from Dubai in GO (former
Maltacom)—starting at end-2008 and ongoing harbor investments by the private operator (a large French
maritime transport company).

11
B. Cementing Fiscal Consolidation
13.
Expenditure-based consolidation continued in 2007, though the public finances
remain fragile (Figure 7). Tight spending control achieved the first recorded current surplus
in recent years while allowing some tax cuts. The structural deficit (net of one-offs, mainly
land sales) improved by almost ½ percentage point of GDP (Table 5). However, the public
finances are under endemic stress from sizable subsidies (about twice the EU average) and
state aid (four times the EU average); health care costs; the public wage bill (13 percent of
GDP); and pensions and other social spending (over 13 percent of GDP). Also, public
enterprise guarantees, and other contingent liabilities remain high.
14.
The authorities are adopting additional measures to meet the 2008 budget target
(1.2 percent of GDP). 2008 data show a significant increase in outlays. The authorities
indicated that there had been frontloaded

maintained through year end. Thus, the
authorities were planning offsetting cuts in discretionary spending, including prioritization
and sequencing of capital projects, additional hiring controls, and other savings in current
spending. They also have raised electricity prices by about one-third since the mission
(although staff estimates that they remain some 25 percent below cost recovery). This latter
measure will limit electricity subsidies to 0.7 percent of GDP (0.25 percent in the original
budget). In staff’s view, the measures in train will limit overall 2008 underperformance to
½ percentage point of GDP relative to budget—partly due to the play of automatic stabilizers,
given lower growth assumptions. The structural balance, however, is forecast to improve by
¾ of a percentage point of GDP—making a sizable contribution toward the MTO.
15.
The authorities anchor their medium-term strategy in further spending
retrenchment, which will require expenditure reforms. The authorities intend to continue
reducing subsidies and still-high public employment (about 30 percent of full-time
employees). In particular, they have announced the elimination of shipyard and bread
subsidies in 2009, and are identifying savings on other subsidies and health costs—although
delivery-point health care charges have been ruled out. The mission encouraged early

12
formulation of detailed and more explicit multiyear measures to reduce current spending.6
This would minimize uncertainty and the encroachment, forced by events, on growthenhancing capital spending—especially, in view of upside risks to expenditure plans,
including unbudgeted potential costs of public enterprise restructuring. Staff suggested
complementing attrition with proactive personnel redeployment and selection based on
training and performance; and consideration of market-based measures to rationalize public
services demand and increase supply efficiency, including in health care, if administrative
cost control measures prove ineffective. There was agreement that 2009–10 revenue
projections were appropriately conservative—given authorities’ indications that tax cuts
would be implemented prudently, as cost savings materialized.
16.
The authorities are reinforcing the fiscal framework with a medium-term
orientation. They are pursuing more structured multiyear fiscal planning and the introduction
of performance budgeting methods. Evaluation procedures for investment projects (crucial
for optimizing reduced EU funds) and hospital performance are being improved. Staff
recommended extending spending reviews to all major areas (particularly education, given its
competitiveness-enhancing role), and parliamentary agreement on aggregate expenditure
limits before starting budget appropriation discussions. On longer-term issues, the EU
pensions working group projects age-related spending to be relatively benign, though revised
estimates of the 2006 pension reform impact still need to be finalized.
C. Strengthening the Growing Financial System
17.
The financial sector appears to be resilient to international developments,
though it has experienced some adverse effects (Box 2). The authorities and private sector
analysts considered the banks well-placed to weather the global turmoil. Banks have strong
liquidity positions (Table 7) and no exposure to subprime-related assets. They are also
profitable, although some banks’ financial results were affected by markdowns in security
portfolios, and equity valuations saw substantial declines in 2008—possibly accentuated by
local stock market thinness (Figure 8). The internationally oriented financial sector (now fully
under uniform regulation) is expanding rapidly.

6

A point also made by the EC in its assessment of Malta’s Stability Program (ECFIN/REP50669/08). Staff’s
medium-term scenario (Table 5) assumes an underlying expenditure-based effort (public employment, subsidies
and other spending reductions) similar to 2004–06. The pace of spending reduction would be however slower
reflecting the expiration of the public wage moderation agreement and increasing demographic pressures on
social spending.

13
Box 2. Spillovers from International Financial Turmoil
Malta’s domestic banks, as elsewhere, have seen some fallout from the turmoil,
including mark-downs in the security portfolios, trading losses, and increased funding
costs. Lending surveys indicate tightening credit conditions, and securities valuation
losses could increase in case of prolonged international market turbulence. But overall,
the following factors indicate low risk of direct contagion.
•

Strong domestic franchises. The systemically important banks have robust
brand recognition and a solid presence and expertise in key domestic sectors.

•

Good funding profile. Domestic banks rely mainly on resident deposits and
little on wholesale market funding—being generally net lenders in cross-border
interbank money markets. Hence, higher funding costs affect profits only
moderately.

•

High liquidity. Liquidity ratios are well above the 30 percent prudential
requirement. This buffer should permit the banks to recover valuation losses by
holding securities (generally highly rated and with maturity under five years) to
maturity.

•

Negligible subprime exposures. Main agencies have confirmed bank ratings
with stable outlooks and reported very limited exposure to structured and
similar instruments—a point confirmed by Central Bank of Malta’s surveys.

18.
The housing market remains overall
broadly stable, although some market
segments have recently experienced real
price declines as credit conditions tightened
(Box 3). Banks’ exposure through mortgages
and corporate lending, at 57 percent of resident
loans, is large and has been growing quickly
(Figure 9). Recently, banks have become more
cautious in extending high loan-to-value
mortgages and are reducing exposures to
construction, while using opportunities for
asset diversification created by EMU entry.
The housing market has remained generally
stable since 2005, and staff concurred with the
authorities that there is probably little, if any,

overvaluation relative to fundamentals. Nonetheless, some market segments could experience
additional real price declines if credit tightens further.

Real house prices increased by 54 percent during 2002–05 but have since been broadly
stable (Figure 6). Staff’s regression analysis,

Number of observations

In recent months, interest rate and credit
tightening also explain the observed decline in
real prices, which could continue for some time
if credit conditions remain restrictive—despite
the estimated absence of significant
overvaluation relative to fundamentals. The
authorities and private analysts pointed out that
the market was highly fragmented, with pent-up
supply concentrated in certain segments, where
the real price falls had occurred
(e.g., apartments).

Domestic asset quality remains weak due to relatively high—and thinly
provisioned—NPLs. Despite substantial reduction in recent years, the NPLs in domestically
controlled banks are high (7.6 percent of loans at end-2007)—and edging up in construction.
The authorities partly shared staff concerns over the low and declining provision-coverage
ratio (below 30 percent before collateral at end-2007). Staff recommended that the supervisor
discuss with banks means to increase provisioning, while enhancing incentives by
introducing tax deductibility of specific provisions. The authorities noted, however, that
unprovisioned loans are fully backed by high-quality collateral.
20.
Malta is making good progress in introducing Basel II and other EU prudential
standards. The authorities saw merit in staff’s recommendations to introduce more frequent
(quarterly) public reporting by the main banks and improve consistency in NPL reporting.
Regarding the former, however, they observed that more frequent reporting may also cause a
higher noise-to-information ratio.
21.
Malta is actively strengthening its national and cross-border crisis management
framework in the light of lessons from the financial turmoil. The Domestic Standing
Group was established last year and Memoranda of Understanding have been signed among
key agencies and with relevant foreign jurisdictions—increasingly important due to rising
internationally oriented bank presence. The authorities are also participating in various EU
and ECB cross-border reviews, as well as conducting simulations and stress tests. In staff’s
view, Malta’s preparedness to engage in bank resolution is satisfactory but could be improved
in some respects. In this regard, the authorities were receptive to staff recommendations to
review the legal means and procedures to act expeditiously—including systemic solvency
support provision—should it ever be necessary. They were also introducing initiatives to
buttress deposit insurance coverage based on recent international experience.
D. Improving Economic Efficiency
22.
The authorities have made remarkable gains in strengthening the business
environment and improving education outcomes, but rigidities in product and labor
markets hinder growth. Policies seek additional improvements in educational attainment
and labor market participation, particularly among females. Staff suggested reconsideration
of the existing across-the-board mandatory inflation adjustment of wages (COLA), which,
although partial, may hinder productivity-based wage increases and help entrench inflation.7
The authorities, however, thought that COLA’s impact was limited and facilitated consensus
in wage negotiations. Staff also recommended granting institutional independence to the
7

See ECB Monthly Bulletin, 5/2008, Box 5 “Wage Indexation Mechanisms in Euro Area Countries” and ECB
Occasional Paper No. 90, 7/2008, “Wage Growth Dispersion Across the Euro Area Countries: Some Stylised
Facts” (Andersson, et al).

16
competition authority (currently part of the Ministry of Finance). The authorities thought this
premature, while agreeing that a proactive stance was crucial in fostering price flexibility and
efficient markets, hampered by the economy’s small size. They also viewed implementation
of the EU services directive as an opportunity in this regard.
23.
Renewed momentum in public enterprise reform would also improve economic
efficiency, while freeing public resources. Privatization and outsourcing has continued in
several areas (harbor services, post, energy), soon to include the shipyards—but the public
sector remains large (Table 9). Although not opposed in principle, the authorities have no
immediate plans to privatize Bank of Valletta8 partly because they consider current market
conditions unfavorable. Staff agreed with the latter point but argued for a more active search
of a suitable strategic investor as the sale would crowd in FDI and have positive spillovers
within the financial system.
24.
The authorities are increasing the pass-through of fuel prices to avoid derailing
budget plans and prevent distortions while exploring means to shield vulnerable
groups. The authorities already increased the price of electricity in July 2008, although a
significant gap relative to costs remains. They also intend to introduce a water and electricity
tariff reform by the fall aiming to protect low-income households and progress toward cost
recovery. In this connection, staff advocated the introduction of rule-based mechanisms to
regularly update administered prices—according to market conditions and aiming to reach
cost recovery over a reasonable period. This would avoid the need for discretionary
government decisions, which have often been protracted and unnecessarily controversial.
25.
Provision of economic statistics has improved substantially but remains below
international best practices (Appendix II). Progress has been made toward SDDS
subscription (expected shortly). The authorities indicated their intention to reinforce the
National Statistics Office, including by filling essential management-level vacancies and
improving further national accounts and business statistics.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
Malta’s EMU membership in January 2008 is an important step forward in
seizing the opportunities of a global marketplace. The authorities’ strategy of boosting
competitiveness through liberalization, export diversification, and value-added upgrading is
beginning to pay off. Growth averaged 3½ percent in 2005–07, underpinned by fiscal
adjustment and economic liberalization, and driven by FDI and new niche exports. Export
reorientation, rising productivity, and terms-of-trade gains supported cost and noncost

17
competitiveness, trimming the current account and trade deficits. However, competitiveness
gaps remain, and Malta is particularly vulnerable to euro strength given its trade orientation.
These factors are intensifying the decline of traditional exports despite subdued ULC growth.
27.
Growth is expected to decelerate to 2¼–2½ percent in 2008–09 due to
unfavorable external developments before reverting back to trend of some 3 percent.
Import-price-driven inflation will curb domestic demand this year, while a weaker external
environment eliminates the growth contribution of net exports. Risks are on the downside:
traditional export sector declines could outpace the emergence of new activities, especially if
complacency over reforms were to dent investor sentiment and FDI.
28.
Seizing the potential of new growth niches will require improvements in
economic efficiency and market-based flexibility. Further fiscal consolidation and public
sector streamlining will be key. The start of the new legislature is an opportunity to
reinvigorate the necessary fiscal, financial, and structural reforms.
29.
The authorities’ MTO of structural fiscal balance by 2010 based on expenditure
retrenchment will require tackling the high cost of subsidies, payroll, and entitlements.
The authorities are appropriately identifying and implementing immediate spending cuts to
address expenditure overruns—partly caused by higher-than-budgeted fuel prices. This
should ensure a continuation of good progress toward the medium-term objective.
Reinforcing the fiscal framework with a medium-term orientation would help preserve the
benefits of fiscal consolidation and prioritize spending. Vulnerabilities inherent to Malta’s
small economy argue for targeting a surplus beyond 2010.
30.
The banking system is well placed to weather the current global turmoil but is
weakly provisioned and exposed to Malta’s narrow economic base. The supervisory
framework is rapidly improving in the wake of EU membership and further steps would
enhance resilience and market discipline. Banks have healthy liquidity and a good funding
profile. But exposure to the slowing housing market, and low and uneven provisioning call
for close vigilance. Recent international experience offers an opportunity to review
mechanisms for crisis prevention and resolution, including the needed authority and
flexibility to act expeditiously.
31.
Further public sector streamlining and market-oriented reforms are key to
realizing Malta’s growth potential. Reform of the public enterprise sector and administered
price-setting mechanisms will be essential to mitigate market distortions and redirect public
spending toward growth-enhancing investment. Enhancing the competition framework and
wage-bargaining flexibility would help to fight inflation and increase competitiveness.
32.

It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the 12-month cycle.

1/ External debt in this table relates to net external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms;
g = real GDP growth rate; e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency); and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
3/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both noninterest current account and nondebt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and nondebt inflows in percent of GDP) remain
at their levels of the last projection year.

1/ General government and gross debt.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Last six years. The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
7/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
8/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Table 9. Malta: Privatizations and Remaining Public Enterprises
Privatizations:
Maltacom (telecom)

Successful privatization of 40 percent through floatations until 1998. Sale of remaining
60 percent to TECOM investments in 2006 (which will also develop the SmartCity).

Malta International Airport

Successful privatization through sales of 40 percent to private operator in 2002 and a
further 40 percent through floatations in 2002 and 2005. The government retains a 20
percent stake.

Tug Malta (harbor towage)

In July 2007, the authorities sold their 73 percent stake to the Italian Rimorchiatori
Riuniti SpA.

Malta Freeport (main cargo harbor)

Concession to operate and develop extended in 2008 to 65 years to French shipping
company CMA-CGM, in return for future expansion/modernization worth 130 million
euros and 500 jobs over the next five years.

Maltapost (postal service)

Successful privatization through sales of 60 percent to Lombard Bank plc (2003 and
2005) and 40 percent through a highly oversubscribed floatation in February 2008.

Remaining public enterprises:
Malta shipyards

Privatization is now envisaged. Subsidies are scheduled to end in 2008 (an EU
accession commitment) and recent government statements point to interest by several
bidders. The process can be expected to require a considerable downsizing of the
current 1700-strong workforce. Until now there had been persistent losses, despite a 7year restructuring plan including 700 million euro debt write-offs and 148 million euros in
operating aid.

AirMalta (airline)

No privatization plans for 98 percent government stake. AirMalta's losses were reduced
from 30 million (2004) to 5 million euros (2007) in a restructuring program. Funding for
the restructuring emanated from sales of AirMalta's hotel properties, so that no
subsidies were paid. Recently AirMalta has expanded into intra-Italian routes.

Enemalta (energy)

Consists of three divisions. For the two smaller ones - Petroleum (profit of 20 million
euros in 2005) and LPG Gas bottling and distribution (0.4 million euros profit in 2005) privatization/long-term leasing is currently underway. The larger electricity division
recorded a loss of 20 million euros in 2005, mainly attributable to its pricing not keeping
pace with costs. Since then the introduction of a surcharge to cover rising fuel costs had
alleviated the problem somewhat, until the strong rise of oil prices at end-2007. The
government guarantees 70 percent of Enemalta's debt.

Water Services Corporation (water)

Privatization is not envisaged, but some efficiency-enhancing reforms have been
undertaken. The tariffs WSC charges are set by the government. High subsidies ensue
(25 million euros in 2006) as water prices to end users are kept artificially low.

Bank of Valletta (largest bank)

The authorities sold 15 percent to the Italian bank Unicredit and 60 percent in
floatations up to 1995. However, the state retains a 25 percent stake. The bank is run
on a commercial basis with no government interference in day-to-day decisions.

There are another 36 (fully or partially) public enterprises in the sectors of waste management, ferry services, air traffic control,
culture and broadcasting, amongst others.

Appendix I. Malta: Fund Policy Recommendations and Implementation
Policy Area

Fund Recommendations

Implementation

Fiscal policy

Pursue expenditure-based consolidation,
further reducing subsidies and public
consumption. Improve medium-term budget
planning. Adopt financial incentives in
healthcare.

Fiscal adjustment continued in 2007 and
2008. After delays, substantial progress in
curbing subsidies is being made since mid2008. Effort to improve budget planning is
ongoing; new procedures for capital projects
are being implemented. Performance
budgeting in hospitals is being introduced, but
co-payments have been ruled out.

Financial sector

Monitor non-performing loans (NPLs) and
concentration risks, notably exposure of
financial sector to the real estate sector.
Bolster provisioning by introducing tax
deductibility of specific provisions.

NPLs have continued to decline but
provisioning has remained thin, with no tax
deductibility. While exposure to the real
estate sector remains high, good progress
has been made in introducing Basel II
standards and upgrading the crisis
management and resolution framework.

Structural reforms

Bolster competitiveness by improving the
flexibility of the economy and rationalizing the
public sector. Enhance productivity by raising
the efficiency of energy and maritime
transportation networks and streamlining of
loss-making public enterprises; thereby
reduce ensuing subsidies.

The authorities have continued streamlining
the public sector with renewed momentum.
Long-term lease of port operations and post
privatization have been completed.
Privatization process was initiated for
shipyards to stop subsidies by end-2008.
Unbundling and privatization of LPG and
gasoline distribution operations is underway.
Retail electricity prices were increased and
the subsidy reduced, although prices remain
below cost recovery. Reforms of the electricity
pricing system and domestic transportation
have been announced.
The independence and profile of the
competition authority remains low. Partial
indexation of wages hampers the alignment
of wage and productivity increases and could
sustain inflationary pressures.

Appendix I. Malta: Fund Relations
(As of May 31, 2008)
Article IV mission: Discussions were held in Valletta, May 20–30, 2008.
Staff team: Messrs. Escolano (head), Henn, and Lissovolik (all EUR).
Country interlocutors: The mission met with Minister of Finance, Mr. Tonio Fenech;
Central Bank of Malta Governor, Mr. Michael Bonello; and other senior officials. It
also met with representatives of financial institutions, the private sector, employers and
labor unions, opposition, and academics. The authorities agreed to publish the
concluding statement.
Data: Malta participates in the IMF’s General Data Dissemination System and is at an
advanced stage to reach subscription to the Special Data Dissemination Standard.

I. Membership Status: Malta became a member of the IMF on September 11, 1968. It
eliminated all remaining restrictions under Article XIV of the Articles of Agreement and
accepted the obligations of Article VIII (Sections 2, 3, and 4) of the Articles of
Agreement on November 30, 1994.

VII. Exchange Rate Arrangement and Restrictions: Malta joined EMU on January 1, 2008
at the central parity of Maltese lira 0.429300 per €1. Malta maintains an exchange system
that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions, except for restrictions maintained for security reasons and
which have been notified to the IMF pursuant to Executive Board Decision No. 144(52/51).
VIII. Article IV Consultation: The last Article IV consultation was concluded on August 24,
2007. Malta is on a 12-month consultation cycle.
IX. Technical Assistance: (1999–present)
• An expert visited Valletta in November 2006, and April and December 2007 to assist
with the preparation of a producer price index, which was first published in May 2008
and constituted one of the last remaining criteria for future SDDS subscription.
• ROSC Data Module mission visited Malta in June 2007.
• FSAP missions in October 2002 and January 2003.
• STA mission on money and banking statistics visited Malta in March 2001.
• An MAE mission addressed monetary operations and liquidity forecasting
(February 1999).
X. Resident Representative: None.

4
Appendix II. Malta: Statistical Issues
Data provision is adequate for surveillance purposes. Significant progress in improving
macroeconomic statistics has been made in close cooperation with the ECB and Eurostat
while upgrading statistical systems to meet the euro area standards. However, national
accounts and balance of payments data have remained subject to substantial revisions, often
affecting several years. Most macroeconomic statistics can now be accessed through Eurostat.
The country has been a participant in the GDDS since September 11, 2000, with the metadata
posted on the IMF’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board. In 2007, the IMF has continued
to provide technical assistance to the authorities in order to develop a producer price index.
Its first release in May 2008 fulfilled one of few remaining requirements to achieve SDDS
standards. Given progress as of July 2008, reaching SDDS subscription status will necessitate
the appointment of an SDDS coordinator. In collaboration with IMF staff, the coordinator
will facilitate completion of the remaining steps toward SDDS subscription, such as the
finalization of the metadata, setting up a National Summary Data Page and Advance Release
Calendar, and finalization of the Reserves Template. The authorities are currently in the
process of taking these steps.
Real sector statistics: Data on retail and consumer prices, labor market indicators, and
tourism arrivals are released monthly, usually with a short lag. These data are available
through the Internet via the National Statistics Office (NSO) website. Presently the NSO
releases national accounts data in euros with one quarter lag. Statistical discrepancies
(captured under stock building) are often large, particularly on the first release, and typically
lead to sizable revisions. Supply side GDP estimates by type of economic activity are not
available, but the recently published producer price index will facilitate their compilation.
National accounts import and export data are not disaggregated into goods and services. The
harmonized index of consumer prices was first published in May 2004.
Government finance statistics: Fiscal statistics meet basic requirements, but timeliness is
below the general practice in the EU. The NSO publishes monthly statistics on the cash
operations of the central government. In addition, quarterly general government accounts are
published on an accrual basis in accordance with the ESA95 methodological framework. The
general government comprises data from the consolidated fund of government adjusted to
include other accounts of government, the accruals elements, and the financial performance
of the Extra Budgetary Units and of the Local Councils.
Monetary and financial statistics: Monetary statistics are timely and of good quality. Since
the entry into the euro area in January 2008, monetary data for IMF statistical publications are
now obtained through a gateway arrangement with the ECB, thus reducing the reporting
burden of the country. The country participated in the pilot project—Coordinated
Compilation Exercise—for Financial Soundness Indicators and submitted indicators as of

5
end-2005 along with metadata, which are now available to the public through the IMF’s
website (http://www.imf.org/external/np/sta/fsi/part.asp?iso=MLT).
External sector statistics: Summary data (merchandise trade, current account balance, and
selected financial account data) are released on a quarterly basis with a lag of about three
months. More detailed BOP data, as well as those on the international investment position,
are released annually, the latter with a lag sometimes exceeding one year. Summary trade
statistics are released monthly with a lag of about 40 days.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
Malta
On August 6, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Malta. 1
Background
Malta joined the European Monetary Union (EMU) on January 1, 2008 and has
implemented broad liberalizing economic reforms since EU accession in 2004. The
economy has experienced a three-year-long expansion with average annual growth of
over 3½ percent during 2005–07, driven by productivity gains, foreign direct investment,
and export diversification into new dynamic sectors. Domestic demand was supported by
rising employment and incomes. The external current account deficit fell to 5½ percent of
GDP in 2007 due to the revival of tourism, new niche service and pharmaceutical
exports, and sustained terms of trade gains. Traditional manufacturing exports, however,
continued a prolonged decline in the face of intense competition. Recently, Malta has
been adversely affected by the euro appreciation reflecting its predominant export
orientation toward non-EMU countries. High dependence on fuel and commodity imports
has pushed inflation—subdued until late 2007—above 4 percent.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
Expenditure-based fiscal consolidation continued in 2007, with the fiscal deficit falling to
1¾ percent of GDP in 2007. However, subsidies and state aid, the public wage bill, and
entitlement spending are comparatively high, exerting significant pressure on the budget.
The authorities have recently adopted several expenditure retrenchment measures,
including adjustments in the subsidized retail electricity tariff, aiming to keep the 2008
budget on track and continue progress toward their medium-term objective of structural
balance.
Financial soundness indicators held up in 2007 despite unfavorable international
developments. The banking sector’s liquidity and funding profile are healthy, and banks
have remained profitable despite markdowns in security portfolios. Nonperforming loans
fell further but are still comparatively high and thinly provisioned. Loan portfolios remain
concentrated in the real estate sector, which is cooling down.
Privatization and restructuring of public enterprises in key sectors (harbor services, post,
energy) continued during 2007. The authorities are unbundling and opening to private
participation the fuel and gas operations of the public energy company, and have
announced their intention to privatize the shipyards shortly.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors congratulated the authorities for Malta’s successful EMU entry on
January 1, 2008. The authorities’ strategy of boosting growth and external
competitiveness through closer regional and global integration, supported by fiscal
adjustment and liberalizing reforms, has catalyzed foreign direct investment, the
emergence of dynamic new export sectors, and attendant productivity gains. Malta’s
three-year-long expansion in employment and activity largely reflects economic opening
and public sector rationalization. Directors also noted the recent favorable trends in
Malta’s price and non-price competitiveness, which have contributed to reducing the
current account deficit.
Looking ahead, Directors stressed that the economy will face some challenges from a
weakening global economy, higher food and fuel prices, and possible risks in the
financial sector. Also, the decline in traditional sectors could accelerate and outpace the
emergence of new export activities. In the absence of independent monetary and
exchange rate policies, Directors underlined the importance of continuing to pursue
sound fiscal policies, increasing the flexibility of the economy, bolstering productivity
growth, and monitoring developments in the financial sector closely.
Directors praised the authorities’ fiscal performance, and welcomed measures to contain
public spending in 2008 as necessary for continued progress in reducing the budget
deficit. In particular, Directors viewed the increase in retail electricity tariffs as
instrumental in limiting expenditure overruns, and encouraged the authorities to follow
through with further steps toward full cost recovery while supporting efforts to protect
low-income households. The announced elimination of certain subsidies—notably those

3
to public shipyards—in 2009 are also important steps in putting the public finances on a
sound footing.
Directors stressed that reinforcing the budget framework with a medium-term orientation
would help preserve the benefits of consolidation while better prioritizing spending. They
supported the authorities’ objective of structural balance by 2010, and reiterated the
desirability of targeting a surplus thereafter, given the vulnerabilities inherent in the
economy’s small size and prospective demographic pressures on spending.
Directors observed that Malta’s banking system appears well-positioned to weather the
global financial turmoil, as banks have healthy liquidity and a good funding profile. At the
same time, Directors noted that the banks’ still-high level of nonperforming loans,
relatively thin provisioning, and concentrated exposures in the cooling housing sector
called for increased supervisory vigilance aimed inter alia at augmenting provisioning
buffers. Directors welcomed the upgrading of the supervisory and crisis management
frameworks, and recommended more frequent public reporting by the main banks. It
would also be useful to review the existing legal authority and institutional mechanisms
to act expeditiously in a crisis situation in light of recent international experiences.
Directors stressed the importance of strengthening labor and product market flexibility,
and further streamlining the public sector, to realize Malta’s growth potential and
maintain competitiveness within the EMU. They suggested introducing stable rulesbased mechanisms for setting administered prices, aiming at cost recovery over the
medium term. Directors recommended implementation of the EU Services Directive to
foster competition in sheltered markets, and reinforcing the competition and statistics
authorities. They encouraged the authorities to consider means to relax the price
indexation of wages, which could entrench inflationary dynamics and hinder alignment
between wage and productivity increases. Directors pointed out that that further
privatization in the banking sector would help to strengthen economic resiliency and
seize new growth opportunities.

Statement by Arrigo Sadun, Executive Director for Malta
and Francesco Spadafora, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
August 6, 2008
On behalf of the Maltese authorities, we thank staff for the well-written and informative
report, which is a testament to the fruitful and close cooperation with the authorities.
Overview
Since the beginning of the year, Malta has been a member of the Euro Area, a landmark
achievement in the authorities’ strategy of fostering an open economy fully integrated into
the global economy.
Malta has enjoyed a three-year long economic expansion underpinned by strong foreign
direct investment, rising productivity, export diversification, and value-added upgrade, all
largely induced by structural reforms. Fiscal adjustment, privatization, and public sector
streamlining have also contributed to the positive performance.
Growth accelerated to 3.8 percent in 2007 and unemployment reached record lows. Inflation
was limited to 0.7 percent, but it is expected to accelerate to 4.1 percent in 2008, before
easing to 2.7 percent in 2009, as food and oil prices stabilize. The trade deficit in goods and
services declined to 1.9 percent of GDP in 2007, from 5.3 percent in 2005, as a result of a
revival of tourism and exports of higher value-added products and services.
Substantial improvements in cost and noncost competitiveness have been key in this regard.
The former reflects productivity gains and wage moderation while the latter results from
FDI-driven export diversification, especially into new services, as well as terms-of-trade
gains, originating from upward shifts in export quality and value-added.
Malta’s history of stable institutional and business environment has attracted large FDI
inflows, which have so far amply overfinanced the current account deficit; this pattern is
expected to continue in the near future. Staff’s external sustainability analysis points to a
robust external balance sheet. However given the economy’s small size and openness and its
reliance on positive investor sentiment, there is a continuing need for prudent fiscal and
financial policies.
The positive trends in Malta’s competitiveness are partly captured by CGER-type estimates:
for example, the macroeconomic balance approach indicates a competitiveness gap of around
3 percent, versus 10-15 percent last year.
Staff expect growth to decelerate to around 2.5 percent in 2008 and 2.3 percent in 2009 as a
result of a weakening external environment that is testing the resiliency of the economy. The
authorities envisage a shallower slowdown on account of better export performance. There is
however agreement that, over the medium term, activity will recover rapidly toward trend,
sustained by FDI, emerging exports activities, and terms-of-trade gains.

2
The authorities recognize that the early period of the new legislation provides the opportunity
to advance fiscal, financial, and structural reforms, and are determined to make progress in
this regard.
Fiscal policy
The authorities are aware that market liberalization and EU membership have to be supported
by a low tax burden and robust fiscal savings in order to allow for public investment in
education and infrastructure that would boost productivity.
Progress in fiscal consolidation over the last few years has resulted in a reduction of the
overall budget deficit from 4.6 percent in 2004 to 1.8 percent in 2007, prompting the
termination of the Maastricht Treaty’s excessive deficit procedure. In the same period, public
debt as a percentage of GDP fell from 72.4 to 62.4 percent.
For 2008, the authorities are targeting, in their stability program, a budget deficit of 1.2
percent of GDP; they are also pursuing a medium-term objective (MTO) of a balanced
structural budget by 2010 in order to ensure domestic stability and reduce vulnerability to
external shocks.
However, because of anticipated overruns for the 2008 budget, partly arising from higher
than projected oil prices, the authorities are identifying and implementing offsetting cuts in
discretionary spending and have already raised electricity prices to close the gap with costs.
In staff’s view, the 2008 budget deficit will stand at 1.7 percent of GDP, as the planned
measures limit the overall underperformance to 0.5 percent of GDP. This notwithstanding,
the structural balance should mark a substantial step toward the MTO, improving from -2.6
percent of GDP in 2007 to -1.9 percent.
To safeguard the budget and prevent distortions, the authorities are increasing the passthrough of fuel prices while exploring means to shield vulnerable groups. They also intend to
introduce a water and electricity tariff reform by the fall, aiming to protect low-income
households and progress toward cost recovery.
To ease pressures on public finances, the authorities’ medium-term strategy is anchored in
further expenditure reforms aimed at containing spending in three main areas: subsidies and
state aid, the public wage bill, and the entitlement programs. They are also reinforcing the
fiscal framework by pursuing more structured multi-year fiscal planning and by introducing
methods of performance budgeting. Staff has recommended extending spending reviews to
all major areas and parliamentary agreement on aggregate expenditure limits before starting
budget appropriation discussions. In order to optimize the access to EU funding, evaluation
procedures for investment projects are being improved.
Financial sector
The resiliency of the financial sector has been tested by the recent international
developments, whose impact has so far been small.

3
According to the authorities and private sector analysts, a strong liquidity position and a good
funding profile, which relies mainly on resident deposits, place the banking system in a good
position to weather the global turmoil. Banks are profitable and have negligible exposure to
subprime-related assets. Some banks’ financial results were affected by markdowns in
security portfolios, while equity valuations saw substantial declines in 2008.
Banks are using opportunities for asset diversification created by EMU entry. More
generally, the internationally oriented financial sector (now fully under uniform regulation) is
expanding rapidly.
Close supervisory vigilance is needed in light of the banks’ large and growing exposure to
the housing market. This remains broadly stable overall, although tightening credit
conditions have resulted in real price declines in some market segments. Staff and the
authorities concur that there is probably little, if any, house overvaluation relative to
fundamentals.
Staff highlight that domestic asset quality remains weak due to relatively high, and thinly
provisioned, non-performing loans (NPLs). The authorities partly shared staff concerns over
the low and declining provision-coverage ratio, while noting that unprovisioned loans are
fully backed by high-quality collateral.
The authorities are making good progress in introducing Basel II and other EU prudential
standards, and, in light of lessons from the financial turmoil, are actively participating in EUwide efforts to strengthen the national and cross-border framework for crisis prevention and
resolution.
Memoranda of Understanding have been signed among key agencies and with relevant
foreign jurisdictions, and, based on recent international experience, deposit insurance
coverage is set to be strengthened.
Structural reforms
The authorities are aware that Malta’s competitiveness and economic prosperity hinge on a
stable macroeconomic framework and are determined to proceed with reforms in the product
and labor markets to improve economic efficiency and facilitate the reorientation toward
high-growth export activities.
This is important in light of the potential further declines that the traditional manufacturing
sector may experience, despite subdued unit labor cost growth, as a result of a weakening
external environment and competition from low-cost economies. The authorities, however,
see this decline as having largely run its course.
While remarkable progress has been made in strengthening the business environment and
improving education outcomes, additional policies would contribute to enhance still low
productivity and increase competitiveness. The authorities are seeking additional
improvements in educational attainment and labor market participation, particularly among
females.

4
The authorities acknowledge staff’s remarks on the existing across-the-board mandatory
inflation adjustment of wages (COLA), but point out that its impact is limited and facilitate
consensus in wage negotiations.
As for the public enterprise sector, despite significant divestment in several areas over the
last few years, it remains large and its administered price-setting mechanisms are a source of
market distortions as well as take a toll on the public budget. To mitigate such distortions
and, more generally, to further scale down the role of such a sector, the authorities are
reinvigorating the liberalization agenda and the reform of public enterprises. They have
announced their intention to restructure and privatize, shortly, the loss-making shipyards.
The authorities consider premature staff’s recommendation to grant institutional
independence to the competition authority (currently part of the Ministry of Finance), but
agree that a proactive stance is crucial in fostering price flexibility and efficient markets.
They view implementation of the EU services directive as an opportunity in this regard.
