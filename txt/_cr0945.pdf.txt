I. STAFF APPRAISAL AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
1.
The global financial crisis is taking a toll on Italy’s economy, compounding its
long-standing, home-grown, weaknesses. Output is projected to contract by about
½ percent in 2008 and 1 percent in 2009, with risks tilted to the downside, linked to a further
slowing of global growth and falling consumer confidence. Going forward, the economy’s
ability to rebound quickly is hampered by rigidities in product and labor markets, a lack of
domestic competition, a likely slower pace of industrial restructuring, and weakness of the
public finances.
2.
The policy agenda should focus on responding to the global crisis while
addressing Italy’s longer-term challenges. Given the exceptional nature of the crisis and its
impact on the domestic economy, some carefully tailored near-term counter-cyclical financial
and fiscal responses are warranted. But immediate measures should be aligned with the need
to respond to Italy’s real economic crisis—the relentless decline in productivity. Structural
reforms should thus continue to be pursued, and indeed intensified when conditions warrant,
aimed at increasing the economy’s growth potential and supported by medium-term
expenditure-based fiscal consolidation.
3.
While the banking system has proved resilient, further near-term actions are
warranted to further strengthen financial stability. The financial system has weathered
the turbulence well, helped by its relatively low risk profile and the authorities’ prudent and
systematic response to the crisis. But vulnerabilities have risen, related to banks’
capitalization, funding, credit quality, profitability, and exposure to Central and Eastern
Europe (CEE). To mitigate these vulnerabilities, recent financial sector support measures
should be fully and promptly implemented, and additional measures should be considered,
including a voluntary government recapitalization scheme. Care should be taken to ensure
transparency, minimize market distortions, limit government involvement in banks’
decision-making, including via a clear exit strategy, and avoid, to the extent possible,
potential spillovers for other countries, especially CEE. Efforts should also continue toward
enhancing international regulatory and supervisory coordination.
4.
At the same time, longer-term financial sector goals should be pursued.
Additional measures should be considered which would not only further strengthen financial
stability, but would also support the growth-enhancing role of the financial sector in the long
run. These could include improving consumer protection, further strengthening the
supervisory and regulatory landscape, and enhancing the coordination, efficiency and
information sharing among regulators. Efforts should also continue to further spur
competition and improve corporate governance in the financial sector.
5.
The budgeted fiscal consolidation for 2009 should be delayed. The government’s
innovative three-year fiscal package—which aims for a broadly-balanced budget by 2011
though spending-based measures—provides a good medium-term anchor. But the target
deficit of 2.1 percent of GDP for 2009 is no longer in line with the deteriorating
macroeconomic environment: staff project the deficit to widen to above 3 percent of GDP.
Nonetheless, the recession warrants a counter-cyclical fiscal response, which should be

4
tailored to Italy’s circumstances, especially its high debt. The budgeted cyclically-adjusted
consolidation for 2009 (estimated by staff at around 0.3 percent of GDP) should thus be
postponed. Timely, temporary, targeted and coordinated measures should be considered,
while fully implementing the budget’s envisaged reductions in current spending. The fiscal
package recently submitted to Parliament, which is likely to imply a broadly neutral fiscal
stance for 2009, is generally in line with these considerations. If the growth outlook
deteriorates significantly, a somewhat larger stimulus could be considered.
6.
The government should continue to steadfastly improve fiscal frameworks to
underpin the medium-term expenditure-based fiscal consolidation. The authorities have
made significant progress in streamlining the budget process, increasing the productivity of
public administration, improving the management of public assets, and advancing fiscal
federalism. These efforts need to be reinforced and remaining gaps filled. Linkages between
the reforms should also be exploited while ensuring consistency with the wider objective of
achieving sustainability via expenditure-based consolidation. The opportunity could also be
taken to make progress on addressing longer-term fiscal challenges, in particular, reforming
the welfare system.
7.
Concerted actions are needed to boost Italy’s growth potential. The structural
reform agenda should focus on further liberalizing retail trade and services, continuing
deregulation efforts in the energy market, and strengthening the role of competition bodies in
formulating policy. A second generation of labor market reforms is required to strengthen the
link between wages and productivity, allow wages to better respond to regional differences,
and make permanent contracts more flexible. International initiatives should be leveraged to
spur reform, while resisting tendencies toward protectionism.
8.
It is proposed that the next Article IV Consultation be held on the regular
12-month cycle.
II. CONTEXT: WEATHERING THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS

Italy’s financial sector has not avoided the global financial crisis, but has so far
withstood the turbulence. Financial markets were shaken as the international crisis
intensified: equity prices plunged, the interbank market Tier I Capital Ratios and Leverage of the

surveys indicate significant tightening ahead (mostly in terms of pricing and lending
standards), and household lending has already sharply declined, chiefly for demand reasons.
Third-quarter profits for the major banks remained positive, albeit much lower than last year
and helped by the application of the new international accounting rules. 1 Bank CDS spreads,
while higher, remained below those of other European peers, reflecting their relatively safer
risk profile: the traditional, relationship-based banking business model that has supported a
broad and stable funding base (composed mainly of retail deposits and bonds), low leverage
ratios, a comparatively high-quality traditional asset portfolio with little exposure to “toxic”
assets, and relatively low dependence on wholesale interbank funding (Box 1). These factors
have been supported by a firm bank regulatory and supervisory environment, strong
intervention and resolution frameworks, and pre-existing high levels of depositor protection
that exceeds the EU minimum (Annex III). 2

The IAS39 rule allows for reclassification of marked-to-market assets as held to maturity. Financial institutions
with large securities investments and trading books benefit from the rule the most.

Depositors in all banks incorporated under the Italian law are protected by the two deposit insurance schemes
(one for mutual banks and one for all the rest). The deposit insurance is generous compared to other EU
countries—at €103,291 per depositor per bank— and has always exceeded the EU-required minimum (recently
raised to €50,000).

Box 1. The Relative Resilience of Italian Banks — Some Explanatory Factors
A few factors could explain why banks did not engage in high-risk/high-yield strategies involving
structured products, which would have put them more at risk in the current crisis:
•

Financial intermediation is relationship based and dominated by banks. This, combined with an
extensive bank-branch network and a sound deposit-insurance system, helps ensure a solid
deposit base and a retail market for other bank liabilities. In addition, most other financial
services (i.e. asset-management and insurance) are also channeled via banks’ networks. Profits
are more stable, which, perhaps, supports safer business strategies. Indeed, even throughout the
financial turbulence, and unlike many of their peers, Italian banks managed to sustain a steady
pace of income and deposit growth.

•

Low (until recently) contestability of the system, combined with still high net interest margins and
retail banking fees, insulated banks from competition, lowering their appetite for risk. Recent
evidence indicates that net margins in Italy increased over the past year and that banks have been
able to pass the increases in their funding costs onto customers.

•

Growth opportunities elsewhere (until recently). Italian banks have rapidly expanded into
fast-growing emerging markets, such as new EU member states and Russia, engaging primarily
in core banking business. These subsidiaries (until recently) generated double-digit profit growth.
However, these exposures are turning into vulnerabilities as the financial crisis takes its toll on
the region (see ¶21).

•

Regulatory provisions may have inhibited riskier strategies. For example, regulatory provisions
issued by the Bank of Italy, including those on derivatives, while in line with EU norms and the
Basel Accord, have been more stringent than in other countries. The regulation for covered
bonds, which has been recently finalized (May 2007), contains strict eligibility requirements as
regards capital ratios for issuers and limits on amount of assets allowed to be transferred to an
SPV.

•

Past scandals could have reduced banks’ appetite for risk-taking. After corporate fraud scandals
with Parmalat and Cirio, banks have been heavily sanctioned by regulators.

8
10.
The system’s resilience has been supported by the authorities’ prudent and
systematic response. From the onset of the crisis in 2007, the Bank of Italy (BoI) intensified
monitoring and disclosure of banks’ risky exposures and communicated the (generally
reassuring) results to the markets. Capitalizing on already strong practices, and in line with
international recommendations, the BoI also intensified liquidity monitoring (with weekly
reporting requirements for the large banks), prudential oversight of risk management and
contingency plans of banks, and targeted inspections, and required leading banks to regularly
report counterparty risk and stress test more frequently. 3 The high-level interministerial
committee on financial stability held frequent ad-hoc meetings, and, as the crisis intensified
in September 2008, the securities regulator (Consob) banned short sales. In addition, the
government passed two enabling decrees that: (1) allow the government to inject capital into
troubled banks on a case-by-case basis, through non-voting preference shares, with
conditionality attached; (2) guarantee new bank liabilities; (3) permit the BoI to swap
government debt for low-quality bank collateral (for up to €40 bn; operations have already
started)—if needed, the Treasury will guarantee the BoI loans; (4) boost the BoI’s powers to
initiate prompt and early bank resolution to avoid losses; and (5) fully underwrite the deposit
guarantee fund. The details of the scheme—especially the pricing of the state capital
injections and bank obligations—are awaiting the implementing legislation.
11.
The ensuing global slowdown precipitated the economy’s fall into recession.
Output contracted by ½ percent in each of the middle two quarters of 2008. With confidence
at its lowest level in over a decade, consumption continued to decline despite still-positive
employment gains and substantial easing of inflationary pressures. Gross fixed investment
slowed sharply in the first half of 2008, due to pessimism about demand prospects and tighter
financing conditions. The contribution of net exports turned firmly negative as partner
country demand weakened. The housing market has also been cooling, but less so than in
many other European countries, given that house prices had not risen as sharply. 4

3

The Bank of Italy, in collaboration with the leading banks, has launched a program of periodic stress tests,
using a variety of methods, sensitivity analyses, and scenarios. The results the May exercises (published in the
Annual Report) demonstrated that “the system offered a good level of resistance to the scenarios postulated”
with regard to credit, interest rate, market and liquidity risks.

The revenue-based fiscal consolidation has come to an end. The structural fiscal
balance improved by 2¾ percent of GDP in 2006−07, mainly due to exceptionally strong
revenues, with the overall deficit narrowing to 1.6 percent of GDP in 2007. But, reflecting the
expansionary budget, weaker revenues, and some temporary factors, the deficit likely
rebounded to 2¾ percent of GDP in 2008, entailing a loosening in structural terms and a higher
expenditure ratio, with the primary current spending ratio reaching a record high. The global
turmoil and economic weakness have already dented corporate profit taxes. Sovereign 10-year
spreads over bunds exceeded 140 bps in December (compared to less than 30 bps a year ago),
reflecting greater risk aversion and lower bund yields—overall sovereign yields have, however,
fallen (which the authorities have moved quickly to lock in).

III. OUTLOOK AND RISKS: CONTINUED WEAKNESS
13.
The near-term outlook is bleak. The global financial crisis has been affecting Italy’s
real economy mainly through the growth/trade and confidence channels, though the credit
channel is likely to prove substantial going forward, and Italy starts from an already relatively
weak base (Box 2). Output is projected to fall by about ½ percent in 2008 and 1 percent in
2009, given negative carry-over from the worse-than-expected output declines in Q2 and Q3
2008, weak recent indicators, and expected weaker partner country demand. The projected
deterioration in Italy’s growth rate between 2008 and 2009 reflects Italy’s relatively low level
and variance of potential growth, but also some potentially insulating factors: its resilient
banking system, low private sector leverage ratios, a less inflated housing market, and the
industrial restructuring of recent years.

Negative risks dominate the outlook, and the eventual recovery will likely be
slow and weak. Uncertainty about the outlook is exceptionally large. Given the Italian
economy’s particularly high reliance on exports, downside external risks dominate, stemming
from the feedback loop between continuing strains in the global financial system and slowing
global economic activity. But domestic risks associated with additional falls in consumer
confidence, linked to the deteriorating macroeconomic context and rising uncertainty, are
also important. Staff estimate that in the event of a prolonged credit crunch (i.e., decline in
loan volumes accompanied by further widening of spreads), investment could decline
significantly, resulting in an additional output loss of up to 1 percent a year for two years
(Box 2). Going forward, the economy’s ability to rebound quickly is hampered by pervasive
rigidities, lack of domestic competition, the likely slower pace of industrial restructuring, and
the limited scope for a fiscal response. Hence, growth is expected to pick up only modestly in
2010, staying below its already weak potential.

12
Box 2. Channeling the Financial Turmoil to the Real Economy
The Italian economy has, so far, been mostly affected by the impact of the global financial
crisis on partner country demand, with Italy’s growth plunging in sync with that of other
industrial countries.
•
Investment. To date, bleak demand prospects at home and (especially) abroad
weighed heavily on business confidence and hence investment. At the same time, the direct
effect of tighter credit conditions has been more moderate, chiefly due to the fact that Italian
firms, on average, rely less on external funding for investment and growth.1 The slowing
economy has eroded the self-funding capacity of firms, but the increase in credit costs to
date (over 70 bps) did not affect the pace of credit growth to corporates (though overall
corporate borrowing did slow as bond placements have dried up since Q2), with most of the
tightening occurring via prices rather than quantities. Staff estimates that, to date, the global
downturn subtracted more than 1 percentage point from fixed investment growth, while the
contribution of tighter credit conditions has been more recent and limited (about ½ ppt).
Corporate borrowing held up well, but household borrowing slowed sharply.

Inflation is expected to moderate in line with the slowdown in growth and global
commodity prices. Inflation moderated in November—coming down from a decade high
peak—largely due to declining global prices for oil and food. Core inflation, however,
remained elevated, and the differential with the euro area widened further, with weak
competition in the service sector (especially in domestic trade) likely contributing. As the
output gap widens further, inflation is projected to slip well below 2 percent in 2009.
Headline inflation is coming down rapidly, in line with the Euro Area, but the positive core gap persists.

The current account deficit is projected to widen to around 3 percent of GDP in 2008
and further in 2009 and decline only gradually over the medium term. So far this year,
nominal export strength has roughly offset the higher energy import bill, while non-energy
imports were subdued. But data for October/November indicate an accelerating contraction in
both exports and (to a lesser extent) imports. The trade account is expected to deteriorate slightly
in 2008−2010, due to weakened global demand weighing on exports, although imports are also
expected to suffer as a result of lower domestic demand. Over the medium term, export growth is
expected to gradually pick up as the global economy recovers, while lower import prices would
help reduce the trade deficit and, gradually, the current account deficit. The main downside risks
are slower partner country growth and a further deterioration of competitiveness.
17.
A modest competitiveness gap persists. Italy’s market share in world trade declined
markedly (and more than its peers) since the mid 1990s. Moreover, CPI— and ULC-based
real exchange rates point to a continued appreciation that has dampened real exports. Recent
staff estimates of the equilibrium real exchange rate based on the CGER methodology
support this conclusion, indicating a competitiveness gap of some 8–9 percent.
The current account deficit has increased relative to the norm,
but is expected to gradually decline over the medium run.

The authorities recognized that the macroeconomic outlook had deteriorated
significantly, but views on the severity of the downturn differed. While the Ministry of
Economy and Finance (MEF) has not officially revised its growth projections of 0.1 and
0.5 percent for 2008 and 2009, respectively, which underlie the budget currently in
Parliament, there was broad recognition that downside risks were materializing. Nevertheless,
they saw a milder downturn than staff, highlighting that Italy’s stronger banking system and
healthy household balance sheets should help it weather the downturn, and that Italy should
benefit more than other countries from the weaker euro and declining energy prices. The
BoI’s views on the outlook were more negative and similar to staff’s. All interlocutors saw
negative risks dominating. Although neither the MEF nor the BoI have released revised
forecasts, there was a broad agreement with the mission on the inflation outlook.

IV. THE POLICY AGENDA: RESPONDING TO THE CRISIS AND REINFORCING
LONG-TERM GOALS
19.
Short-term actions are warranted to counter the effects of the global crisis. The
exceptional nature of the crisis and its repercussions for the domestic economy require
near-term actions to strengthen financial stability and a countercyclical fiscal response both at
the national and international level. But such actions should be tailored to Italy’s specific
circumstances—especially its high public debt and widening spreads, which constrict the
scope for an aggressive fiscal policy response—being mindful of international spillovers.
20.
But immediate actions should be aligned with the need for longer-term reforms
to address Italy’s main challenge— its chronic lack of growth. Beyond the present
cyclical slowdown, the real economic crisis confronting Italy is the decline in productivity
over the last decade, which has spawned stagnating incomes, rising unit labor costs, a
significant competitiveness gap, and tepid growth. And Italy’s large and unproductive public
sector—with its poor quality spending, high effective tax burden, and persistent deficits—
compounds the problem. The government should thus set short-term measures with longerterm goals in mind, aimed at increasing productivity and ensuring fiscal sustainability.

16
A. Preserving Financial Soundness
21.
While the financial system remains sound and well supervised, vulnerabilities
have risen. These are mainly related to:

Liquidity and funding: Banks’ funding
maturity mismatch is rising, given their
increasing reliance on relatively shorter-term
ECB refinancing and retail bond issues. For a
number of large institutions, which are more
reliant on wholesale and interbank international
market funding, sizeable debt redemptions are
coming due in the next 24 months, and
although 12-month ahead redemptions are
largely pre-funded, some gaps remain. In
addition, recourse to the retail bond market
could be more limited going forward, as scope
for switching away from other investments
narrows and the market becomes saturated.

Large redemptions are coming due in 2009-10


Capital: While the banking system’s
capitalization meets regulatory requirements, core
Tier I capital in a few large banks has fallen
below 6 percent since late 2007. And despite
steps taken by large banks to boost capital,
including through rights issuance and scrip
dividend, markets may view their new ratios as
weak compared to many peers elsewhere,
especially those that have received governmentsponsored recapitalizations. In addition, banks’
important shareholders— foundations that hold
more than half of the capital of listed banks—may
have limited financial capacity to quickly boost
banks’ capitalization if needed.

Profitability. Despite high margins and
fees, inefficiencies have led to relatively low
profitability even in good times, which is set to
decline further as activity flags. As of June,
annualized return on equity fell to 10 percent
(from 13 percent a year ago) and individual bank
financial reports also suggest that some large
banks would have registered losses in the third
quarter, were it not for the boost to profitability
due to the new accounting rule.


Regional exposures. Two large Italian banks are major players in several CEE
countries, where unwinding of imbalances is leading to some hard landings. 5 Although
banks’ overall exposures seem moderate (below 10 percent of consolidated equity) and their
lending strategies relatively prudent, most regional subsidiaries previously required funding
from the parent, and these requirements could increase if conditions in the host countries
deteriorate. In addition, exposures to Western Europe (Germany) have already proven to be a
significant negative factor. Profitability is also likely to suffer from such regional exposures.

Credit quality. Households and corporate debt burdens, though low, are increasing,
and impaired loans are rising, prompting banks to build up reserves. As the recession deepens
and funding costs rise, credit quality is likely to worsen, with small enterprises likely to come
under particular pressure.

Cross-border regulatory risk. A number of Italian banks have substantial operations
in other European countries, as do foreign banks in Italy. Yet, even in the midst of the crisis,
Europe still lacks a well-defined and binding mechanism of cross-border supervision and
crisis-resolution and effective information-sharing.
If the financial crisis and credit crunch intensify, so too will these vulnerabilities.
22.
Additional steps to strengthen financial stability, many of which are already in
train, could help mitigate these vulnerabilities. Recent bank support packages need to be
fully implemented to shore up confidence, especially by making fully operational the funding
guarantee scheme. In addition, a voluntary pre-emptive recapitalization scheme, available to
sound banks, could play a useful role in supporting investor confidence and fostering credit
growth. The modalities of this scheme should be carefully designed to minimize market
distortions and limit government involvement in banks’ decision-making (for example, on
credit growth), including via a clear exit strategy. In this regard, ensuring full transparency is
crucial. Experience in other countries also suggests that: (1) the operation should be on
commercial terms, but not unduly expensive in order to increase take-up by banks, encourage
private capital raising, and support credit growth; (2) dividend policy should reflect the need
to shore up confidence and repay government holdings; and (3) full and quick loss
recognition needs to be actively fostered, especially to encourage the re-capitalized banks to
minimize credit tightening going forward; and (4) conditionality (for example on lending)
should be limited. These principles are also reflected in the recent EU Communiqué (of
December 5) on bank recapitalization schemes.
23.
Fostering international coordination is critical. Italy’s advocacy of a more
coordinated international approach to crisis resolution and stronger cross-border supervision
is welcome. This should be continued, along with Italy’s implementation of the international
financial reform agenda, including the remaining FSF recommendations and finalizing

20 percent in Hungary, and 18 percent in Poland and have exposures in Russia, Ukraine and the Baltics.

18
implementation of EC Directives (in particular MIFID and the Takeover Directive). The
Italian authorities should be mindful of potential spillovers from their bank support actions
for other countries, especially in CEE. For example, government recapitalization funds
should not be prevented from being used to recapitalize subsidiaries in other countries, if this
were deemed an efficient way of supporting the domestic bank.
24.
The agenda for achieving longer-term financial sector goals should continue to
be pursued. Immediate measures aimed at ensuring financial stability should also support the
growth-enhancing role of the financial sector in the long run. In particular, the supervisory
and regulatory landscape could be further strengthened by: establishing a personal bankruptcy
law, which is especially important given the weak growth outlook; intensifying efforts to
ensure transparency and consumer protection, as banks become increasingly reliant on bond
issuance to retail investors; completing legislative efforts to reduce the number of regulators
and improve coordination among them; 6 and finalizing the removal of banks from the
ownership of the BoI. The work to enhance the BoI’s stress testing to incorporate complex
interlinkages across institutions and the macroeconomic environment should also continue.
The strides made in recent years to spur competition and improve corporate governance,
which appear to positively affect growth, should be preserved and built upon. In addition,
other efficiency-enhancing measures, such as the reform of cooperative banks (which could
also support financial stability), should not be sidelined. 7
25.
The authorities broadly agreed with staffs’ appraisal of the financial system and
main recommendations. They recognized the growing vulnerabilities in the financial system
and the need to fully implement remaining measures to mitigate them; indeed they assured
that work was well under way and the remaining legislation would be issued shortly. They
also noted that emergency recapitalization scheme has been operational, but no recourse to it
has been necessary. On the voluntary bank recapitalization scheme, the BoI and the Treasury
saw continued financing of the economy as a main objective of the measure; the BoI favored
relatively light conditionality. The authorities stressed the need to ensure close coordination
among European countries, especially in the design of the various bank support packages. In
this respect, they pointed to the spillover on Italian banks from the global “race to the top” to
reach high capitalization ratios, even though the situation of Italian banks was very different.
More generally, the MEF pointed out that the financial turmoil has stressed the well-known
drawbacks of the European supervisory architecture and has called for an urgent review
aimed at introducing effective coordination instruments.

6

The so-called “Authorities” law, drafted but not finalized during the previous government’s term, envisaged a
“twin-peak” model of market regulation and supervision, reducing the number of regulators from four to two
(BoI and Consob).

19
B. Providing Short-Run Support While Maintaining Fiscal Sustainability
26.
The government’s innovative three-year fiscal package targets significant
adjustment in 2009 and a broadly-balanced budget by 2011. These commitments, in line
with Italy’s undertakings under the SGP, are positive signs of policy continuity and key steps
toward debt sustainability. The adjustment plan is appropriately expenditure-based (though
perhaps overly ambitious with respect to reducing investment spending) and targets an
increase in the cyclically-adjusted balance of 0.6 percentage points in 2009, with a headline
deficit of 2.1 percent of GDP, while the public debt and spending ratios are projected to fall.
This plan is based on real growth rising from 0.5 percent in 2009 to 1.2 percent in 2011.
27.
But the near-term fiscal outlook has since sharply deteriorated, in line with the
macroeconomic environment. Staff projects the fiscal deficit in 2009 to be above 3 percent
of GDP, mainly due to weaker growth, while the expenditure ratio would rise, even if
nominal spending plans are observed. And adjusting for staff’s output gap and other minor
factors, the cyclically-adjusted balance (and excluding the impact of the package announced
on November 28) would increase by 0.3 percent of GDP (and by 0.5 percent of GDP net of
one-off measures). In addition, there are risks that tax elasticities could shift adversely during
the downturn and expenditure savings would be not be fully realized. The debt ratio will
likely rise further, reflecting the gap between the still-high average interest rate on
government debt and falling growth rates, a lower primary balance, and possible bank
support operations.
28.
Nonetheless, macroeconomic considerations and the need for a coordinated
international response argue for delaying the planned structural consolidation in 2009.
While preserving and fully implementing the budget’s envisaged reductions in current
spending, timely, temporary, targeted and coordinated counter-cyclical measures could lessen
the impact of the output decline without significantly undermining fiscal sustainability. As in
other countries, the measures could include one-off outlays for vulnerable groups, bringing
forward planned maintenance spending, and reductions in government payments delays. In
this context, the recent measure limiting interest deductibility for banks could be deferred,
and its modalities reconsidered. Public infrastructure spending, especially accelerating
existing projects, would support both short-term demand and longer-term growth if
implemented rapidly, transparently, and efficiently, with due regard to fiscal risks and using
the recommendations of the recent spending review. While policy diversification is
important, given uncertainty about the effectiveness of different measures, piecemeal
responses should be avoided and a credible path to the MTO maintained. The “anti-crisis”
package of fiscal measures recently (after the mission’s conclusion) submitted to Parliament
is broadly in line with these considerations, implying a broadly neutral fiscal stance for 2009
(Box 3). If the growth outlook deteriorates significantly, a somewhat larger fiscal stimulus
could be considered.

20
29.
Italy, unlike many other advanced countries, is ill-placed to launch a more
aggressive fiscal response to counter the effects of the global financial crisis. With its
large debt, spiking spreads over Bunds, and the prospect of debt issuance rising globally,
delays in adjustment will likely raise interest costs and undermine confidence. Also, Italy’s
growth problems stem from low potential, not cyclical, growth, and past relaxations have not
proven to be effective.
Box 3. Italy’s Recent Fiscal Measures to Counter the Crisis
On November 28, the government passed an “anti-crisis” decree that aims to support the
flagging economy. The package’s gross cost is around ½ percent of GDP, but it aims to be broadly
neutral in net terms taking into account offsetting (mainly revenue-raising) measures. But the total
economic impact could go beyond the fiscal cost, especially if measures to accelerate investment
projects prove to be effective. The main countercyclical measures fall into three broad categories:
•

Support to families/individuals (the bulk of the fiscal cost of the package): the main measure
is a one-off bonus to low-income households. There are also provisions to cap interest rates on
mortgages, make additional social payments, cut taxes on productivity bonuses, and limit road
tolls and household utility payments.

•

Support to enterprises: these mainly take the form of “cash-flow” support: postponing the
timing of certain tax payments and reducing payment delays by the government. There is
another important measure on guaranteeing bank borrowing, with specific targets for financing
small and medium-sized enterprises—its modalities are to be clarified in a separate decree.

•

Acceleration of investment: including appointing special officials to take charge of key
projects, with a view to accelerating their implementation, more investment financing for
railroads, and additional financing for the main national projects.

The package — while not perfect — appears to be broadly appropriate for Italy. The likely expost fiscal cost of the decree — even assuming some shortfall of offsetting revenue-raising measures in
a weak economy — is likely to be 0.2-0.3 percent of GDP, within the available scope for fiscal
stimulus, though some further measures could be considered, especially if there are high-quality
investment projects being delayed essentially for lack of financing. The key measure (bonus) is timely,
temporary, and targeted, although not all measures conform to these principles. The omnibus structure
of the “decree-law” offers the dual advantage of immediate effect and “policy diversification” (though
perhaps too diversified). At the same time, there would be some flexibility of future implementation in
follow-up decrees on specific issues, such as on bank borrowing guarantees. Appropriate
implementation — and in particular controlling fiscal risks stemming from bank guarantees and
investment projects — will be important to maximize the package’s effect on confidence and contain
costs.

31.
Italy’s fiscal framework has been improving steadily over time, but insufficiently
to fix its fragile public finances. In particular, the perennial need for consolidation was
typically addressed in a piecemeal fashion, often by closing the most visible gaps through
“emergency” annual packages that were only partially effective. Efficiency-oriented reforms
based on strategically decentralizing the budget process through greater managerial flexibility
(initiated in 1997) and fiscal federalism (2001) were repeatedly delayed or scaled back partly
to safeguard short-term outcomes. As a result, both the quantity and quality of fiscal
adjustment suffered.
32.
The government should build on steps recently taken to improve fiscal
frameworks, which are crucial for the viability of the expenditure-based adjustment.
Important actions have already been taken, including: (1) streamlining the budget process and
strengthening its medium-term orientation; (2) increasing the productivity of public
administration by containing the cost of public employees and implementing a
comprehensive plan to reduce the burden of administration; (3) advancing measures to
improve cost effectiveness in the education sector, following the recent spending review; and
(4) finalizing the draft law on fiscal federalism, currently with Parliament, which aims at
increasing the fiscal autonomy and discipline of all levels of government. But these steps
need to be built upon to achieve longer-term objectives, including by:
•
Deepening budget system reform: For next year’s medium-term plan, the realism of
the baseline projections should be enhanced and fiscal targets should reflect agreements with
sub-national governments. Rigidities need to be reduced, including by overhauling the budget
law, streamlining legislation related to spending programs, and increasing flexibility in the
management of civil servants (Annex I).
•
Pursuing cost-conscious fiscal federalism: This requires a transparent, formula-based,
equalization scheme, a robust and independent regime for monitoring fiscal targets,
harmonized accounting, and greater civil service mobility. Given that sub-national

26
governments need sufficient revenue autonomy at the margin to finance spending preferences
or cost overruns, a comprehensive review of property taxation would be useful, especially
since the tax on primary residences has recently been eliminated. Should the reform seem set
to result in higher costs, bolder offsetting measures could be considered, including
streamlining the structure of sub-national governments.
•
Better managing public sector assets: Care should be taken to ensure that the
potential proceeds from sales of public assets do not delay consolidation. 8 Faster progress

33.
The authorities agreed with the need for some limited temporary measures to
address the impact of the crisis, while remaining committed to their adjustment plan.
While agreeing that the worsening macroeconomic conditions warranted some scaling back
of planned consolidation, the MEF stressed Italy’s relatively limited room for maneuver,
especially the high debt burden and the rising spreads, and believed the deficit could still be
below the 3 percent limit in 2009. Accelerating investment spending and supporting credit
extension were seen as the most effective way of stimulating growth.
34.
Views on prospects for longer-term reforms were mixed. On pension reform, the
MEF pointed to political sensitivities, a potential negative impact on confidence, several
reforms of recent years, and risks of implementation delays and reversals, as had occurred
with the 2004 reform. Also, the MEF’s long-term age-related spending projections for Italy
do not indicate any urgency for such reforms. Most interlocutors suggested that reforms to the
budget process and fiscal federalism structure would proceed, though admittedly slowly. The
MEF is keen to build on the pilot spending review exercise and reduce rigidities in the
system, but recognized the medium-term nature of the reform program. Fiscal federalism
reforms will be largely dependent on follow-up legislation that is to evolve over the next
couple of years. Some interlocutors considered that the forthcoming retirement of many
public employees offered a key opportunity to generate cost savings, as did the potential
revision of the accounting law.

C. Enhancing Competitiveness and Productivity
35.
The real crisis confronting Italy is the chronic lack of growth due to declining
productivity. Italy experienced an unprecedented fall in factor productivity over the last
decade, both in manufacturing (from a high level) and services (from a low level), which lies
behind the relentless increase in unit labor costs and Italy’s falling behind its peers in GDP
per-capita terms. This has been linked to a number of structural factors, including: (1) policy
and regulatory rigidities limiting competition and hindering the business environment; (2)
low efficiency, linked to the preponderance of small and medium-sized enterprises that are
unable to exploit fully economies of scale; (3) limited process and product innovation,
hindered by labor market rigidities; and (4) outdated specialization patterns, given a
production structure (especially in manufacturing) based on traditional low skill products.

36.
Despite recent industrial restructuring and structural reforms, Italy still lags its
peers.
•
Recent, but modest, improvements in Italy’s micro-based competitiveness indicators
reflect a private-sector driven restructuring in sectors already exposed to competition. And
although some reallocation toward more dynamic and high-tech sectors occurred, it was
slower than in EU peers, with Italy missing out on opportunities to develop its service
exports, especially in tourism (Box 4). 9 Thus, while the authorities’ policies are promoting
domestic stability, and hence the external stability of the union as a whole, productivity and
labor utilization need to improve to ensure longer-term stability.

See “Competitiveness in the Southern Euro Area: France, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain” WP 08/112.

28
•
Building on progress made in recent years in product and service market
liberalization, the government has: (1) passed the local public services bill (albeit falling
short of requirements); (2) simplified legislation; (3) implemented a law instituting
competition assessments and regulatory impact analysis; and (4) incorporated the Antitrust
Authority’s recommendations in a competition bill to be discussed by Parliament annually.
But the reform momentum appears to have slowed.

Significant labor market reforms over the past decade have improved employment,
labor force participation, and unemployment rates, but Italy’s employment-to-population ratio
continues to remain among the lowest in the euro area. Moreover, while the deregulation of
fixed-and part-term contracts in recent years has improved labor market flexibility, it has also
resulted in more “atypical” employment, contributed to stagnant labor productivity, and
exposed workers to increased employment risk without commensurate improvements in the
social safety net, implying that recent employment gains can be easily reversed.

Box 4. Is Italy Gaining Competitiveness by Restructuring?1
Standard measures indicate that Italy has a modest competitiveness gap. But it is often
countered that Italy’s exports have been robust in nominal terms, and there is much anecdotal
evidence of trade-based firm restructuring in response to the challenges of globalization. Could
such restructuring imply that Italy is substantially more competitive than standard indicators
suggest?
On the positive side, there is evidence of moderate export quality upgrading, proxied by unit
value growth (though this is an imperfect proxy also indicative of cost pressures), and some
redirection toward dynamic markets and increase in outsourcing. More ambiguously, recent staff
analyses indicate that competitive pressure on Italy’s exports has been consistently higher than
for key EU comparators. While this has been a factor pushing firms to restructure, it also reflects
“unfavorable” specialization. Less encouragingly, there are no major positive competitiveness
trends emerging from the sluggish services sectors, FDI flows, and the technological content of
Italy’s exports.
The restructuring may also have much further to go. The intersectoral reallocation of resources
away from traditional activities has been limited, and the dynamics of competition from
emerging markets have yet to play out, especially as these countries may intensify their
upgrading. And while Italy may retain certain niches, a deeper downsizing in some sectors is
also a possibility. On balance, export quality improvements are likely to have alleviated some of
the competitiveness gap, but not enough to substantially offset the broader structural
shortcomings weighing on external performance.
1/ See “Trends in Italy’s Nonprice Competitiveness” IMF WP 08/124.

37.
The structural reform agenda should continue to be pursued to boost Italy’s
growth potential. Given Italy’s history of sluggish liberalization and reform and complex
judicial and regulatory system, a comprehensive structural reform strategy remains critical for
reviving Italy’s growth potential. Piecemeal reforms run the risk of paralysis and reversals,
while broad-ranging reforms would produce synergies (Annex II). Building on the progress to
date, and rather than allowing it to be eclipsed by the current crisis, the government’s reform
agenda should continue to be pursued, and indeed expanded when conditions warrant,
including by adopting the recommendations of the Antitrust Authority and OECD, focusing
on: further liberalizing retail trade and (especially professional) services; continuing
deregulation efforts in the energy market, particularly gas; strengthening the role of
competition bodies in formulating and influencing policy at an early stage; and eliminating
cross-vetoes for infrastructure projects of national interest. The policy agenda and its public
acceptance could be strengthened by making greater use of public discussion documents and
expert committees (e.g., Australia’s Productivity Commission).

38.
A second generation of labor market reforms is needed. Key constraints on labor
market performance that should be addressed include: a wage determination mechanism that
prevents wages from being more strongly linked to productivity; an inefficient, and unequal,
social safety net that prevents sufficient labor reallocation; asymmetric regulation of different
contract types that tilts incentives toward atypical employment contracts; and high labor
taxation that reduces the incentives for employment creation. Although not well suited as a
short-term stimulus measure, broadening and streamlining the social safety net, in particular
the unemployment benefit system, could provide some support for the likely increase in
redundancies and widen the scope for public acceptance of reducing dismissal restrictions of
permanent contracts. Such reform could be financed in part by reducing replacement rates
and spending on active labor market policies, and by eliminating piecemeal measures such as
tax reductions on overtime/bonus pay which are costly and unlikely to substantially improve
outcomes. More generally, any reductions in labor taxation should be broad-based and
combined with modifications of the wage bargaining framework that increase the scope for
firm-level bargaining. Labor market reform, together with employment and real wages, would
also benefit from early product market reforms (Annex II).
International initiatives provide an opportunity to spur structural reform. The
government’s new national reform program aligns priorities for the next three years with the
revised Lisbon Agenda’s objectives. All

The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment of trends in
competitiveness and labor market performance. They, however, stressed that aggregate
indicators do not yet fully capture the effects of the industrial restructuring underway in
recent years, reflected in some recent micro-economic evidence on rising variability in
profitability, which is also in line with the strong growth in nominal exports and rising export
10

As the OEDC estimates, Italy could benefit significantly from implementing the Services Directive— trade in
services could increase by almost 120 percent, and GDP per capita by over 2 percent as a result (see “Going for
Growth”, OECD 2008).

unit values. The BoI also pointed to recent, albeit limited, evidence in the micro data of firm
turnover and an increase in the average firm size as signs of a higher level of competition.
The authorities expected unemployment to rise further, along with slowing, and possibly
negative, employment growth. They also agreed on the main shortcomings of labor market
institutions, namely, a wage bargaining mechanism that leaves too little scope for firm-level
negotiations, and an insufficient social safety net that is uneven across sectors and contract
types.

The government considered their structural reform plans adequate and did not
see scaling up efforts as a top priority at this time. The BoI agreed that the structural
reform momentum had slowed and that it needs to be revived. The MEF and other
interlocutors pointed to the government’s commitment to policy continuity and the progress
achieved to date. The government expressed doubt as to whether reforming the
unemployment system could form part of an immediate crisis response, given the
implementation lags and permanent expenditure involved. In line with this view, the
government has recently opted for supplementing existing instruments, such as the
industry-specific unemployment support schemes (“cassa integrazione”), rather than
overhauling the welfare system. On wage determination, the government pointed to ongoing
tripartite negotiations aimed at increasing the use of firm-level bargaining by linking
nationally bargained wages to projected inflation (excluding imported inputs) and reducing
taxation on supplemental wages negotiated at the firm level.

ANNEX I— THE CHALLENGE OF FIXING FISCAL FRAMEWORKS 1
I. INTRODUCTION
Italy’s fiscal frameworks have improved in recent years. The SGP’s excessive deficit
procedure has been effective in triggering adjustment, while broader EU-led surveillance and
the authorities’ own efforts have contributed to progress in debt and deficit accounting,
central government spending control, the phasing out of one-off measures, and deficit
containment under the domestic stability pact. But shortcomings still hamper the attainment
of key fiscal goals.
The fiscal position falls well short of the MTO (structural balance). Deficits have been
broadly in the 2–4 percent of GDP range, but, unlike in other EU countries, not much lower,
partly owing to discretionary relaxations. This has blunted progress in debt reduction and
underscores the lack of an effective medium-term budget orientation.
Italy has a poor record of hitting its expenditure targets

Adjustment has been largely revenue-based and hence precarious. Tax hikes proved
more effective in delivering “quick” annual adjustment than “across-the-board” spending
cuts, which were ineffective or at best short-lived. Indeed, Italy’s record of meeting nominal
spending plans is weak compared to other large EU countries, especially Germany. Thus,
despite significant periodic expenditure cuts, the spending ratio has risen steadily.
Weak budget institutions hamper effective spending-based adjustment. Italy’s budget
process is fragmented, time-consuming, and legalistic, while lacking transparency and
result-orientation. The bulk of budget spending is mandatory/incremental, and governed by a
plethora of rigid laws. This leaves marginal scope for employee mobility and resource
reallocation, and mid-year spending relaxations often become necessary to avoid arrears. The
multi-year spending projections are optimistic, and do not provide certainty of resources to
managers.

Unsettled intergovernmental rules and remaining data weaknesses hinder broader
public sector efficiency. Without a functioning federalism framework, local governments
have focused on “incremental” bargaining for central transfers. Ex-post, this tended to
generate recurring debts and deficit “surprises,” notably in health care. Similarly, many
public enterprises continue to depend on sizable transfers. Lack of uniform data— on local
government finances and consolidated public enterprise sector—complicates effective fiscal
policy responses.
II.

IMPROVING BUDGET INSTITUTIONS
A. Background

There is a growing desire by, and pressure on, the Italian authorities to improve the
cost effectiveness of public spending. The recognized need to reduce the level of public
debt, alleviate the tax burden, and enhance the productivity of public sector services requires
a budget system that facilitates both the transparent allocation of scarce resources to key
priorities and increased efficiency gains from expenditure programs.
However, the budgetary system has displayed weaknesses that stymie the objectives of
fiscal consolidation and enhanced expenditure effectiveness. An IMF report in 2007
documented some of the main institutional weaknesses:
• An “incrementalist” approach to budget formulation. The bulk of public spending was
extrapolated annually with marginal changes and without a proper re-examination of the
relative value of spending programs and their contribution to government’s priorities;
• An excessively fragmented structure of the voted budget, with some 1,500 line items in
2007 that bore no clear relation to the objectives of public spending;
• The lack of a meaningful medium-term orientation in the budget process, with existing
forward projections not representing true baseline costs for subsequent budgets;
• A budget approval process in Parliament which allows a proliferation of micro-oriented
amendments (about 12,000 presented during the discussion of the 2007 budget);
• Many ex-ante controls on budget execution, constraining budget managers’ flexibility in
using inputs and fostering a focus on legal compliance, rather than on efficiency;
• A relatively weak information base on the cost of different spending programs, and on
their effectiveness in terms of relevant outcomes; and, relatedly,
• Little focus by policy makers on the budget outturn, especially in terms of the results of
public spending programs and their cost; and weak accountability for performance.

42
B. Recent Reforms
Several measures were introduced with the 2008 and the 2009 budgets to address these
shortcomings. To reduce the overall size of the public sector while making the public
administration more effective, successive governments have implemented important changes
to the budget framework, including:
•

Rationalizing the structure of the budget and aligning it with government policy
objectives. A program classification was introduced with 2008 budget and further refined
for the 2009 budget; it now includes 34 high level missions and 168 programs, which
facilitates consideration of the budget according to government objectives. However, the
budget is still voted along more disaggregate line items, or Unita Previsionale di Base
(UPBs), although these have been reduced from 1,500 to around 700. As required by the
1978 accounting law, these UPBs still represent the basic control unit for budget
execution even within the same program (see Figure 1).

•

Strengthening the medium-term orientation of the budget. The 2009–13
medium-term plan, or Documento di Programmazione Economico-Finanziaria (DPEF),
and subsequent legislation established a binding three-year package of measures that were
passed into law. The documents include three-year estimates of the costs of existing
policy, broken down by missions and programs.

43

•

Streamlining the annual budget process and increasing transparency. Key budget
decisions were advanced to June/July (and were anticipated in the DPEF), instead of
December. However, to achieve this, a series of “maneuvers” that typically adjust existing
revenue and expenditure, authorize new budget proposals, and are the main focus of
parliamentary debate in the last months of the year, were passed through the legislature
via a confidence vote in the summer, reducing both the length and depth of discussion.
The DPEF itself is a more detailed and transparent medium-term strategy document that
now explicitly indicates aggregate revenue and expenditure plans.

•

Enhancing managerial flexibility within aggregated programs. The budget
documentation sets spending caps for all missions and programs, and although some
additional flexibility is given to transfer resources within programs, this is still confined
to a small percentage of expenditure, once “exogenously” driven expenditure is excluded.
The basic unit of control remains the UPB. Nonetheless, to meet the aggregate constraints
set out in the medium-term adjustment package, line ministries can, for the first time,
propose to transfer resources from UPBs in policy areas already defined by legislation
(i.e., rigid or mandatory spending) to other priorities.

•

Conducting spending review exercises for selected ministries. A technical committee
established in 2007 undertook a review of cost-effectiveness of public expenditure in five
areas: justice, infrastructure, transport, internal affairs, and education. The review was
structured more along ministry lines than along programs. Although the final results were
reported in mid-2008, both the implementation of the findings and the overall future of
the spending review process is unclear. The technical committee was dissolved at the end
of the pilot phase, but the General Accounting Department (budget office) intends to
continue the exercise and mainstream it into the budget process.

•

Improving the information base on budget execution. Significant efforts in recent
years to implement a computerized system for cash transactions (SIOPE) are starting to
bear fruit. This system, which is based on a standardized codification of all cash
operations across government levels and agencies, allows real-time monitoring of cash
flows. In 2008, the system was rolled out to health and public welfare entities; it now
captures 98 percent of public expenditure. The SIOPE should represent a powerful tool
for tracking spending.
C. Going Forward

Reducing structural rigidities in the budget will help improve cost-effectiveness. Budget
rigidities can reduce economic efficiency by limiting government’s ability to reallocate
spending in response to changing needs and forcing the brunt of any fiscal retrenchment to

44
fall on a subset of budget items. In the Italian context, rigidities come from exogenously
driven expenditure, which can be divided into two broad categories: (i) mandatory charges
(oneri inderogabili) where the government has pre-existing obligations, but the exact amount
is not predetermined, including pensions, the public sector payroll, and interest payments;
and (ii) legislated expenditure (fattori legislativi) where specific activities are encumbered by
existing legislative prescriptions that specify exact spending requirements. Table 1 shows the
implication of these rigidities for a sample program—there is little flexibility for a program
manager to reallocate resources. The authorities should thus focus on a set of reforms that
begin to tackle these rigidities in the budget framework. Three important steps in this regard
are set out below.

•

Overhauling the 1978 budget law to amend the accounting basis and introduce
greater control flexibility. The authorities intend to revise the existing accounting and
budget law (law 468/1978); a source of some of the rigidities. They should take the
opportunity to redefine UPBs and align them with the new program structure. This will
facilitate an eventual move to appropriation and control by programs, once there is
confidence in the program design and costing. Nonetheless, the law should still allow the

45
option of controlling expenditure according to other categories should it be needed, for
example, limiting administrative expenditure. The increased flexibility and reduction of
ex-ante controls for program managers needs to be accompanied by strengthened ex-post
accountability for legal compliance, financial propriety and delivery of results.
•

Rationalizing the body of legislation that encumbers the various spending programs.
Aligning UPBs with programs will not deliver the desired flexibility if expenditure
chapters within these programs continue to be encumbered by other pieces of legislation.
The authorities should select priority programs and revise the underlying legislation in
order to identify opportunities for simplification and rationalization. This will likely
require a continuation of the spending review exercise.

•

Increasing the flexibility in the management of civil servants to facilitate geographic
and functional mobility. Improving the effectiveness of public services and also
reducing expenditure will require additional flexibility in the management of civil
servants. In particular, it is important to move to a framework where line ministries are
responsible for delivering policy objectives within a hard budget constraint that includes
personnel costs. Increased flexibility in this regard is also important for the objectives set
out in the fiscal federalism reforms.

The medium-term orientation of the budget should be enhanced to foster both fiscal
discipline and also policy prioritization. For next year’s DPEF, the fiscal targets should
reflect agreements with subnational governments, effectively bringing forward some of the
Domestic Stability Pact negotiations and increasing the credibility of the commitments.
However, the authorities could consider setting quantified targets for major areas of spending
in the DPEF, or at least making binding the total level of primary spending for the year ahead.
This would enhance the role of line ministries and parliament in establishing key budget
priorities and trade-offs later in the process. The realism of cost estimates for maintaining
existing policy should strengthened by using clearly specified and objectively determined
cost drivers (such as the rate of inflation)—these parameters should be agreed for each policy
during initial policy discussions and updates should be purely technical exercises. Budget
preparation could then focus more transparently on policy changes.
Systematically reviewing expenditure programs for efficiency and effectiveness should
become part of the budget process. The pilot spending review exercise highlighted ample
policy options to feed into a budgetary debate on cost-effectiveness. The authorities should
improve this review process for identifying programs to be eliminated, expanded, initiated, or
redesigned to achieve savings. This will require changing the nature of budgetary
negotiations to include greater consideration of performance and gradually building up the
capacity of the MEF to monitor and evaluate line ministries.

46
The information base should be improved before moving towards full program
budgeting and performance targets. Once there is confidence that the program
classification is reasonably satisfactory, the authorities should work to improve the mapping
of cost objects to programs on a continuous basis, potentially through an enhancement of
existing accounting systems. This reform should precede appropriation by program. In
addition, performance measurement of government programs through the design and
publication of performance indicators should be developed gradually in collaboration with
line ministries before moving to a performance targeting regime; understanding the links
between resources and results will take time. The intent to establish a comprehensive
database covering financial, output and outcome information is a positive step in this regard.

INTER-GOVERNMENTAL FISCAL RELATIONSHIPS
A. Background

Italian fiscal federalism is characterized by a significant reliance on transfers. 2 Vertical
gaps have narrowed over time, but remain large. In the late 1990s regions were assigned new
taxes to replace some of the state transfers, with some flexibility in setting rates, including a
new tax on company value added (IRAP) and a surcharge on the national income tax
(IRPEF). Horizontal inequities between regions are also significant. The South is more
dependent than the North and has a lower margin of flexibility to increase own revenue.
The authorities are undertaking reforms to increase the accountability of sub-national
governments and further align revenue powers with spending responsibilities. After
changes to the Constitution in 2001 that envisioned further devolution of taxation and
spending, there were a number of aborted attempts to advance the reform, and the situation
remains unsettled. Sub-national revenue assignments, on aggregate, cover roughly half of
current expenses, making regional and local government dependent on central transfers
(sub-national governments can also borrow for investment). This in turn reduces the
incentives to raise own revenue and complicates budget stability. The draft law approved by
the Council of Ministers on October 3, 2008, sets out to gradually replace sub-national
dependence on central transfers with own source revenues or a greater share in national taxes.

Italy consists of five special status regions (which are significant beneficiaries of net resource flows regardless
of per capita income); 15 ordinary regions; 109 provinces; and upwards of 8,000 municipalities.

B. Determining Expenditure Needs
Current Situation
Over the last few decades many spending assignments have been devolved to lower
levels of government, in line with the principles of subsidiarity. The central government is
left with exclusive competence in areas such as foreign policy; national security;
macroeconomic policy; income redistribution; tax collection; constitutional matters; and
setting public service standards. Health makes up the bulk of regional spending, with some
capital transfers for economic development. Lower levels of government are responsible for
road maintenance; school construction; environment; waste and sewage; some health
services; management of employment services; and subsidies. Some areas, such as energy
distribution are shared between levels. Costs (and thus transfers) are determined based on
historical spending.
The Constitutional Court has tried to resolve conflicts in areas of duplication, but some
conflicts remain. The court ruled that in areas of overlapping competency the central
government should legislate fundamental principles, while the regions undertake financing
and administrative functions. Nonetheless, anomalies remain and despite the stipulations of
the Constitution, education continues to be financed and provided by the center. Rigid central
wage setting has limited the ability of lower levels to manage the cost of devolution.
Reform Proposals
The major change envisaged on spending is to move away from costing sub-national
public services based on historical costs in favor of benchmark, or standard, costs. The
reform would apply mainly to regional spending in areas where the central government has
responsibility for setting national service standards, Livelli Essenziali di Assistenza (LEA),
such as health, education, and social assistance. Similarly, standard costs will be developed

48
for delivery of local transport services across the country. For local governments
(municipalities and provinces) spending on fundamental functions 3 will be determined on a
per capita basis, estimated using historical trends, and adjusted for demographic, geographic,
social and economic features. A transition time of up to five years is envisaged.
International Experience
Systems of benchmarking, or formula funding, to enable local agencies to deliver
‘standard’ packages of services are increasingly widespread (Smith, 2007). The standard
is often interpreted as the national average level of services, given a locality’s social,
economic and geographical circumstances. The standard can be defined in terms of
expenditure levels, service levels or outcomes. The aim of the benchmark is to determine the
local agency’s ‘spending need’. One of the best known systems is diagnosis-related groups
(DRGs) in health, now used in Regional Health Enterprises in Italy. Benchmarks are typically
adjusted to reflect differences in service complexity.
Moving Forward
The move towards standard costs is welcome, but a balance needs to be attained
between a simple and complex, micro-analytical and data intensive approaches. A
simple approach, for example based on a high-performing region, runs the risk of being
rejected as unrepresentative, while an overly complex system may need to be continuously
redefined. 4 Two broad categories of formula funding mechanism can be identified: case
payments based on actual output, which generally give local agencies the incentive to
increase output and efficiency; and capitation methods based on estimates of output that
emphasize the ‘fair funding’ principle of giving the local agency the means to deliver some
standard of service, with few incentives to secure the desired results. The former are more
aligned with performance budgeting, but the latter are less demanding of administrative data
and audit requirements. Some combination of the two mechanisms may be appropriate. The
system will also need to define what happens in the eventuality of the state redefining or
updating the LEA, as the funding of the spending assignments in this category is guaranteed.
Should high costs materialize, bolder offsetting reforms could be considered, including
streamlining the structure of subnational governments. To set the context for this
exercise, the authorities should review public service “delivery chains”—the role of various
levels of government in expenditure areas, from policy formulation, through defining

“Fundamental functions” have not yet been defined.

and, articles by Mapelli (2008) and Muraro (2008) for a discussion of issues in determining standard costs.

49
standards, to service delivery. Where possible, duplication of spending competencies and
civil service posts should be rationalized, and mechanisms to enhance coordination and
information sharing should be established.
C. Revenue Assignments
Current Situation
Sub-national revenue assignments cover about half of current expenses. There are few
genuinely autonomous sub-national taxes; most are shared taxes, which for ordinary regions
count as transfers, surcharges on national taxes, or have the base controlled by the center.
Tax autonomy has been generally increasing over time. The main locally based tax for
regions is the IRAP (see table 2), which appears to be a relatively efficient tax with a low
standard rate and a wide base. The local property tax (ICI) was the main own revenue source
for municipal level government, but was abolished in May 2008 for primary residences. The
center has also interfered with the bases of other sub-national taxes.
Reform Proposals
Regions are to have sufficient own revenue resources and sharing in national taxes to
cover assigned tasks. Decentralized entities will have three main revenue sources: (i) own
taxes, i.e. instituted with local legislation; (ii) derived taxes i.e. instituted by national
legislation, but with some local discretion to set rates and relief; and (iii) national tax sharing
arrangements for IRPEF and national VAT (IVA). For regions, these taxes will gradually
replace the IRAP, which covers most health expenditure.
Tax sharing will be based on the principle of “territoriality” 5 and could lead to large
pro-capita variations in resources across regions. However, the main base intended for
sharing among the regions is the national VAT, which due to its more even distribution
across regions will require smaller transfers to equalize revenue capacity than other bases. A
disadvantage of relying heavily on the VAT is the low ownership of the tax given the center’s
role in setting the base and rate.

5

Taken to mean revenue will be attributed to the locality where the tax base is e.g. the destination principle for
consumption taxes.

Whether sub-national governments will have enough flexibility to guarantee autonomy
in expenditure choices remains unclear. The ability to institute new own taxes is
constrained by a provision forbidding taxation of the same base by different levels of
government. Moreover, the existing flexibility to vary rates (e.g. on the IRAP) has not been
utilized, except as a centrally imposed sanction for cost overruns and for industrial policy.
The law also seeks to eliminate interference with tax bases that belong to other levels of
government, although the recent decision to eliminate the local property tax on primary
residences goes against that intent.
Tax assignments will be calculated according to the nature of the expenditure they will
finance, but will not be earmarked. For example, mandatory regional spending, i.e., where
the center sets basic standards (LEA), is to be covered by own revenue sources (calculated at
uniform rates), national tax sharing arrangements for IRPEF and national VAT (IVA). An
equalization fund will ensure that all regions can finance services at the required standard
(see below). Other regional expenditure will be covered by surcharges on the IRPEF.
International Experience
There is broad agreement in the literature that a degree of tax autonomy is warranted
for an effective decentralized system (Ambrosanio and Bordignon, 2006). A variety of
reasons are put forward for tax autonomy: (i) to be able to cater to local preferences; (ii) to
foster yardstick competition whereby citizens distinguish good and bad policy choices; and
(iii) to harden budget constraints and instill discipline, as sub-national governments have
greater flexibility at the margin to deal with expenditure increases. Tax autonomy varies
across countries; Italy is slightly below average, both in terms of percentage of taxes
allocated to lower levels of government and the discretion to set rates and relief (Figure 3).

The properties of different taxes and tax bases can make them more, or less, apt for
different levels of government. National governments often retain taxes with strong cyclical
components, such as personal and corporate income taxes. Central governments also
frequently retain control of the base and rates for VAT to avoid the complexity and
inefficiencies that might arise from sub-national discretion over these taxes. Nonetheless, an
advantage of allocating consumption taxes to sub-national government (often through tax
sharing arrangements) is that the base is more evenly distributed than income taxes.
Sub-national tax assignments should: (i) allow taxpayers to see the benefit of contributing
i.e., be linked to service provision; (ii) not distort resource allocation; (iii) not exacerbate
vertical and horizontal imbalances; and (iv) should be easily administered and enforced.
Whether mobility of the base is an important consideration depends on whether one values a
degree of horizontal tax competition to keep governments efficient. Property taxes are one of
the best sources of local revenue. Surcharges for sub-national governments on personal
income tax have the advantage of being simple and transparent, but are subject to horizontal
inequity. Tax sharing arrangements are common, but give no marginal autonomy. Excise
taxes are well suited to sub-national government, if applied according to a destination
principle.
Moving Forward
Local entities need enough revenue flexibility at the margin to increase the level/quality
of public service provision and/or be responsible for any cost overruns. With the gradual
elimination of the IRAP, which represents over 50 percent of regional tax revenue, an
alternative tax controlled by the region needs to be identified. The flexibility of sub-national
government to vary surcharges rates for IRPEF will need to be increased accompanied, as
envisaged, by a reduction in the central rate.

52
The reform is an opportunity to undertake a comprehensive review of property
taxation. The abolition of the ICI on primary residences should be reconsidered, or
accompanied by alternative sources of property taxation, as this tax fulfils the desirable
criteria for sub-national revenue and represents an important local tax in many countries.
D. Equalization Scheme
Current Situation
Most grants are untied and are considered mandatory from a central government
budgeting viewpoint. Equalization grants to cover vertical fiscal imbalances go from the
center to both regional and local governments; there are additional grants from regional
governments to local authorities within their jurisdiction. Expenditure for special programs,
such as regional projects, is financed by EU grants and national cofinancing arrangements.
However, the overall result of the equalization system is a soft budget constraint on
sub-national governments. These transfers are fixed ex-ante when the budgets for all levels
of government are determined; these are largely based on the previous year’s spending. The
equalization is calculated largely in terms of spending levels; own revenue is deducted from
permissible spending to determine the transfer level, with the attendant disincentives for local
tax efforts. Moreover, at the end of year grants can be “topped up” to cover unforeseen
deficits. This is especially true for health and transport expenditure. The rules for these late
adjustments are not clear and appear to be influenced by relative bargaining power.
Reform Proposals
The proposal is to move from a system of equalization based on spending, towards
equalization based on revenue capacities and expenditure needs. Expenditure estimates
based on historical spending are to be phased out in favor of standard costs for certain
mandated functions. Ordinary grants are to be replaced by tax revenues, leaving only
equalization grants and special purpose grants for central (and EU) policy objectives.
Regional equalization transfers are to be calibrated according to category of devolved
expenditure:
1. For LEA mandated expenditure, a vertical equalization fund will financed by
sharing the VAT base. In the first round, a share of VAT collected in each region will be
calculated at a rate that is sufficient to fully cover LEA functions (estimated according
standard costs) in at least one region, after subtracting the region’s share in IRPEF and own

53
revenues. 6 In a second round, an additional share of VAT is calculated at a rate that is
sufficient to fully cover LEA expenditure in all other regions, after subtracting their share in
the IRPEF, own revenues, and VAT shares based on the first round calculations.
2. For non-LEA expenditure, a horizontal equalization fund will financed by
surcharges on the IRPEF. Transfers will be determined by equalizing only revenue
capacity against a standard calculated using an average IRPEF surcharge rate. Regions that
have above (below) average IRPEF per capita contribute (draw from) the fund.
In a break with the past, regions will have greater responsibility for managing the
equalization funds for the provinces and municipalities under their jurisdiction. Equalization
needs will be calculated as the difference between some standard cost per capita for recurrent
expenses and a standard value for own revenue sources and national tax shares.
International Experience
Italy’s overall dependence on transfers is not unusual in OECD context (Figure 4).
Grants reflect a variety of objectives from a reduction of vertical and horizontal fiscal
imbalances, through implementation of national standards in public services, to fostering
national priorities and enhancing local expenditure efficiency.

The academic literature points to the reduction of transfer dependence as a way to
reduce free riding and moral hazard, and instill better budget discipline. Studies have
shown that excessive grant dependence is associated with weaker budget discipline at the
sub-national level e.g. Germany (Rodden, 2006) and also weaker economic performance e.g.,
Austria (Blochlieger, 2007). Equalization schemes have to be carefully designed to avoid
disincentives to develop local revenues and incentives to inflate expenditure needs.
Equalization based on both revenue capacities and also expenditure needs addresses the
abstraction from differential costs of services associated with a revenue only approach and
also the incentive problems and possible inefficiencies associated with an expenditure needs
only approach (Ahmad and Searle, 2006).
Moving Forward
The equalization fund for national standards of public service provision should be
based on transparent formulae and rules that can be easily monitored. Discretionary
choices by recipient levels to increase service levels should be financed by own resources.
The current system of ex-post bargaining should be eliminated and hard budget constraints
imposed. In addition, the government should consider setting the equalization at below 100
percent for non-LEA functions to incentivize own revenue effort.
This will require that the equalization scheme be treated as a “closed loop”; the inflows
to the equalization fund (e.g. VAT share) should be fixed ex-ante in the budget cycle,
preferably for three years in the DPEF, in order to reduce the discretionary influence of the
center, harden the budget constraint and more closely mirror a horizontal equalization
scheme. This share could be reviewed every three years or so and would be less prone to
expenditure drift. 7 This arrangement would be equivalent to imposing a balanced operating
budget requirement, after equalization grants, on all sub-nationals in the DSP.
The equalization scheme should be implemented and enforced by an autonomous
agency free from bargaining. Transparent formulae and independent monitoring will
increase transparency and reduce discretionality. The formulation of the Permanent
Conference on Public Finance 8 to determine the mechanics, and monitor the operation, of the
equalization scheme will be a positive step if it is allowed to operate based on pre-established
rules and not political bargaining. This agency should meet at the start of the budget cycle.

Or the share for the outer year in the medium-term projection could be revised annually.
The Conference will be composed of representatives from all levels of government.

55
E. Fiscal Discipline and Stability
Current Situation
The main vehicle for imposing fiscal discipline on lower levels of government is the
Domestic Stability Pact (DSP). The aim of the DSP was to set a fiscal path for all levels of
government that was consistent with the commitments made in the Stability and Growth pact
(SGP). The DSP contains a set of fiscal targets, a monitoring mechanism and a system of
sanctions. The DSP is set within the context of the annual budget law, after consultation with
the lower levels. A pact for health spending is separately negotiated.
However, the DSP has shown certain weaknesses. Shortcomings include a lack of
consistency with the SGP targets, periodic amendments to the rules and targets, varying
coverage and sensitivity to cyclical conditions (Fedelino, 2005). Although compliance with
the DSP has improved in recent years, the health sector is particularly problematic as it is
outside the coverage of the DSP and subject to significant cost overruns.
Reform Proposals
The current proposals for fiscal federalism are geared towards engendering greater
responsibility for fiscal outcomes to lower levels of government. The exact mechanism for
enforcing discipline within the new federal framework has not been defined. However, the
proposals on fiscal federalism should be considered alongside the recent move to establish
binding three-year adjustment packages consistent with longer-term fiscal objectives and that
were anticipated as part of the 2009−13 DPEF. Sharing the deficit target across levels of
government is easier if accounting practices are harmonized, as the authorities are planning to
do.
International Experience
Evidence of the impact of fiscal federalism on overall budget discipline and
macro-stability is inconclusive. Some studies find that federal institutional arrangements are
associated with an increased tendency toward macroeconomic fragility, volatility and crises
(e.g. Wibbels, 2000). Others find that the dangers of fiscal decentralization for fiscal
stabilization have been exaggerated, at least for OECD countries (Thornton and Mati, 2007),
or that sub-national tiers play a positive role in fiscal consolidation cycles (Darby, Muscatelli
and Roy, 2005).
Different countries have availed themselves of a range of instruments to limit the risks
to fiscal discipline. These can divided into four broad categories: administrative controls;
centrally-imposed rules; formalized cooperation; and market discipline. Pure market
approaches have the benefit of freeing the center from the complication of monitoring local

56
authorities, but are effective only if the central government can commit not to bail out
sub-national governments. The US and Canada earned this credibility by resisting pressure to
provide loans to states in financial trouble in the 1830s and 1840s (Spilimbergo, 2005 ).
Moving Forward
Italy should endeavor to ensure that the federalism reforms are budget neutral at a
general government level. As Italy moves towards additional revenue autonomy for
sub-national governments, the consequent changes to the rates/shares that regions can
command from VAT and income tax need to be reflected in an offset at the central level, if
the tax burden is not to rise. This will also send an important signal of the center’s
commitment to fiscal stability.
The DSP should be revised to have comprehensive coverage and also provide stable,
and credible, fiscal objectives for all levels of government. These should ideally target a
zero operating budget balance after equalization grants, according to a harmonized definition,
that are fully consistent with the multi-year adjustments set out in the DPEF. For next year’s
DPEF, the fiscal targets should reflect agreements with subnational governments, effectively
bringing forward some of the DSP negotiations.
A credible system of sanctions should be established for budget indiscipline, perhaps
combined with a no-bailout clause for local government (although the center will need to
earn its credibility). Enforcement mechanisms should be transparent and non-discretionary,
with enforcement responsibilities delegated, whenever possible, to autonomous agencies and
courts.
F. Complementary Reforms
Fiscal federal arrangements will depend on complementary reforms in other areas.
• Budget processes and systems need to be harmonized across levels of government.
The review of “delivery chains” should be integrated with the spending review exercise
undertaken as part of the budget system reform. Shared or overlapping services should be
examined to reduce, where possible, duplication of spending competencies and civil service
posts. Likewise, the budget policies and spending reforms envisaged at the central level to
improve efficiency need to be cascaded down to, and coordinated with, local levels if
spending is to become more effective.
• Reducing overlaps in expenditure competencies will rely, in many instances, on
increased flexibility in the public labor market. Establishing sound benchmark costs, and
the related equalization scheme, will require high-quality data. Data should be comparable
across regions and units of government, and which is frequently updated. Some of this data

57
could be sourced to an independent authority, but much will also depend on a modern and
consistent accounting system across different levels of government. The refinement of
program classification at the center of government will need to be coordinated with other
levels. Ensuring high-quality data should precede the other reforms that establish expenditure
and revenue quantities.

ANNEX II—REFORMING ITALY’S LABOR MARKET 1
I. INTRODUCTION
The Italian labor market has improved markedly over the past decade, but important
challenges remain. The social safety net while high for some worker groups, is virtually
nonexistent for others; the extent of employment protection varies substantially across worker
groups; and the aggregate wage distribution is too compressed. As one of the consequences, a
rising share of workers faces high employment risk but little income insurance. The existing
wage bargaining system exacerbates these disparities: nationally bargained wages are less
binding in the North, but too high for South, and the lack of a sufficient social safety net,
particularly for those in the South, prevents sufficient spatial mobility to more quickly reduce
regional disparities.
This annex provides an overview of the institutional landscape of Italy’s labor market
and recent labor market outcomes from a cross-country perspective. It argues that
addressing Italy’s labor market underperformance requires a comprehensive view of the labor
market, recognizing the importance of avoiding further partial measures that exacerbate
existing inequities, and also recognizing that product and labor markets interact in important
ways. While not all shortcomings of the labor market can be addressed simultaneously,
empirical evidence points to the need for careful sequencing, and combination, of selected
reforms. Simulations suggests that proper design can also reduce the (fiscal) costs of reform.
II. BACKGROUND
Starting in the mid-1990s, both labor force participation and employment increased
substantially, and with cumulative employment growth almost twice the increase in the
labor force, the unemployment rate declined sharply, to 6.1 in 2007, just over half the rate in
1995 (Figure 1, left panel). Reform efforts, such as the 1997 Treu measures and the 2003
Biagi reforms, contributed to the growth in aggregate employment, but their focus on reform
“at the margin” also led to an increasing dualism of the labor market.
Much of the employment gains since 1995 were in temporary and part-time
employment. Between 1995 and 2007, the share of temporary employment increased from
7.2 percent to 12.4 percent, and the share of part-time employment from 10.5 percent to over
15 percent (Figure 1, right panel). In absolute terms, the number of workers in temporary

work arrangements more than doubled during that time, while permanent employment
increased by only 7 percent. While less dramatic, a similar gap was observed for part-time
employment, which increased by 65 percent during the time period, compared to 9 percent
cumulative growth in full-time employment. The jump in part-time employment in 2004 had
the positive side-effect of benefiting female employment, which increased by over one
percentage point that year (as a share of total employment).
In spite of recent improvements, important weaknesses remain in the Italian labor
market. Employment growth exhibits signs of a slowdown, and the level of employment, as
a share of the working-age population, is still substantially smaller than in most other
European countries. Hours worked are at about the EU average and thus do not compensate
for Italy’s low employment share. And while the increased use in temporary and part-time
employment, also now roughly at the EU average, has provided increased flexibility, it may
also have displaced growth in permanent employment and contributed to stalling productivity
growth. In spite of recent employment growth, unemployed workers still take a long time to
find work—nearly 50 percent of the unemployed have been out of work for more than one
year, substantially above the EU average. Stagnant labor productivity and continued earnings
growth have led to a substantial increase in unit labor costs.
III. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
Assessing the possible sources of Italy’s labor market performance requires a nuanced
and comprehensive view. Simple consideration of OECD labor market indicators presents a
puzzle. Along many dimensions of the regulatory framework, Italy ranks broadly mid-field,

and on some dimensions Italy actually appears less regulated than the EU average. Yet, labor
market outcomes are among the worst in the EU. 2 To gain a better understanding of this
apparent disconnect between labor market policies and outcomes, it is necessary to
(1) consider the interactions of different labor market regulations, rather than considering
specific margins in isolation, and (2) also take into account spillover-effects between
regulations in the labor market and those in others, especially product markets.
Low productivity is the main source of high, and rising, unit labor costs. Average wage
growth has been relatively moderate in Italy: for example, manufacturing earnings grew over
the past decade at an average annual rate of 2.6 percent, below the average rate of over
3.2 percent in other EU15 countries. The tax wedge, i.e., the combined tax burden of
employer and employee deductions relative to total labor cost, is also not out of line: for
example, Italy’s tax wedge for married individual with two children and average income, is
33.7 percent, below the EU average of 34.2 percent. Thus, comparatively high labor costs are
in large part due to low productivity.

1/ 2000=100 (left panel); cross-country data are average annual growth rates during 1995-2006.

Productivity is held down by asymmetries in labor institutions and their inability to
reflect regional differences. Among the key hindrances of an efficient labor utilization and
allocation are a rigid wage bargaining mechanism; inefficiencies and inequities in the
unemployment insurance (UI) system; and asymmetric employment protection regulations
(EPL). More specifically:

2

De jure indicators may not capture the full extent of the regulations’ de facto impact. For example, based on
survey data, the World Economic Forum's recent competitiveness report ranks Italy 49th among 134 countries
and near the bottom on most labor-market related indicators.

63
•

Collective wage bargaining—About 60 percent of workers are covered Italy’s
collective bargaining agreements (Box 1), high by European comparison, and the
effective coverage is even higher. However, the nature of the two-tier system leaves
little scope for many firms, specifically for small enterprises and many in the South, to
engage in firm-level negotiations. As a result, a predominance of nationally negotiated
wages over those at the firm level exacerbate regional differences in economic
development.

•

Unemployment insurance—The Italian UI system is complex, and uneven. While
ordinary UI benefits are initially relatively high, with a net replacement rate of
60 percent, they drop to zero after 8 months (12 months for workers aged over 50), and
complex eligibility rules imply that only few unemployed individuals actually receive
such UI benefits (Demekas, 1995). 3 By contrast, wage supplementation funds (cassa
integrazione guadagni, or CIG) can be substantially more generous, both in terms of
level and duration, but are limited to workers on certain contracts and those from
participating firms (mostly large firms in the North). The lack of a sufficient social
safety net inhibits an efficient worker reallocation, both regionally and in terms of skill
mismatches.

•

Employment protection–Past reforms have substantially reduced restrictions on fixed
term and part-time employment arrangements, from among the highest in Europe in the
mid-1980s to about the EU15 average in 2003, but have left restrictions on regular
employment unchanged (see Figure 4). Although permanent EPL appear comparatively
low according to the OECD indicators, market participants and academics alike
recognize permanent employment as substantially protected. 4 The asymmetric
deregulation has tilted incentives for job creation toward “atypical” contracts, resulting
in increased employment risk for an increasing fraction of the labor force (and
particularly those with the least access to social insurance) and contributing to
worsening productivity trends. 5

3

In 2005, 2.3 percent of the labor force received UI benefits, about a third the rate in other EU countries.
Reasons include that receipt of UI benefits in Italy includes an income-test of family members (see de Neubourg
et al., 2007); it also has minimum requirements regarding work and contribution histories.

4

For example, Art. 18 in Law 300/1970 (statuto dei lavoratori) protects workers against dismissal without
(narrowly defined) just cause, making it difficult for firms to lay off individual workers without risking
substantial penalties; protection against collective dismissals is among the highest in OECD countries; and the
survey data cited in footnote 2 illustrates the high perceived rigidity of Italy’s labor market.
5

The asymmetric liberalization of temporary EPL, and the increased use of temporary contracts, is likely to
have impacted productivity, among other things, because their time-limited nature reduces incentives for human
capital investments and temporary employment creation tends to be in low-skill areas. Also, the still high
protection of permanent contracts maintained the difficulty of laying off non-productive workers on permanent
contracts. The overall result has been a bias towards less-productive employment. However, from a pure
accounting perspective, the entry of low-skilled workers is likely to have contributed to the decline in measured
productivity, thus overstating the actual loss of competitiveness (see Codogno, 2008).

64
Box 1. Key Reforms of the Italian Labor Market
Over the past two decades, Italy’s labor market has undergone substantial reform. Adverse
macroeconomic conditions, including an unemployment rate that exceeded 12 percent during the
late 1980s, and Italy’s envisaged entry into the EMU in 1999, resulted in several reform measures
(patti sociali) starting in the early 1990s. Key among them were the social pact of 1993 which
included the incomes policy arrangement and which laid down the foundations of the industrial
relations and collective bargaining framework currently still in practice; and the Treu measures in
1997 and Biagi reforms in 2003, both aimed at improving labor market flexibility.
The collective bargaining structure laid out in the 1993 social pact postulates a two-tier bargaining
structure: (1) collective bargaining at the national (sectoral) level, to determine the terms and
conditions of employment (renegotiated every four years) and basic wage guarantees (minimi
tabellari, renegotiated every two years); and (2) bargaining at the second (regional or firm) level,
allowing the bargaining partners to supplement national contracts (valid for four years).
Second-level bargaining is optional, and, importantly, wages can not be reduced below those
negotiated in the minimi tabellari. Thus, although second-level bargaining in principle provides
flexibility for better wage-productivity links, the wage floor imposed by the minimi tabellari
limits the use of second-level bargaining. 6
While the 1993 social pact provided a broad bargaining framework between the social partners,
the Treu measures in 1997 (Law 197/1997), named after then-Labor Minister Tiziano Treu, were
the first legislative measures aimed specifically at increasing the employment rate, particularly in
the South, and overall labor market flexibility. The Treu law aimed at increased flexibility via
labor market reform “at the margin,” mainly by introducing temporary contracts and providing
incentives for part-time work. Another law in the same year (Law 469/1993) on the privatization
and decentralization of job centers abolished the principle of a public monopoly on employment
services. Efforts to increase labor market flexibility were taken forward with the 2003 Biagi
reform (Law 30/2003), named after the late Marco Biagi, advisor on labor market reform under
the 2001−2006 Berlusconi government. This reform further deregulated the use of atypical work
arrangements, such as temporary agency work (staff-leasing) and part-time work, and introduced
new forms of atypical work arrangements such as on-call jobs (lavoro intermittente), job sharing
and occasional work (lavoro a progetto).

6

Although Italy does not have a statutory minimum wage, collectively agreed wages impose a de facto wage
floor even for workers not covered by collective bargaining—the Italian constitution contains a clause on the
right to fair wages (sec. 36), and in determining the level of the fair wage, Italian labor courts have consistently
taken the minimi tabellari as guiding parameters.

IV. LESSONS AND DIRECTIONS FOR REFORM
The details of Italy’s labor market institutions are important. Among the key lessons
from the overview of Italy’s labor market institutions is that the problems are not excessive
average wage growth, but a bargaining system that provides insufficient differentiation,
leading to wage outcomes that are too restrictive for some subsets of the economy; they are
not an excessively generous UI system (as, arguably, in some other European countries), but
one that is too low on average, and too uneven, missing those worker groups that most need
it; and while employment protection is too high overall, it is specifically its asymmetry that
causes additional distortions.

66
Important lessons from the experiences of successful reformers can be adapted to the
Italian case. Several lessons stand out :
•

A labor market reform agenda should address inefficiencies in product markets.
Successful reformers have typically also deregulated product markets, in line with a
broad academic literature (Box 2). Given that Italy’s product market is among the most
regulated in Europe, this lesson is of particular importance. Moreover, product market
deregulation is typically less costly (fiscally), and more competitive product markets
can also pave facilitate subsequent labor market reform. Thus, product market
deregulation should be a top priority in Italy.

•

Reforms should not be piecemeal. Labor market reforms should be implemented in
packages that avoid unintended consequences. Italy’s reform history itself provides
numerous examples of piecemeal reforms, such as the asymmetric liberalization of
temporary employment, partial tax reductions, and expansion of the CIG scheme. 7
More specifically:
a. An extended use of second-level bargaining is crucial to obtain a more flexible and
differentiated wage structure. 8 Reductions in labor taxes may be necessary to
provide additional flexibility, but these should be broad-based, rather than partial,
and should be implemented only with commitments of unions to moderate wage
demands at the national level so as to broaden the scope for wage supplements at
the firm-level, while ensuring that tax cuts benefit both workers and firms.
b. A further EPL reduction, and equalization across employment types, should be
combined with a reform of the UI system, including a broadening of coverage and
lengthening of duration. 9 That is, increased employment risk should be buffered by
improved income insurance. 10

7

Recent measures to reduce taxes at the margin, such as the reduction of taxation on overtime/bonus pay, affect
average costs of employment (and thus job creation) only marginally, disproportionately benefit those in
permanent employment, and have the potential to result in substantial fiscal costs. Italy’s government has also
recently committed additional funds to the CIG scheme, thus further exacerbating existing inequities in the
social safety net (see also Boeri and Garibaldi, 2008).

8

Increased wage flexibility would allow firms to adjust to idiosyncratic economic conditions, and could also
help mitigate Italy’s regional discrepancies, especially given relatively limited internal migration.

9

See also Boeri and Garibaldi’s (2008) policy proposal which underscores the need for a universal, and unified,
UI system. In terms of financing, their proposal notes that such UI reform should have an “experience-rating”
component, whereby firms with higher worker turnover would pay higher taxes.

10

Although UI can create disincentive effects by raising reservation wages, Acemoglu and Shimer (2000) note
that (moderate) UI may also increase labor productivity by encouraging workers to seek more productive jobs
(and firms to create them). With incomplete insurance markets, social insurance can also raise economic
welfare, although Rogerson and Schindler (2002) caution that the details of such insurance are crucial.

67
Box 2. Product Market Regulations and the Labor Market

Product market regulations 11 have been found to be negatively correlated with employment (see,
e.g., Boeri et al., 2000, and Figure 5). A possible channel for this relationship is that in a
monopolistic market structure, firms set prices at a markup over marginal cost, thus reducing the
equilibrium quantity of output. Increased competition then tends to result in a lower equilibrium
price, higher output and, all else equal, higher employment.
The effects of product market deregulation on labor market outcomes depend, among other
things, on the size of labor market distortions. More specifically, in labor markets with strong
unions, wages are elevated over the marginal product of labor because unions extract a share of
the (monopolistic) firms’ rents. Because product market deregulations reduces firms’ rents, it also
reduces workers’ wage premium, and so the scope for employment effects of product market
deregulation is larger in labor markets where unions are strong. The empirical evidence is broadly
consistent with these predictions (see Fiori et al., 2007).
Although product market deregulation may, as a consequence, reduce union power and nominal
wage gains, Blanchard and Giavazzi (2003) argue that higher aggregate employment and real
wages, due to more competition and thus lower prices, will benefit the average worker. In
addition, reduced union power may also facilitate future labor market reform. Fiori et al. (2007)
provide empirical support for the model’s key predictions. The theoretical and empirical results
suggest that in the presence of both rigid product and labor markets, reforming the product market
first may likely have a large payoff and could also facilitate subsequent labor market reform. 12
Lastly, while the average worker will benefit from deregulation, some worker groups may not. As
Blanchard and Giavazzi (2003) point out, political economy considerations may call for
combining reforms in ways that help compensate some losers from reform—these considerations
are consistent with the experiences of successful labor market reformers (Annett, 2007) and they
also inform the directions for Italian reform outlined in this annex.

Appropriate design, and sequencing, of reforms can mitigate fiscal constraints. Labor
market reforms can be costly in the short run, while positive employment effects may only be
felt in the medium term. Sequencing reforms appropriately by initiating product market

11

Following the OECD, product market regulations are those that “reduce the intensity of competition in […]
the product market” (Conway et al., 2005, p. 3). These regulations can, however, take many shapes; the OECD’s
database on product market regulations contains measures ranging from the administrative burden on startups to
the size of the public enterprise sector to regulatory and administrative opacity.
12

However, the debate on the optimal product-labor market sequencing is ongoing; For example, Berger and
Danninger (2006) find that simultaneous deregulation may have the largest employment impact.

68
reforms first can provide substantial employment gains at little to no cost (Box 2). 13 But even
within the set of possible labor market reforms, careful design can reduce the costliness of
such measures.
Model-based simulations suggest that different reform combinations can have
significantly diverging medium-term outcomes. For example, simulations by the author
based on a labor market matching model (similar to that in Mortensen and Pissarides, 1994)
suggest that while cuts in labor taxation unambiguously raise employment, they are generally
not self-financing and can result in substantial medium-term fiscal costs unless combined
with other measures, such as reduced wage demands. Translated to the case of Italy, where
fiscal constraints are especially relevant, this means that while broad-based reductions in
labor costs are important for improving labor market outcomes, such measures are likely to
be costly from a fiscal perspective unless combined with a more flexible wage bargaining
structure than is currently in place.

13

Based on case studies for Denmark, the Netherlands, Ireland and the UK, Annett (2007) finds that
employment gains associated with labor market reform were greater in the presence of liberalized product
markets, consistent with the sequencing results summarized in Box 2.

ANNEX III— ITALY’S BANK CRISIS-MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK 1
The system of crisis management and prevention rests on three pillars: the crisis procedures
framework, the deposit insurance scheme, and the liquidity and lender of last resort facilities.
All three functions are either executed or controlled by the BoI, eliminating coordination and
information-sharing inefficiencies. The BoI’s track record in terms of efficiency and speed of
reaction to individual bank failures is good, with no loss of deposits and bank runs recorded
at least since the inception of the deposit insurance scheme in 1987.
Bank Resolution Procedures
The legal framework (The Banking Law of 1993) for the liquidation or restructuring of single
credit institutions is well-defined, with the BoI playing a key role in it. The law gives the BoI
powers to activate a broad range of measures graduated according to the seriousness of the
situation in a problem bank. The most recent Government Decree Law 155 of October 9,
2008, further amended the bank resolution framework to include the case of a "severe crisis"
with potential systemic effects (including liquidity) as a trigger for the initiation of the special
administration, even when serious losses or violations are not ascertained. Capital injections
by the state would apply in this case as well, with the BoI in charge of deciding. 2
All measures can be broadly divided into two groups: crisis-prevention and crisis-resolution.
Preventive measures are not formally included in the prompt corrective-action framework,
and the choice of the course of action is at sole discretion of the BoI.
•

Preventive measures include letters (leaving it up to the bank to develop specific
measures), circulars, regulatory actions (measures imposed by the BoI), and
administrative sanctions (in the event of non-compliance).

•

Resolution measures include placing the bank into special administration (BoI-led
rehabilitation) or compulsory administrative liquidation (BoI-led bankruptcy
procedure). Both measures apply to banking groups as well, with an umbrella
principle—if the parent is in trouble, the parent may be placed under special
administration and, if necessary to manage the crisis of the group, all distressed
member companies may be placed under the same special regime.

The BoI has the powers to fine the bank managers. The grounds for intervention are
extensive.

the continued flow of credit to firms and consumers in the current state of crisis in world financial markets.”

71

Crisis-prevention
Regular inspections
When necessary, the BoI convenes the bank’s governing bodies
to examine the situation and suggest measures.
Then, the BoI sends a letter to the bank’s governing body
indicating the problem and proposed remedial measures (e.g.,
increase profitability).
The BoI can order a bank’s board to be convened and propose
adoption of actions.
The BoI may impose more stringent regulatory requirements on
a bank (as regards capital adequacy, risk limitation, eligible
equity holding, internal organization, control mechanisms, etc.)
Or
If the bank violates supervisory rules, the BoI can impose
pecuniary administrative sanctions on the board members or
responsible employees.

The troubled bank is required to
develop an action program with an
implementation timetable.

The bank must comply with the
requirements within a certain time
period.

If there are violations of regulatory requirements or management
irregularities, the BoI can prohibit a bank from engaging in new
activities or order to close the branches.
Crisis-resolution
In more serious cases, crisis procedures can be initiated. The BoI can submit the proposal to the
Ministry of Economy to place the bank under “special administration” (SA)—a procedure for bank
rehabilitation.
The BoI appoints special administrators and an oversight committee who replace the management and
auditors, take over running the bank, and exercise all functions of administration and control. The aim
is to evaluate the situation and find corrective measures.
In an emergency, the BoI can arrange directly for special administrators to take over the provisional
management for up to two months.
If self-rehabilitation is not deemed possible there is market resolution (bank is taken over by other
institutions). If violations are especially serious or the crisis is not reversible for exceptionally serious
capital losses, there is compulsory administrative liquidation (CAL), a procedure equivalent to the
bankruptcy of a commercial enterprise.
If CAL is proposed, the BoI (Supervision Department) prepares the measures necessary to liquidate,
including procedures to take the bank out of the national and international payment system, monetary
system, and the payout of deposit insurance. The BoI coordinates with the deposit insurance schemes.
After the Minister approves the proposal, the BoI appoints a special body to liquidate the bank. The
payout of deposit insurance almost never occurred, as the way out is generally a transfer of assets and
liabilities to another bank, preserving the continuity of business and the protection of all creditors.
Neither SA or CAL prevents the BoI from imposing penalties on a bank’s governing bodies.
As of October 9 The scope for application of the procedures for special administration and
provisional management of banks (Article 70 ff. of the Consolidated Law on Banking) is extended
to cases of severe crisis, including liquidity crisis, that could jeopardize the stability of the financial
system.

72
Deposit Insurance Scheme
Depositors in all banks incorporated under the Italian law, with the exception of mutual
banks, are protected by the Interbank Deposit Protection Fund (Fondo Interbancario di
Tutela dei Depositi, or FITD). 3 The mutual banks are protected under a separate scheme, the
Mutual Banks Depositor Protection Fund (MBDPF). There is no private co-insurance
scheme.
The FIDT is generous compared to the other countries and has exceeded the EU-required
minimum, recently raised to €50,000. The FITD provides €103,291 per depositor per bank,
and deposits are protected irrespective of currency.
The BoI has full legislative powers in supervising and coordinating the activities of deposit
protection funds. All interventions of the FIDT must be authorized by the BoI, and the choice
of intervention is determined by the “least-cost” principle. The scheme can be used to pay off
depositors, cover the shortfall between assets and liabilities in case of a transfer of a failing
bank to a third party, or provide support interventions (i.e. guarantees), which can be initiated
only if bank is placed under SA.
The FIDT is funded by bank contributions, ex-post, and risk-adjusted according to the size of
the deposit base covered and risk profile of the bank portfolio.
The FIDT does not have supervisory powers. However, it monitors the financial ratios of its
members and, in case of non-compliance (with FIDT’s guidelines on risk profile and unpaid
contributions), it can impose four types of sanctions: suspending voting rights, removing a
bank’s representative; imposing pecuniary sanctions; and excluding the member from the
FIDT.
Since its creation, the FIDT was activated only six times, and has been under the strict
surveillance by the BoI.
The Decree Law of October 9, 2008, empowered the Ministry of Economy and Finance to
issue a state guarantee to back up the DI schemes.

3

FIDT was established in 1987 as a voluntary consortium. In 1996, the FIDT was incorporated into the legal
system by the Legislative Decree No. 659, implementing the EU Directive 94/19/EU and participation in FIDT
was made mandatory. As of June 2007, the FIDT was covering about euro 395 bn of deposits in 297 institutions.
The MBDPF protects depositors of about 460 mutual banks, and covers much smaller amount of deposits (euro
35 bn).

73
Liquidity and Lender of Last Resort (LOLR)
The system-wide liquidity is provide by the ECB via open market operations and standing
facilities. Standing facilities allow a broad range of institutions discreet access against a
broad range of collateral. However, in some cases, access to (uncollateralised) LOLR is
needed.
LOLR facilities and decisions in EU rest with national authorities, hence the BoI. In case of
insolvency, the government guarantees the BoI’s liquidity support. In addition, as by the
recent Decree 155 (October 9, 2008), in the event of severe liquidity crises, the government
guarantees the loans granted by the BoI to Italian banks and the branches of foreign banks.
The BoI had no specific LOLR line open as of November 2008.
In implementing the measures stated in Decree Law 157 (13 October, 2008), the BoI adopted
measures to strengthen the liquidity support for Italian banks. For the matters falling within
its competence, it contributes to the implementation of the Eurosystem’s credit operations,
which, following the changes introduced by the ECB on 8 October 2008, allow the demand
for liquidity to be met for unlimited amounts at the fixed rate of 3.75 per cent. The BoI has
decided to:
1. reduce from €1,000,000 to €500,000, with immediate effect, the minimum threshold
for loans to be eligible for refinancing operations, without prejudice to the right to
make further adjustments in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the ECB
2. activate a new facility for temporary swaps between government securities held by the
BoI and assets held by Italian banks. The transactions will be renewable, have a
maturity of one month and be remunerated with a fee of 1 per cent on an annual basis.
Banks will be able to swap debt instruments in various currencies and with a rating
lower than that of eligible collateral with the ECB. The operations started on October
16, will be carried out twice a week and the facility’s total amount can reach €40 bn.

ANNEX II. ITALY: STATISTICAL INFORMATION
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. Italy’s economic database is comprehensive and
of generally high quality. Italy has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard
(SDDS) and has posted the metadata on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(DSBB). Data are provided to the Fund in a comprehensive manner (see attached table). The
authorities regularly publish a full range of economic and financial data, as well as a calendar
of dates for the main statistical releases. Italy is also subject to the statistical requirements
and timeliness and reporting standards of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB),
and has adopted the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA95). The shift to chain-weighted
indices for national accounts has been largely completed over the course of 2006.
A Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC)—Data Module (Country
Report No. 02/234, 10/18/02) found Italy’s macroeconomic statistics to be of generally high
quality, but also identified some shortcomings that hindered an accurate and timely analysis
of economic and financial developments: (i) no statistical agency had the responsibility to
compile and disseminate a comprehensive statement of government finances, and a persistent
difference had emerged between the SGP-monitored fiscal deficit and the PSBR net of
privatization receipts (discussed in detail in the 2004 Staff Report); (ii) source data and/or
statistical techniques could be strengthened in several areas, most importantly, by raising
response rates on the enterprise surveys used in the national accounts and producer price
index, making price collection for the consumer price index more efficient, and improving
the coverage of cross-border financial transactions; (iii) balance of payments and government
finance statistics could be closer aligned with the internationally accepted methodological
guidelines on concepts and definitions, scope, classification and sectorization, and/or
valuation; and (iv) resources were under pressure in some parts of the National Institute of
Statistics (Istat) in the face of the statistical requirements of the EU and the Euro area.
Recent steps to improve economic data include: the introduction in 2005 of the regional price
indices by Istat; the publication of quarterly data for the general government balance,
expenditure, and revenue on an accruals basis along with a financial balance sheet (in line
with ESA95 and GFSM 2001) starting in October 2003; and more detailed labor survey,
conducted by professional staff. Progress has also been made in reconciling the discrepancy
between the cash-based net borrowing requirement and the accrual budget deficit, and
working groups— consisting of representatives of the BoI, MEF (which also publishes
cash-based data on the central government in GFSM 2001 format), and Istat—meet regularly
to look at different aspects of the reconciliation. While some differences still exist between
the two measures, these are now accounted for more comprehensively and speedily (see the
2005 Fiscal ROSC Update Report for details).
Notwithstanding these improvements, weaknesses remain in some areas. In the national
accounts, changes in inventories are derived as a residual and lumped together with the
statistical discrepancy thus hampering the economic analysis. Furthermore, as highlighted by
the fiscal transparency ROSC and the two follow-ups, the quality and timeliness of some
fiscal data, particularly on expenditure by local governments, is still in need of improvement.
Istat’s resources remain insufficient and lower than European peers.

Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation with Italy
Supplementary Information

This supplement provides information that has become available since the staff report was

confidence weakened further. Coupled
Sources: BoI, and IMF staff estimates
with recent downward revisions to partner
country growth and world trade, staff now project GDP to decline by 2.1 percent in 2009 and
by 0.1 percent in 2010 with the risks to this projection, mainly relating to the global outlook,
remaining tilted to the downside. The forecast for 2009 is similar to that made by the Bank of
Italy and the European Commission in mid-January (-2 percent), but staff envisage a more
gradual recovery thereafter. Staff project inflation to fall to 1.2 percent in 2009, and remain
under 2 percent in 2010, reflecting weaker international commodity prices and the significant
output gap.

2.
The fiscal position is set to weaken commensurately. On the back of deteriorating
cyclical conditions, revenues continued to flag in December, and staff now project the 2009
fiscal deficit to widen to 3.9 percent of GDP—including the effects of the recent anti-crisis
package approved by Parliament at end-January, 2009—as automatic stabilizers operate. The
public debt ratio is forecast to rise to 109.4 percent of GDP. Risks to the fiscal balance
remain to the downside, reflecting not only the risks to growth, but also that revenue
elasticities may shift adversely. In line with other high-debt Euro area sovereigns, 10-year
spreads over German bunds remained elevated (around 140 basis points at end-January).

Financial market strains have persisted, and sovereign risk indicators remain
elevated. While CDS spreads for the largest banks edged down by some 20 to 40 basis points
during the past month, equity valuations remained at historical lows. Italy’s voluntary bank
recapitalization scheme for sound banks has been approved by the European Commission but
has not yet been promulgated.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with Italy
On February 6, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Italy. 1
Background
The economy has entered into recession, as the global financial crisis and ensuing slowdown
intensified. Output is projected to contract by 0.6 percent in 2008 and 2.1 percent in 2009, with
risks tilted to the downside. Inflation has moderated, in line with the euro area, and is expected
to decline further in 2009 as the output gap increases. The current account deficit is projected to
moderate to 2.4 percent of GDP in 2008 and 2 percent of GDP in 2009 and then gradually
narrow over the medium term, as external demand and exports pick up. The economy’s
recovery, however, is likely to be slow and weak, reflecting underlying structural rigidities, lack
of domestic competition, and the limited scope for a fiscal response.
The financial system has weathered the global turbulence, although vulnerabilities have
increased. While banks came under pressure, the system as a whole remained solid,
and no institution failed or fell short of regulatory requirements. The system’s resilience reflects
its relatively safer risk profile, which was supported by a firm regulatory and supervisory
environment, strong intervention and resolution frameworks, and pre-existing high levels of
depositor protection. However, vulnerabilities have risen, related to banks’ capitalization,
funding, credit quality, profitability, and exposure to Central and Eastern Europe (CEE).
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2

The revenue-based fiscal consolidation has come to an end. The structural fiscal balance
improved by 2¾ percent of GDP in 2006-07, mainly due to exceptionally strong revenues, with
the overall deficit narrowing to 1.6 percent of GDP in 2007. But, reflecting the expansionary
budget, weaker revenues, and some temporary factors, the deficit likely rebounded to 2¾
percent of GDP in 2008, entailing a loosening in structural terms and a higher expenditure ratio,
with the primary current spending ratio reaching a record high. The fiscal deficit is likely to widen
to around 3.9 percent of GDP in 2009, due to the deteriorating macroeconomic environment.
Debt will start rising again, reaching 109 percent of GDP in 2009.
Executive Board Assessment
The Executive Directors noted that, in line with the rest of the euro area, Italy is being severely
affected by the worsening economic environment, although its financial sector has remained
relatively resilient. The economic recession is deepening, and, while a gradual recovery is
expected in 2010, the possibility of a prolonged downturn cannot be ruled out. Against this
backdrop, Directors welcomed the authorities’ focus on prudent and comprehensive measures
to strengthen financial stability and on temporary and targeted fiscal measures, while remaining
committed to fiscal sustainability. They underscored the need to implement these measures
promptly. At the same time, the authorities should step up implementation of their long-run
structural reform agenda to enhance the economy’s growth potential.
Directors supported the authorities’ actions to strengthen financial system stability and reduce
vulnerabilities through intensified monitoring and prudential oversight. They looked forward to
the implementation of the recently announced voluntary government recapitalization scheme,
while stressing the need for minimizing potential negative spillovers for other countries.
Directors commended Italy’s advocacy of enhanced international regulatory and supervisory
coordination.
Directors supported the government’s anti-crisis fiscal package. The package takes into account
the limited room for fiscal stimulus, and focuses on temporary, targeted, and timely measures,
as well as on accelerating public investment projects. Directors in general saw little scope for
further stimulus, but a few noted that a somewhat larger stimulus could be considered if the
growth outlook deteriorates further. Although a delay in structural consolidation is warranted
for 2009, it will nevertheless be important to carry out the envisaged reductions in current
spending to underpin fiscal sustainability. In this vein, Directors welcomed that the authorities
remain committed to attaining fiscal balance in the medium term.
Directors welcomed the progress made in improving Italy’s fiscal frameworks. The 2009 budget
process has been streamlined and its medium-term orientation strengthened. Efforts are under
way to increase the productivity of public administration and improve the management of public
assets. Implementation of the fiscal federalism reform will increase fiscal autonomy and
discipline at all levels of government. Directors encouraged the authorities to build on these
efforts, by filling the remaining gaps, and following through on plans to tackle longer-term fiscal
challenges, in particular reforming the welfare system.

3

Directors underscored the importance of reducing regulation, increasing competition, and
improving the business environment to raise Italy’s productivity and growth potential. They
welcomed recent measures to enhance competition in local public services, simplify legislation,
and institute competition assessments and regulatory impact analyses. Directors called on the
authorities to further liberalize retail trade and services, continue deregulation in the energy
market, and strengthen the role of competition bodies. A comprehensive package could help
reinvigorate the reform effort by reaping synergies and raising popular support.
Directors noted the strides made in the past decade to boost employment. They encouraged a
second generation of labor market reforms to strengthen the link between wages and
productivity, allow wages to better respond to regional differences, and make permanent
contracts more flexible, in tandem with efforts to enhance the social safety net. Directors
pointed to the benefits that would accrue from concerted efforts to attain the EU Lisbon Agenda
objectives, and urged the authorities to resist protectionist pressures.

Statement by Arrigo Sadun, Executive Director for Italy
February 6, 2009
We wish to thank staff for its open, constructive, and comprehensive dialogue established
with the authorities. Staff’s effort in grasping the complexities of the Italian economy
deserves praise; all the more so, as it is not always easy to distinguish between structural
issues and the impact of the current global crisis. The results of this effort are well reflected
in the report, which provides an updated, in-depth analysis of the Italian economy.
Overview
The worst global recession of the last seventy years is taking its toll on the Italian economy;
however, as it has remained largely immune from the housing boom and excessive financial
leveraging that had propelled unsustainable growth rates in other counties in the previous
years, Italy now has been able to avoid the most severe effects of the financial crisis.
Furthermore, the impact of the financial market turmoil has been mitigated by prudent
banking practices and the relatively low level of indebtedness of households and firms. The
corporate sector is dominated by a very large number of small and medium-sized firms that
rely more on self-financing rather than on capital markets, while the traditional bank-client
relationship mitigates the effects of credit rationing.
The authorities have already locked-in to a relatively tight budget for 2009 last summer,
ahead of the economic downturn, and anchored it to a three-year fiscal framework (20092011) aimed at reaching a balanced-budget by 2011. Although the deepening of the recession
has led to the adoption of several measures to soften the blow, these have been designed to
limit their impact on the budget. These efforts have had a positive impact on the markets as
the spread between the yields on Italian and German 10-year government bonds, although
still elevated, have declined from their recent peaks.
In addition to the difficulties caused by the global recession, the Italian economy faces a
number of long-term challenges. Accordingly, the authorities are committed to reducing the
high level of public debt as well as to implementing further structural reforms that will raise
productivity and growth potential.
Economic Outlook
Following a 0.6 percent decline in 2008, the staff projects a further 2.1 percent contraction in
Italy’s GDP in 2009. This projection is roughly in line with those by the Bank of Italy and
the European Commission. The government will shortly issue its revised forecasts, taking
into consideration the most recent developments, including a greater-than-expected decline in
private consumption and investment. Staff projects a small negative growth in 2010. This
scenario is in contrast with the assumption of a generalized upturn of the global economy and
with the most recent forecasts for the Italian economy issued by the European Commission
and Bank of Italy, both of which project a recovery in 2010. The authorities believe that a
number of factors will limit the duration of the recession: real disposable income will be
sustained by low inflation (particularly lower energy prices); corporate and household
balance sheets appear relatively solid. Finally, consumption should be less affected than in

2
other countries by the negative wealth effect stemming from the downturn in the housing
market, but also because its lower reliance on credit.
After several years of robust job creation, employment growth declined in 2008 although it
remained positive. Unemployment is anticipated to increase in 2009, but will remain well
below the European average. The 2008 surge in inflation, triggered by higher energy and
other commodities spikes, is receding fast and is expected to continue to do so in 2009. The
current account deficit is expected to decline, thanks to a surplus in the trade balance; this, in
turn, reflects the improvement in the terms of trade.
Although the authorities fully expect a very difficult environment throughout 2009, they
believe that the avoidance of excessive imbalances in the previous cycle makes the Italian
economy relatively less exposed to downside risks, and this will facilitate the recovery when
the global economy turns the corner.
Fiscal Policy
Last June the European Council abrogated the excessive deficit procedure against Italy, as
the deficit ratio had declined to 1.6 percent in 2007, the best performance since 2000 and
well below the 3 percent threshold of the Maastricht Treaty. The improvement reflected
strong revenue increases as well as firmer control of expenditure growth. Staff estimates that
the deficit reached 2.7 percent in 2008, due to weaker revenue and a more expansionary
budget. In order to strengthen the fiscal stance, the Italian authorities have adopted a number
of significant changes in the budgetary process, including a 3-year budgetary-framework that
is aimed at reaching a balanced budget by 2011. The fiscal strategy is based on the
containment of public expenditures across the board and at all levels of government. An
adequate level of resources for social services will be guaranteed by increasing the efficiency
of other public sector activities. A comprehensive reform of the public administration has
been launched in the framework of the 2009 budget. A crucial element of this reform is to
link wage increases and productivity.
The high level of public debt severely limits the authorities’ scope for fiscal stimulus. Thus,
the measures recently adopted have been targeted to address specific issues, such as
supporting low-income households, and are largely based on the mobilization of funds
already included in investment plans. Accordingly, the authorities do not expect any
significant impact on the budget. The measures entail high multiplicator effects and are
designed to be temporary. Therefore, the overall deterioration of fiscal balances in 2009 can
be considered almost entirely cyclical, as it depends on GDP dynamics and automatic
stabilizers.
The momentum to improve the fiscal framework has not slackened. The spending review
pilot project, initiated with the Fund’s technical support, has been completed and a report
covering five key areas of the public sector (justice, infrastructure, transports, internal affairs,
and education) has been issued. The budget office, in cooperation with line ministers, is now
responsible for selecting priority programs, reviewing their underlying legislation and
identifying opportunities for reducing spending and improving efficiency.
Fiscal discipline of local governments has increased markedly in recent years. The Domestic
Stability Pact has helped bring local public finances under control. In the past, the health care
system, managed at the regional level, has been a traditional source of overspending.
However, with the introduction of the so-called “health-care pact” in 2006, which provides

3
stringent budgetary limits, expenditure trends have improved noticeably. The fiscal
federalism reform, already approved by the Senate, will provide a more coherent framework
to establish areas of responsibilities and allocation of resources at all levels of government.
The authorities consider an expedited implementation of the reform a top priority.
The Banking System
The Italian banking system has so far suffered less than others from the impact of the crisis.
As noted by staff, the system remains solid; no institution has failed since the outbreak of the
crisis, nor has fallen short of regulatory requirements. The resilience of the banking system
reflects a business model based on prudent lending, as well as on retail funding rather than on
wholesale capital markets.
Its resilience also stems from a solid regulatory and supervisory environment and strong
intervention and resolution frameworks. Box 1 in the staff report mentions a number of
factors that have prevented Italian banks from pursuing more risky strategies, such as the
extensive bank-branch network and, more generally, the banks’ funding policies. While in
line with EU norms and the Basel Accord, regulatory provisions, including those on
derivatives, securitizations, liquidity monitoring, limits on the use of hybrid capital, and
exposures to SPVs, have long been particularly stringent.
The Italian authorities’ response to the financial crisis has been prudent and systematic since
its outbreak. Following the intensification of global financial instability, in October 2008 the
authorities adopted measures to preserve the stability of the financial system, protect savers,
and maintain adequate levels of bank liquidity and capitalization. These actions have recently
been supplemented by additional measures designed to strengthen the system’s overall ability
to finance economic activity.
The Ministry of Economy and Finance has been authorized to participate in the
recapitalization of banks whose capital levels have been deemed insufficient by the Bank of
Italy. Moreover, to support bank lending, the Ministry can subscribe financial instruments
issued by sound listed Italian banks that qualify as regulatory capital support. Furthermore, in
the event of a severe liquidity crisis, the Italian Treasury is authorized to guarantee the
emergency loans granted by the Bank of Italy to Italian banks and to the branches of foreign
banks operating in Italy.
Further measures to sustain bank liquidity and foster funding have been adopted in a
coordinated effort with the other euro-area countries. For example, the Ministry of Economy
and Finance can issue state guarantees for Italian banks’ new liabilities with maturity
between three months and five years. Additional measures adopted by the Bank of Italy
include the activation of a new facility that allows banks to temporary exchange their assets
for government securities held by the Bank of Italy itself.
The crisis resolution framework has been further strengthened through the extension of the
procedures for special administration and provisional management of banks to cases of
“severe crises”, including liquidity crises, which could jeopardize the stability of the financial
system.

4
Structural Reforms
Low productivity growth coupled with steady increases in unit labor costs are at the basis of
Italy’s competitive gap and slow growth potential. Despite the disappointing performance of
the Italian economy in the past few years, there are growing signs that a widespread
restructuring of the Italian industry is underway. Even in traditional sectors such as textiles
and leather goods, Italian firms have managed to move toward higher value-added goods,
and have improved the quality of their exports. This is confirmed by the fact that although
Italy’s world market shares have declined if measured at constant-price, they have remained
relatively stable at current prices. These findings are also in line with the latest data on the
Trade Performance Index, developed by the International Trade Centre of UNCTAD/WTO,
which ranks Italy very high in terms of competitiveness in several sectors of world trade.
The authorities are committed to continue pursuing the reform agenda to boost Italy’s growth
potential. The National Reform Programmme, submitted to the EU Commission last
November in the framework of the Lisbon’s Agenda, envisages specific measures to be
implemented before 2010 concerning the liberalization of products and services markets.
Building on the recently approved measures for the electricity sector and local public
services, the authorities seek to promote greater competition in other sectors. The
modernization of the public administration, programmed as part of the 2009 budget, will
boost the efficiency of the public sector. Finally, investment in infrastructures and research
and development will be accelerated.
A series of reforms launched in the past several years have increased labor market mobility
and led to substantial job creation. Although the unemployment rate remains well below the
European average, the recession is putting stress on the labor market. Accordingly, the social
safety net has been strengthened with additional funding for the unemployment protection
scheme (“cassa integrazione”). Moreover, the social partners have started to implement some
changes in the collective bargaining process, increasing wage flexibility and strengthening
the linkage to productivity growth. Specifically, basic wage rates will be negotiated at the
national level taking into consideration the expected rate of inflation (excluding energy
prices). Wage increases tied to productivity gains will be determined through decentralized
negotiations.
