REPUBLIC OF SOUTH SUDAN
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context: Endowed with significant natural resources, South Sudan faces acute challenges:
fractured politics, feeble institutions and capacity, underdevelopment, and corruption. Since
the country’s independence in 2011, institution building and development have been
hindered by a number of factors, including volatile relations with Sudan, a 15-month
shutdown of oil production, and more recently, a civil conflict. Inflation rose following an
initial period of economic instability in 2011-12, but has been contained since then owing
to fiscal and monetary restraint. However, distortions in the foreign exchange market and
extra-budgetary expenditures remain significant, foreign exchange reserves are critically
low, and near-term prospects for a durable political settlement are uncertain.
Focus of the consultation: This is the first Article IV Consultation with South Sudan since
the country became an IMF member in April 2012. The discussions focused on policies to
establish economic stability and move forward with reforms to build the legitimacy of the
state, improve cooperation with the international community, and attract investment.
Key issues and recommendations: The priorities are to ensure political inclusion and
lasting peace, reform the foreign exchange market and unify the exchange rate, improve
budget execution, overhaul non-oil revenue administration, and foster transparency and
accountability in oil, fiscal, and central bank operations. Key medium-term reforms to
reduce fragility comprise the implementation of provisions in oil and public financial
management legislation and well-prioritized demobilization and public investment plans.
The authorities broadly concurred with these recommendations; the extent of progress will
depend on commitment to nation building and political will to prevail over vested interests.
Exchange rate arrangement: South Sudan has maintained a number of exchange
restrictions and multiple currency practices under the transitional arrangements of Article
XIV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, and introduced a multiple currency practice subject
to Fund’s jurisdiction under Article VIII after becoming a member.
Capacity building: Technical support and training from the IMF is being coordinated with
other stakeholders and delivered through a dedicated five-year capacity building program
set up in November 2012. In the coming year, support is expected to focus on the
macroeconomic framework, petroleum fiscal management, non-oil revenue administration,
foreign reserves management, monetary operations, banking supervision, and
macroeconomic statistics.

CONTEXT
1.
South Sudan’s fragility is complex and multifaceted. A troubled history of conflict left a
legacy of poverty, low human development indicators, weak governance, and lack of infrastructure
and institutions. Although rich in natural resources, the economy is centered on oil production and
subsistence agriculture, with almost all

civilians.
2.
Social indicators improved gradually after 2005 although little progress was made in
building the public infrastructure. Between 2005 and 2011, foreign aid and technical assistance
amounted to about US$500 million per year, focused on humanitarian support, health and
education. Government spending amounted to about US$2.5 billion per year amidst large oil-related
inflows, but its effectiveness was constrained by poor budget execution and governance problems.2
Some progress was made in lowering child mortality rates, increasing school attendance, and
reducing poverty, but little was achieved in terms of building the energy and the transport
infrastructure.3
3.
Unresolved issues with Sudan led to a shutdown of oil production in January 2012.
Amidst disagreements with Sudan over oil transit fees (the infrastructure to export oil is within
Sudan’s territory), South Sudan suspended all oil production in January 2012.4 Before the shutdown,
South Sudan’s oil production was about 330,000 barrels per day.5
1

In the past year, oil production accounted for 99 percent of exports, 95 percent of government revenue, and about
one-half of GDP. South Sudan has a large area of fertile arable land, important fishing and forestry resources, and
undeveloped deposits of gold, silver, iron ore, copper, and other minerals.

2

In his 2012 annual audit report of the financial year that ended in December 2008, the auditor general reported
protracted problems with budget execution, including neglect for spending procedures, disregard for budget
appropriations, nontransparent accounting, and weak legislative oversight (Report of the Auditor General on the
Financial Statements of the Government of South Sudan, National Audit Chamber, http://www.auditchamber-ss.org/).

National Bureau of Statistics, 2012 Millennium Development Goals Report (http://ssnbs.org/publications/).

Following the 2005 peace agreement and until independence in 2011, oil proceeds were equally shared between the
central government in Sudan and the regional government of South Sudan—where three-fourths of former Sudan’s
oil production was located.
5

South Sudan is believed to have the largest oil reserves in sub-Saharan Africa after Nigeria and Angola. Proven
oil reserves are 1.2 billion barrels, although observers contend that a new review would reveal a higher figure. To
counteract Sudan’s monopoly power on the transit of oil, the authorities are building domestic refineries and would
like to build alternative pipelines through neighboring countries.

4.
A new agreement with Sudan led to a resumption of oil production in April 2013. Under
the agreement, South Sudan pays oil transit and pipeline fees of about US$10 per barrel plus a
cumulative US$3 billion in direct financial transfers over about three and a half years (financial
transfers are linked to the flow of oil production at the rate of US$15 per barrel). The agreement
contains provisions for a demilitarized zone, forgiveness of bilateral claims, and regularization of
cross-border and pension payments.6 While some progress has been made in these areas, the
settlement of important border issues (including the status of the disputed region of Abyei) remains
outstanding.
5.
More recently, a political struggle escalated into a civil war. In December 2013, growing
tensions within the ruling party (SPLM) and a power struggle between President Kiir and former vicePresident Machar triggered arrests and the exile of key party leaders and a conflict along ethnic lines
(between the Dinka and the Nuer, the main ethnic groups) in four states, two of which (Upper Nile
and Unity) produce most of South Sudan’s oil.7 The conflict left thousands dead, about 1.7 million
people displaced, destroyed infrastructure in the affected areas, and worsened already poor
humanitarian conditions, leading to a high risk of famine in coming months.8

MACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
6.
Economic performance has been unsteady. Growth has been volatile owing to disruptions
in oil production, weather conditions, and internal conflict. After the January 2012 shutdown, oil
production recovered to more than 235,000 barrels per day at end 2013, only to fall to about
160,000 barrels per day in early 2014 as a result of the conflict. Despite an increase in private
investment around Juba in recent years and a weather-related increase in agricultural production in
2012, non-oil economic activity is estimated to have declined since then. Because of the conflict, the
forecast for the current fiscal year (ending in June 2015) is also subdued owing to constrained oil
production and an expected fall in agricultural output (Table 1). The near-term macroeconomic
framework is based on the assumption of a gradual normalization of the security situation in 2015,
although serious risks remain (see below).

6

The agreement, signed in September 2012, also stipulates that Sudan would assume all external debt of former
Sudan subject to securing a “firm commitment” of international creditors for debt relief (i.e. Sudan’s reaching the HIPC
decision point) no later than two years from the date of agreement (this was termed the “zero option”). Upon
expiration of the two-year window, the two countries agreed in November 2014 to extend the zero option to October
2016. Sudan’s authorities have started implementing an outreach strategy with South Sudan under the auspices of the
African Union High Implementation Panel to garner support for debt relief.
7

Confrontations erupted between government and rebel forces (most of which splintered from the South Sudanese
army) in four states. Other states, notably those in the Greater Bahr El Ghazal, were also affected by displaced
populations.
8

Heightened insecurity led to the evacuation of the IMF resident representative and four long-term advisors in
December 2013. Technical advisors from all other agencies were also evacuated. As the situation in the capital Juba
improved in 2014, Fund operations began resuming in August.

Instability in oil receipts and the conflict led to financial challenges. The oil shutdown
worsened the fiscal accounts. In response, the authorities cut expenditures by about 40 percent in
real terms in 2012/13 and funded the budget with government deposits and short-term domestic
and external borrowing. The resumption of oil production allowed spending to recover in 2013/14
and permitted servicing some of the debt.

Inflation rose after independence but
has declined since 2012. Higher government
spending after independence and the initial
monetization of the deficit caused by the oil
shutdown pushed inflation to about 80 percent
by mid-2012. Thereafter, lower food prices and
fiscal austerity brought inflation down to near
zero by mid-2013. As the fiscal situation is
worsening again in 2014, shortfalls in revenues
and in external financing are leading to a
monetary expansion that threatens to bring
inflation to double digit levels in 2015 (Tables 3
and 4).9

Foreign currency rationing led to a parallel market for foreign exchange. The parallel
market emerged in September 2011 as the Bank of South Sudan (the central bank) decided to peg
the currency at an overvalued level and ration foreign exchange.10 The rationing entails a hidden
transfer of resources from the government to

Financing the projected fiscal deficit in 2014/15 will be difficult. Government deposits
and foreign reserves have reached all-time lows this year (as of end-September 2014, net foreign
assets of the central bank amounted to US$379 million, about 3 weeks of imports), and the
availability of external financing has been limited owing to high levels of country risk.

DISCUSSIONS ON NEAR-TERM PRIORITIES
11.
The discussions centered on the strategy to address the country’s main political and
economic challenges. A political settlement and peace are essential. In addition, steps to deal with
pressing fiscal issues, a distorted foreign exchange regime, and insufficient transparency and
accountability in public financial management (including oil revenue management) are needed for
economic stability and to enhance the legitimacy of the state.12
12.
Staff advised the authorities to adopt appropriate policies to deal with the current
financing shortfall and the threat of economic instability. The authorities indicated that they
would most likely adopt a combination of measures that could increase non-oil revenue and reduce
fiscal spending, and possibly undertake additional external borrowing. Yet they recognized that the
benefits of non-oil reforms will not be large enough, that spending cuts will be difficult, and that
10

As per the Central Bank Law, the authorities were expected to allow the currency to float for a period of up to six
months beginning in July 2011 and subsequently peg it at a sustainable level vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar.

11

By mid-2013, there were 79 foreign exchange houses licensed in South Sudan. A significant part of goods are
imported at the parallel market exchange rate while only a small number of transactions (i.e. imports of food,
medicine, fuel, and construction materials) benefit from foreign exchange acquired at the official exchange rate.
12

Discussions with Fund staff on economic challenges and policies began in 2012 when the authorities requested
feedback on policies to respond to the challenges of the oil shutdown; they continued through regular staff visits
since then. In parallel, a program of IMF technical assistance in selected areas of Fund competence began in late 2012.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

REPUBLIC OF SOUTH SUDAN

access to external borrowing may be limited, leaving the residual financing gap to be filled through
central bank financing. In this regard, the staff urged the authorities to proceed with exchange rate
unification, a policy that could yield substantial fiscal benefits in the near term (see below).

A. Peace and Political Inclusion
13.
Resolving the conflict requires political inclusion. Violence has continued in conflictaffected areas despite frequent negotiations between the government and rebels and the signing of
cessation of hostilities agreements. A peace process sponsored by the Intergovernmental Authority
on Development (comprising Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, and Uganda) has been under
way since early 2014, and pressure has intensified on all parties to bring about peace, yet prospects
are uncertain. The authorities expect that a dialogue within the ruling party comprising those in the
government, former Vice-President Machar, and those that signaled their dissent in 2013, would
result in a political settlement and a government of national unity in 2015.

B. Fiscal Management
14.

There are four main fiscal challenges in the near term:


Financing the higher deficit. The authorities are aware of the risks of monetizing the fiscal
deficit and are contemplating expenditure cuts. They are also considering exchange rate
unification, a measure that could have a significant positive effect on the fiscal accounts
(since about 95 percent of revenues are denominated in foreign currency). As no decision has
been made yet, the near-term macroeconomic projections (Tables 1-5) assume a spending
envelope in line with the approved budget and no exchange rate unification.13



Improving budget execution and preventing arrears. Budget execution has been complicated
by emergency unbudgeted expenditures and extra-budgetary spending by government
agencies.14 The authorities agreed to monitor expenditure commitments for consistency with
monthly budget limits, enforce procurement regulations (a procurement act is about to be
passed by Parliament), and proceed with steps to set up a single treasury account. On the
latter, the authorities are expected to prepare a plan including a list of all government
accounts held at commercial banks and a timetable to centralize the management of fiscal
resources and expenditures. The authorities also agreed to conduct an inventory of valid
arrears and prepare a plan for their repayment; they have requested assistance from the
World Bank to begin evaluating claims from two key ministries (Ministry of Defense and
Ministry of Roads and Transport).

13

In the baseline, expenditures are in line with the 2014/15 budget but oil and non-oil revenues have been adjusted
downward in light of lower oil price and output projections. Compared to the previous year’s budget, current
spending has been increased while capital expenditures have been curtailed. The overall spending envelope is
somewhat higher, although in real terms it is around its level in 2011/12.

14

In early 2014, a “crisis management committee” took over spending decisions to deal with the security challenges;
the committee was recently dissolved in order to restore budgetary procedures.

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF SOUTH SUDAN



Establish a functioning revenue administration. Severe capacity constraints, corruption, and
lack of a legal framework and resources have delayed setting up an efficient system of nonoil revenue administration. In the near-term, with support from the IMF and other providers,
the authorities intend to implement a new customs tariff schedule, automate customs
operations at the largest customs post, and allocate additional resources to enforce
compliance with domestic taxes, especially through the large taxpayers’ unit. In addition, the
National Assembly has approved a Financial Bill specifying all the elements of the tax system
at the federal level.15 Staff also encouraged the authorities not to divert their efforts to
establish a National Revenue Authority in the near-term; such an institution could be
important in the medium term but it need not be a priority compared to the basic measures
required to boost collection.



Reorient spending towards development. About 40 percent of public spending goes to
security and a similar share is devoted to public sector salaries, while infrastructure spending
has been meager and declining since 2011/12. The authorities concurred on the need to
reverse this trend as soon as fiscal pressures become less severe and oil revenues recover.

C. Exchange Rate Regime
15.
South Sudan maintains a fixed exchange rate. Given severe capacity constraints and lack
of tools to implement monetary policy, and in line with staff’s view, the authorities consider that the
fixed exchange rate regime mandated by the Central Bank Law is the best option at this point and
that, if the exchange rate is set at a realistic level, it can serve as an anchor for prices. However, as oil
receipts have proven to be quite volatile, the authorities do not preclude moving towards a more
flexible exchange rate regime in the medium term.
16.
Foreign exchange market distortions are a major challenge. The minister of finance and
the governor of the central bank agreed that the rationing and allocation of foreign exchange since
2011 have created significant distortions in the economy and reinforced perceptions of poor
economic management by fostering corruption and rent-seeking, altering critical price signals, and
detering foreign invesment. 16 And while the paucity and quality of historical data does not permit the
estimation of an equilibrium exchange rate, the persistent parallel market premium since September
2011 strongly suggests that the official exchange rate is overvalued. South Sudan maintains a

15

The above measures are consistent with technical advice from the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department. For a description
of South Sudan’s tax system, see Appendix I.

16

The premium on the parallel market rate has been between 30 and 80 percent since 2011, although most recently it
has hovered around 70 percent. The exchange restrictions and the dual rate also lead to large quasi-fiscal losses as
the government has not been servicing its debt to the central bank and has been building more debt. As of endSeptember 2014, this debt amounted to SSP 4 billion (8.8 percent of GDP).

number of exchange restrictions under the transitional arrangements of Article XIV and one multiple
currency practice subject to the Fund’s approval under Article VIII (see Informational Annex). 17
17.
The authorities concurred on the need for exchange rate reform. The Ministry of Finance
and Economic Planning (MoFEP), recognizing that current policies are too costly for the budget and
the economy, planned to carry out a reform of the market in 2013, but the reform could not proceed
because of opposition by vested interests.18 The reform entails unifying the exchange rate and
setting up two-way fixed rate auctions and an interbank market for foreign exchange where foreign
exchange houses would bid for foreign currency only through commercial banks and the market
would clear at a sustainable exchange rate without rationing (Box 1). During the Article IV
discussions, the authorities indicated that they would like to proceed with the reform soon, but that
the timing will depend on securing the necessary political consensus. They were also concerned
about not having enough foreign reserves to defend a new parity. The staff noted that, if the
exchange rate is set at a realistic level, the excess demand for foreign currency could be eliminated if
backed by a consistent fiscal policy.

17

In September 2013, the IMF’s Legal Department conducted a review of South Sudan’s foreign exchange system.
The multiple currency practice subject to the Fund’s jurisdiction under Article VIII is related to an exchange rate
guarantee arrangement established by the central bank with a commercial bank and introduced after South Sudan
joined the Fund.

18

Upon request by the authorities, the IMF’s Monetary and Capital Markets Department provided technical advice
and training on all aspects of the reform in 2013. In November of that year, the central bank announced a 34 percent
devaluation of the South Sudanese pound, but the announcement was reversed immediately and the reform was not
implemented.

Box 1. Why Exchange Rate Reform Matters
Reforming the foreign exchange market in South Sudan could provide the following benefits:
Improved fiscal position and reserve buffers. Exchange rate unification, through an adjustment of the official
rate to a realistic level, will substantially increase the value of oil and non-oil (i.e. customs) revenues. This would
alleviate financing needs, thus reducing reliance on external borrowing and facilitate an increase in government
deposits and in central bank’s foreign exchange
reserves (the text table illustrates the estimated
effect of exchange rate unification on key
macroeconomic variables in fiscal year 2014/15).
Build legitimacy in government policies. The
reform will eliminate the large transfer of funds from
the government to a few beneficiaries and provide

Set up an interbank market for foreign exchange. The envisaged two-way trading by banks and the central
bank is an important step to foster financial market development. The ensuing interbank foreign exchange
market will facilitate the monitoring and managing of liquidity and pave the way for the introduction of
monetary instruments and the establishment of a money market.
Foster non-oil economic activity. The reform will instill clarity in the price for foreign currency and reduce
foreign exchange market distortions which, in turn, will lower risks for import competing or non-oil export
activities, notably agriculture, and promote foreign investment.
Focus on core central bank activities. Scarce resources were used since 2011 to deal with administrative
controls and exchange rate allocations. The allocations, at first roughly equal in volume to exchange houses and
banks, became increasingly discretionary as central bank’s foreign reserves dwindled. The reform will lower
administrative costs and allow the Bank of South Sudan to focus on its core mandates.
To be successful, the reform requires (i) an appropriate communications strategy, (ii) a sustainable set of fiscal
and monetary policies; (iii) a level of the exchange rate that is consistent with these policies; and (iv) proper
regulations, including those to prevent overbidding by banks. The reform is expected to have a very small effect
on consumer prices since most goods and services are already priced at the parallel market rate (staff estimates
a pass through of 10-20 percent).

D. Transparency and Accountability
18.
Steps to increase transparency and accountability in oil, fiscal, and central bank
operations can build confidence. Based on provisions of current or forthcoming legislation19, the
staff urged the authorities to: (i) publish regularly detailed and comprehensive data on oil
production, sales, costs, profit oil, and receipts from bonuses from sales of mining rights; (ii) conduct
competitive bidding for new oil and mining exploration and sharing arrangements and disclose the
content of contracts; (iii) begin publication of quarterly budget execution reports, including financing
details; (iv) seek Parliamentary approval and publish details of public debt operations in accordance
with the Public Financial Management and Accounting Law; and (v) implement the recommendations
of the 2012 external audit of the central bank and conduct an external audit of the 2013 accounts by
a reputable audit firm.20 The minister of finance and the central bank governor agreed on the need to
proceed with these steps as a way to increase transparency and accountability in the use of public
resources and build legitimacy in the state.

MEDIUM TERM: FOUNDATIONS TO EXIT FRAGILITY
19.
The discussions also touched on the medium-term outlook and priority reforms that
could help build economic resilience. The authorities consider that the outlook is broadly positive
but subject to significant risks. To counteract these risks, they appreciate the importance to begin
focusing on key reforms to improve public financial management (especially oil revenue
management), change the composition of public spending towards social and infrastructure
spending, implement a demobilization program, engage with donors and investors, and facilitate
regional integration. 21

A. Outlook and Risks
20.
The baseline projections assume a gradual normalization of the political and security
situation, regional stability, and economic reforms. In the next 10 years, annual real GDP growth
could expand at an average of 6-7 percent. This reflects the recovery of oil production after the
2012/13 shutdown and the recent slowdown, the low initial level of non-oil GDP (including an
19

The Petroleum Law, the Petroleum Revenue Management Act (forthcoming), the Public Financial Management and
Accounting Law, the Mining Law, and the Central Bank Law.
20

An external audit of the 2012 accounts of the central bank was conducted but could not be completed because of
limited information. As a result, the country’s auditor general issued a disclaimer of opinion for the audit. The issues
include, but are not limited to, mismatches related to “nostro” accounts and suspense accounts that remain to be
cleared. In response to the audit findings, the authorities have initiated steps to begin addressing the issues raised in
the report, and a time-bound plan of action is being prepared.
21

The authorities have applied to join the East Africa Community (EAC). Integration with the EAC could bring about
important benefits, including principles of good governance and the rule of law (Article 3.3 of the EAC charter
stipulates that membership is contingent upon adherence to universally acceptable principles of governance,
democracy, the rule of law, human rights, and social justice). Given South Sudan’s low levels of development and
human capital, the transition will need to be managed carefully to ensure that the non-oil economy can develop in a
competitive environment.

estimated decline in 2013/14 and a projected decline in 2014/15 because of the conflict), and a
recovery in trade with Sudan in light of the recent reopening of the border. The GDP path is driven
by the oil production profile, as the latter first recovers from the current slowdown to reach about
260 thousand barrels per day by 2016/17, then decline until 2022 as production rates fall in aging oil
fields, and ultimately increase again as a result of assumed investment in enhanced recovery and
exploitation of new fields in the early 2020s (oil output could reach about 400 thousand barrels per
day by 2026.22 In the medium term, non-oil GDP (especially agriculture and services) is also expected
to benefit from higher post-conflict spending (particularly the rebuilding of destroyed infrastructure),
while other non-oil activities could also expand as investments in transport and energy begin
facilitating economic diversification (Table 6).
21.
In the next five years, two priorities will be building foreign reserves and scaling up
public investment. In light of South Sudan’s vulnerabilities, it is estimated that a target for foreign
reserves of 6-8 months of imports could be appropriate.23 In addition, the country has massive
infrastructure needs, requiring public investments of at least US$15 billion in the next 10 years.24
However, capacity constraints imply that the scaling up of public investment will need to be gradual,
with priority given to transport and energy infrastructure as a way to enable other investments over
time.
22.
A debt sustainability analysis puts South Sudan at a moderate risk of debt distress.
South Sudan’s external debt ratios are presently very low, there are no external arrears, and the
baseline scenario projects that a moderate amount of external debt (mostly non-concessional) may
be incurred in coming years to fill temporary investment gaps, yielding debt ratios that are below
their respective thresholds (see accompanying Staff Report “Republic of South Sudan: Debt
Sustainability Analysis”). However, several factors linked to the country’s fragility and heavy
dependence on oil revenues pose serious vulnerabilities, thus implying a moderate risk of debt
distress.
23.
The authorities agreed that five major risks could lead to a worse outcome compared
to the baseline. First, lack of political inclusiveness could intensify internal conflicts, leading to
22

Preliminary industry estimates suggest that, under a secure and stable environment, sufficient investment could
bring oil output to nearly 700 thousand barrels per day. The baseline takes a less optimistic view in light of lingering
political and regional risks. Barring new discoveries, oil production is expected to fall to negligible levels by 2035.
23

This is a preliminary reserve adequacy estimate for South Sudan. Vulnerabilities include the country’s dependence
on volatile oil revenue flows. A full reserve adequacy analysis is not applicable at this point as many key variables
(namely, the bottom 10 percentile of the distribution of external demand growth, terms of trade growth, change in
FDI to GDP, and change in Aid to GDP) are not available. Nevertheless, comparable averages for fragile states with
fixed exchange rates indicate that an appropriate reserve cover would be around 6-8 months of imports (DablaNorris, Kim, and Shirono, Optimal Precautionary Reserves for Low-Income Countries: A Cost-Benefit Analysis, IMF
Working Paper 11/249, October 2011).
24

A 2011 World Bank study estimated that South Sudan will need about US$1.4 billion per year in infrastructure
investment for about 10 years, of which one-half would need to be spent on transport and 40 percent on energy and
water projects. These figures did not include the construction of alternative oil pipelines (through Kenya or Ethiopia
and Djibouti), a project that could add another US$4 billion.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

protracted economic instability. Second, failure to embark on economic reforms, especially the
unification of the exchange rate and improved fiscal management, will prevent an appropriate
buildup of reserves and force additional borrowing, arrears, and/or lead to high inflation. Third,
unresolved territorial issues with Sudan and the expiration of the oil sharing agreement in 2016
could reignite tensions and threaten to disrupt oil production. Fourth, rent seeking behavior and
corruption, if not combated, would concentrate wealth and resources within a few and stifle
development. Lastly, a further and sustained decline in international oil prices would create serious
macroeconomic tensions, possibly leading to a fiscal and balance of payments crisis (Table 7).
24.
Given these risks, alternative scenarios with protracted political instability and
insufficient reforms or a shutdown of oil production cannot be ruled out. Under such scenarios,
fiscal and balance of payments gaps could become impossible to manage, domestic arrears could
continue to mount, real GDP growth would be stifled and inflation higher, and debt ratios could
climb to unsustainable levels.25 These risks, which would perpetuate fragility and threaten the
country’s viability, underscore the importance of a strong commitment to internal peace, economic
reforms, good relations with Sudan, and close cooperation with the international community.

B. Oil Revenue Management
25.
A proper management of oil revenues is crucial for South Sudan’s development. The
Petroleum Revenue Management Act (PRMA), passed by parliament in October 2013, is an important
step, and complements the already enacted Petroleum Law. These two pieces of legislation include
provisions to prevent corruption and mismanagement, and their reporting and transparency
requirements go beyond EITI requirements.26 The PRMA prescribes that all oil revenue should flow
through specific accounts, that utilization of this revenue should be approved by the National
Legislative Assembly and flow through the budget, and that key information and reports should be
regularly published. The act also provides for prudent financial management, with investment
guidelines and auditing provisions for two reserve funds and an explicit prohibition against oilguaranteed borrowing except in a case of a national emergency (Box 2). The PRMA is yet to be
signed into law by the President, yet the authorities indicated that the implementation of some of its
provisions can begin in coming months. At the same time, the Petroleum Law requires that all oil
contracts should be awarded through competitive tender, and that data on contracts, production,
and revenue should be publicly available.

25

See Staff Report “Republic of South Sudan: Debt Sustainability Analysis”.

26

The authorities stated their intention to join the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and take steps to
make South Sudan an EITI candidate.

Box 2. Saving Provisions of the Petroleum Revenue Management Act
The Petroleum Revenue Management Act aims at ensuring a transparent and efficient management of the
oil wealth and at preventing wasteful spending before the necessary improvements in absorption capacity
and public financial management are introduced.
The act enshrines the provisions of South Sudan’s provisional constitution to establish two reserve funds: a
Petroleum Revenue Stabilization Account to shelter public expenditure from unexpected fluctuations in oil
revenues, and a Future Generation Fund that accumulates savings for future investment spending. The
rationale for the latter is that the projected profile for oil revenues anticipates sizable amount of revenues
that could be available within certain timeframes, even though such amounts cannot possibly be efficiently
invested within the same periods.
While the act is model legislation, one drawback is the coexistence of two fiscal rules that stipulate the
maximum amount of oil revenues that can be made available for use by the budget in a given year. One of
the rules puts a cap on these transfers at 75 percent of oil revenue, with the remaining 25 percent to be
saved in the stabilization account (15 percent) and the future generation funds (10 percent). The other rule
uses a seven-year historical average of oil prices to compute the maximum oil revenues available to the
budget.
During the discussions, the authorities agreed that
the 75 percent rule is inferior compared to the 7-year
rule as the former: (i) creates confusion in
interpreting the minimum level of mandated savings;
(ii) could provide for unfeasibly low levels of
government spending in some years; and (iii) could
foster pro-cyclical fiscal spending. A simulation of
both rules (see box figure) shows that the fixed 75
percent cap will likely be too restrictive considering
that public spending will most likely need to increase
in nominal terms and that, over time, higher levels of
public investment should be largely financed by
current oil receipts. The authorities shared the view
that the law will need to be amended to address
these drawbacks.

C. Fiscal Framework: Peace, Demobilization, and Infrastructure Spending
26.
Future budgets will need to devote resources to foster peace and increase social and
infrastructure spending while seeking to gradually reduce current spending over time. At first,
peace will likely require budget allocations to reintegrate militias into the government and begin a
disarmament program. At the same time, sustaining peace and reconciliation over time will require a
well-designed demobilization program to allow for the gradual absorption of former combatants
into the private sector together with a civil service strategy to keep a lean and more efficient
government. Furthermore, social and infrastructure needs are massive in South Sudan, now

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

REPUBLIC OF SOUTH SUDAN

exacerbated by the recent conflict.27 Attending to these needs will require a gradual scaling up of
investment in the social and physical infrastructure (health, energy, transport, and water). The
medium-term fiscal framework (as portrayed in Table 6 and in the accompanying debt sustainability
analysis) contains preliminary estimates of this path. The authorities recognize that the process will
need to be properly planned and timed as cost overruns, poor governance, or lack of complementary
infrastructure (e.g., roads) could significantly weaken the effectiveness of the investments. In order to
ensure the targeting of non-oil balance for stabilization and intergenerational savings, and given
finite oil reserves, the non-oil domestic current fiscal balance would be an appropriate medium-term
fiscal anchor.28 A clear commitment to development, together with technical assistance and donor
involvement will be needed to deliver visible results in these areas.

D. Engaging Donors and the Private Sector
27.
Steps to enable support through country systems will be important. Over time, the
authorities will need to improve service delivery and build legitimacy in the state. At present, donors
are focusing on humanitarian assistance and have been encouraging the authorities to bring the
conflict to an end, a precondition for increasing development assistance.29 At the same time, no aid
would be channeled through the budget unless there are improvements in fiscal management.
Therefore, a partnership between the government and donors under which the former undertakes
key reforms to improve transparency and accountability in budget execution and expenditure
management will facilitate the process, even if the actual service delivery has to be temporarily
subcontracted because of capacity constraints.
28.
In the medium-term, private sector investment will also be essential to sustain growth
and diversify the economy. In this regard, the staff noted that a stable political environment,
investment in basic infrastructure, and the implementation of the economic and governance reforms
described above will go a long way to increase competitiveness and attract investment, thus
fostering economic diversification over time. In this process, improvements in the regulatory
framework and attention to financial sector development will be important.30

27

Before the conflict broke out, the transport and the energy infrastructure were already seriously deficient. Less than
2 percent of the primary road network was paved and less than a third of the unpaved roads were in good condition.
Power generation and transmission networks were lacking, serving a mere 1 percent of the population.

South Sudan’s financial sector is very small and undeveloped, a cash-based economy with negligible levels of
intermediation and private sector credit. Over time, measures to foster financial development should become a
priority. For a description of the financial system and related issues, see Appendix 2.

CAPACITY BUILDING AND DATA ISSUES
29.
The IMF provides capacity-building to South Sudan under a five-year program. The
program was launched in November 2012 to complement efforts by other donors and providers to
build capacity in economic areas and statistics. The program focuses on building economic
institutions and developing skills through selective technical assistance and training on the
macroeconomic framework, central banking, foreign reserves management, monetary and foreign
exchange operations, banking supervision, public financial management, non-oil taxation, and
macroeconomic statistics (Box 3). The program was interrupted in December 2013 as a result of the
conflict and resumed in September 2014.
30.
Data shortcomings complicate economic analysis and policymaking. Price, exchange
rate, and monetary data are generally reliable and a country page has been introduced in the
November 2013 issue of the International Financial Statistics (although data for the central bank has
a few gaps and further improvements in accounting and controls are needed). At the same time,
there is an urgency to produce and publish comprehensive oil sector and fiscal data (the authorities
expressed their intention to begin regular publication of quarterly budget execution reports and oil
data). Lastly, national accounts lack source data, especially on non-oil activities, and balance of
payments data are rudimentary (see accompanying Informational Annex).
Box 3. Capacity Building in South Sudan
Background. Capacity building is a key component of the technical assistance South Sudan receives from
the international community. Since 2006, South Sudan has received substantial technical assistance from
Norway, the United States’ Agency for International Development, the United Kingdom’s Department for
International Development, the World Bank, and the African Development Bank on petroleum issues,
statistics, macroeconomic analysis, public financial management, and basic central bank functions. Since
2012, as IMF assistance was requested, the Fund coordinated support with the authorities and other
providers to ensure complementary support in selected areas.
IMF support. The Trust Fund has an initial budget of US$10.2 million and is supported by the European
Union, the United Kingdom, and Norway. It is guided by a Steering Committee comprising the authorities,
donors, and IMF staff and operates under a results-based management framework.
Goals. The main goals of the program are: (i) develop an integrated macroeconomic framework; (ii) set up a
fully functional central bank; (iii) modernize tax and customs administration; (iv) strengthen oil revenue
management; and (v) build capacity for the production of basic macroeconomic data. About 50 percent of
the assistance comprises monetary and central banking issues, with the rest applied to the other areas.
Delivery. IMF support is delivered through short-term and long-term advisors, headquarters’ missions, and
training depending on periodic assessments of needs. There are currently 4 long-term advisors in the field
(central bank accounting, banking supervision, monetary operations, and monetary statistics), and four more
could be added in 2015 (macroeconomic framework, oil revenue management, foreign reserves
management, and central bank organization) depending on the security situation and the extent of
engagement by the authorities. Missions cover public financial management, non-oil revenue
administration, anti-money-laundering, national accounts, and fiscal and balance of payments statistics.
Since the inception of the program, most technical assistance included training.

STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
South Sudan is a fragile state facing huge challenges. Social and human development
indicators are below sub-Saharan African averages, the economy is underdeveloped, institutions are
nascent and governance is weak, road and energy infrastructures are lacking, and a legacy of internal
conflicts and tensions with Sudan are sources of fragility. The recent civil conflict has further
complicated or even reversed initial steps on institution building and development.
32.
Some progress has been made since 2011. Three years after independence, the authorities
have made some progress with legislation to set up institutions and rules for sovereign economic
policy making, including the Petroleum Law, the Petroleum Revenue Management Act, the Public
Financial Management and Accounting Law, and the Public Procurement Act. And on
macroeconomic management, the decision to control fiscal spending and monetary growth after the
oil shutdown and subsequent financial prudence prevented an inflation-depreciation spiral that
could have led to the demise of the local currency and a far more severe economic crisis.
33.
However, critical vulnerabilities that threaten economic stability and development
need to be urgently addressed. The foreign exchange market is distorted, reserves buffers are
critically low, the fiscal deficit is growing, social and infrastructure spending is inadequate,
governance problems abound, and public financial management (especially oil revenue
management) needs to change radically.
34.
In the near term, political inclusion and peace are necessary but insufficient to address
other important causes of South Sudan’s fragility. Beyond the importance of an inclusive political
settlement, there is an urgent need for commitment and focus on nation building and on priority
measures to help build stability and the legitimacy of the state:


Fiscal management needs to be improved. The budget process suffered a blow in early 2014
as spending allocation decisions prioritized security spending and bypassed budgetary
procedures. Recent steps to reverse that process are welcomed, together with plans to enforce
monthly budget allocations and prevent extra-budgetary spending and domestic arrears. At the
same time, there is a need to enact the PRMA and to accelerate the passage of the Public
Procurement Act, begin preparing an inventory of valid domestic arrears and a plan to pay
claims, and proceed to set up a single treasury account. The staff also urges the authorities to
shift the composition of spending towards social and infrastructure outlays in preparation for the
FY15/16 budget.



Exchange rate reform is critical. The exchange rate is the most important price in an economy,
and multiple exchange rates and restrictions lead to costly distortions. Exchange rate reform will
improve public finances and the availability of foreign exchange, reduce corruption and rentseeking behavior, contribute to financial development, and improve price signals and the
environment for non-oil activities. The authorities should move forward with measures to unify
the exchange rate and adopt a market-based allocation system.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF SOUTH SUDAN



Increasing transparency and accountability in oil, fiscal, and central bank operations are
also a priority. Steps in this direction include the timely publication of budget execution reports;
the publication of comprehensive data on oil production, sales, and costs; the publication of data
on foreign debt commitments, and the implementation of recommendations from the 2012 audit
of the central bank as well as the initiation of an audit for 2013.

35.
Further reforms will also be needed in the medium-term. The focus will need to be on
implementing the petroleum and public financial management legislation and on a well-planned
disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration program. Regarding the PRMA, consideration may
need to be given to outsourcing some key functions such as those of investment and management
of the petroleum revenue savings funds. These tasks will require cooperation with the international
community as well as continued technical assistance.
36.
Staff considers that there is a moderate risk of debt distress. South Sudan’s external debt
ratios are presently very low, there are no external arrears, and the baseline projects a moderate
amount of external debt, yielding debt ratios that are below their respective benchmarks. However,
several risks linked to the country’s fragility and its heavy dependence on oil revenues pose serious
vulnerabilities which, if materialized, would lead to a higher risk of debt distress.
37.
South Sudan’s development will hinge on leadership and political will. The road to build
resilience and ultimately exit fragility will be challenging. Above all, it will require political
commitment and determination to put the welfare and future of the country over that of vested
interests and proceed with much needed reforms. This, in turn, will build the legitimacy of the state,
facilitate support from multilateral institutions, bilateral partners, and the private sector, and promote
equitable development.
38.
The staff encourages the authorities to remove the exchange restrictions and multiple
currency practices under the transitional arrangements of Article XIV (as described in the
Informational Annex) as soon as conditions permit. The staff recommends the approval until March
2015 of the multiple currency practice subject to Fund’s jurisdiction under Article VIII as the
conditions required for the approval under Decision No. 1034-(60/27) are met. The authorities
committed to remove this multiple currency practice by March 2015.
39.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
consultation cycle.

Appendix II. Financial Sector Issues
South Sudan’s financial sector is small and undeveloped. The system grew a bit after independence, but
has stalled in recent months as a result of increasing economic tensions and the conflict. The financial
system seems well capitalized but the number of banks and exchange houses is excessive compared to
its size. The priorities are monitoring liquidity conditions, developing monetary instruments, enforcing
criteria for licensing new banks, strengthening supervision, establishing a credit bureau, and ensuring
that property rights get established.

A. Financial Intermediation
1.
The level of monetization is very small. The economy is cash-based, with limited use of
demand deposits and almost no term deposits. The ratio of M2-to-GDP is at about 15 percent, well
below the sub-Saharan Africa average of 36 percent. Banking sector assets are equivalent to just 18.4
percent of GDP.
2.
Intermediation expanded a bit since independence, but it has recently stagnated. Bank
assets and deposits grew at about 16 percent per year until 2014, but there has been little growth
this year. At the same time, claims on the private sector expanded from a meager base since 2011,
but has stagnated this year (Figure 1). Banks remain highly liquid—liquid asset ratios average about
70 percent—due to their reluctance to lend. The main sources of bank revenue are trade financing,
foreign exchange transactions, and interest from a limited stock of government securities.
3.
Banks’ balance sheets are not dollarized, but many payments and most contracts are
conducted in foreign currency (e.g. hotels, house rentals and purchases). Foreign exchange
restrictions, multiple currency practices, and uncertainty have contributed to the prevalence of
dollar-denominated transactions.

B. The Banking System
4.
The number of financial institutions is excessive compared to the size of the financial
sector. There are 28 licensed banks, out of which 7 are majority foreign-owned. In addition, there are
79 licensed foreign exchange bureaus, 12 microfinance institutions, and ten insurance companies.
Most foreign owned banks tend to be subsidiaries of reputable banks in their home countries and
provide some banking products and services, the plethora of local banks and exchange houses cater
exclusively to the foreign exchange market.
5.

The banking sector is small and concentrated.



Deposits and credit have grown from a low base but remain small in proportion to GDP (Figure
1). Deposits are short term as well as loans, thereby with no maturity mismatch.



Credit to the private sector is negligible at 10 percent of deposits. Despite a rise in credit to the
private sector between 2011 and 2013, it has since tapered off due to the recent uncertainty and
lower non-oil economic activity.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

31

REPUBLIC OF SOUTH SUDAN



Generous licensing of new banks and foreign exchange houses pose risks, including of money
laundering and illicit transactions, not least because of limited capacity to supervise them. The
staff noted the importance of applying strict regulatory procedures on new licenses.

6.
The availability of collateral is another concern. Land titles are not available and property
rights not established. Banks are reluctant to lend against leased land because if the land is leased to
an investor, there is no clarity about asset ownership and assets cannot be ceased for foreclosure
because the land owner (who is not typically the borrower) is the ultimate owner of the asset. This
stifles economic activity and banking intermediation, as entrepreneurs and businesses have to either
postpone capital purchases or finance them slowly out of their own savings.

C. Supervision
7.
There is a need to build capacity on banking supervision. Risk-based supervision requires
risk analysis and supervisors’ capacity needs to be enhanced to allow for the implementation of Basel
I requirements. The mandated capital adequacy ratio requires strict implementation among all banks
along with the continuous enforcement of the Central Bank Law.
8.
Data quality should also be improved through supervision and training. The quality of
NPL data may not be robust, and the capacity to assess and manage such data needs to be built. The
training of qualified staff accompanied by the implementation of IT systems will be a crucial step
towards quality enhancement. And while data obtained through off-site supervision forms a good
basis for monitoring banking sector risks, on-site inspections are even more important in assessing
whether banks actually comply with prudential norms and regulations.

D. Financial Soundness Indicators
9.
Banks’ profitability seems to have declined recently, but they are highly liquid and
appear to be reasonably capitalized. Profits seem to have fallen in the past year—the return on
assets ratio fell to its 2011 level, and the return on equity has declined by almost 35 percent since
June 2013 (see Table 1). Most of the decline is due to curtailed non-interest income, as the Bank of
South Sudan has limited the allocation of foreign exchange to commercial banks significantly. At the
same time, the consolidated capital position of the banking system has shown a positive trend since
independence. The regulatory Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio stood at 76.2 percent by
end-June 2014 —due to low credit exposure—while the total capital-to-assets ratio was 15.6 percent.
Lastly, the ratio of gross non-performing loans (NPLs) to total loans is low at 5.5 percent. The ratio
has been declining as banks intensified efforts to recover loans directly from debtors rather than
going through the judicial system.

Safeguards assessments
The authorities are undertaking measures to strengthen central bank safeguards based on the 2012
roadmap provided by staff to facilitate completion of a safeguards assessment. The Bank of South
Sudan (BSS) needs to intensify efforts to improve its governance, the management of foreign
exchange, its internal audit function, currency and banking operations, and its financial reporting. An
effective oversight by senior management is also needed to ensure that prompt remedial actions are
undertaken in response to the 2012 external audit findings as well as on the implementation of
provisions of the Petroleum Revenue Management Act that concern the central bank. Furthermore,
a reputable audit firm should be appointed to audit the 2013 BSS financial statements.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Exchange rate arrangement
South Sudan introduced its currency (the South Sudanese Pound) upon independence in July 2011.
In September 2011, the Bank of South Sudan (BSS) pegged the exchange rate at 2.95 SSP per U.S.
dollar. The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg against the U.S. dollar.
Rationing of foreign exchange since September 2011 has led to a parallel market where the
exchange rate trades at a premium compared to the official rate.
South Sudan maintains a number of exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices (MCPs)
under the transitional arrangements of Article XIV. The exchange restrictions under Article XIV arise
from (i) limiting the availability of foreign exchange through the rationing and further earmarking of
foreign exchange by the central bank, (ii) imposing absolute ceilings on the availability of foreign
exchange for certain invisible transactions (travel, remittances for living expenses of students and
families residing abroad, transfers of salaries by foreign workers), (iii) the extra burden caused by
channeling foreign exchange transactions to the parallel market, and (iv) requiring a tax clearance
certificate for access to foreign exchange for priority imports. The MCPs maintained under Article
XIV arise from (i) the spread of more than 2 percent between the official exchange rate (buying and
selling exchange rates of the central bank) and the exchange rate at which commercial banks sell
foreign currency within the limits set by the central bank, and (ii) the spread of more than 2 percent
between the parallel market exchange rate on the one hand and that of the official exchange rate
and the exchange rate in the formal commercial market on the other hand. In addition to the
measures maintained under Article XIV, South Sudan maintains one MCP subject to the Fund’s
jurisdiction under Article VIII. The MCP arises from the exchange rate guarantee arrangements
maintained by the BSS with one commercial bank. This arrangement was introduced after South
Sudan joined the Fund and therefore, is not covered under transitional arrangements of Article XIV.
The arrangement supports the system of foreign exchange allocations to priority imports.

Article IV consultation
The next Article IV consultation will be held in accordance with the 2010 decision on consultation
cycles.

WORLD BANK OPERATIONS
Date of Latest Interim Strategy Note (ISN): February 28, 2013 (Joint IDA and IFC ISN, covering the
period FY13-FY14). An update to the World Bank Board was provided in March 2014.
The Bank’s Interim Strategy for South Sudan supports the Government development agenda to help
the country head out of fragility to stability. The Bank’s program of activities pursue two
complementary objectives of: (i) improving economic management and governance for effective
local service delivery; and (ii) expanding productive employment opportunities. The recent political
and security crises, which erupted in Juba on December 15, 2013 and later engulfed six of the ten
states in South Sudan, prompted the Bank, together with South Sudan’s other Development
Partners, to evaluate on how best to respond. As a result, the World Bank Group formulated the
following principles for engagement – which were discussed at the Bank’s Board in March 2014:
(i) protecting core functions of government; (ii) protecting the vulnerable by supporting livelihoods
and ensuring the delivery of basic services: (iii) investing in knowledge; and (iv) protecting
development gains.
A systematic Country Diagnostic is under preparation and the Country Partnership Framework is
scheduled for discussion in FY16.
Ongoing Operations (as of October 31, 2014)
The current World Bank-approved projects comprise:
(i)

Three investment projects funded from the South Sudan Transitional Trust Fund which
attempt to strike a balance between delivery of quick impact and building institutional
capability. The South Sudan Rural Roads Project (US$38 million) is focusing on labor-based
upgrading and maintenance of rural roads and building state and national capacity for rural
infrastructure management; the South Sudan Health Rapid Results Project (US$28 million)
supports GRSS finance performance-based contracts for delivery of high impact primary
health services in two remote states, while building the institutional capability of the Ministry
of Health with coordination of services, monitoring, and evaluation; and the Private Sector
Development Project (US$9 million) entails grants to micro-finance providers and promotes
entrepreneurship while strengthening the regularly framework and South Sudan’s Business
Forum.

(ii)

The Emergency Food Crisis Response Project (US$ 12.7 million), funded from the Global Food
Crisis Response Fund, provides assistance to South Sudan in mitigating the impacts of the
continuing food crisis;

(iii)

Five IDA supported projects including the Local Governance and Service Delivery Project
(US$50 million) which builds the capacity of local governments and communities on
planning, implementing and monitoring development activities; the Social Safety Net and
Skills Development Project (US$21 million), which has the objective of providing access to
income opportunities and temporary employment to vulnerable households as well as

establishing a sustainable social protection systems in South Sudan; the Statistical Capacity
Building Project(US$ 9 million) which helps the government carry out poverty surveys,
produce reliable GDP estimates, monitor progress on the millennium development goals
(MDGs), and build the foundation for an evidence-based decision making culture in South
Sudan; as well as two Additional Financings: the Health Rapid Results(US$35 million), and
the Emergency Food Crisis Response Project(US$ 9 million).
(iv)

The South Sudan Eastern Africa Regional intervention project (US$80 million in its first phase)
will contribute to the construction and maintenance of a core highway from the Kenya
border to Juba that could serve as a gateway to the central and north-western parts of
South Sudan. The project leverages regional IDA resources and potential financing partners,
including China, the African Development Bank, and possibly others. The operation will also
provide support for the ICT Sector.

(v)

The two IDF grant projects: Procurement Capacity Development Support (US$750,000K) and
Strengthening the Capacity of the Audit Chamber (US$ 299,144K) support capacity building in
the indicated organizations.

(vi)

The State-and Peace-Building Fund (SPF) grant aims to assist MoFEP with fiscal policy rules
that recognize South Sudan's dependence on oil revenues and assist the national Legislative
Assembly to carry out its oversight responsibilities as they pertain to oil revenues; it also
helps improve the capacity and efficiency of the Ministry of Petroleum, Mining and Industry
(MoPMI) to manage oil resources. The project has an initial allocation of US$3.03m.

Pipeline Operations FY 2014-2015
The Bank’s remaining plan for FY 2015 includes five investment interventions:
(i) the Institutional Development and Capacity-Building project (US$40 million) will continue to
deepen efforts and move toward a more medium to long-term approach to public sector
strengthening; (ii) the Energy Sector Technical Assistance Project (US$15 million) will strengthen the
capacity of the GRSS to facilitate the development of its energy sector planning capabilities,
electrical distribution efficiency, and off-grid electrification programs; (iii) the Agriculture
Development Project (US$50 million) will contribute to increasing crop production and productivity
of participating households in selected project areas and laying the foundation of the recovery of
the sector; iv) additional financing to the South Sudan Rural Roads Project (US$50 million) will allow
scaling up of project activities in selected rural roads; and (v) the Regional Communications
Infrastructure Program (US$ 30 million) which is expected to be presented to the Bank’s Board in
FY16 will support efforts to lower prices for international capacity and extend the geographic reach
of broadband networks.
An extensive analytical work and technical assistance is complementing the Bank’s lending activities.

AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK OPERATIONS
Introduction
The African Development Bank Group’s first strategy for South Sudan is articulated in the Interim
Country Strategy Paper (I-CSP) 2012-2014 approved by the Boards of Directors in October 2012. The
I-CSP is aligned with the South Sudan Development Plan (SSDP) 2011-2013, which is now extended
to 2016. The I-CSP is articulated around one main pillar: “State Building through Capacity Building
and Infrastructural Development”. The particular emphasis is on creating the conditions for
promoting peace, stability and state building, through assisting the country in human and
institutional capacity building in public financial management and aid coordination and in
implementing infrastructural programs as well as quick-win infrastructure projects with rapid
impact on peace, security, livelihood and the investment climate. The I-CSP will be expiring at the
end of 2014, however, given the current political crisis in South Sudan, it became difficult to prepare
a new Country Strategy Paper and the Bank decided to update and extend the existing I-CSP to
2016 (this work is ongoing).
Ongoing Operations
As at 31 October, 2014, the Bank Group’s operations in South Sudan amounted to UA 29.01 million
covering four operations. The Public Utility project is the largest in value terms with a commitment
value of UA 16.96 million in an electricity project. The Transport sector project has a commitment
value of UA 6.93 million, while the multi-sector project has a commitment value of 5.18 million,
mainly focusing on human and institutional capacity development. The average project size is UA
6.5 million with an annual disbursement ratio in 2014 of 7 percent. As a result of the crisis, the new
projects approved in the last quarter of 2013 have been delayed in terms of signing the grant
agreements and the fulfilment of conditions prior to the first disbursement.
Pipeline Operations for FY 2015-2016.
For 2015-16, the Bank has allocated South Sudan UA 36.94 Million consisting of grants amounting
to UA 29.44 million (ADF Performances Based Allocation UA 7.5 Million and UA 21.94 Million
Transitional Support Facility) as well as of ADF loans amounting to UA 7.5 Million for four Projects.
The Projects are: the urban water supply and sanitation project, the Juba Power Distribution System
Rehabilitation and Expansion Phase II project, the Lobira-Kapoeta Road Project, and the Institutional
Support Project. All the four operations are expected to be considered for Board approval before
end ADF-13; i.e. by end-2016.
The plan for FY 2015 includes two projects, namely the Lobira-Kapoeta Road Project and the
Institutional support project with a total commitment of UA 27.44 million. Two other projects will be
considered in 2016 with the remaining commitments amounting to UA 9.5 million.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
The quality of economic data suffers from several shortcomings. With the exception of consumer prices,
monetary, and exchange rate data, other macroeconomic data have serious weaknesses in terms of quality,
periodicity, and timeliness. Some progress with data quality and compilation was made between 2011 and
2013, but it was partly reversed in 2014 owing to displacement of civilians, the exile of local statisticians, and
the interruption of technical assistance.
Real sector



Price indices. A monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) covering Juba, Wau, and Malakal is compiled (data for
Malakal is not available in 2014 because of the conflict), based on the 2009-10 Household Budget Survey.
To ensure appropriate weights are used, a new household survey will need to be conducted when peace
and security are established. Import price indices are not available and will require substantial investment
in source data development (particularly at customs). Monthly CPI figures are available on the National
Bureau of Statistics (NBS) website.



GDP/GNP/National Income. The NBS compiles and publishes GDP at current and constant (2009) prices
from the expenditure side. However, the figures are quite weak owing to the absence of source data on
most variables. Preliminary estimates on income (mainly profits to direct investors in the oil sector) allows
for the estimation of GNI. Work on source data and on the production-based GDP estimates is a priority
which will require, inter-alia, an agriculture survey.

Fiscal sector



Revenue, expenditure, balance and composition of financing. Cash revenue and expenditure data (using
both an economic and functional classification) are available for the central government, but the data are
aggregated, are not disseminated, and are not in line with GFSM 2011 classification standards. Data for
local governments and states are virtually nonexistent.

Monetary sector



Foreign reserves. Data on central bank holdings of foreign exchange are available from the central bank.



Exchange rates. Data on the bid and ask exchange rates vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar applied by the central
bank, and on the exchange rate prevailing in the parallel market, are available from the central bank.



Monetary statistics for commercial banks. A consolidated balance sheet and a survey for commercial banks
are compiled on a monthly basis by the central bank.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 15

REPUBLIC OF SOUTH SUDAN

Monetary sector (continued)



Monetary data. The balance sheet of the central bank, including reserve money and international reserve
assets and liability of the monetary authorities is available on a monthly basis from the central bank. The
BSS has reconciled most of its foreign currency accounts and manual records and has begun transmitting
its monthly survey to the IMF. The BSS compiles and reports the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs) 1SR for
central bank based on provisional data for BSS, 2SR for the other depository corporations, 5SR for
monetary aggregates, 6SR for interest rate, and Form 01R for exchange rate to the IMF’s Statistics
Department.3 As a result, a country page for South Sudan has been introduced in the November 2013
issue of the IMF’s International Financial Statistics.



Interest rates. Data on interest rates on deposits and lending are available from a few commercial banks.

External sector



Balance of payments. Data on external sector statistics are scant. As the agency responsible for compiling
external sector statistics, the BSS has begun collecting source data. For estimating GDP by expenditure, the
NBS compiles components of the current account, but the quality of the data is very weak owing to limited
capacity and lack of source data, notably on imports of goods and services. There are reliable estimates for
oil exports based on volume and price data, as well as data on commercial banks’ foreign assets and
liabilities and on banks’ reserve assets. Partial data from official sources on income and current transfers
are occasionally available. Data on cross-border transactions through the banking system are collected by
the BSS’ international transactions reporting system, but cross-border transactions are also conducted
through nonbank channels. International investment position statistics are not compiled, and data on
direct investment flows and positions are virtually nonexistent.



Gross external debt. At the time of its secession from Sudan, South Sudan had no official external debt.
Some external public debt has been accumulated since end-2012 and information about terms and
amounts has been shared with Fund staff. However, these data are not published and public or private
debt statistics are not available.

Data Standards and Quality



South Sudan does not yet subscribe to the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS).

Standardized Report Forms (SRFs) for reporting monetary data to the IMF are numbered 1 through 6. See

REPUBLIC OF SOUTH SUDAN
STAFF REPORT FOR 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION—DEBT
SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

Approved by Roger Nord and Ranil
Salgado (IMF) and John Panzer (IDA)

Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary
Fund and the International Development Association

South Sudan is at moderate risk of external debt distress.1 Based on available data, the external
debt stock at present is modest, and the baseline suggests a sustainable debt profile over the next
20 years. The evolution of public debt mirrors that of the public external debt as only a small
amount of domestic borrowing is projected. At the same time, the high share of short term debt
heightens rollover risks. Alternative scenarios also point to serious vulnerabilities linked to the
risk of political and regional instability, protracted governance problems, lack of economic and
other critical reforms, and shocks to oil production. If unresolved, these issues could result in
rapid debt accumulation and a downgrade of the risk rating. These risks highlight the
importance of peace, prudent policies, and a reform program focused on a clean and
accountable government.

1

The risk rating is assessed using Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries (LIC DSF). The DSA
presented in this document is based on a unified 5 percent discount rate. South Sudan has a “weak” policy
performance based on the 2013 CPIA rating (the CPIA score is 2.10). The thresholds, which apply to external
public and publicly-guaranteed debt, are: 30 percent for the present value (PV) of external debt-to-GDP ratio,
100 percent for the PV of external debt-to-exports ratio, 200 percent for the PV of external debt-to-revenue
ratio, 15 percent for the PV of external debt service-to-exports ratio, and 18 percent for the debt service-torevenue ratio.

See “Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Framework for LowIncome Countries”

REPUBLIC OF SOUTH SUDAN

BACKGROUND
1.
While South Sudan accumulated some debt since 2011, public debt ratios are still at very low
levels. When it emerged as an independent state in July 2011, the Republic of South Sudan had no
domestic or foreign debt or arrears. However, a 15-month oil production shutdown between January 2012
and April 2013 and the civil conflict that erupted in December 2013 reduced fiscal revenues and depleted
previously accumulated foreign exchange reserves, forcing the authorities to control spending and incur
domestic and foreign debt. As a result, by June 2014, the authorities reported that the stock of public debt2
amounted to about US$953 million or 6.4 percent of GDP; this amount includes short-term domestic debt
equivalent to US$407 million (measured at the official exchange rate).3,4
2.
Most of the public external debt is of short-term nature and nonconcessional. In 2012-13, the
authorities indicated that they arranged for a US$1 billion short-term oil-guaranteed borrowing facility
through the oil companies operating in South Sudan. As of June 2014, the outstanding amount of debt
from this facility stood at US$328 million.5 In addition, a small amount of short-term debt was contracted for
purchases of arms (US$59 million in the first half of 2014). Of the remaining external debt, US$158 million
was a long-term nonconcessional loan for the construction of the Juba airport.6

ASSUMPTIONS
3.
The baseline scenario assumes that the security situation improves gradually over the
coming years and that oil production and the economy begin to recover.7 Over the medium term, it is
assumed that fiscal and monetary policies will be prudent, that the exchange rate is unified at a sustainable
level, and that inflation remains at single-digits. At the same time, the government is expected to embark on
a well-prioritized reform program, focused on shifting the composition of spending towards social and
infrastructure spending, implementing a disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration program, and
fostering transparency and accountability in the management of public resources.8 Public investment is
2

Public debt refers to debt of the central government.

3

In 2012, the authorities sold SSP1 billion of short-term securities to domestic banks and borrowed SSP0.1 billion
from another commercial bank. As this debt has been rolled over, the stock as of mid-2014 amounted to SSP1.2
billion.
4

As a result of the oil shutdown and subsequent fiscal stress, cumulative borrowing from the central bank amounted
to SSP4 billion (8.8 percent of GDP). Such borrowing was undertaken on an exceptional basis as it is not permitted
under the central bank law. In addition, as the central bank was not adequately capitalized following independence,
the government issued bonds to the central bank of which the outstanding amount as of June 30 was SSP2 billion.
This debt is not counted as part of the public debt because it consists of intra-public sector obligations.
5

The authorities plan for additional borrowing of up to US$1 billion in the fiscal year that began in July 2014.

6

The long-term loan carries an interest rate of 2 percent, has a maturity of 20 years, and a grace period of 5 years.

7

Estimates and projections for the DSA are based on calendar year calculations. The figures are compatible with the
fiscal-year data presented in the staff report on the 2014 Article IV consultation.
8

Under the baseline, the authorities are expected to proceed with plans to strengthen public financial management
(including oil revenue management), primarily through improving budget execution and preventing domestic arrears,

assumed to be moderately scaled up over time, with initial focus on transport and energy infrastructure and
the infrastructure damaged by the conflict.9 This, together with the projected resumption of trade with
Sudan and, over time, the expansion of agriculture and mining activities, is expected to support average real
GDP growth of about 7 percent per year during the next 10 years (Box 1). The projections of public and
publicly guaranteed debt (PPG) are derived from these assumptions.
Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions: 2014-2034
Real sector: During the next 10 years, annual average real GDP growth is projected to be about 7 percent based on
the expected recovery of oil production and non-oil real GDP is assumed to grow at about 5 percent per year. Oil
output is projected to increase gradually to about 260
thousand barrels per day by 2017, but decline for 3-5
years after that as production rates fall in aging oil fields.
It is also assumed that investment in enhanced oil
recovery and new fields after 2020 pushes up production
to nearly 400 thousand barrels per day by 2026.
Thereafter, oil output is projected to fall to 140 thousand
barrels per day by 2034. Real non-oil GDP growth is
assumed to recover slowly from its current low base and

If properly managed, a scaling up of public investment could lead to a meaningful improvement in real incomes in
the next two decades. The impact of the scaling up will depend on key structural conditions, such as absorptive
capacity, the prudent management of mineral revenue, and the extent of improvements in the business environment.
In any case, the process should be timed appropriately and the projects chosen according to their viability and
expected return. This, in turn, will require the use of cost-benefit analysis techniques and a well implemented public
investment program.

Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions: 2014-2034 (concluded)
percent of GPD in the 2030s. About one quarter of oil revenue is expected to be saved for oil stabilization and for
future investments, primarily in years in which oil revenues outpace projected spending. Expenditure as a share of
GDP is projected to rise somewhat in the medium term and later decline towards 20 percent of GDP in the long run.
The profile for expenditure in the next decade mimics a scaling up of public investment that raises the share of public
spending to GDP, together with a demobilization and civil service reform program that begins to push the share
down by the early 2020s. Capital expenditures are projected to increase from 3 percent of GDP at present to about
7 percent of GDP by 2020 before declining toward 5 percent of GDP in the outer years of the projection period.
Based on these trends, the overall fiscal balance (including grants) records a small deficit over the medium term
(except in a few years when there is a surplus), before converging to a small surplus by the late 2020s.
External sector: Exports of goods and services as a share of GDP are projected to increase in the medium term,
supported by growth in both the oil and the non-oil sectors, and later decline as oil production begins to fade in the
late 2020s. The share of imports of goods and services to GDP follows an inverted U-shape profile. It is expected to
increase in the medium term because of the scaling up of public (and later private) investment but decrease after the
mid-2020s as the non-oil economy develops and import substitution begins to take hold. Grants are projected to
remain at around 6 percent of GDP in the next few years and decline towards 3 percent by the end of the forecast
period.

4.
Medium to long-term external borrowing assumptions include a mix of concessional and
nonconcessional loans. Given the projected fiscal situation and large infrastructure needs, the authorities
are likely to contract some external debt in the medium-term.10 A large part of this debt will likely be
nonconcessional (especially in the next 3 years), although the authorities would like to approach multilateral
and bilateral partners for concessional resources at some point. These and the above macroeconomic
assumptions are modeled in the baseline, yielding external public sector borrowing requirements of about
US$5 billion in the next 10 years. In the long term, higher oil and non-oil revenues are expected to bring
external borrowing down to near zero.11, 12

10

The authorities are discussing with China loans for infrastructure projects to be implemented during the next 10
years. An initial framework agreement comprising oil-guaranteed loans of US$1 billion is being finalized; the bulk of
this funding will be for a road project. In addition, the authorities, together with the Kenyan authorities, plan to
embark on a US$1.3 billion project for a highway between Juba and Eldoret in Kenya, an extension of fiber optics
connection to Juba, and trade facilitation. The highway will allow speedier connection between South Sudan and the
Mombasa port in Kenya. Of the US$1.3 billion, about US$530 million is estimated to correspond to the portion of the
highway that will go through Kenya. The project is expected to be financed by the World Bank, China’s EXIM bank, the
African Development Bank, and, possibly, other lenders and is expected to extend until 2025. The projected amounts
of borrowing for these projects are implicitly embedded within the baseline assumptions of the DSA.

11

Similar to recent borrowing for infrastructure, we assume that the bulk of the borrowing for building the basic
infrastructure between 2015 and 2022 would be at a 4.5 percent interest rate, 15 year maturity, and 5 year grace
period, implying that the grant element could fall substantially in the medium term (Figure 1). As oil production
increases over time and the fiscal position improves, borrowing requirements, especially at nonconcessional rates is

While the baseline scenario is plausible, recent instability and the risks ahead could lead to
worse outcomes. These risks involve lack of political inclusiveness, failure to embark on economic reforms,
unresolved territorial issues with Sudan and the expiration of the oil sharing agreement in 2016, and
protracted rent seeking behavior and corruption (see alternative scenarios below for a simulation of some
extreme risks). These risks, which would prolong fragility, underscore the importance of a commitment to
internal peace, economic reforms, good relations with Sudan, and close cooperation with the international
community.13

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
6.
Under the baseline, external debt dynamics appear to be favorable given the country’s
abundant oil and mining resources. All baseline debt indicators are below their threshold values. Debt
ratios change only slightly over the medium term reflecting the repayment of short term loans and some
borrowing projected for infrastructure projects. The debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to peak at around 20
percent in 2021 and decline thereafter. The present value (PV) of external debt-to-exports is projected to
reach about 50 percent by 2022 and then decline to about 7 percent. Lastly, the PV of the debt-to-revenue
ratio is also manageable and expected to fall below 4 percent by 2034.14
7.
However, a disruption to oil production and/or severe political instability, insecurity, and
insufficient reforms, could quickly destabilize debt ratios. The DSA simulates two alternative customized
scenarios to illustrate these risks. The scenarios are extreme in that their likelihood is rather lower than other,
more moderate scenarios of recurrent political turmoil and mild reforms or a short interruption of oil
production; thus the simulations are intended to just illustrate some extreme, yet still possible risks. They
also highlight the need to prevent conflict and foster political inclusion and equitable development.
8.
The first scenario illustrates the effects of a shock to oil production similar to the shutdown
experienced in 2012. The simulation shows that, under this scenario, the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio would
exceed the 30 percent threshold for a few years (see Figure 1) before returning to normal later in the
decade, while other debt ratios will also breach their respective thresholds.15

assumed to fall to negligible levels from 2023 (to about US$30 million a year). The lower nonconcessional borrowing
needs raises the average grant element for new borrowing in the long run.
12

This DSA excludes remittances given their insignificance in the country’s economy (net remittances were 1 percent
of GDP in 2011).
13

See “Republic of South Sudan: Staff Report for 2014 Article IV Consultations”.

14

The path of external debt residuals follows that of the non-interest current account balance and net FDI inflows
which in turn are driven mostly by oil projections. Because oil exports and FDI flows in the DSA template do not
reflect net debt creating flows in the BOP, the external debt residuals are higher than normal in the medium to longterm.
15

Both scenarios assume that the authorities are able to borrow to cover their fiscal and balance of payments gaps.
We assume that the additional borrowing under the alternative scenarios is at 4.5 percent interest, 15 years maturity
with grace period of 5 years. However, it must be noted that heightened levels of country risk may lead to a situation
whereby most sources of financing may become unavailable. Such an extreme scenario would lead to much more
severe economic disruptions.

9.
Another extreme scenario in which political instability and insecurity continues unabated for
several years combined with sluggish reforms could lead to a progressive decline in real GDP per
capita and destabilize debt ratios. Under such scenario, the investments needed to prevent a decline in oil
production (and to start production in new fields) are assumed to be postponed until the late 2020s.16 The
results are summarized in Figure 1, which shows that all the debt ratios (PV of debt-to-GDP, PV debt-toexports, PV debt-to-revenue, debt service-to-exports and debt service-to-revenue) breach their respective
thresholds within a few years. Even as the situation is assumed to improve gradually by the early 2020s, debt
ratios remain elevated through the end of the projection period because of pressing fiscal and infrastructure
needs.
10.
Lack of resolution in Sudan’s debt could potentially lead to discussions with Sudan on the
allocation of its foreign debt. Under a cooperation agreement signed with Sudan in September 2012,
Sudan committed to assume all external debt of former Sudan subject to securing a “firm commitment” of
international creditors for debt relief (i.e. Sudan’s reaching the HIPC decision point) no later than two years
from the date of agreement (this was termed the “zero option”). Absent such commitment, the agreement
states that the two countries may discuss how to apportion the debt. Upon expiration of the two-year
window, the two countries agreed in November 2014 to interpret the zero option in a “flexible” manner and
extended the timing for debt relief until October 2016. In the meantime, the authorities indicated that South
Sudan remains committed to support Sudan’s efforts to obtain debt relief. Even if discussions were to be
held in the future on how to apportion Sudan’s debt, it is not possible to speculate at this point on what the
allocation could be. Given the above, this risk has not been quantified in the DSA.

PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
The evolution of public debt indicators mirrors that of the external debt. The DSA assumes that a
small portion of domestic public debt is generated in the long run as the result of the development of a
domestic treasury bill market, leading to a stock of public debt that is marginally larger than that of external
debt. In the medium-term, the increase in debt ratios in the DSA reflects the projected amount of
borrowing that will be needed to gradually scale up public investment and the asymmetry between such
profile and that of oil receipts which in turn leads to a moderate amount of external borrowing in the
baseline (Table 3 and Figure 2). As a result, under the baseline, the PV of public debt remains below the
30 percent benchmark implying that the public sector debt would also be sustainable.

CONCLUSION
11.
While the baseline scenario points to a sustainable path for South Sudan’s debt,
uncertainties about the path of oil revenue and the country’s fragility put the country at a moderate
risk of debt distress. Under the baseline scenario, debt trajectories are below their respective thresholds, as
16

The projection implies that oil production could fall from the current level of 160 thousand barrels per day to about
100 thousand barrels per day by the mid-2020s. In this situation, public debt rises to about US$6.3 billion by 2018 (all
debt thresholds are breached) and climbs further to US$14.6 billion by end-2024.

prudent policies and the implementation of key economic reforms would support a moderate amount of
external borrowing to fund investment projects. However, risks abound, and alternative scenarios with
protracted instability and/or disruptions in oil production can significantly increase the risk of debt distress.
Other dimensions of the country’s fragility include weak governance and institutions, which also elevate
risks to debt sustainability.
12.
The analysis highlights the preconditions for stability and debt sustainability in South Sudan.
These are political inclusion and peace, good relations with Sudan, prudent economic policies, fiscal
reforms, and a transparent and efficient management of public resources (especially oil and mining).

Table 4. Republic of South Sudan: Sensitivity Analysis for Key Indicators of Public Debt 2014-2034

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on the Republic of South Sudan
December 15, 2014
This statement contains information that has become available since the staff report was
circulated to the Executive Board. This information does not alter the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
1.
Foreign exchange reserves remain critically low and the exchange rate in the
parallel market has depreciated further. At end-November 2014, the net foreign assets of
the central bank amounted to US$340 million (less than 3-weeks of imports), compared to
US$379 million at end-September. Reflecting the difficult macroeconomic situation, the
exchange rate in the parallel market also depreciated, from SSP 5.3 per U.S. dollar in October
to SSP 5.8 per U.S. dollar at end-November.
2.
Financing the fiscal deficit remains challenging in light of the ongoing conflict
and low oil prices. While production remains subdued, staff estimates that if the most
recent oil prices persist for the remainder of the fiscal year, the average price for South
Sudanese oil could be about 5 U.S. dollars lower compared to the baseline in the staff report,
leading to a further worsening of the fiscal balance equivalent to 1.6 percentage points of
GDP (US$235 million).

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with South Sudan

On December, 15, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with South Sudan.
South Sudan is a fragile state with acute challenges. Since it became an independent state in
2011, institution building and development have been hindered by volatile relations with Sudan,
a 15-month shutdown of oil production, and more recently, a civil conflict. Although rich in
natural resources, the economy is centered on oil production and subsistence agriculture, with
almost all consumer goods being imported.
Economic performance has been mixed in recent years. Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
growth has displayed high volatility, the result of changes in oil and agricultural production.
Inflation rose in an initial period of economic instability in 2011-12 but was contained in 201314 thanks to fiscal and monetary restraint and lower food prices. However, serious challenges
remain, including distortions in the foreign exchange market and in budget execution, lower
international oil prices, and subdued oil production. As a result, financing the budget for 2014/15
is challenging and will likely require policy decisions given the otherwise potentially adverse
impact on economic stability and inflation.
The medium-term outlook could be promising, but there are serious risks. Assuming peace,
regional cooperation, and economic reforms, oil production could increase in coming years and
the potential for other mining and non-oil activities (especially agriculture and forestry) could be
unlocked, leading to strong GDP growth and allowing for investments in social sectors and the
public infrastructure. However, there are several risks on the horizon, including unresolved
political and security issues, continued governance problems, and insufficient progress on critical
economic reforms.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. In welcoming the completion of
the first Article IV consultation with South Sudan, Directors noted that the country faces
formidable near-term challenges from the ongoing civil war, volatile relations with Sudan, large
swings in oil production and prices, and weak institutions and governance. Against this
background, Directors underscored the urgent need for measures to address fiscal imbalances,
including exchange rate unification, and stressed the importance of peace and political inclusion
to set the basis for growth and development.
Directors agreed that reduced oil revenues and lack of room for public expenditure cuts call for
policy actions on a variety of fronts to close the financing gap in the fiscal accounts and restore
macroeconomic stability. They supported the authorities’ intentions to mobilize non-oil revenue,
and emphasized the importance of improving expenditure management and preventing domestic
arrears, primarily through the enforcement of monthly budget allocations, a strict control of
extra-budgetary expenditures, and steps to set up a single treasury account. Directors cautioned
against increased central-bank financing of the fiscal deficit, which would fuel inflation and
further weaken the local currency.
Directors underscored the need to unify the exchange rate and adopt a market-based system for
allocating foreign exchange. Exchange rate unification would significantly reduce the fiscal
imbalance, remove incentives for corruption, and improve price signals to favor private
investment and non-oil economic activities. An adjustment in the exchange rate peg to a realistic
level would also help stem foreign reserve losses. Directors urged the authorities to remove the
multiple currency practices and exchange restrictions as soon as possible.
Directors stressed the urgency of improving transparency and accountability in the management
of mineral resources, government expenditures, and central bank operations. They encouraged
the authorities to enact the Petroleum Revenue Management Act, and called for the
implementation of recommendations from the 2012 audit of the central bank and the wide
dissemination of oil, fiscal, and financial data.
Directors emphasized that strong and concerted policy efforts will be needed over the medium
term to foster economic development and build institutions. Priorities include restoring depleted
reserve buffers, reorienting public spending toward social sectors and infrastructure,
implementing public financial management legislation, and addressing the legacy of war. These
tasks will require strong leadership and cooperation from the international community, including
continued technical assistance.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.
