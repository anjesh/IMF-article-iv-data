ST. LUCIA
Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2008 Consultation with St. Lucia
Approved by Guy Meredith and Anthony R. Boote
July 10, 2008
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Recent developments. Following an acceleration in real GDP growth between 2001–06, activity
was flat in 2007, reflecting a hurricane-induced contraction in banana exports, and a downturn in
construction activity and tourist arrivals. Despite being underpinned by the regional currency
board arrangement, annual inflation reached close to 7 percent in 2007, due largely to food and
fuel price shocks and the ongoing depreciation of the U.S. dollar. The fiscal policy stance
tightened markedly in 2007/08, while public debt remained stable at about 70 percent of GDP.
Outlook and risks. Although near-term growth prospects are favorable, risks are tilted to the
downside. Given continuing pressure for higher social and capital spending, there is a risk that
current policies may adversely affect the sustainability of public debt. While St. Lucia’s domestic
credit markets remain largely unaffected by international financial turbulence, slower growth and
consumption in the U.S. and world economy, accompanied by high energy prices, may dampen
tourism and private capital inflows.
External competitiveness. The real effective exchange rate is in line with macroeconomic
fundamentals, yet maintaining competitiveness remains a challenge. The recent rise in the
external current account deficit reflects an adverse terms of trade shock and a downturn in tourist
arrivals, and is almost fully financed by nondebt-creating private capital inflows.
Main issues. Policy discussions focused on the key challenges facing St. Lucia:
● Broadening the bases of growth. The authorities and staff agreed on the required steps,
including efforts to revitalize tourism, improve the investment climate, and diversify exports.
● Debt sustainability and fiscal consolidation. To ensure fiscal and debt sustainability, staff
advocated fiscal adjustment to be achieved largely by greater prioritization of capital spending,
enhanced debt management, and a broadening of the tax base, including through enhanced passthrough of world energy prices. The authorities agreed with the need for fiscal consolidation and
better evaluation of public sector investment, but emphasized that their plan to boost tourismsector public infrastructure was the lynchpin of a strategy to attract large private capital flows
into tourism.
● Financial and external stability. Current account imbalances are projected to decline over the
medium term, and be smaller than the estimated equilibrium level. The authorities have
strengthened banking sector supervision, but need to bolster efforts to introduce a single
regulatory agency for nonbank financial institutions and close unregulated investment schemes.

I. BACKGROUND AND RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS 1
1.
St. Lucia is a small, open,
tourism-based economy that is
vulnerable to exogenous shocks.
Tourism accounts for over three-quarters
of exports, and the import content of both
consumption and foreign direct
investment is high. While the share of
value added from the traditionallydominant agriculture sector has declined
sharply in recent decades, crop exports
(particularly bananas) support the
incomes of much of the country’s large
rural population (Figure 1).

transport and half of local transport.

2.
St. Lucia’s macroeconomic performance has been mixed in recent years. While
real GDP growth averaged about 4 percent during 2003–06, it has slowed to 1¾ percent in
2007, reflecting contraction in hurricane-affected agriculture (mainly banana exports), and
slowdowns in construction activity and stayover tourist arrivals. 2 Inflation increased sharply
to 6.8 percent at end-December 2007 (Figure 2), due to higher imported fuel and food prices
and the ongoing depreciation of the U.S. dollar (to which the Eastern Caribbean (EC) dollar
is pegged). Unemployment has declined from 22 percent in 2003 to 14 percent in 2007.
3.
Progress has been made in reducing fiscal imbalances, yet public debt and debt
servicing payments continue to rise. The government achieved a primary surplus in
FY 2007/08 of 0.8 percent of GDP, reflecting an increase in current revenue and a marked
reduction in capital expenditures following the spike in Cricket World Cup-related spending.
The authorities explained that unexpected developments—mainly the lack of donor funding
and inadequate capacity to appraise investment projects—had complicated budgetary
execution in FY 2007/08. However, public debt increased to 70½ percent of GDP (due to
rising public enterprise debt), still the lowest in the ECCU (Figures 3 and 4). The approved
1

The Article IV discussions were held in Castries during June 5–18, 2008. The staff team comprised
Messrs. Cashin (Head), Nassar, and Ms. Sun (all WHD). The mission met with the Prime Minister (and
Minister of Finance), the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, the Permanent Secretary of the
Ministry of Economic Affairs, other senior government officials, opposition parliamentarians, representatives of
the financial and business sectors, as well as farmers, trade unions and civil society. Staff of the Eastern
Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) and Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) also participated. Mr. Charleton
(OED) joined for the final discussions.

2

St. Lucia was affected by the passage of Hurricane Dean in August 2007, which damaged the agriculture
sector and some public infrastructure, and by an earthquake in November 2007. The latter natural disaster
triggered a payment of US$0.5 million under the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF).

4
budget for FY 2008/09, if fully implemented, would widen fiscal imbalances through
increased capital spending, yet this is unlikely given implementation constraints (Box 1).
4.
The external current account deficit remained elevated in 2007, accompanied by
strong capital inflows. The large deficit (29 percent of GDP) was driven primarily by a
continued deterioration of the terms of trade and decline in tourist arrivals, and higher
imports related to hotel construction and energy demand (Box 2). The deficit continues to be
almost entirely financed by foreign direct investment, mainly in tourism-related construction.
Nonetheless, St. Lucia remains vulnerable to external shocks, given its dependence on
imported oil, volatile tourism receipts, exposure to natural disasters, and rising food and
energy prices.
5.
Indicators present a mixed picture of St. Lucia’s external competitiveness.
St. Lucia’s real effective exchange (REER) is at its lowest level in 20 years, reflecting the
depreciation of the U.S. dollar against major currencies. However, real wages have increased,
the terms of trade has deteriorated since 2000, and in recent years St. Lucia experienced a
decline in its share of stayover visitors to the Caribbean. Analysis undertaken by staff finds
that the REER was close to its estimated equilibrium level, suggesting that the exchange rate
regime, if supported by fiscal and wage policies, will remain competitive.
6.
Private sector credit grew substantially in 2007. Despite a softening in economic
activity, demand for credit by firms and households has continued to rise (Figure 5). As a
result, commercial banks have accelerated their drawdown of foreign assets to expand their
loan portfolio. The increase in demand for credit, combined with renewed targeting by
private sector banks of small- and medium-sized enterprises, has heightened competition,
triggering a narrowing of lending spreads.
7.
The health of the financial sector continues to strengthen. Provisioning, asset
quality and capital adequacy all improved in 2007 (Figure 6). Nonperforming loans (NPLs)
of local banks continue to decline, and are close to the ECCB’s prudential target of 5 percent.
However, the decline in the NPL ratio reflects in part the continued growth in bank lending,
which could engender future problem loans, especially in the event of any large
macroeconomic shock (such as a sustained downturn in tourist arrivals reflecting a slowing
world economy). Nonbank financial intermediaries remain under-regulated, despite holding
about one fifth of financial sector assets.
8.
St. Lucia has favorable social indicators, but poverty and crime remain
concerns. The country has near-universal adult literacy, strong health outcomes, and good
access to social services. However, unemployment has remained high, particularly among the
young and women. One fourth of the population lives in poverty, and crime is a growing
problem.

5
II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS 3
9.
Policy discussions focused on four issues: broadening the bases of economic
growth; enhancing fiscal consolidation and debt sustainability; maintaining financial sector
and external stability; and reducing other vulnerabilities. Policy discussions took place
against the backdrop of deteriorating prospects for global growth and continued high import
prices.
A. Broadening the Bases of Economic Growth
10.
Near-term growth prospects are favorable. Stayover tourist arrivals grew by about
9 percent during the first four months of 2008 and private investment should remain healthy,
reflecting the construction of several new upscale resorts. The staff forecasts growth of
2⅓ percent in 2008, as signs of accelerating activity are still tentative. Despite deteriorating
global prospects, high energy prices, and only modest recovery in agriculture, growth is
projected to rise further in 2009. The authorities were in broad agreement with this
assessment, and were particularly concerned about the impact of high oil prices, any sudden
unwinding of global external imbalances, and associated risks for tourism demand. They
were also apprehensive about the level and volatility of the U.S. dollar. Inflation is expected
to remain elevated, amid record high energy and food import prices.
11.
Medium-term growth will be determined by the rate of growth of potential
output. On current policies, staff projects output growth to increase to about 4½ percent by
2013. Additional hotel capacity, combined with vigorous marketing and more frequent airlift,
is expected to boost growth. This outlook does not foresee a prolonged period of adverse
headwinds from the current global economic downturn. The mission believes that there is a
need to build on the 2007 National Development Plan, by improving the investment climate
and fostering higher labor utilization, which would also ease the strain on public finances.
Additional measures that the government could take to enhance productivity and efficiency
include:

The consultation was complemented by the Executive Board discussion of the Staff Report for the 2007
Eastern Caribbean Currency Union Discussion on Common Policies of Member Countries, the report for which
covers common regional issues related to monetary and exchange rate issues and banking system supervision
(see IMF Country Report No. 08/94).

6
• Basing tourism development on a long-term plan that considers related policies and
needs for infrastructure and services. The authorities recognized that the ongoing expansion
in stayover capacity presents a number of challenges if it is to be utilized fully and yield a

wider economic return. These include the capacity to supply water, power, roads, skills
training, security, airlift, and other services. The authorities argued that the proposed public
investment projects were key to escaping from St. Lucia’s rising public debt and low-growth
dynamics, by promoting private sector investment as key engine of economic growth.
• Improving the investment climate. While St. Lucia continues to be ranked first among
Caribbean countries in the World Bank’s Doing Business Indicators, improvements in
several areas are needed, particularly cross-border trade, property registration, contract
enforcement, foreclosure laws, and the availability of credit information (Figure 7). The
mission supported the authorities’ plan to work closely with the business sector and USAID
in overcoming weaknesses in the investment climate.
• Developing regional trade in goods and services. The mission welcomed the authorities’
progress in implementing the Caribbean Single Market Economy (CSME) requirements and
in preparing for the OECS Economic Union. Staff recommended that the authorities enhance
regional cooperation in providing government services and rationalizing tax concessions, and
continue to support regional efforts to facilitate the movement of goods, labor and capital
across OECS and CARICOM countries. The mission also reviewed progress in the
implementation of St. Lucia’s 2006 National Export Strategy.
• Diversifying exports. The hurricane-affected downturn in banana exports in 2007 has
negative implications for employment creation, income levels, and the general standard of
living in the island’s rural communities. The mission welcomed the authorities’ intention to
develop a five-year strategic management plan, announced in the 2008/09 Budget, to
promote diversification in the agriculture sector. Staff agreed with the authorities that in the
medium term, the expansion in hotel room capacity and the upturn in tourist arrivals will
likely stimulate local demand for agricultural production.

7
• Strengthening underdeveloped social safety nets. In St. Lucia a series of social programs
has evolved over time in a piecemeal fashion, which is both expensive and inefficient in
targeting the needs of the most vulnerable. Poverty has increased in recent years, due to the
slowdown in economic activity and the downturn in banana exports. The mission noted that
the authorities plan to expand social safety nets through the introduction of a St. Lucian
version of the Chilean Puente program, promote the use of food stamps in local stores, and
raise the level of public assistance payments. Nonetheless, the mission stressed the need to
sharpen the focus and coherence of poverty reduction initiatives and ensure that they are
linked to the social development programs in the budget, consistent with overall
macroeconomic and fiscal objectives. The mission also welcomed the authorities’ plans to
develop a National Poverty Reduction Strategy, with a view to improving the coherence of
social protection programs.

revenues. On current policies, staff projections show a widening of the primary deficit into
the medium term, chiefly due to the government’s proposed acceleration in investment
spending. In this scenario, public debt would reach 73 percent of GDP by FY 2013/14.
Staff’s projections also show that even in an alternative scenario with higher growth, it is
necessary to take additional revenue and expenditure measures to bring public finances in
line with long-run debt sustainability (Annex I).
14.
The challenge is to contain the fiscal deficit while accommodating a modest
increase in social and capital spending. On the basis of the alternative scenario, the mission
recommended a primary surplus of

allow for higher social spending, while
reducing the deficit. Grants from the European Union and Taiwan, Province of China, are
expected to increase, yet disbursements are not expected to reach the level envisaged in the
budget. Under this alternative scenario and with annual GDP growth of about 5 percent, staff
projections show that debt could fall to below 60 percent of GDP by 2012, eight years earlier
than required under the ECCB Monetary Council’s benchmark (see Annex I). While the
authorities broadly supported the need for fiscal consolidation, they viewed increased nearterm capital spending as necessary to expand tourism infrastructure, attract FDI and private
investment, and continue the transformation of the economy away from agriculture toward
tourism-based services.
15.
Over the medium term, there is scope to raise revenues by broadening the tax
base. Major aspects include:
• Taxation of petroleum products. Staff welcomed the adjustment of retail prices of
petroleum products in early 2008 and the authorities’ commitment to pursue a flexible oil
pricing mechanism, as announced in the Budget Speech of April 2008. However, world oil
prices have since risen further and are projected to remain high over the medium term. At
present, retail prices of petroleum products are the lowest in the region and the effective tax
rate has declined dramatically. The mission recommended a flexible pricing mechanism, so
as to ensure that the revenue authorities garner the full amount of the legislated consumption
tax as world (and landed) petroleum prices change.

9
• Property taxation. Although the real estate sector continues to perform well, property tax
collections have remained flat. The mission urged the authorities to accelerate plans to move
to a market valuation-based property tax system (preferably during FY 2009/10) once the
required cadastral surveys are completed, with minimal exemptions permitted. Staff supports
the authorities’ intention to model the proposed enabling legislation on that of St. Kitts and
Nevis, which will facilitate harmonization of legislation in the region.
• Introduction of the VAT. The mission recommended that the authorities step up their
efforts to introduce a VAT in FY 2009/10, including by strengthening domestic tax and
customs operations, and continuing to seek relevant technical assistance from CARTAC and
the Fund. The authorities will soon establish the VAT Implementation Unit, and plan to seek
assistance from CARTAC and the Fund in drafting relevant legislation. Staff reiterated its
caution against having a large number of zero-rated and exempt products and services, as this
will weaken the VAT regime by increasing the administrative burden, eroding the tax base,
distorting incentives in the tax regime, and complicating compliance. In particular, the
mission underscored the need to resist pressures to exempt the tourism sector and to avoid
multiple VAT rates. The authorities were also encouraged to announce a specific date for
VAT implementation and begin to educate the public on the attributes of the VAT.
• Strengthening tax administration. Currently, taxpayer registration is undertaken on a
voluntary basis. The mission emphasized the need to strengthen the administrative capacity
to identify and register taxpayers, and to clean up the outdated register, which will also be
important for the introduction of the VAT. The mission also welcomed steps taken in both
the Customs and Inland Revenue Departments to strengthen the auditing process.
16.
Expenditures will need to be curtailed and management of public debt
enhanced:
• Prioritization of capital expenditure. The 2008/09 budget affirmed the government’s
commitment to undertake a large number of high-profile projects announced in the National
Development Plan of 2007. While the mission supports improvements in transportation and
tourism-related infrastructure, it is critical that infrastructure projects be prioritized and
properly phased. Staff welcomed the authorities’ commitment to introduce a formal public
sector investment program (PSIP) mechanism to ensure the effectiveness of capital
expenditures, which would involve the implementation of multi-year rolling PSIPs, and
urged the government to seek technical assistance from CARTAC and the CDB.
• Debt management. The mission supports the authorities’ efforts to strengthen technical
capacity in its debt management unit, following technical assistance from the Fund’s
Monetary and Capital Markets Department (received in May 2008). 5 It is hoped that the
5

10
enhanced debt management will allow the authorities to more accurately monitor existing
debt, inform as to the timing of future debt payments, advise on the least-cost source of
managing cash flows, and formulate a strategy for retiring high-cost debt. It is also important
that potential contingent liabilities resulting from expected public private partnership (PPP)
projects be closely monitored.
• Civil service wages. Civil service wage negotiations for the 2008–10 triennium will
commence later in 2008, and the mission expressed concern regarding the effects on
competitiveness of excessive wage increases. The mission and the authorities agreed on the
importance of limiting wage increases, to facilitate fiscal consolidation and dampen secondround increases in inflation, particularly as the authorities do not have an independent
monetary policy that can be used to achieve these goals. In addition, civil service reforms
should be undertaken, which would offer some scope for savings while providing greater
differentiation in the pay scale between higher- and lower-skilled workers.
C. External Stability
17.
St. Lucia’s real exchange rate
appears to be in line with fundamentals.
Staff analyses indicate that St. Lucia’s
actual real effective exchange rate (REER)
is close to its equilibrium level, reflecting
the depreciation of the U.S. dollar against
major currencies (Figure 8). 6 Since 2000,
the equilibrium REER has also
depreciated, due to the ongoing decline in
both the terms of trade and relative tourist
arrivals, and the accumulation of net
foreign liabilities.

infrastructure, along with increased airlift,
more competitive intra-Caribbean airfares, and promotional efforts, will also boost tourism
performance, although higher oil prices pose a downside risk.

St. Lucia’s current account deficits are broadly in line with estimated
equilibrium levels. Using the macroeconomic balance approach, staff estimates put the

appear sustainable. While deficits are projected to remain above estimated equilibrium levels
for several years, which heightens external vulnerabilities, imbalances are expected to
decline over the medium term to a sustainable level. Moreover, public external debt is
expected to be roughly constant (as a share of GDP) over the medium term, at a level which
appears consistent with stability of the currency union. The authorities agreed with this
assessment, noting that the import content of FDI flows is extremely high, so that if FDI
falters, then current account imbalances will shrink as well, with only limited dislocation of
the domestic economy. Nonetheless, St. Lucia’s large stocks of public and external debt
make further fiscal consolidation key to enhancing debt sustainability, maintaining
competitiveness, and supporting the region’s currency board arrangement.

seeking to alter the modalities of the CCRIF to better reflect the asset structure of CARICOM

introduction of strengthened building codes, and greater take-up of insurance of public and
private assets.
21.
While the authorities intend to revitalize the agricultural industry, the banana
sector is likely to continue to contract due to competitive pressures and the ongoing
erosion of trade preferences in European markets. 9 The mission supports the authorities’
efforts to bolster social safety nets for displaced farmers and agricultural workers, and
recommends focusing on time-bound measures such as income transfers, retraining
programs, noncontributory pensions, and limited subsidies on agricultural inputs (to
encourage diversification into nonbanana agriculture). While the European Union continues
to fund efforts to alleviate the social impact of the sector’s decline, the mission notes the
slow pace of donor support for much-needed investment in health, education and social
spending.
22.
The collapse in donor assistance has slowed the transition of the economy out of
agriculture. The authorities generally agreed with the mission’s recommendations on easing

The medium-term plans for the banana industry entail a smaller number of productive growers, producing
high-quality bananas for export to Europe under the higher-priced ‘fair trade’ label. Beginning January 1, 2008,
banana exports from St. Lucia have continued to enter the European Union duty-free, under the EU-CARICOM

slowdown in the world economy. While
Sources: St. Lucia authorities; Delegation of the European Commission, Barbados.
St. Lucia’s domestic credit markets remain
largely unaffected by international financial volatility, slower growth and consumption in the
U.S. and world economy, accompanied by high energy prices, may dampen the flow of
tourists and private capital to the Caribbean.
24.
Strong credit growth, financed by increased foreign borrowing of banks, calls
for closer monitoring of financial sector soundness. Very high domestic lending growth,
due in part to growing competition between bank and nonbank financial institutions, points to
increased credit risks and the potential for the erosion of financial system assets. The sharp
slowdown in economic activity in 2007, compounded by St. Lucia’s vulnerability to natural
disasters and the likely impact of slower world growth on tourism, poses further risks to the
longstanding stability of the banking sector. Although the financial sector as a whole appears
well capitalized and profitable, the mission urged the authorities to step up on-site and offsite supervision of banks (particularly local banks) by the ECCB, and recommended that
more attention be given to crisis management. While the authorities broadly agreed with the
staff’s recommendations, they were sanguine regarding the extent of any deterioration in the
quality of banks’ loan portfolios.
25.
Enhanced regulation and supervision of nonbank financial institutions is also a
priority. Additional measures need to be taken to strengthen the effectiveness of financial
sector supervision, including through the development of a broad supervisory framework to
regulate all nonbank financial institutions. Staff welcomed the enhancement of supervision of
nonbanks by the strengthening of the Financial Services Supervision Unit, and the likely end2008 passage of the OECS-wide uniform Cooperatives Society Act, uniform Insurance Act,
and uniform Money Services Act. While Cabinet has approved an independent Single
Regulatory Unit (SRU) for nonbanks, additional steps need to be taken to ensure that the
SRU is established as soon as possible. The mission supports the authorities’ intention to
establish the SRU as an independent statutory authority, responsible for supervision of the
offshore financial sector, domestic insurance sector, credit unions, money transfer
institutions, and the soon-to-be established National Development Bank. Staff also supports
the authorities’ request for CARTAC technical assistance in the drafting of enabling
legislation and acknowledges further progress in improving the AML/CFT regime. The
mission noted the completion in February 2008 of mutual evaluation of financial regulation

14
by the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force, and recommended that firm and prompt
action be taken to close nontransparent investment schemes (Box 3).
E. Other Issues
26.
St. Lucia’s statistical data remains weak, despite ongoing efforts to enhance
databases. In particular, improvements in coverage and timeliness are needed to facilitate
effective policymaking, surveillance, and inform public debate. Additional resources need to
be devoted to strengthening data in the areas of national accounts, private sector external
debt, tourism, labor markets, and foreign project aid. The mission welcomed the authorities’
recent initiative to construct and rebase the consumer price index, and its work in rebasing
the national accounts to 2005 (in line with other OECS countries).
27.
St. Lucia is grappling with the challenges facing the entire ECCU—a slowing of
growth and a spike in inflation triggered by external shocks and a weakened external
environment. The potential for further increases in already-high world oil and food prices is
a major risk to St. Lucia’s economy. Regarding oil prices and supplies, the mission noted that
work on the construction of a privately-owned oil refinery has yet to commence, and that
St. Lucia continues to abstain from signing the PetroCaribe Agreement with Venezuela. On
food prices, the authorities indicated that they are taking steps to encourage local agriculture
production (including through subsidies for fertilizer), continuing to subsidize the price of
flour, sugar and rice, and have placed an additional 15 basic food and health-related goods
under price controls, involving maximum wholesale and retail margins. They have also
implemented the CARICOM initiative to temporarily (until March 2010) suspend the
common external tariff on several items of imported foodstuffs. The mission advised against
additional price controls, due to their inability to effectively target support, and encouraged
the authorities to seek the assistance of the CDB and the World Bank in the design of wellfunctioning social safety nets to deliver assistance to the poor.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
St. Lucia’s macroeconomic performance has been mixed in 2007, while nearterm prospects are favorable. Activity has been flat, reflecting the contraction in hurricaneaffected agriculture, construction activity, and stayover tourism arrivals. Inflation increased
sharply at end-2007, driven by higher imported food and energy prices. Growth is likely to
accelerate in 2008 and 2009, due to a rebound in agriculture, rising tourism-related
construction activity and growing tourism flows, while inflation is projected to remain
elevated.
29.
Both the real effective exchange rate and medium-term current account deficits
appear to be broadly in line with fundamentals. While current account deficits are
projected to remain high for an extended period, capital flows and current account
imbalances will decline over the medium term. In addition, external debt is projected to

15
remain constant over the medium term, and large new private construction investment in
tourism points to continuing strong prospects in this key sector of the economy, although
persistent high oil prices could dampen these prospects somewhat. Nonetheless, further fiscal
consolidation is necessary to bolster external competitiveness, assist in maintaining external
stability, and support the quasi-currency board arrangement.
30.
Fiscal imbalances and the stock of public debt need to be brought to more
sustainable levels. Despite the recent welcome improvement in fiscal balances, projected
fiscal trends increase the risk that earlier consolidation gains could be reversed. While the
approved budget for 2008/09, if fully implemented, would widen fiscal imbalances,
implementation constraints will again likely dampen expenditures. Nonetheless, public debt
remains high, constraining the fiscal room for maneuver in the event of shocks, while the
burden of debt servicing limits the ability to undertake much needed social and povertyreduction spending. Key fiscal initiatives include:
•

Revenue reforms. The authorities should move quickly to broaden the tax base through
introduction of the VAT and market valuation-based property taxation, and institute more
flexible domestic petroleum pricing. To ensure the integrity of consumption taxation, it is
vital to avoid weakening the prospective VAT through exemptions and tax concessions.

•

Expenditure restraint. Capital expenditures need to be prioritized and properly
evaluated, along with limiting growth in the civil service wage bill.

•

Debt management. Ongoing efforts by the authorities to strengthen the capacity for debt
management are well placed.

31.
Prompt action is needed to strengthen social safety nets. The ongoing erosion of
trade preferences and the high price of imported food and fuel are having important
economic and social consequences. Staff supports the authorities’ plans to provide welltargeted safety nets, drawing upon assistance from external donors where possible, and
suggests that price controls be phased out once such safety nets are in place.
32.
Financial sector vulnerabilities call for close monitoring. The ongoing credit boom
amidst an economic slowdown could erode the quality of banking system assets, raising the
importance of effective banking supervision. Prompt action is also needed to terminate
unregulated financial institutions, in particular the nontransparent investment schemes
operating in St. Lucia. Staff urges the authorities to expedite their efforts to consolidate
regulation and supervision of nonbank financial intermediaries, and enhance supervision of
international financial services.
33.
Economic and social statistics need to be enhanced. Data often remain scanty in
terms of coverage, timeliness, and reliability. Staff welcomes the authorities’ focus on
strengthening data quality and provision, including by seeking technical assistance from
CARTAC, the ECCB and the Fund.
34.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

16

Box 1. St. Lucia: The 2008/09 Budget
The budget (introduced in April 2008) is designed to steer a course through tough
economic times. Planned projects include: (i) revitalizing the agriculture sector; (ii) investing
heavily in training in order to address skills-mismatches in the productive sectors of the economy;
(iii) re-establishing a National Development Bank that will offer financial and technical support to
farmers and small businesses; and (iv) fighting crime.
If fully implemented, the budget will worsen the fiscal deficit and increase public debt.
Absent implementation constraints, the budget implies a significant deterioration in the primary
and overall fiscal deficits to 2 percent and 5.3 percent of GDP, respectively. Financing from loans
and new bond issues will increase the central government debt to 65 percent of GDP. In addition,
the budget envisages grants to the tune of 4 percent of GDP, though the historical average is
about 0.1 percent of GDP.
Much of the deterioration in the primary balance stems from an increase in capital
spending. The budget scales up capital spending to 14.7 percent of GDP, though the historical
implementation rate has yielded capital spending of less than 10 percent of GDP. The
government justifies increased spending with additional demands for infrastructure to support the
agriculture, information technology, and tourism sectors. Current expenditure is set to increase by
about 1.5 percent of GDP, including on social programs.
Revenue projections appear realistic. The increase in current revenue (½ of 1 percent of GDP)
will be largely derived from higher receipts from tax arrears. A key measure in the budget is a
two-year income tax amnesty, which will make it easier for taxpayers to settle their arrears, which
are currently estimated at EC$324 million (about 10½ percent of GDP), inclusive of interest and
penalties.

1/ Assumes that 90 percent of FDI is spent on imports.

Imports grew by less than 1 percentage point
of GDP in 2007. Rising world energy prices led to a sharp increase of fuel imports, but this was
largely offset by a decline of construction-related imports as a result of a weakening in public
sector construction activities. Despite higher food prices, food imports grew by only 2.3 percent,
as stayover tourist arrivals declined in 2007.
Due to a sharp increase in cruise-ship arrivals, tourism receipts grew by a modest
4 percent in 2007, despite a 5 percent decline in stayover tourist arrivals. A variety of
factors contributed to the decline in stayover tourists, including: Cricket World Cup-related
disruptions during the peak winter tourist season; more stringent rules on Caribbean travel for
U.S. nationals; and problems with the availability and cost of intra-regional airlift. The shift toward
more cruise-ship arrivals also contributed to a further decline of average visitor expenditure, as
stayover tourists tend to spend considerably more than cruise-ship passengers.
For 2008 the current account deficit is expected to remain high, and continue to be
financed largely by FDI. Imports as a share of GDP are not expected to fall sharply to pre-2006
levels as several major hotel projects are set to commence in the second half of 2008, and food
and energy import prices are projected to rise significantly. Tourism receipts should recover in
2008 as a result of an aggressive marketing campaign in the U.S., and new direct flights from the
United States and the United Kingdom.

Box 3. Unregulated Investment Schemes in St. Lucia
In several Caribbean countries, unregulated investment schemes (UIS) appear to be growing
quickly. The schemes claim unusually high monthly returns and operate through a system of
referrals by existing members, features shared with pyramid schemes which inevitably collapse.
Most of the schemes claim to be engaged in foreign exchange trading.
One UIS is known to be operating in St. Lucia. The Wilshaw Forex Club Ltd. appears to have
commenced operations in December 2007. It invests through TCI FX Traders Ltd, which describes
itself as “an open ended investment company incorporated in the Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI) on
August 16, 2006 and subject to the laws of the TCI.” According to the Wilshaw prospectus, TCI FX
Traders Ltd. is established for the purpose of investing through OLINT TCI, a FX trading entity with
the object of “obtaining constant above average return through a disciplined investment approach.”
Overseas Locket International (OLINT) originated in Jamaica and promised extremely high returns
of 6–20 percent per month, but the Jamaican authorities issued cease and desist orders against
OLINT in 2006. The St. Kitts Government also issued an advisory that OLINT had never been
licensed to conduct investment or any other business in St. Kitts.
Prompt policy action against UIS is needed. Country experiences suggest that such schemes
can inflict extensive damage to financial and social-political stability. The St. Lucian authorities
should provide prominent public warnings of the risks, issue a financial advisory that any such
schemes are not licensed, and announce no bailout for participants. Coordinated regulatory action
by the Eastern Caribbean Securities Regulatory Commission (ECSRC), the ECCB, and the
St. Lucian authorities to shut down such schemes is also urgently needed, including as a first step
establishing which agency has the relevant jurisdictional authority.

1/ Smaller numbers represent greater ease in doing business. The indicators are comparable across
175 countries.
2/ This is an overall indicator that captures the regulatory costs of doing business; it can be used to
analyze specific regulations that enhance or constrain investment, productivity, and growth.
3/ This topic identifies the bureaucratic and legal hurdles an entrepreneur must overcome to
incorporate and register a new firm. It examines the procedures, time, and cost involved in launching a
commercial or industrial firm with up to 50 employees and start-up capital of 10 times the economy’s
per-capita gross national income.
4/ This topic explores two sets of issues—credit information registries and the effectiveness of
collateral and bankruptcy laws in facilitating lending.
5/ This topic looks at the efficiency of contract enforcement by following the evolution of a sale of
goods dispute and tracking the time, cost, and number of procedures involved from the moment the
plaintiff files the lawsuit until actual payment.

Annex I. St. Lucia: Medium-Term Outlook Under Alternative Fiscal Scenarios
The risk of current fiscal policies leading to an unsustainable level of public debt
remains high, given the pressure for capital and social spending. In the absence of
containment of capital spending, and an increase in revenues, current debt dynamics are
unfavorable.
Two fiscal scenarios are considered—a baseline scenario and an alternative scenario.
Under the baseline scenario, discussed in the text, the debt stock and debt servicing costs
continue to rise; under the alternative scenario, the stock of debt declines gradually over the
medium term, achieving the ECCB Monetary Council’s debt benchmark (60 percent of GDP
by 2020) in FY 2012/13.
Baseline scenario. This scenario assumes that the authorities will continue current policies
with overall imbalances that are financed commercially, and also through some grants from
Taiwan Province of China. Financing is assumed to continue to be available ad infinitum. In
the medium term, growth remains driven by public and private investment, mainly through
large-scale infrastructure and tourism sector construction, but is still lower (by about ½ of
1 percent) than under the alternative scenario. On the revenue side, new measures would be
limited to the introduction of a revenue-positive VAT in FY 2009/10. On the expenditure
side, the wage bill would remain constant (as a share of GDP), and there would be an
increase in capital expenditure. Under this scenario, the central government primary deficit
(excluding grants) would deteriorate, reaching 2.2 percent of GDP by FY 2009/10, and
public debt would rise to about 73 percent of GDP by FY 2013/14 (Table 8, Baseline
Scenario).
Alternative scenario. The broad theme of this scenario is fiscal consolidation and additional
social spending. This is expected to be achieved through greater revenue mobilization and a
reduction in capital expenditure. Revenue initiatives will focus on: (i) increased petroleum
product taxes in FY 2008/09 through flexible adjustment of domestic retail prices;
(ii) introduction of a market valuation-based property tax in FY 2009/10; and (iii) more
vigorous collection of domestic taxes and tax arrears. Additional grants are expected from the
European Union and Taiwan Province of China. On the expenditure side, to create room for
planned additional social spending, growth in the real wage bill will be curtailed (by holding
constant the number of civil servants), while capital expenditure will be cut by the
elimination or postponement of low-priority projects.
With the impetus from prioritization of public sector capital projects, the underlying growth
is expected to accelerate with greater activity in the private sector, and is estimated at about
5 percent over the medium term. Under this scenario, the central government primary
balance (excluding grants) would reach a surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP by FY 2009/10, and
public debt would decline to about 60 percent of GDP by FY 2012/13 (Table 8, Alternative
Scenario).

Annex II. St. Lucia: Summary of Appendices
Fund Relations
St. Lucia does not have outstanding obligations to the Fund. St. Lucia is a member of the Eastern
Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), which manages monetary policy and the exchange system for
its eight members. The common currency, the Eastern Caribbean dollar, has been pegged to the
U.S. dollar at the rate of EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar since July 1976. St. Lucia has accepted the
obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system free of
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. The
last Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on September 26, 2007 (IMF
Country Report No. 08/67). CARTAC has provided extensive technical assistance in recent
years. In addition, FAD fielded a VAT and tax administration mission in September/October
2007, a PSIA mission on poverty and trade preference erosion in December 2007, and MCM
fielded a debt management mission in April/May 2008.
Relations with the World Bank Group 10
In September 2005, the Eastern Caribbean Sub-Region Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for
FY 2006–09 was presented to the Board of the World Bank. The strategy supports the subregion’s development agenda through two main pillars: (i) stimulating growth and improving
competitiveness; and (2) reducing vulnerability, by promoting greater social inclusion and
strengthening disaster risk management. There are eight active World Bank projects in St. Lucia
for a net commitment of approximately US$47.68 million: Telecommunications and ICT
Development, Water Supply Infrastructure Improvement, HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control, the
Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility, the OECS Skills for Inclusive Growth, the OECS
E-Government for Regional Integration, St. Lucia Disaster Management, and St. Lucia Education
Development.
Relations with the Caribbean Development Bank 11
St. Lucia continued to receive financing from the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) for
infrastructure development, human resource development, the formulation and implementation of
economic, social and sectoral policies, direct and indirect lending to the productive sectors,
environmental protection and poverty reduction. At end-2007, St. Lucia had a total outstanding
balance of US$129.9 million. Since 1970, CDB financing for St. Lucia has been distributed
mainly in the transportation and communication, education, and manufacturing sectors.
Statistical Issues

St. Lucia participates in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). Although
the statistical database compares well with those of its ECCU peers, there are weaknesses in
coverage, frequency, quality, and timeliness, in particular: incorporation of tourism in the
national accounts, the public sector beyond the central government, and the balance of
payments.

VII. Exchange Rate Arrangement: St. Lucia is a member of the Eastern Caribbean Currency
Union which has a common central bank (the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank) and currency (the
Eastern Caribbean dollar). Since July 1976 the Eastern Caribbean dollar has been pegged to the
U.S. dollar at the rate of EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar. St. Lucia has accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. St. Lucia maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on
payments and transfers for current international transactions.
VIII. Last Article IV Consultation: St. Lucia is currently on the 12-month cycle. The last
Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on September 26, 2007. The
relevant documents are IMF Country Report Nos. 08/67 and 08/68.
IX. Technical Assistance (September 2007–July 2008): Several missions from the Caribbean
Regional Technical Assistance Center (CARTAC) have visited St. Lucia since September 2007.
In the area of public finance, CARTAC consultants assisted the authorities in financial
programming, accessing the impact of a pass-through of the international price of fuel, the
introduction of a VAT and a market-based property tax, and with other measures aimed at
containing expenditures. A FAD TA mission in January 2008 studied the poverty impact of
trade preference erosion and mitigating measures. FAD also fielded a mission in November
2007, with a view to providing a strategy for successful introduction of the VAT, reviewing
ongoing Customs and Excise Department reforms, and offering advice for the medium term
on strengthening the VAT. MCM TA in May 2008 provided a process framework to assist the
authorities in formulating an effective medium-term debt management strategy.

Appendix II. St. Lucia: Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of June 16, 2008)
In September 2005, the Eastern Caribbean Sub-Region Country Assistance Strategy (CAS)
for FY06-09 was presented to the Board of the World Bank. The strategy supports the subregion’s development agenda through two main pillars: (1) stimulating growth and
improving competitiveness; and (2) reducing vulnerability, by promoting greater social
inclusion and strengthening disaster risk management. Recognizing the OECS countries’
weakened creditworthiness due to high debt ratios, Bank activities will focus on leveraging
available donor grant financing. Following the recommendations of the recently completed
growth and competitiveness study for the OECS, IBRD and IDA support would focus on
providing technical and financial assistance for interventions to support the two main pillars.
An indicative Base Case lending scenario consisted of about US$51.3 million in IDA
resources for the four OECS IDA eligible countries. An OECS CAS Progress Report was
completed in June 2008.
I. PROJECTS
There are eight active World Bank projects in St. Lucia for a net commitment of
approximately US$47.68 million.
The OECS E-Government for Regional Integration Program was approved by the Board
on May 27, 2008. This project consists of a US$2.4 million IDA credit (two thirds of which
is from the Regional IDA allocation) to St. Lucia and is designed to promote the efficiency,
quality, and transparency of public services through the delivery of regionally integrated egovernment applications that take advantage of economies of scale. The program is
structured in phases. Phase 1 focuses on cross-sectoral e-government issues, as well as on
specific applications in the public finance area (including Public Financial Management or
PFM, tax, customs and procurement), and also includes an e-government in health pilot
project (possibly together with preparatory and complementary activities in other social and
productive sectors). Subsequent phases of the program are expected to deepen the assistance
provided under Phase 1, while expanding the program to cover other sectors, in particular,
health, education, agriculture, tourism, postal, among others that may emerge during the
early stages of implementation of Phase 1.
The OECS (LC) Skills for Inclusive Growth project was approved in May 2007 for US$3.5
million of IDA credit. The objective of the project is to assist the Government of St. Lucia to
increase the employability of youth through private-sector driven training. This objective will
be pursued through three means: (i) establishment of a competitive training scheme that
finances private sector-driven training and traineeships, (ii) development of an improved
policy framework for delivering training by enhancing OECS collaboration in training and

4
introducing occupational standards to increase quality and value of training, and (iii)
strengthening institutional capacity to better implement, monitor, and plan training.
The OECS Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) was approved in January 2007.
This is the world’s first ever multi-country catastrophe insurance pool. The bank approved a
US$4.5 million IDA credit for St. Lucia to finance their contribution to the fund over three
years. The Facility will enable governments to purchase catastrophe insurance coverage
against adverse natural events, such as a major earthquakes or hurricanes. The CCRIF allows
participating countries to pool their country-specific risks into one, better-diversified
portfolio, resulting in a substantial reduction in the premium cost of 45-50 percent.
The Telecommunications and ICT Development Project, approved in May 2005 for
US$543,000, half coming from IBRD loans and the other half form IDA credit, aims at
improving the access, quality, and use of telecommunications and ICT services to achieve
socio-economic development in the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS). The
project has four components: 1) strengthening the national and regional regulatory
frameworks and promoting additional competition in the telecommunications sector.
Emphasis will be given to capacity building of Eastern Caribbean Telecommunications
Authority (ECTEL) and the National Telecommunications Regulatory Commissions
(NTRCs) by providing them with assistances to revise the regional and national sector
legislation, and develop a modem interconnection regime; 2) reviewing current universal
access policy, creating related guidelines, and providing financial support to establish a
Universal Service Fund (USF); 3) improving growth and competitiveness in ICT-enabled
services through utilization of broadband infrastructure; 4) ensuring management and
administration of the overall project.
The St. Lucia Water Supply Infrastructure Improvement Project was approved in
December 2001 for US$1.3 million in IBRD loans. In May 2005, an additional financing of
US$3.85 million in IBRD loans and US$5.69 million in IDA credit was approved. The total
commitment for this project is now US$10.84 million. The objectives of the St. Lucia Water
Supply Infrastructure Improvement Project are: (i) to alleviate the water shortage in the entire
north of the country; (ii) to implement urgent investments that will result in additional
revenues, and reduction of the likelihood of commercial users abandoning the system; and
(iii) to improve the potential of a successful partnership between the Government and the
private sector. On April 10, 2007, a request for an additional US$1.84 million was approved
for this project.
The HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project was approved in July 2004 for US$6.4
million, with half the financing through IBRD loans and the other half from IDA credit. The
project supports the national program, which aims to prevent and control the spread of the
epidemic, and to mitigate the socio-economic impact of the disease on the population. The
project will use a two-pronged strategy: targeting interventions at high risk groups, and
implementing non-targeted activities for the general population. The first component Community and Civil Society Initiatives - will finance HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and
support activities of Civil Society Organizations, women's organizations, professional

5
organizations, trade unions, and private sector organizations. The second component will
support the response to HIV/AIDS by non-health sector line ministries, namely, basic crosscutting HIV/AIDS activities which all ministries are expected to implement under their
respective sectoral HIV/AIDS programs. The third component will strengthen the capacity of
the Ministry of Health to provide technical guidance for the national response to HIV/AIDS,
specifically it will strengthen HIV/AIDS related services for prevention, treatment, and care
delivered through the health care system. Finally, the fourth component will help build the
institutional capacity for scaling up responsiveness, by financing technical advisory services,
training, staffing, equipment, goods, and general operating costs.
The St. Lucia Disaster Management Project II was approved in June 2004 for US$7.5
million and consists of US$3.8 million in IDA credit, and US$3.7 million from the IBRD.
This project aims at further reducing the country's vulnerability to adverse natural events
(hurricane, floods, etc.) through investment in risk management activities. The project four
components: Component 1) Physical Prevention and Mitigation Work: (a) coastal protection
works for Dennery Village; (b) rehabilitation and reconstruction of two bridges; (c) drainage,
river walls and slope stabilization; (d) retrofitting of schools and health centers;
(e) procurement of additional stock; (f) technical audits for works at Dennery Village;
(g) training and capacity building. Component 2) Strengthening Emergency Preparedness
and Response: (a) construction of the Emergency Operations Center and additional satellite
warehouses; (b) installation of water tanks; (c) technical assistance and training for the
National Emergency Management Office; (d) specialized disaster equipment. Component 3)
Institutional Strengthening: (a) building code training and sensitization; (b) technical
assistance in territorial planning; (c) vulnerability assessment. Component 4) Project
Management: (a) technical assistance to the Project Coordination Unit and technical audits.
The St. Lucia Education Development Project was approved in June 2002 for US$12.0
million, half of which is from IDA credit, and the other half coming from the IBRD. The
overall program objective is to build human capital in the OECS which in turn will contribute
to the diversification of their economy and more sustainable growth. There are three main
project components. The first increases equitable access and equity in secondary education,
particularly in poor rural communities. The second component comprises 4 subcomponents,
which: 1) develop curriculum for Forms I-III and provide instructional guides, textbooks, and
other resource materials; 2) establish learning resource centers, and expand and upgrade
learning centers, including science and information technology labs; 3) elaborate program to
support participation of disadvantaged students, and related teacher development in special
education; and 4) provide school-based improvement projects, and extra-curricular activities.
The third component expands the education management information system, including
networking of schools and EMIS training.

6
II. ECONOMIC AND SECTOR WORK
The Bank has completed a series of analytical work relating to public sector capacity in the
OECS including a number of Public Expenditure Reviews, an Institutional and
Organizational Capacity Review and, in late 2007, a Country Fiduciary Assessment. The
Bank also prepared an OECS study on Growth and Competitiveness (2005), a Caribbean Air
Transport Report (2006), and a regional study on Crime, Violence, and Development:
Trends, Costs, and Policy Options in the Caribbean (2007). St. Lucia was also included in the
OECS Doing Business Report in 2007, the first multi-country special report to be undertaken
by the Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS). Follow-on detailed diagnostic work for
St. Lucia is expected in FY09. In addition, an OECS Private Sector Financing Study was
completed in early 2008.
St. Lucia will also benefit from ongoing and planned analytical and advisory activities
including the following: A Caribbean Skills and Curriculum Study, a Caribbean Financial
Sector and Regulation report, a Caribbean Social Protection Strategy Review, a Trade
Integration in the Caribbean: Policy Options for Sustained Growth, Job Creation, and Poverty
Reduction report, a CARICOM study on Managing Nurse Migration, and an OECS Tourism
Backward Linkages Study. A Regional Energy Security report is also planned for FY09.

Appendix III. St. Lucia: Relations with the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB)
(As of June 24, 2008)
CDB interventions in St. Lucia have facilitated sustainable development by supporting
investments in both social and economic infrastructure. This support has been financial and
non-financial in nature and was aimed at ensuring that St. Lucia remains competitive in the
global economy while ensuring that the needs of vulnerable groups are addressed.
Specifically, the CDB has been involved in areas such as infrastructural development, human
resource development, the formulation and implementation of economic, social and sectoral
policies, direct and indirect lending to the productive sectors, environmental protection and
poverty reduction. Going forward, it is expected that the Bank will continue to support
sustainable economic growth by providing support for policy reforms and other efforts which
promote good governance, facilitating upgrades to utilities and infrastructure, improving the
competitiveness of the tourism sector, supporting medium and small enterprises, reducing
vulnerability to natural hazards and fostering inclusive social development.
Notwithstanding some decline in borrowing activity in recent years, reflecting to some extent
the availability of alternative sources of financing, St. Lucia remains the second-largest
beneficiary of CDB funding, with US$265.5 million being approved to St. Lucia
cumulatively in loans, contingent loans, equity and grants from 1970 to 2007. Of this
amount, US$136.8 million were approved from Ordinary Capital Resources with the
remainder being sourced from the “soft” window. In 2007 St. Lucia benefited from a grant of
US$8,000 to assist small scale private sector entities in building capacity to compete more
effectively in the local and regional markets. At the end of December 2007, St. Lucia had a
total outstanding balance of US$129.9 million compared to US$148.7 million at the end of
the previous year. There were no new approvals for the January to March period of 2008.

Appendix IV. St. Lucia: Statistical Issues
(As of June 26, 2008)
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Although
the statistical database compares well with those of its Eastern Caribbean Central Bank
(ECCB) peers, the accuracy and timeliness of macroeconomic statistics should be improved
in order to achieve adequate standards for Fund surveillance and meet the authorities’ needs.
There are persistent weaknesses in coverage, frequency, quality, and timeliness, in particular
regarding the national accounts, data on the public sector beyond the central government, and
the balance of payments. Also, comprehensive and regular labor statistics are not available.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs publishes bi-annually an economic and social review,
which includes statistics on many macroeconomic sectors. The ECCB publishes a quarterly
economic and financial review and an annual balance of payments for each member country.
St. Lucia is a participant in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). Its metadata,
which include detailed plans for statistical development in the main macroeconomic areas
over the short and medium term, have been posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards
Bulletin Board (http://dsbb.imf.org) since September 21, 2000.
Real Sector Statistics
The authorities are revising GDP estimates to obtain better sectoral estimates, but the process
is being delayed by data collection problems. Attempts are being made to compile quarterly
GDP estimates with funding from the Organization of American States. Given the increasing
importance of tourism activities, a new comprehensive survey of the sector is necessary to
establish key data, such as the average length of stay in different types of accommodations
and the average daily expenditure by type of tourist arrival. This information should be crosschecked with other related activities (i.e., restaurants and transportation) to ensure
consistency. Missions fielded by the Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance Center in
2005 and 2007 aided development of export and import price indices and initial work on
measuring price developments in the tourism sector. The rebasing exercise of the CPI has
been completed—the new CPI basket (base January 2008) is based on the 2006 Household
Expenditure Survey. Another area in need of improvement is labor statistics, in particular, the
reporting of private and public employment and wages.
Government Finance Statistics
Reporting of central government data has improved substantially over the last few years, but
deficiencies remain in the rest of the public sector. The authorities are reporting monthly data
on the central government’s current revenue and expenditure, using a Fund-compatible
economic classification, with lags of a couple of months. However, frequent and substantial
revisions suggest that there is a need for further refinement. With regard to the rest of the
public sector, the periodicity and timeliness of data reporting should be improved; annual
financial statements and projections are currently obtained directly from the entities during

9
Fund missions and partially consolidated public sector accounts are only compiled by the
Fund staff. Data on domestic debt of the public sector are not available on a regular basis. No
fiscal data are reported to STA for publication in the GFS Yearbook or in IFS.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
Monetary statistics are compiled and reported to the Fund by the ECCB on a monthly basis
based on a standardized report form since July 2006. In April 2007 a data ROSC mission
assessed the monetary statistics with reference to the GDDS, and the Data Quality
Assessment Framework (DQAF, July 2003). It indicated that the institutional coverage of the
other depository corporations is incomplete, as data for mortgage companies, finance
companies, building societies, and credit unions—all of which accept deposits—are
excluded. Also, accrued interest is not incorporated in the value of the interest-bearing assets
and liabilities, and valuation adjustments are included in other liabilities. In addition, source
data for the commercial banks do not provide the disaggregation recommended in the
Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. Close coordination between the ECCB and the
single regulatory unit (which supervises financial corporations other than those licensed
under the Banking Act) is crucial.
Balance of Payments Statistics
Balance of payments data are compiled by the ECCB on an annual basis. Although recent
data provide a more detailed breakdown of goods than in the past, in other areas they do not
provide sufficient detail to enable publication of the full classification used in the fifth edition
of the Balance of Payments Manual. Annual data up to 2005 are published in the IFS. In
general, enhanced data resources and better compilation procedures are needed to improve
the accuracy and timeliness of balance of payments statistics. Efforts should also be made to
compile quarterly balance of payments statistics and the annual international investment
position statement.
External Debt
The Ministry of Finance has a comprehensive database for public and publicly guaranteed
external loans that provides detailed and reasonably up-to-date breakdowns of disbursements
and debt service. Information on bonds placed abroad is compiled annually and monthly data
are provided only at the staff’s request. There is a need to restore the quality of information
on these bonds, which has weakened recently as the distinction between resident and
nonresident holders was discontinued.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
ST. LUCIA
External and Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the staff of the International Monetary Fund
In consultation with World Bank Staff
July 10, 2008
This debt sustainability analysis (DSA) assesses the sustainability of St. Lucia’s public and
external debt. The analysis suggests that sound public finances will be key to achieving debt
sustainability. Staff estimates show that public debt will remain high in the absence of
continued fiscal consolidation. St. Lucia’s risk of external debt distress is moderate.
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Macroeconomic performance was mixed in 2007. Growth decelerated from an annual
average of 4.2 percent during 2003-06 to 1.7 percent in 2007, largely reflecting the winding
down of Cricket World Cup (CWC)-related construction and declines in stayover tourist
arrivals. As world food and energy prices soared, annual inflation rose to 6.8 percent by end2007. However, substantial progress was made in reducing fiscal imbalances. With higher
current revenue and lower capital expenditure, a primary surplus of 0.8 percent of GDP was
achieved, representing a fiscal adjustment of 3½ percent of GDP from 2006. As a result of
this fiscal improvement, the public debt-to-GDP ratio increased only slightly to 70 percent of
GDP.
II. UNDERLYING DSA ASSUMPTIONS
2.
The baseline scenario assumes that the authorities will continue the fiscal policy of
sizeable overall imbalances that are financed commercially. In the medium term, growth is
projected at around 4.4 percent, driven by hotel construction activities and tourism. Under
this scenario, the central government primary deficit (including grants) deteriorates
gradually, peaking at 1.9 percent of GDP in 2009. Compared to the 2007 Article IV
Consultation DSA, growth projections remain similar while fiscal projections are more
conservative given the progress in reducing fiscal imbalances in 2007.

2

Box 1. Baseline Macroeconomic Assumptions (2008–28)
•

Real GDP growth is projected to average about 4½ percent, consistent with the
stronger growth observed in the 2002-06 and reflecting the ongoing large expansion
of tourism accommodation capacity. With rapidly rising world food and fuel prices,
inflation is projected to remain in the high single digits in 2008 before returning to
low historical averages consistent with the quasi-currency board arrangement.

•

The primary balance of the central government (including grants) is projected to
deteriorate gradually, peaking at 1.9 percent of GDP by 2009. On the revenue side,
new measures would be limited to the introduction of a revenue-positive VAT. On the
expenditure side, the wage bill would remain constant (as a share of GDP) and capital
expenditure would rise steadily to 14 percent of GDP by 2011, before declining
slightly to 13 percent of GDP for 2012 and beyond.

•

Given uncertainty surrounding the disbursements of the European Union assistance,
annual grants are conservatively projected at 0.3 percent of GDP.

•

The current account deficit is projected to remain elevated and largely financed by
foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2008. However, as FDI-related imports wind down
and tourist receipts pick up over the medium term, the current account deficit is
expected to return gradually to a more sustainable level. The projected increase in
tourist arrivals is underpinned by an expansion of hotel capacity of 40 percent over
the medium-term.

•

FDI is assumed to remain high for 2008-10, and gradually return to its historical
average of 11 percent of GDP by 2013.
III. EVALUATION OF PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

3.
At end-2007 public debt stood at about 70 percent of GDP—nearly twice the level of
a decade ago—albeit still the lowest in the ECCU. Expansionary fiscal polices in 2001–02
sharply raised the fiscal deficit and debt-to-GDP ratio. In subsequent years the authorities
strengthened revenue administration and tightened capital expenditure, enabling them to slow
the pace of public debt build up.
4.
External debt represents 46 percent of GDP, while domestic debt represents
24 percent of GDP. Regarding the stock of external debt, the largest share is owed to
multilateral and bilateral creditors (around 22 percent of GDP, with the Caribbean
Development Bank holding around three fifths of that share), followed by commercial
creditors (around 12 percent of GDP). In the future, most of new external requirements are
expected to be financed commercially through the ECCU’s Regional Government Securities

3
Market (RGSM). On the domestic front, commercial banks are the most important lenders to
the government.
Baseline scenario
5.
Under the baseline scenario St. Lucia’s public debt would remain high, at about
73 percent of GDP by 2013. The debt-to-GDP ratio would increase marginally to around
75 percent by 2028. All other indicators of debt sustainability follow a similar pattern of
stagnation, with the NPV of debt-to revenue ratio remaining at over 230 percent by 2028.
Alternative scenarios
Adjustment scenario
6.
Under this scenario a fiscal adjustment would lead to an average primary surplus of
about 1½ percent of GDP over the medium term. This adjustment would restore the primary
surplus to its average level during 1985-2000 and would require additional revenue
enhancing measures, including the introduction of a market valuation-based property tax and
a more flexible fuel pricing regime, as well as wage restraint and prioritization of capital
expenditures.
7.
Under this adjustment scenario St. Lucia’s public debt-to-GDP ratio would decline to
below 60 percent—the ECCB’s benchmark—by 2012. The debt-to-GDP ratio would decline
further to around 40 percent by 2028. All other indicators of debt sustainability would show a
steady improvement, particularly with debt service as a share of current revenue falling from
around 23 percent in 2008 to around 10 percent by 2028.
Changes in growth and primary balance
8.
The sensitivity analysis (which is applied to the baseline scenario) shows that
economic growth and the primary balance are the two key drivers of St. Lucia’s debt
dynamics. If growth is assumed to remain at one standard deviation below the baseline, the
NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio will reach 118 percent by 2028 (Table 2, Scenario A3). If both
annual growth and primary deficit were to be kept at historical levels (2.2 percent and
0.9 percent of GDP, respectively), the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio would reach 112 percent by
2028 (Table 2, Scenario A1).
9.
The sensitivity analysis also highlights the importance of containing expenditure if
economic growth were to decline. Alternative Scenario B1, in which growth is assumed to
decline to -0.6 percent for 2009 and 2010, indicates that the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio will
increase rapidly, reaching 116 percent by 2028. This is because as output slows, fiscal
revenues are assumed to remain constant as a share of GDP while expenditures are assumed
to remain constant in nominal terms relative to the baseline scenario, producing a substantial

4
and permanent deterioration of the primary balance. This, in turn, increases debt ratios
markedly.
Natural disaster
10.
The impact of a natural disaster on St. Lucia’s debt dynamics was also analyzed
(Table 2, Alternative Scenario A4). Under this scenario (which is again applied to the
baseline scenario) it is assumed that a hurricane increases the primary deficit of the
government by 3 percent of GDP in 2009, 2010 and 2011, before reverting to its baseline
levels thereafter. 1 This shock accelerates the deterioration of the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio,
reaching 90 percent by 2011.
IV. EVALUATION OF EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
11.
St. Lucia’s external debt sustainability analysis includes only public sector debt, since
data on private sector external borrowing are not available. As a result, the external DSA
follows a similar pattern to that of the public sector DSA.
12.
Under the baseline scenario the NPV of external debt remains at about 43 percent of
GDP, below the prudential threshold of 50 percent, throughout the projection period. 2 All
other debt and debt service ratios also remain relatively stable and below relevant indicative
thresholds.
13.
Sensitivity analysis (which is applied to the baseline scenario) shows that the level of
external debt is most responsive to a large shock of nominal exchange rate depreciation as
the majority of external debt is denominated in U.S. dollars. With a one-time 30 percent
nominal depreciation in 2009, the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio will jump to 60 percent,
breaching the debt-to-GDP threshold of 50 percent (Table 4, Scenario B6). Similarly, lower
export growth and a shortfall in non-debt creating flows would also breach the debt-to-GDP
threshold of 50 percent (Table 4, Scenarios B2 and B4, respectively). The export shortfall
would engender a long-lived hump in the debt service-to-exports ratio, which is indicative of
some liquidity concerns (Table 4, Scenario B2). The level of external debt is also responsive
to a negative shock on growth and costlier terms of financing (Table 4, Scenarios B1 and A2,
respectively), but these shocks do not lead to a breach of thresholds.
1

The actual impact of this shock could be lower given the recent participation of St. Lucia in the Caribbean
Catastrophe Insurance Facility—a regional insurance pool organized by the World Bank.

2

The DSA uses policy-dependent external debt-burden indicators. Policy performance is measured by the
Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index, compiled annually by the World Bank. The CPIA
divides countries into three performance categories (strong, medium, and poor) based on the overall quality of
its macroeconomic policies, with strong performers having higher prudential thresholds than poor performers.
St. Lucia is classified by the CPIA as a strong performer, with prudential thresholds on NPV of debt-to-GDP
and debt-to-exports ratios of 50 and 200 percent, respectively.

5
V. CONCLUSIONS
14.
Absent a fiscal adjustment that would return the primary balance to its historical
average, imbalances for the overall public sector would remain, leaving the ECCB’s public
debt benchmark of 60 percent of GDP out of reach for St. Lucia. Staff analysis shows that,
with a fiscal adjustment bringing the average primary surplus (including grants) to around 1½
percent of GDP over the medium term (close to the long-term average), St. Lucia would
reach the ECCB’s target by 2012 and continue to bring down its public debt steadily to 40
percent of GDP by 2028.
15.
On the external front St. Lucia faces a moderate risk of debt distress. The baseline
scenario indicates no breach of any thresholds. Various stress tests suggest several breaches
of the NPV of debt-to-GDP threshold. However, as private external debt data are unavailable,
some caution should be used when interpreting these results, which cover public external
debt only.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 16, 2008

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation
with St. Lucia
On July 30, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with St. Lucia.1
Background
Macroeconomic performance has been mixed in recent years. While real GDP growth
averaged 4 percent during 2003–06, growth slowed to about 1¾ percent in 2007, reflecting
contraction in hurricane–affected agriculture (mainly banana exports), and slowdowns in
construction activity and stayover tourist arrivals. Inflation increased sharply to almost
7 percent at end-December 2007, due to higher imported fuel and food prices and the
ongoing depreciation of the U.S. dollar. With deteriorating global prospects and slow
recovery in agriculture, growth is expected to be modest in 2008 (at 2⅓ percent) and to rise
further in 2009. Additional hotel capacity, combined with vigorous marketing and more
frequent airlift, is expected to boost growth. Despite this broadly positive outlook,
vulnerabilities remain, including the country’s dependence on imported oil, high food prices,
declining European Union (EU) banana preferences, volatile tourism receipts, and exposure
to natural disasters.
The fiscal position has strengthened in 2007, yet public debt and debt servicing payments
continue to rise. The primary balance improved in FY 2007/08 (April 1-March 31), reflecting
an increase in current revenue and a marked reduction in capital expenditure. While the
total revenue-to-GDP ratio increased from about 27 percent in FY 2006/07 to 28¼ percent in
FY 2007/08, total spending (excluding interest payments) declined sharply from 29½
percent to about 27½ percent, contributing to a 3½ percent of GDP improvement in the
primary balance. However, public debt increased to 70½ percent of GDP.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s
authorities.

2

The external current account deficit remained elevated in 2007. The large deficit (29 percent
of GDP) was driven primarily by a continued deterioration of the terms of trade and decline
in tourist arrivals, and higher imports related to hotel construction and energy demand. The
deficit continues to be almost entirely financed by foreign direct investment, mainly in the
tourism sector. Nonetheless, St. Lucia remains vulnerable to external shocks, given its
dependence on imported oil, volatile tourism receipts, exposure to natural disasters, and
rising food and energy prices.
Indicators present a mixed picture of St. Lucia’s external competitiveness. St. Lucia’s real
effective exchange rate (REER) is at its lowest level in 20 years, reflecting the depreciation
of the U.S. dollar against major currencies. However, real wages have increased, the terms
of trade has deteriorated since 2000, and in recent years St. Lucia experienced a decline in
its share of stayover visitors to the Caribbean. Analysis undertaken by Fund staff finds that
the REER was close to its estimated equilibrium level, suggesting that the exchange rate, if
supported by fiscal and wage policies, will remain competitive.
Broad money growth remained strong in 2007, and prudential indicators point to a
strengthening of the financial system. Despite a softening in economic activity, demand for
credit by firms and households has continued to rise. As a result, commercial banks have
accelerated their drawdown of net foreign assets to expand their loan portfolio. Meanwhile,
the health of the financial sector continues to strengthen. Provisioning, asset quality and
capital adequacy all improved in 2007. Nonperforming loans (NPLs) of local banks continue
to decline. However, the decline in the NPL ratio reflects in part the continued growth in
bank lending, which could engender future problem loans, especially in the event of any
large macroeconomic shock.
There has been some progress toward strengthening the financial supervisory and
regulatory framework. The authorities have enhanced supervision of nonbanks by
strengthening the Financial Services Supervision Unit, and expect to pass in 2008 the
OECS-wide uniform Cooperatives Society Act, uniform Insurance Act, and uniform Money
Services Act. However, progress has been slow in developing a broad supervisory
framework to regulate all nonbank financial intermediaries. While a Single Regulatory Unit
for nonbanks (including the offshore financial sector, domestic insurance sector, credit
unions, money transfer institutions, and the soon-to-be-established National Development
Bank) was approved by Cabinet in 2006, it has not yet been fully implemented.
There has also been progress in implementing broad structural reforms. On fiscal issues,
the authorities intend to enhance the tax base by the introduction of a more flexible
mechanism for retail fuel pricing in 2008, a market valuation-based property tax in
FY 2009/10, and a revenue-positive VAT in FY 2009/10. Regarding the real sector, the
erosion of trade preferences for bananas has negatively affected employment creation,
income levels, and the general standard of living in the island’s rural communities; the
authorities have announced their intention to develop a five-year strategic management
plan, with a view to promote diversification in the agriculture sector. They have also
attempted to bolster the country’s social safety nets to alleviate poverty. St. Lucia is one of
the world’s most disaster-prone countries, and has made good progress in bolstering

3

national disaster mitigation and preparedness, including by the enhancement of the National
Emergency Management Organization, improvements to the national disaster response
plan, and participation in regional risk pooling.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors observed that although economic activity was flat in 2007, growth is
likely to accelerate in 2008 and 2009, due to a rebound in agriculture, a recovery of tourism
receipts, and related support activities. Medium-term growth prospects are favorable, but
risks are tilted to the downside given the uncertainties in the external environment, in
particular with regard to the effect of energy price increases on tourist arrivals. Directors
considered that the reforms envisaged by the authorities aimed at strengthening the tourism
infrastructure, improving the investment climate, and diversifying exports would broaden the
bases of economic growth and reduce exposure to external shocks.
Directors welcomed the recent improvement in fiscal performance. They stressed the need
to maintain a primary surplus to ensure debt sustainability, and to help dampen inflationary
pressures. Directors called for a broadening of the tax base, along with stepped up
preparations for the introduction of the VAT. They encouraged the authorities to follow
through on commitments to introduce a more flexible retail fuel pricing mechanism to
achieve greater pass-through of world oil price increases, as well as market valuation-based
property taxation. Directors noted that achieving fiscal and debt sustainability will also
require greater prioritization of capital spending, limiting the civil service wage bill, and
enhancing debt management.
Directors noted that the acceleration in inflation appears to be due largely to the high prices
of imported food and fuel and the ongoing depreciation of the U.S. dollar. Given the negative
impact of inflation and the erosion of trade preferences on the purchasing power of the
poorest segment of society, Directors welcomed the government’s plan to sharpen its
poverty reduction programs, and commended the authorities’ efforts to strengthen social
safety nets.
Recognizing that St. Lucia’s currency, the Eastern Caribbean dollar, is pegged to the U.S.
dollar, Directors took note of the staff's assessment that the country’s real effective
exchange rate is in line with fundamentals. Directors saw the recent rise in the current
account deficit as reflecting adverse terms of trade shocks and a decline in tourism arrivals.
They noted further that the deficit remains almost fully financed by non-debt creating private
capital inflows, and that the current account imbalances are expected to decline over the
medium term to sustainable levels. Given the high level of public debt, Directors
emphasized the importance of sustained fiscal consolidation and structural reforms to
maintain competitiveness and support the stability of the region’s currency board
arrangement.
Executive Directors noted that continued rapid growth in private sector credit could erode
the quality of banks’ loan portfolios, and looked to effective supervision by the Eastern
Caribbean Central Bank to monitor closely banks’ credit quality and risk management
practices. Directors emphasized the need for the St. Lucian authorities to consolidate

4

regulation and supervision of nonbank financial intermediaries under an independent Single
Regulatory Unit, enhance supervision of international financial services, improve the AntiMoney Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regime, and terminate
unregulated investment schemes.
Directors called on the authorities to improve further the coverage and timeliness of
economic and social statistics, in particular on the national accounts, tourism, the balance of
payments, and public sector debt, and to devote adequate resources to this area. They
supported the authorities’ request for Fund technical assistance to strengthen the statistical
data base.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
