BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultations
Prepared by the Staff Representatives
for the 2005 Consultation with Bosnia and Herzegovina
Approved by Reza Moghadam and Donal Donovan
May 12, 2005

A staff team—Messrs. Doyle (head) and Kanda, and Ms. Petrova (all EUR), Ms. Wandwasi (FAD),
Mr. Mundkur (LEG) and Mr. Zeuner (PDR) visited Bosnia and Herzegovina during March 29–April 15,
2005 for discussions for the 2005 Article IV Consultation. It was assisted by Messrs. Norregaard and
Slack, Ms. Milic, and Ms. Selimovic-Mehmedbasic in the Res Rep’s office. Mr. Litman, Senior Advisor
of the Executive Director, also participated in the discussions.
The mission met: (a) at the State level, the chair of the State Presidency, Mr. Paravac; the Chair of the
Council of Ministers Mr. Terzic; the Minister of Finance and Treasury Ms. Maric; other senior Ministers;
and the Central Bank Governor Mr. Kozaric; (b) in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina: the Prime
Minister Mr. Hadzipasic; the Minister of Finance Mr. Vrankic; and (c) in the Republika Srpska: the
President Mr. Cavic; the Prime Minister Mr. Bukejlovic; the Minister of Finance Ms. Cenic. The mission
also met Lord Ashdown and Mr. Butler in the High Representative’s office, and representatives of the
international community, the judiciary, business and labor, and academics.
Directors at the last Article IV meeting in February 2004 welcomed progress in strengthening the
fiscal stance and structures, and urged accelerated structural reform.
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2004/pr0436.htm. Bosnia and Herzegovina has not accepted the
obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4.
Governance is complex. An internationally appointed “High Representative” oversees implementation of
the Dayton peace agreement using powers to appoint and dismiss elected officials, overrule and impose
legislation. Dayton established “The Entities” which exercise most economic powers: the Republika
Sprksa (RS), 1/3 of the population, is a centralized government structure, while “the Federation” with the
remaining population is decentralized, with 10 Cantons. “The State,” a small government unit above the
Entities, has focused on external matters, but its mandate is expanding to domestic issues also.
Nationalist parties are in coalition in various combinations at all levels of government, including the
new minority RS administration. The High Representative is actively promoting institutional reforms to
secure Bosnia and Herzegovina access to NATO’s Partnership for Peace and a Stabilization and
Association agreement with the EU. National elections are next due in fall of 2006, with new
administrations likely forming only some six months thereafter.
The authorities have assented to publication of this Staff Report.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has come a long way. Since Dayton in 1995, GDP has
trebled and exports have risen almost 10 times (Figure 1). Inflation has stabilized at industrial
country rates, anchored by the currency board. About half of activity is now accounted for by
the private sector and banks have been almost completely privatized to non-residents. And
the fiscal system, though
fractured, has delivered a
fiscal consolidation of

GDP in 4 years, taking
The 2002–04 SBA targeted fiscal consolidation of 3.3 percent of

Arrangements, and

assistance (TA) from many donors, including the Fund (Text Box 1, Appendix 1). In this

2.

Progress continued in 2004.

•

In the context of strong regional export market growth and recent large enterprise
restructurings, GDP grew an estimated 5¾ percent, led by mining, manufacturing and
energy and exports rose over 15 percent (Text Figure 1, Tables 1a-1b).

Fiscal data—like all macroeconomic data in Bosnia and Herzegovina—are subject to
significant margins of uncertainty, with domestic financing and arrears accumulation likely
sources of particular weakness in the budgetary estimates. All macroeconomic assessments
for Bosnia and Herzegovina are qualified by such data uncertainties.

But growth also
reflected credit-fueled
demand which spilled
into imports (Text
Table 1, Tables 2a-2c).
So despite strong
exports, the external
current account deficit
strengthened by only
½ percentage point to
17¼ percent of GDP
(tables 3a-3d).

Inflation continues to be low, and averaged 0.4 percent in 2004 (Figure 2).

And the fiscal stance
firmed, albeit by less
than targeted
(Text Table 2, Tables
4a-4i). Disappointing
revenues, particularly
customs and excises,
and slow progress on
demobilization
required various
offsetting adjustments,

2004 consolidated fiscal balance strengthened by 0.7 percentage points to a deficit of
0.6 percent of GDP, excluding bank recapitalization of ½ percent of GDP.
•

International reserves continued to increase, reaching 6 months of imports by end2004 (Figure 3).

3.
And structural fiscal reforms deepened alongside. Customs administration and
indirect tax policy have been unified into the State-level Indirect Tax Authority (ITA), with
many indirect tax revenues pooled into a single account from 2005 and distributed to
governments by formula. These arrangements pave the way for a VAT from end-2005—with
a single rate of 17 percent and an EU-standard structure—to replace the dual-rate sales tax.
Military demobilization continued, along with some downsizing of other government
workforces. Much of this reflected staff advice.
4.
The 2005 budgets are a
“holding operation” (Text
Table 3). They anticipate further
declines in revenue ratios as
regional FTAs are fully phased in,
and a modest tightening in the
fiscal balance from 2004 and a
primary surplus of 0.3 percent of
GDP—excluding one-off spending
items such as severance pay. The
authorities intend, however, to
tighten these targets by some
0.2 percent of GDP, largely by
expenditure cuts by the Federation
central government.

But a great deal remains to be done.

•

Unemployment and poverty are estimated to be in the mid-20s and over 30 percent
respectively, and output is still well below pre-war levels.

•

With due allowance for poor data quality—which remains despite considerable STA
TA—the external current account deficit is well above international norms and cannot
be sustained at those levels over the medium term, particularly in the context of
declining reconstruction aid inflows.2

-7-

•

The key domestic counterpart of the external deficit is widespread corporate lossmaking—hence national savings estimated at just 3 percent of GDP in 2004
(Text Table 4).3 And price and unit labor cost data suggest that profitability did not
improve in 2004 (Text Table 5). Strong growth in manufacturing production was
fully absorbed by increased paid employment in the Federation and by wage growth
in the RS (Figure 4).

And the prolonged boom of credit—non-government borrowing from banks is up by
21 percentage points of GDP since 2001—is aggravating pressures on the external
imbalance and may engender prudential concerns. Banks’ insistence on indexation to
the euro of longer term loans also suggests continued caution on their part in regard to
foreign currency risk.

6.

And looking ahead, the fiscal challenges are deepening.

•

The Entities’ 2004 domestic claims laws, which aimed to secure fiscal sustainability
by writing down heavy government domestic liabilities in 2004, have been blocked
by recent court rulings (Text Box 2).4

3

See Selected Economic Issues, Chapter 4.

4

See Selected Economic Issues, Chapter 6.

-8-

Some government operations have
already been disrupted by seizure of
their deposits and other assets in
execution of court awards for claimants
and incidence of this could increase
sharply. And since the rulings imply
much higher public liabilities than
anticipated, the primary balance
necessary to secure fiscal sustainability
may be well above the earlier estimated
1 percent of GDP—that was consistent
with the NPV of payouts of 10 percent
of GDP anticipated in the domestic
claims laws. Indeed, for example, a
primary surplus of 4 percent of GDP or
more may be needed if the court
mandates, when clarified, implicitly
require that domestic claims payouts be
made with an NPV of 50 percent of
GDP.

Text Box 2. Restructuring Domestic Liabilities
Citizens’ claims on government for war damages, bank
deposits seized during the war, expenditure arrears,
privatization coupons, etc., summed to over 200 percent of
GDP.
2004 laws restructured these into a set of KM Zero Coupon
Bonds—up to 50 years—and cash payouts. The implied
NPV of 10 percent of GDP combined with other debts,
yielded a NPV of total government debt of 35 percent of
GDP. Cash payouts under the deal have begun, as has
verification of all individual remaining claims.
Recent constitutional court rulings against bonds “up to 50
years” without interest for war damages, and mandating a
maximum maturity of bonds for frozen foreign account
holders of 15 years with coupons at “fair” (market) rates,
will imply a much higher NPV of domestic debt than
anticipated in the 2004 laws.

•

But at the same time, a swathe of policy initiatives—largely sponsored by the
international community—imply significant increases in primary spending in the near to
medium term.5 These include plans to expand State-level ministries, to shift security
functions to the State level, to expand municipal investments, to secure ethnic
diversification at all levels of all civil services, and to raise public investment. These
could add over 4 percent of GDP permanently to primary spending.

•

There is no domestic institution tasked with designing and implementing overarching
fiscal policies.6 Thus, the consolidated fiscal balance is not targeted, controlled, or even
monitored domestically. These core fiscal tasks have hitherto effectively been outsourced
to Fund staff.

•

And the VAT is coming in 2006.7 But preparations are behind schedule: software and IT
systems are not yet in place, and registration, public information, and recruitment of staff
are lagging. And since VAT in this case involves the simultaneous introduction of a new
tax and a new tax administration, implementation risks are high even if all technical
preparations are completed. Alongside, the entire structure of financing arrangements for

-9-

all cantons and municipalities, hitherto based on sales tax collected in their areas, will
need to change because this basis for funding is not technically feasible with a VAT.
7.
These challenges arise in the context of—and in anticipation of—profound
transitions in governance. The current High Representative’s term ends by end-2005, his
office thereafter transforming into an EU-led body which is expected to make little use of the
executive powers vested in it. And national elections are due in the fall of 2006. Ahead of
both these events, signs of adjustment fatigue are emerging: calls for a reorientation of policy
from “stability” to “development,” for increased pensions, budget wages, and social benefits,
the partial abrogation of free trade agreements with Serbia and Montenegro and Croatia in
2004–05, and the slow progress with privatization and broader restructuring of the corporate
sector are all symptomatic of this.
II. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
8.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has achieved a degree of stability that once seemed
unattainable, most clearly symbolized by the currency board.
9.
But the challenges appear daunting. With reconstruction aid inflows dropping and
unemployment already high even as international refugee returns continue apace, a large
external current account correction is in prospect. Reconciling this with growth and
employment objectives will not be straightforward. Indeed, labyrinthine government
structures, the progressive transition in governance as the OHR steps back, and adjustment
fatigue are already straining policy implementation and social absorption capacity. And all
these challenges will be compounded by need to reconcile court mandates for large claimant
payouts with the myriad of calls from the international community for additional primary
spending.
10.
In this context, the authorities hesitate to press ahead decisively with reform.
While they acknowledge its general necessity, they regard stability as broadly assured and
emphasize need for greater focus on social concerns rather than on sustainability. And
notwithstanding the coming OHR exit, there are few signs on their part of purposeful formal
coordination of fiscal policymaking. This has impeded efforts to agree a successor
arrangement to the 2002-04 SBA with the Fund so far.
11.
Discussions took place in this context. Given an assessment of external
sustainability, the appropriate fiscal stance was discussed, and within that, approaches to
reconciling claims payouts with other future calls on public resources. The implications for
fiscal policymaking structures, taking account of the OHR transition, and for measures to
sustain output and raise employment growth were derived from this, along with assessments
of the monetary and exchange regime and of policies for 2005–06.
A. External and Fiscal Sustainability
12.
The authorities regard the external deficit as a concern, but not an imminent
threat. They stressed that circumstances in Bosnia and Herzegovina are unusual, and the
data are unreliable: remittances, imports, and nominal GDP could all be under-recorded,

- 10 -

distorting measured deficits to GDP ratios.8 Further, external sovereign indebtedness—albeit
affected by the U.S. dollar depreciation—has been declining, suggesting unrecorded inward
transfers or/and non-debt creating inflows. And risks of sudden stops may be muted given the
absence of portfolio flows, the reassurance provided by the presence of the OHR and
peacekeepers, and the scarcity of intelligible high frequency macroeconomic data available to
the public which might arouse concerns.
13.
Staff noted that persistent large external deficits and credit booms have heralded
instability elsewhere.9 While the links are not automatic, and circumstances are indeed
unusual, unstable fiscal structures, widespread corporate loss-making, and possible prudential
issues arising from the bank credit boom all raise serious concerns. Moreover, the comfort
derived from the sovereign debt trends is qualified by sharply declining aid inflows, lack of
data on trends in net private external indebtedness, and uncertainties in assessing
competitiveness (¶37). And given the absence of capital controls and the public memory of
hyperinflation, shocks—perhaps political in origin as the OHR winds down—could be
unsettling. With Bosnia and Herzegovina’s external deficit an outlier in international,
transition, currency board, and even post-conflict experience, there seemed little room for
complacency.
14.
Thus, policies should ensure a
decline in the external deficit. The
authorities agreed that at least a modest
decline in the external deficit should be
secured in the short term through demand
restraint, anticipating a more decisive
reduction yielded by structural reforms
further out. They suggested that given
some recent corporate restructurings, the
strengthening in the external deficit in
2004, and reassuring trends in external
debt, albeit based on incomplete data, an
immediate sizeable squeeze on demand
did not appear warranted and would
aggravate social strains (Text Box 3). But
if the monthly external trade trends turned
adverse, a more decisive fiscal and/or
monetary-cum-regulatory tightening
would be appropriate in the short term.

Text Box 3. Large Company Restructurings
Recent company restructuring and FDI could boost
GDP and the trade balance quickly. A group of large
restructured firms, surveyed by staff, anticipate this.
They expect their exports, which were 13 percent of
BiH exports in 2003, to exceed all 2003 BiH exports
within two years.

Sustainability is achievable in a strong reform context. With the authorities relying
almost completely on staff for macroeconomic projections, they agreed that a steady decline
in the current account deficit towards single digits over four years was possible (Text Table
6, Table 5). This would reflect the impact of company and labor market reforms (¶32) and
reduced public consumption on corporate and public savings. With efficiency gains likely to

along with the short-term
effects of corporate restructuring being offset by the latter’s growth enhancing effects.
Inflation is projected to remain low, anchored by the currency board.
16.
But the court rulings on domestic claims compound the challenges. Though the
authorities intend, in coordination with OHR, to seek further guidance from the court of its
requirements, the NPV of these obligations will likely be much higher than had been
anticipated in the domestic claims laws. This will require, at the point at which that NPV is
quantified, a commensurate strengthening in the primary fiscal balance to restore fiscal
sustainability. And, given possible differential indebtedness between the entities, the
adjustment required could be very different between them. But delays in enumerating the
outstanding claims mean that this “point of quantification” could be a year or so away.
17.
In this context, staff drew three implications. While doubt remains as to the
increase in the NPV of the mandated claims payouts compared with 10 percent of GDP
anticipated in the 2004 laws, the consolidated fiscal primary surplus should remain at least as
strong as was consistent with sustainability under the payouts anticipated in those laws—a
surplus of 1 percent of GDP. In addition, cash payouts budgeted in 2005 under those laws
should be suspended unless they are in execution of specific court awards. And all discussion
of restitution payouts—to compensate claimants for seizure of property post 1945—should
be postponed until the burden of domestic debts was clarified. The authorities demurred on
the first (Section F), but agreed otherwise.
18.
All agreed, however, that in the absence of strong reforms, exports could falter
and external and domestic imbalances could widen. In this context, continued rapid credit
growth and any increases in the fiscal deficit will raise the external deficit further. And in the

- 12 -

absence of structural reforms, activity and employment growth will weaken. Accordingly,
economic stability will be endangered.
B. Taxation and Expenditure Policies
19.
Given spending pressures, the authorities hoped to raise revenue ratios, notably
via strengthened tax administration. Though at 49 percent of GDP, revenue ratios
(including grants) appears burdensome, the authorities noted that GDP may be understated
by half—implying a revenue ratio closer to one-third of GDP, low internationally.10 And tax
evasion is high, VAT will assist efforts to combat it, and added revenue could support more
spending.
20.
Staff acknowledged the pressures, but counseled against anticipating higher
revenue ratios in spending plans. Given uncertain quantification of the grey economy and
VAT yields, the evident waste in spending, and risk that increasing tax burdens could
discourage activity, spending should remain contained with tax rates lowered pro rata
alongside improvements in tax administration. And any permanent revenue windfall from the
VAT might best be used to lower labor taxes rather than to boost spending. At 52 percent of
the net wage (including benefits) in the RS and 69 percent of the net wage (excluding
benefits) in the Federation, these discourage tax compliance and jobs. All agreed, however,
that given the state of technical preparations, VAT should not be introduced before end-2005.
21.
These considerations frame the scope for public spending. The authorities have
established, at OHR’s initiative, a “Fiscal Sustainability Group”—consisting of
representatives of government from all levels and academics—to identify budget savings. Its
first recommendation was to lower State level remuneration towards those paid by the Entity
governments, a proposal staff welcomed for its role in lowering state building costs and
signaling wage restraint to all levels of government and the private sector. Staff suggested
that the group be provided with a mandate—to prepare a menu of permanent cuts summing
to 10 percent of tax and nontax revenues—to legitimize and focus its work, noting that
spending on the social safety net warranted particular attention (Text Box 4). A menu of
options on this scale would be needed to address prospective fiscal pressures, allow a shift
from current to investment spending in the budgets, and make room for increased operations
and maintenance expenditure.

Text Box 4. The Social Safety Net
The social safety net has three key components: veterans’ programs; and pension, disability, and
unemployment programs, and the Social Welfare and Child Protection (SWCP) system. These are
expensive, poorly targeted, uncoordinated, and highly uneven in their coverage of beneficiaries.
•

Veterans programs are provided by the Entity central governments, both to veterans and their extended
families. Monthly benefits are relative to certified injury and are often as high as the average Entity
monthly wage. Total budget spending on veterans benefits accounts for 7¾ of Federation consolidated
central, cantonal, and municipal government spending, and 5¾ percent in the RS in 2004.

•

Pensions, disability, and unemployment benefits are provided by extrabudgetary funds at Entity central
government level. Pension and unemployment eligibility depends on contributions, while disability
benefit is universal for certified invalids. 486,000 pensioners, 8,700 unemployed, and 94,000 invalids
received benefits in 2004 amounting to 23 percent of consolidated Entity, cantonal, and municipal
government spending. Funding for the schemes has been compromised by high rates of non-payment of
contributions, which also lowers individuals’ entitlements. And collections shortfalls have typically
required pension payouts below standard entitlements in the RS, despite additional funding from the
central government budget. Eligibility for cash unemployment benefit expires after a year, but health
contributions continue to be made by the unemployment fund thereafter until employment is secured.
Active labor market programs are virtually non-existent. Average monthly disability benefit is
approximately 1/3 of the average monthly wage.

•

The SWCP is operated by cantons and municipalities in the Federation and by the central government
and municipalities in the RS. It provides benefits in cash and kind, including to children and the elderly
from low income households. Data are incomplete, but Federation central and cantonal government
spending on these schemes totaled at least 0.4 percent of consolidated Federation budget spending in
2004. Many poorer households have not received benefits for years. In the RS, only one-tenth of those
registered as in need receive benefits. This partly reflects the low revenue base in poorer cantons and
municipalities, but may also reflect double dipping by some beneficiaries exploiting the lack of
coordination between the multiple social welfare programs.

Accordingly, there is need to strengthen the social safety net to anticipate both the impact of the single rate
of VAT, the possible effects of corporate restructuring on the poor, and to lower the burden it places on the
budgets. To this end, a recent FAD TA mission recommended centralization of the SWCP at the Entity
central government level, supported by harmonized policy and financing mechanisms there. And the IBRD
calls for significant rationalization and retrenchment of the veterans benefit schemes. Plans for a threepillar pension structure are under preliminary discussion. But ahead of that, in the context of corporate
restructuring, the pension schemes could be significantly affected by calls for governments to ignore gaps
in contribution histories for workers and pensioners in determining individual’s monthly pension
entitlements.

- 14 -

C. Fiscal Architecture
22.
This fiscal agenda will require strong policymaking structures, especially given
the prospective loss of the OHR as an organizing force. The authorities acknowledged
shortcomings here—including that the consolidated fiscal balance is not targeted, controlled,
or even monitored domestically. But addressing these concerns is complicated by the lack of
consensus on the future structure of governments and the degree to which the Dayton
constitutional compromises should be retained (Text Box 5). In this context, the task is to
find an approach to strengthening formal fiscal coordination which achieves a level of
consensus even though views remain divergent in the wider constitutional debates.

Text Box 5. Two Options for Governmental and Fiscal Structures
With secessionist sentiment receding—albeit still present—discussion of options for
constitutional reform focuses on two broad approaches.
1. Core coordinating (and most other) fiscal tasks could be centralized at the State level,
alongside a shift in other fiscal functions down to Municipal level. The transfers in both
directions could be incremental. The State could expand by absorbing more resources from the
single account at the expense of the Entity central governments and Cantons, and borrowing by
issuing bonds under a framework State debt law now being drafted. An eventual centralized
structure would mirror those internationally and would meet various EU requirements. And
when sufficiently large relative to other government levels, the State could thereby effect control
of consolidated fiscal developments. This would imply a major shift from the Dayton
compromises.
2. The status quo could continue, but with specific expenditure functions shifted to and taken up
de novo by the State on a case by case basis. This would respect the compromises struck at
Dayton while adapting them to specific EU accession needs. But this approach would leave the
coordination of consolidated fiscal developments and the unusually complex structure of
government unaddressed. And it leaves the transfer of functions to the State subject to case-bycase—and likely contentious—negotiations.
In either case, transitions to the structures are likely to be protracted. And during those
transitions, the consolidated fiscal balance could deteriorate unless additional State drawings
from the single account, its borrowing, and any expansions of municipal functions are closely
coordinated with matching expenditure reductions at other levels of government. This
coordination, which has to be achieved with and by government structures as they now exist,
will be essential to fiscal sustainability.

23.
One promising avenue is development of the role of the Indirect Tax Authority
(ITA) Board. The three key Ministers of Finance already determine their indirect tax
policies there. And it houses a small technical macro unit, with resident FAD TA. But the
authorities emphasized that this initiative will need to go further if it is to anchor broader
fiscal coordination effectively.

- 15 -

24.

In this context, two aspects of its operations were discussed.

•

Though the 2004 Indirect Tax System (ITS) law envisages that the ITA Board—on
which the Entities enjoy a strong voice—will “determine” indirect tax policy, in
practice the State parliament alone does so. With funding for the State invariant to
indirect tax collections, the State Parliament’s decisions are not disciplined by need
for revenue at State level. But Entities’ and Cantonal budgets are substantially funded
from this source. The Entity authorities expressed dissatisfaction with these
arrangements and proposed that changes to indirect tax policies (as defined in the
Act) should require the formal approval of both the ITA Board and the State
parliament to ensure effective coordination between revenue decisions and
expenditure needs at different levels of government. The staff agreed. And though the
State authorities preferred current arrangements, they agreed to pursue this change.

•

Further, the ITS law provides that the State can unilaterally determine its annual
drawings from the ITA single account, leaving the residual funds to the Entities. This
provides unchecked funding for expansions of State-level activities—a major
attraction for those favoring such expansions.11 But this unilateral element delinks
increased State spending from commensurate Entity cuts, thereby compromising
discipline over the consolidated budget balance of all governments. Again, the State
authorities were less persuaded by these concerns than were those of the Entities. But
given the need for fiscal discipline, the authorities agreed that, subject to State
parliamentary consent to the amendment, such annual State withdrawals should be
subject to formal prior approval by Entity Ministers of Finance.

25.
With the ITA Board strengthened in this way, it could evolve into a formal
National Fiscal Council (NFC).12 The notion is that each year, once the NFC has set a target
consolidated fiscal balance and allocated it among the constituent governments, “mutual
surveillance”—by the various authorities of each other—could ensure implementation of
those targets. This would require data transparency—notably timely publication of detailed
high frequency fiscal outturn data. And it would require appropriate borrowing rules on
cantonal and municipal governments to control the evolution of their consolidated balances.13
To this end, the authorities proposed to convene a prototype NFC immediately, consisting of
the three Prime Ministers and Ministers of Finance and the CBBH Governor, with its initial
work focusing on coordinating preparations for the 2006 budgets. And they undertook to
commence regular publication of monthly fiscal outturn data promptly. Staff welcomed these
initiatives.

- 16 -

26.
This will also require reliable macro statistics. The authorities agreed that with
some notable exceptions, the quality of macro data is poor—even if it has served as a basis
for program design. This undermines effective policymaking and Fund surveillance. The
authorities propose to address these difficulties through voluntary coordination between the
three statistics agencies, though staff urged adoption of a single budget for all statistical
offices to secure that coordination in perpetuity.
D. Corporate Restructuring
27.
All policy objectives are complicated by the fact that output is still well below
pre-war levels.
28.
The authorities acknowledge that corporate weaknesses are a key constraint.
Their problems—including low capacity utilization, outdated equipment, and excess debts—
have multiple roots: former Yugoslav worker-manager structures; disruptions of civil war;
voucher privatization; lack of bankruptcy procedures; corruption; and protracted neglect by
donors. About 60 percent of SOEs and a similar share of voucher privatized firms report
losses, predominantly funded from inter-company, wage, and contribution arrears.14
29.
The issues have begun to be tackled. Legal administration to enforce strong 2003
bankruptcy laws is being built with USAID TA. Some SOEs are again being put up for sale.
And various rounds of the “Bulldozer project” to curb red tape have been completed. But
overall, progress has been slow and Bosnia and Herzegovina still typically scores low on
regional league tables of “places to do business”.
30.
Further steps are being discussed with the IBRD. But sensitive to the need to
minimize social costs, the authorities incline to a five part strategy:
•

Arrangements to close gaps in pension and other social contribution histories for
workers, including those to be laid off

•

Debt reschedulings, write-offs, and equity swaps for firms being privatized

•

Asset sales incorporating employment and other guarantees

•

Modest application of bankruptcy procedures, and

•

Further bank credit to support production.

31.
Staff urged a more ambitious program than the authorities envisaged. As the
authorities suggested, debt restructuring was necessary, not least to facilitate new credit
flows. And intentions to restructure debts only in the context of changes of ownership were
welcome. But with only a handful of companies fully privatized in 2004 and fiscal
14

See Selected Economic Issues, Chapter 4.

- 17 -

sustainability in doubt, a more determined approach—including forceful application by the
tax and privatization authorities of bankruptcy and liquidation procedures—seemed
unavoidable. And given fiscal constraints, concessions on gaps in contribution histories
would need to be strictly limited, with social concerns addressed by minimizing frictional
unemployment, rather than ameliorated with social benefits and employment guarantees.
While challenging, transition experience elsewhere—notably Hungary’s bankruptcy reforms
in 1993—and the rapid recovery of the relatively few restructured firms in Bosnia and
Herzegovina suggests that this tough approach works (Text Box 3, ¶14). And with large
swathes of business property subject to possible claims for restitution in kind, staff suggested
that intentions in this regard should be determined on as limited a basis and as soon as
possible so as to prevent this from further discouraging new investment. A multi-faceted
IBRD program on corporate restructuring is anticipated for end-2005.
32.
Labor market institutions would need reform alongside. These are, de facto, little
reformed from Yugoslav arrangements and the labor markets are consequently sclerotic;
business representatives say that hiring new workers is “the last thing we do.” Thus,
collective agreements often set contracted wage rates above corporate capacity to pay, and
furthermore, indexation of wage floors to average wages paid in the Federation establishes a
feedback loop. Consequently, corporates frequently accumulate wage arrears, with up to a
fifth of non-government workers, outside of the utilities, not being paid in full each month.
The Federation is considering elimination of this feedback loop. But given the stock of wage
arrears outstanding, the legal requirement to pay all wage arrears and severance before
dismissal also needs to be relaxed to facilitate labor shedding. And the complex system of
collective bargaining and rigid wage ladders (coefficients) stymies flexibility. Staff noted that
with bankruptcy procedures commencing, reforms in these areas would aid shedding of
excess labor, and encourage alignment of contracted with paid remuneration. And they would
mitigate frictional unemployment.
33.
But recent trade protectionist initiatives move policy in the opposite direction.
Unilateral partial abrogation of regional free trade area agreements (FTAs) in 2004–05 has
raised tariffs on some food products. And this follows introduction of two “import tariff
quotas” on meat and cars in late-2004. The authorities noted that their overall level of tariff
protection was in their view low—an average unweighted tariff of 6½ percent—and that
subsidies provided by trading partners to their producers disadvantaged Bosnian competitors,
therefore requiring a meaningful response. Nonetheless, staff emphasized that trade
protection was no solution to underlying corporate weaknesses, or an effective means of
addressing social concerns. Thus, the authorities intention to settle the trade disputes on a
consensual basis was welcome, and it would facilitate a more purposeful pursuit of WTO
membership that could be finalized in 2006.
E. The Monetary and Exchange Rate Regimes and the Financial Sector
34.
In this challenging context, the authorities remain committed to the currency
board. They noted that in difficult circumstances, it had secured price stability and that it
enjoyed the confidence of the public—as reflected both in the 2002 surge in local currency
notes and coin in circulation after the introduction of euro notes and coin, and, until recently,

- 18 -

in the rising share of local currency in total bank deposits.15 Though some private
commentators suggest that the regime is “good for stability” but “bad for development,” the
monetary authorities regarded consideration of any other regime in Bosnia and Herzegovina
as “an adventure” which could jeopardize both. Accordingly, the only plausible exit would
be to euroization, given aspirations to eventual EU accession. Staff agreed. The currency
board had established a critical degree of credibility, minimizing the burden on policies in
other areas to anchor price expectations. But its sustainability requires strong policy actions,
including measures to address the large external imbalance.
35.
Alongside, the financial sector needs to remain strong. Wholesale bank
privatization in 1998-2002, recapitalization, state-level deposit insurance from 2002, and
strengthened regulation—including enforcement of phased in liquidity and forex exposure
rules in 2003-04—had created a vibrant banking sector. But staff noted concern that credit
risk problems could emerge following several years of a credit boom, even though this was
not yet evident in the NPL data (Text Box 6).The regulators agreed that the banking sector
could not be completely isolated from the broader difficulties in the corporate sector and the
wider economy. They also agreed that the weak legal framework called for heightened
regulatory surveillance. And they regretted that proposals to strengthen supervision by
bringing the two Entity supervisory bodies into the Central Bank were on hold, a hiatus
which also compounded difficulties with their funding. Staff encouraged early completion of

15

See Selected Economic Issues, Chapter 2.

- 19 Text Box 6. Credit Risks in the Banking System
Bank credit to the private sector has increased by 21 percentage points of GDP in the past 3 years, following
bank privatization in 1998-2002. A recent MFD study of credit risks arising in this context concluded: (i)
The return on assets for the banking sector was 0.6 percent in 2004, low given the risks arising in a
transition economy, (ii) banks’ resilience against shocks to credit quality, reflected in stress tests, is not
high—an increase of 6–9 percent in classified loans, assuming full provisioning, would cause the two least
capitalized of the largest nine banks to breach the minimum 12 percent capital adequacy requirement, absent
fresh capital. These results appear to reflect stiff competition for market share.
Furthermore, banks face challenges in assessing and anticipating credit risk. (i) Given poor quality financial
data for most borrowers, banks rely more on evaluation of collateral than on rigorous risk assessments. (ii)
Collateral is typically in the form of real estate, which has a thin market complicating assessments of market
value. (iii) Banks consequently require an additional margin of collateral, but the adequacy of this
requirement is hard to confirm. (iv) And to the extent that provisioning reflects collateral, it may be
inadequate if the collateral is overvalued.
On the other hand, most of the credit growth has been generated by the six largest banks, all of which are
foreign owned. There is little evidence of an asset bubble—which would artificially inflate collateral prices.
A pledge registry and a credit bureau have been established, which will help banks carry out deeper analyses
of credit risk. NPL ratios have continued to improve—albeit in part because of the rapid pace of growth of
total loans—and most loans are small and fairly well diversified. And the weakest banks are small and pose
little systemic risk.
Recommendations for improving credit risk include: (i) further strengthen supervision, by increasing the
capacity to conduct credit risk analysis, more frequent onsite supervision, merging the entity banking
agencies into the central bank, increasing resources for supervision, and preparing a new State level banking
law using EU banking directives as benchmarks; (ii) improve banks’ credit culture, by encouraging banks to
carry out deeper credit analysis and to insist on reliable financial statements from borrowers, encouraging
use of the credit bureau or developing a large loan register at the State level, improving loan classification to
reflect a more risk-based assessment of loans, and strengthening banks’ internal risk management.

this transfer, noting that in the currency board setting, effective supervision is essential. And
staff welcomed the enactment of AML legislation at the State level in 2004, replacing earlier
Entity-level legislation.
36.
CBBH law amendments in 2004 were made in this context. With CBBH capital
approaching 9 percent of monetary liabilities, dividend payments of 60 percent of annual
profits (up from zero previously) will be made from 2005 and the State’s mandatory
recapitalization of the Bank if its capital declines below 5 percent of monetary liabilities is
eliminated. The monetary authorities noted that fiscal strains could be ameliorated by
commencing dividend payments and that uncertainties could be minimized by making those
payments nondiscretionary. In a stable environment, CBBH capital was expected to continue
to rise modestly even with the anticipated dividend payouts. Staff noted that assessments
should also consider more difficult environments, and that in such circumstances any
weakening of bank capital could compound problems. And the abolition of mandatory
recapitalization weakened assurances for the Bank. The latter was a particular concern given
hopes to shift banking supervision—and the associated contingent liabilities—into the Bank.
37.
And competitiveness needs to strengthen. Given current corporate and labor market
structures, impressionistic evidence on price competitiveness—including as reflected in
macroeconomic imbalances—gave the monetary authorities some cause for concern, even
allowing recent growth of exports. But multiple post conflict and transition shocks render the
evidence difficult to interpret. In this context, and given the lack of a plausible alternative
exchange rate regime, all policies would remain focused on securing alignment of price and
wage levels to the exchange rate. Staff agreed. While the CPI-REER has depreciated in
recent years, as the Serbian Dinar appreciated, the relative price of non-traded goods has
reportedly risen as have ULCs relative to output prices (Text Table 5, Figure 4). This is
suggestive of a profits squeeze in the tradable sector, underscored by ongoing accumulation
of wage arrears. But none of these indicators is statistically robust. And in the context of the
firm commitment to the currency board, decisive fiscal, corporate, and labor (including State
remuneration) policies could help to secure any corrections which might be needed to align
aggregate prices and wages.
F. Fiscal Balance and Credit Growth Goals: 2005–06
38.
Given the medium term focus of efforts to lower the external deficit, the
authorities propose policies accommodating significant further flows of credit to the
private sector in 2005. Their budgets anticipate a primary surplus of ¼ percent of GDP. But
they propose a modest further tightening in their budget targets, of some 0.2 percent of GDP
via expenditure cuts in the Federation central government budget, to offset unanticipated
deficits in the 2005 cantonal budgets, and thereby to allow unabated credit growth consistent
with external objectives (Text Table 7). Staff emphasized the need for the target primary
balance to be at least as strong as required for fiscal sustainability under the 2004 domestic
claims laws—a primary balance of 1 percent—and to support the external correction, even
ahead of a decisive corporate restructuring program. This suggested need for a further modest

- 21 -

tightening in the 2005 balance target, and maintenance of at least that primary surplus in the
budgets for 2006.

39.
In this context, risks to execution of 2005 fiscal targets also needed to be
addressed. Though 2005 revenue projections are broadly appropriate, recent adjustments in
the Federation cantons, on RS police pay, the delayed implementation of anticipated
reductions in State remuneration rates, and dividend projections all raise concerns. And the
evolution of collections through the single account—prone to uncertainty as this is a major
structural innovation—should be closely monitored.
40.
And, for 2006, two fiscal risks loom. First, all agreed that uncertainties in VAT
proceeds should be reflected in the adoption of spending reserve (“delayed spending lists”)
including at State level, execution of which would be contingent on actual revenue
collections. If revenue exceeded projections, the authorities anticipated raising spending,
while staff suggested that reductions in labor tax rates might be more appropriate. And
second, the wholesale redesign on cantonal and municipal funding, necessitated by the VAT,
could generate various fiscal strains. Staff urged early action to redesign these arrangements.
41.
On the credit side, the authorities proposed to monitor credit and external trade
trends closely. Staff suggested that a correction in the current account deficit may require a
policy tightening. With a primary fiscal balance of 1 percent of GDP, credit growth in the
“low 20s” in 2005 would be consistent with a strengthening in the external current account
balance of some ½ percent of GDP in 2005, and a further 1½ percent in 2006. While the most
recent annualized credit growth rates exceed this guideline, it was too early to determine the
case for corrective action, not least because of the uncertainties in the credit-external balance
relationship. But frequent reviews of credit and external developments should be conducted
through the year to determine if current settings of policy instruments are adequate to secure
the external goal.

- 22 -

III. STAFF APPRAISAL
42.
A decade into peace, it is remarkable how much has changed—and how little.
Socialist planning, war, economic collapse, and inflation have long gone. But peacekeepers,
the OHR, unemployment, a swathe of state-owned companies, domestic claims, external
deficits and the fractured constitution remain. And while economic growth appears to have
been strong in 2004—buoyed by exports and a credit boom—imports, including consumption
goods, have surged. Thus, the external current account deficit remains a striking pointer to
fundamental structural weaknesses. If aspirations to sustained prosperity, full assertion of
sovereignty, and EU membership are to be realized, those weaknesses need to be addressed.
43.
The currency board is an essential anchor to further progress. Because it enjoys
credibility and so is stabilizing price expectations, it thereby minimizes the burden on other
policies to do so. It thereby supports growth and development.
44.
But it must be sustainable and that requires policy action. In particular, fiscal and
external sustainability, effective policy-making institutions, a vibrant corporate sector, sound
public services, and a robust financial sector are required. And with the external deficit
apparently far outside international norms, policies need to ensure that the deficit falls
decisively, even in the short term, anticipating a structural reform-induced decline into a
sustainable range further out. These steps are needed to secure economic growth and the
viability of the anchor.
45.
The most immediate challenge to this prospect is domestic claims. The court
rulings against the 2004 domestic claims restructuring laws implicitly constitutes a
“helicopter drop” of debt on the governments, the quantum of which is yet to be determined.
And government operations may be increasingly disrupted by court enforcement of the
claims. While efforts continue to clarify the court rulings, processes to verify the claims and
to present government concerns effectively in court need to be accelerated. And until the
court’s requirements are clear, payments executing the domestic claims plans should be
suspended. All parties concerned should coordinate activities in this area directly and only
through the OHR. If the constitutional court insists on large payouts to claimants, major
permanent adjustments to budget spending will be needed. In anticipation of this,
consideration of financial restitution should be suspended, and any social plan for workers as
part of the corporate restructuring agenda will need to be strictly limited.
46.
Given these pressures, discipline on government spending will be essential. So
reforms now anticipated—state building, expansion of municipal and cantonal activities, new
public investment, civil service reforms, etc—many of which are sponsored and designed by
the international community, need to be reengineered to minimize their budgetary costs.
Early reductions in state remuneration rates are a key first step and should be supported by
clear prioritization among the various state building programs. Spending increases should be
contingent on offsetting spending cuts, drawn from a menu of options to be prepared by the
“Fiscal Sustainability Group.” The latter should be provided with a mandate jointly by the
State and the Entities to identify cuts summing to at least 10 percent of consolidated budget
revenue, and spending on social programs should form a focus for its deliberations.

- 23 -

47.
Alongside, revenue policies need to be strengthened. Thus, the single account in
the ITA and preparations for the VAT from end-2005 are welcome, though this date should
be reflected promptly in the law and administrative preparations for the tax should be
accelerated. Maintenance of the continued effectiveness of the sales tax administration during
2005 while the VAT administration is being built will be key. But anticipating increased tax
burdens would be counterproductive. Even if added revenues can be raised, this could retard
growth and employment, and therefore fiscal sustainability and development. Added revenue
should come from increasing economic activity, with broader fiscal pressures addressed by
this means and by exploiting the ample scope for efficiencies in spending. And with VAT
replacing the sales tax, preparations to design new arrangements to fund cantons and
municipalities from 2006 should begin without delay.
48.
And strengthened fiscal coordination is essential. As first steps, State unilateral
determination of its annual administrative expenditures should end, as should the State
Parliament’s de facto unfettered role in determining indirect tax policy. These steps,
establishing State accountability for expenditure and tying responsibility for revenue policy
more closely to that for spending, will set the stage for a broader sweep of actions—adoption
of an integrated formal calendar for all budgets, control of local government balances,
strengthened macro-analytical capacity and transparency of fiscal data—to secure effective
fiscal sovereignty and pave the way for establishment of a formal National Fiscal Council.
The initiative to set up a prototype for this immediately is welcome and its effectiveness will
require timely collation and publication of detailed consolidated monthly fiscal outturn data.
But none of this will work without a much more purposeful commitment to formal fiscal
coordination in practice than has been evident hitherto.
49.
Within these constraints, fiscal and external sustainability should guide
determination of the fiscal balance targets. With the NPV of court mandated payouts
likely much higher than anticipated in the domestic claims laws, the sustainable primary
surplus will probably be well above the earlier estimated level. In this case, deep expenditure
retrenchment will be needed to fund debt service on the claims. Until the implications of the
court rulings are clear, the primary surplus should be at least 1 percent of GDP. This would
also ensure that the fiscal sector achieves its primary task, given the low level of domestic
savings, by not drawing on them and thereby leaving them available to the private sector
where their developmental impact is greatest.
50.
In that light, the 2005 budget targets fall short. The necessary adjustment would
largely be achieved by the correction to the cantonal and Federation central government
budgets anticipated and would maximize room for private credit growth consistent with at
least a modest further external consolidation. And these corrections would maximize scope
for credit creation within the external constraint. But key risks to execution of these fiscal
plans—both in 2005 and in the context of VAT introduction from 2006—need to be
decisively addressed. With the momentum of economic growth strong, external concerns
should prevail in determining any mid-year policy adjustments in the event of adverse
developments.

- 24 -

51.
The financial system—especially the banking sector—remains supportive.
Largely privately owned, it enjoys the confidence of the public. But given the sustained
competition for market share and attendant risk of credit difficulties, loan quality should be
monitored closely and regulations firmly enforced. In this context, early completion of the
process to bring the banking agencies into the CBBH is encouraged. This will consolidate the
supervisory process, will reflect and encourage the increasing integration of the banking
system, and will secure improved coordination between prudential and credit policies.
52.
But resolving the broad sweep of economic challenges will require a root and
branch restructuring of the corporate sector. Privatization, bankruptcy, labor law changes,
and a social plan are key to this—the latter necessarily strictly limited given fiscal
constraints. Financial engineering—debt rescheduling, debt equity swaps, and the like, not
linked to sale to strategic investors—and trade protective initiatives, including suspension of
elements of the free trade area agreements, prolong rather than end corporate difficulties. An
early conclusion of discussions with the IBRD on these matters is needed, anticipating
decisive implementation of the reform program, as is full resumption of the FTA
arrangements and determined prosecution of membership of the WTO.
53.
Labor and restitution policies should support these efforts. Legal arrangements
allowing indefinite accrual of wage rights, regardless of attendance for work, need to be
rationalized, as do indexation arrangements in wage determination, notably in the Federation.
And with wage arrears so high in so many cases, scope to dismiss workers without clearance
of those arrears is an essential part of corporate rationalization.
54.
Even though the record suggests that remarkable progress is possible, the
challenges are considerable. The fiscal pressures could prove intense, notably if ambitious
and high cost international community sponsored plans for spending proceed unadjusted
alongside court mandates for large domestic claims payouts. In this context, the consolidated
budget balance could give way, even if fiscal architectural arrangements are strengthened and
a greater commitment to formal internal coordination of budgetary policies emerges. Social
pressures are also set to mount if corporate restructuring commences in earnest. And these
challenges have to be faced in the context of a fundamental shift in governance as the OHR
withdraws and in the run up to national elections. If economic growth remains strong and the
anticipated boost from firms already restructured comes through, this will provide some
relief. But if credit risks materialize and decisive broad-based corporate reform is delayed,
this relief could prove to be short-lived.
55.
Given the challenges, including the transition of governance, much more
effective internal formal fiscal coordination will be essential. That, and deep corporate
restructuring, will be key to sustaining development and stability.
56.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Bosnia and Herzegovina be
held within 12 months, subject to the applicable Executive Board decision on Article IV
consultation cycles.

ANNEX

BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA: DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
1.
This annex reviews indicators of public debt sustainability in Bosnia and
Herzegovina under the staff’s baseline scenario and discusses macroeconomic and debt
indicators under stress. It presents the staff’s baseline scenario for external and general
government debt in percent of GDP, average interest rates, and access to new credit for the
period through 2010. The alternative scenarios are based on shocks to various key
macroeconomic variables. The shocks are expressed as temporary deviations from the
baseline and are defined relative to historical averages for the period 2000-04, without
considering dynamic feedbacks.
2.
BIH’s general government debt relative to GDP has been on a declining trend.
While the regularization of old debts denominated in non-convertible currencies contributed
to this decline, real GDP growth rates averaging close to 6 percent and a major improvement
in the primary deficit have been the main reasons for the fall in the debt-to-GDP ratio from
42 percent of GDP in 2000 to 31 percent at end-2004.
3.
At end-2004, most of BIH’s reported external debt was public. However, the
share of private sector debt in total external debt has been rising, from about 30 percent of
total external debt at end-2000 to about 43 percent four years later, including banks’ foreign
liabilities. General government debt to the domestic banking sector denominated in domestic
currency continues to be negligible at about ¼ percent of GDP.
4.
The debt-servicing burden of BIH’s external debt is manageable. In 2004, interest
and amortization payments amounted to 1.7 percent of GDP. This is largely the result of
highly concessional borrowing from the World Bank (more than half of the general
government debt is owed to the World Bank). However, amortization payments have
increased as a share of total debt service, from one third in 2000 to two thirds four years later.
5.
BIH’s current and projected indebtedness is comfortable, even in the face of the
common array of shocks (Annex Tables 1 and 2). This fundamentally reflects that
economic growth is projected well above real interest rates and because the primary balance
is projected to remain firm through 2010.
6.
While this suggests that BIH has capacity to settle some of the vast amount of
domestic claims without compromising medium-term public debt sustainability, the
level of domestic indebtedness is being determined by the courts.16 If the court mandates
domestic debts of 50 percent of 2005 GDP in NPV terms, the general government debt-toGDP ratio would increase more than three times and remain well above 50 percent of GDP
by the end of the decade. The debt-stabilizing primary balance would have to improve from a
modest deficit to a surplus of at least 4 percent of GDP. While the DSA indicates that a 3percent surplus might be sufficient for stabilizing the debt-to-GDP ratio, the corresponding
16

overall fiscal deficits could not be financed, thus requiring the additional adjustment to a
surplus of 4 percent of GDP. In addition, external debt sustainability relies heavily on the
assumption that non-debt creating private inflows continue. In the baseline scenario, they
reduce external debt by more than 30 percent of GDP over the projection period. The
conclusions of the debt sustainability analysis are therefore conditional on the court rulings
on domestic claims and continued large private non-debt creating inflows.

VII. Safeguards Assessment
Under the Fund’s safeguards assessments policy, the Central Bank of Bosnia and
Herzegovina (CBBH) is subject to a full safeguards assessment with respect to any new
Stand-By Arrangement. The assessment was completed on January 24, 2005 and
concluded that safeguards in place at the CBBH appear generally adequate. However,
certain weaknesses were identified in the internal audit and control system, and the
safeguards assessment recommended measures to address them.

VIII. Exchange Rate Arrangements
The currency of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the convertible marka (KM), introduced on
August 11, 1997. On September 5, 2002, the State parliament approved an amendment to
the CBBH law that changes the peg of the KM from the DM to the Euro, under a currency
board arrangement. The KM is pegged to the euro at KM 1 = 0.5113 euro. Small
denominations of KM notes have been in circulation since June 22, 1998; large
denominations and coins were introduced in August 1998, and December 1998,
respectively. The convertible marka (KM) is the currency used for operations and
transactions with the Fund for Bosnia and Herzegovina.
Bosnia and Herzegovina maintains restrictions on payments and transfers for current
international transactions resulting from measures taken with respect to frozen foreign
currency deposits as identified in SM/02/44.

Last Article IV Consultation
Following the conclusion of the last SBA arrangement, Bosnia and Herzegovina is on the
twelve month cycle, subject to the provisions of the decision on consultation cycles
approved on July 15, 2002. The last Article IV consultation was concluded on February 25,
2004.

APPENDIX II

Bosnia and Herzegovina: IMF–World Bank Relations
A. Partnership in Bosnia and Herzegovina’s Poverty Reduction Strategy
1.
Bosnia and Herzegovina’s (BiH’s) progress from post-conflict recovery has been
underpinned by substantial fiscal adjustment, adherence to the currency board arrangement
introduced in 1997 and efforts to advance structural reforms. The IMF has the lead in
assisting BH maintain macroeconomic stability and ensuring fiscal sustainability.
Negotiations on a new Stand-by-Arrangement began in February 2005 following the
expiration of the previous arrangement in 2003. The World Bank, meanwhile, has taken the
lead in providing post-conflict reconstruction, followed by continued support of wideranging structural and institutional reforms. The Bank also supported the State and Entity
Governments with the finalization of the Medium-Term Development Strategy/Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP).
2.
After extensive consultations across both Entities for more than eighteen months, the
PRSP was agreed by the Entity and State governments in February 2004 to guide priority
policy actions through 2007. The PRSP has also taken into consideration the
recommendations of the European Commission’s feasibility study for the Stabilization and
Association Process, completed in late 2003.
3.
The PRSP commits the authorities to enact rigorous reforms to: (i) create conditions
for sustainable and balanced economic development; (ii) reduce poverty; and (iii) accelerate
EU integration. Responsibilities for implementation of the measures proposed in support of
these goals are spread across all levels of Government, with progress coordinated by an
Economic Planning and Policy Implementation Unit (EPPU) that reports to the State Council
of Ministers.
4.
Taking stock more than a year after the PRSP was agreed, a large number of the
proposed measures have been implemented. Nevertheless, still hesitant cooperation between
the Entity Governments on reforms requiring concerted action and/or harmonization has
delayed implementation of some of the most important measures. These include the adoption
of a framework law on higher education, a law on public debt and a legal framework to
establish minimum social entitlements for all citizens of BH. Moreover, the full
implementation of the BiH Law on Statistics is still outstanding, as is reform of existing
pension systems.
B. World Bank Financed Reforms
5.
The World Bank Board approved a new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for BiH
covering fiscal years 2005-07 (FY05-07) in September 2004. The CAS builds on two
previous full strategies (FY98-99 and FY00-02) and is informed by the Country Assistance
Evaluation prepared by the World Bank’s independent Operations Evaluation Department in
April 2004. The CAS is intended to help the authorities complete the transition from

- 58 -

APPENDIX II

generous post-conflict assistance (including exceptional IDA allocations based on postconflict considerations) following the 1995 Dayton Peace Agreements, to a more regular
program based on standard IDA criteria. With income levels per capita now well above the
IDA threshold, the CAS is designed to help BiH improve its credit-worthiness, which should
ultimately enable BiH to graduate from concessional IDA credits to IBRD lending.
6.
The FY05-07 CAS is anchored in the PRSP and is structured along three mutually
reinforcing pillars, reflecting BiH’s principal development challenges: (i) improving public
finance and strengthening institutions; (ii) promoting sustainable private-sector led growth;
and (iii) investing in key social and economic infrastructure. The base case under the CAS
sets BiH’s IDA allocation at $152 million for FY05-07. This is, however, conditional on
satisfactory macroeconomic and reform performance. With recent delays to reform there are
significant risks that the full envelope available under the base case may not be committed.
7.
More determined reform efforts would result in an increase of BiH’s allocation, with
an additional $30 million of IBRD financing in the high case. Triggers for such a move
include the successful launch of the VAT, at least 100 companies filing for bankruptcy, and
reduction of non-interest recurrent public spending to 38 percent of GDP and of the public
administration wage bill to 32 percent of total non-interest recurrent spending. Other triggers
include the introduction of harmonized wage-determination systems (public and private),
linking wage-setting to productivity and the adoption and successful implementation of an
affordable domestic debt settlement plan in line with the PRSP. At this stage, however, early
movement to a high case seems unlikely.
8.
The active World Bank IDA portfolio includes fifteen investment and three
adjustment projects with a total commitment of almost $370 million, of which about
$220 million remain to be disbursed. The investment side of the Bank’s portfolio has
performed well, and several new activities are scheduled to be presented to the Board before
the end of FY05. Following Board approval in March 2004 of the Health Sector
Enhancement Project (HSEP), the World Bank began negotiations in April on an
Education Restructuring Project (ERP), and expects to present this operation to the Board
in June. Commitments under the two projects would amount to $27 million.
9.
In contrast, there have been significant challenges on the adjustment side of the
Bank’s portfolio. The Business Enabling Environment Structural Adjustment Credit
(BAC) still has an undisbursed second tranche of about $30 million. Despite four extensions
of the loan’s effectiveness deadline, business inspection laws are yet to be enacted by both
Entity Parliaments, and this is now expected to take until August 2005. In addition, the
Second Social Sector Structural Adjustment Credit (SOSAC II), with an undisbursed
amount of $53 million, has yet to be made effective over 9 months after Board approval. In
order for these funds to become available to BH, the Federation authorities will need to abide
by SOSAC II commitments to keep spending on veterans programs at the 2004 level in
nominal terms. Given veterans benefits makes up almost 30 percent of total Government
spending in the Federation, and is subject to significant corruption, some discipline will be
required to allow, over time, for a reallocation of social sector spending from veterans’

- 59 -

APPENDIX II

benefits to social welfare and child protection programs. The RS is fully in line with its
SOSAC II commitments on veterans’ benefits spending.
10.
Reforming Government spending and higher education finance is a key objective of
the Economic Management Structural Adjustment Credit (EMSAC), the first tranche of
which was released in December 2004. A second tranche of about $25 million is scheduled
to be disbursed by the end of 2005 provided the credit’s core conditions are met. These
include the submission by the State Government to the State Parliament of a draft Higher
Education State Framework Law that assigns the responsibility for higher education
financing to a level above that of the cantons, establishes higher education funding bodies at
a level higher than that of the cantons, and that abolishes the legal independence of faculties
by unifying them into universities and colleges. Little progress has been made to date in
agreeing such a law, however.
C. IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
11.
The IMF and the World Bank work closely together in supporting the Governments’
structural reform agenda. Effective collaboration between the two institutions will remain of
key importance as BiH advances the implementation of the PRSP and may begin
negotiations on a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU as early as
this calendar year. Key areas of continued cooperation are likely to include: (i) fostering
private sector-led growth; (ii) rationalizing government spending, (iii) a revision of the 2005
Federation budget to meet IMF macro-economic requirements and to allow the Federation to
comply with SOSAC II agreements, and (iv) introduction of a minimum social assistance and
child protection scheme centralized at least on the entity level – especially in response to the
pending introduction of a single rate VAT from the start of 2006.
12.
Creating the conditions for rapid and sustainable economic growth remains one of the
key areas of collaboration between the World Bank and the Fund. A new proposed
Programmatic Development Policy Credit (PDPC) being prepared by the World Bank will
focus on increasing domestic savings to help reduce the current account deficit and reliance
on debt financing, bolster output growth and help improve creditworthiness. A key
component of this work will be to support intensified restructuring of remaining state-owned
enterprises through privatization or bankruptcy, and accelerated restructuring of voucherprivatized companies. The PDPC will also focus on ways to deal with outsized arrears of
pension contributions and wages, with view to helping reduce the stubbornly high excess
employment that contributed to blocking enterprise restructuring in the past. The design of
this project will continue in very close coordination with the IMF. The PDPC was originally
scheduled to be presented to the World Bank Board in June 2005. Delays by the BH
authorities on the broader reform agenda, however, have led to this being postponed. As
funds can not be carried across from one IDA replenishment to another, there is a strong risk
that the BH authorities may not be able to access the full IDA envelope outlined in the CAS
base case scenario.

- 60 -

APPENDIX II

13.
General Government spending relative to GDP has declined substantially to
50 percent last year from 64 percent in 2000. Nonetheless, the multi-layered and fragmented
public sector consumes a larger share of resources relative to the other countries in the region
and needs to be rationalized and streamlined. The World Bank is leading with the EMSAC
which commits the Government to reducing the wage bill and increasing the share of outlays
on maintenance and investment. The PDPC currently under preparation aims, inter alia, to
increase further the efficiency of Government spending and cap growth in health care
outlays.
14.
Controlling growth in veterans’ benefits, which make up a very high proportion of
GDP and Government spending, especially in the Federation (where outlays on veterans’
benefits amount to about 30 percent of overall spending) remains an important challenge.
The Federation authorities will need to bring spending back to 2004 nominal levels in order
to fulfill their commitment under SOSAC II and to provide room for other critical social
programs. Veterans’ benefits spending has also been open to considerable corruption. To
date, however, movement on this area has been considerable slower than expected due to
entrenched political interests. In part due to very high expenditures on veterans, most of the
social welfare and child protection system in BiH is rudimentary, with limited administrative
and financial capacity to provide even basic entitlements to the most vulnerable members of
society (although child protection in the RS remains a notable exception). The legal
framework leaves it to the sub-entity Governments to provide benefits to the poor, families
with children, civil victims of war, and other vulnerable social groups, resulting in a wide
disparity in the scope and level of assistance. The World Bank is leading with efforts under
SOSAC II to help the authorities centralize at Entity level the legislation and financing of
social assistance in the RS and child protection in the Federation. Setting up a minimum
safety net will enable the authorities to provide targeted assistance to the poor to mitigate
adverse social effects, including those likely to result from the introduction of the single rate
VAT.

APPENDIX III

Bosnia and Herzegovina: Statistical Issues
1.
The Dayton peace treaty, which ended the civil war, implicitly gave responsibility for
statistical functions to the two Entities (The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and
Republika Srpska). In August 1998, the State created its own statistical institute, the Bosnia
and Herzegovina Agency for Statistics (BHAS) with a view to compiling country-wide
statistics in accordance with internationally accepted methodologies, consolidating data
produced by the Entities Statistical Institutes, and acting as the primary coordinating agency
for contacts with international agencies. Significant technical assistance was provided in
recent years, mainly by the European Union and essentially in the form of training seminars
and study visits. A Fund resident statistical advisor was assigned to the Central Bank of
Bosnia and Herzegovina (CBBH) in May 1999, to provide technical assistance in the
development of all areas of macroeconomic statistics on the basis of the comprehensive
review conducted in early 1998 by the Fund’s Multisector Statistics mission and the
recommendations of Fund missions in the areas of monetary and balance of payments
statistics. A country page for Bosnia and Herzegovina in International Finance Statistics
(IFS) was introduced in July 2001.
A. Real Sector
2.
In recent years, efforts have been made in both Entities to improve real sector
statistics, but results have been mixed. The Federation and RS both have published nominal
GDP estimates using the production approach based on international standards
recommended by the 1993 SNA, since 1998 and 1999, respectively. However, in both cases,
production estimates at constant prices and GDP by expenditure are still unavailable and
informal sector activities are under-recorded. The preparation of a household budget survey,
to serve as the basis for revising price indices and to facilitate the compilation of GDP by the
expenditure approach, has begun. There are still no meaningful short-term business and
consumer surveys. Both statistical offices compile prices and production indices using
outdated methodologies, and consistent time series are not available. Industrial production
indices are prepared in each Entity, but there is no index at the country level. Labor statistics
are the weakest area for both Institutes, and data on employment, unemployment, and wage
rates are based on deficient methodologies.
B. Balance of Payments
3.
Trade data are published by Entities’ Statistical Institutes and balance of payments
statistics by the CBBH’s Research Department. The quality of the data is generally poor.
Merchandise trade data are not based on international standards and suffer from serious
undercoverage due to smuggling and undervaluation. The coverage of foreign aid data,
foreign investment, and workers remittances is inadequate. However, there are signs of
progress. The ASYCUDA customs information system has been introduced in both entities.
All customs posts were covered by the system by the end of 2002. Efforts to enhance the
system, including by improving communication and system security are ongoing, with
assistance from the EU and UNCTAD.

- 62 -

APPENDIX III

C. Government Finance
4.
The CBBH has recently agreed, in accord with the finance ministers of the State and
two entity governments, to take the lead in compiling Government Finance Statistics (GFS)
on a countrywide basis, and recently assigned a team of three staff to work on the GFS. At its
request, STA fielded a GFS technical assistance mission in September 2003. The mission
examined the structure of the relations between BiH governments and advised on sector
classification for international comparison purposes. It developed a system to allow budget
data to be classified, aggregated, and consolidated into summary GFS aggregates for all BiH
governments, except for municipalities. This exercise also demonstrated that currently
available data do not provide a satisfactory basis for compilation of GFS. The mission
suggested enlisting the help of USAID to develop reporting systems that can electronically
link GFS codes with ORACLE accounting systems used in the Treasuries. Reporting systems
are still being developed.
5.
The mission developed a medium term development plan for fiscal statistics in BiH,
taking account of the problems posed by the complexity of the BiH government structure and
the difficulties faced by the CBBH in collecting and processing data. The mission
recommended a conservative approach, with the essential first step utilizing simple systems
and processes which allow summary GFS reports to be produced on a timely and regular
basis. Progress requires commitments by all parties to cooperate, as well as additional
computer resources and, in the long run, more staff, at the CBBH.
D. Monetary Accounts
6.
The CBBH reports monetary accounts to the Fund on both a countrywide and Entity
basis. It also began, in early 2003, reporting weighted average interest rate data for bank
deposits and loans with data from January 2002 onward for publication in the IFS. Over the
period 1996–2001, several Fund technical assistance missions have assisted the authorities in
establishing an integrated system for compiling countrywide monetary statistics meeting
Fund standards. The latest mission, in April/May 2004, reviewed in particular the recent
institutional changes and accounting developments that have important implications for
monetary statistics and assisted in revising and updating the current monetary data
compilation procedures. The mission recommended improvements in, among other areas, the
treatment of “passive accounts” on banks’ balance sheets, banks’ claims arising from “credit
card debts,” “euro-linked” loans in national currency, and government accounts.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation—Supplementary Information
Prepared by the Staff Representatives
For the 2005 Consultation with Bosnia and Herzegovina
Approved by Reza Moghadam and Donal Donovan
May 24, 2005
1.
This supplement provides information on three developments since the Staff Report
for the Article IV Consultation was issued.
I. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
2.
First, the Office of the High Representative (OHR) has provided a legal opinion on
the proposal to require the assent of the Entities (the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina,
and the Republika Sprska) to total expenditure in the annual State budget.1 This opinion
suggests that the proposal would require a change to the constitution. The change would be
required even though Entity assent to total State spending would be congruent with the
relationship between the budgets that was established in the Dayton constitution.2 In
addition, the State has recently withdrawn its agreement to the proposal to require Entity
assent to total State spending, preferring reliance on existing “checks and balances” to
encourage coordination between State and Entity budgets.3
3.
Second, the authorities have formed “The BiH Fiscal Council,” in the spirit of staff
proposals.4 This body is an initiative to strengthen coordination of fiscal policies, including
between the Entities and the State. The voting members of the Council will consist of the
1

See Staff Report, para 24.

2

Prior to establishment of the single account for indirect tax collections from 2005, Dayton
provided the State with no funding, requiring it to obtain all its resources from the Entities. In
that way, its annual expenditure de facto required the prior assent of the Entities.
3

The procedures mentioned as checks and balances to ensure reflection of Entity-level
interest in State budgets comprise approval of the draft State budget by the State-level
Council of Ministers, the State-level Presidency, and the State-level Parliament.
4

See Staff Report para 25, Selected Issues Paper, Chapter 10, and SM (04/35) Chapter 3 .

-2-

Chairman of the Council of Ministers, the Entity Prime and Finance Ministers, the State
Minister of Finance and Treasury. The Central Bank Governor, a representative of Brcko
District and the Chairman of the Indirect Tax Authority Board will have observer status. The
tasks of the Council will be to determine total revenue and expenditures of the individual
annual budgets of the State and the Entities, and to monitor execution of those budgets in
accord with the parameters approved by the Council. Decision-making will be by
consensus—which the Fiscal Council members clarify to mean “unanimity”—of voting
members. The Council will meet at least monthly. At this stage, the Council has no
foundation in law, being formed only by agreement of its current members.
4.
Third, an EC mission has ruled that Bosnia and Herzegovina is not yet ready to
commence negotiations for a Stabilization and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU.
The key issues which impede progress are the lack of domestic consensus on the principles
of an EU-program mandating centralization of police functions, and insufficient progress on
broadcasting reforms. The EC will give consideration to commencing SAA negotiations once
progress in these areas is made.
II. APPRAISAL
5.
With the political consensus for the proposal for Entity assent to annual state budget
expenditure no longer in place, an alternative mechanism will be needed to ensure a
coordinated and consensual relationship between the State and Entity budgets. Thus far, the
existing “checks and balances” have had limited effectiveness in this regard in practice, so
that significant High Representative and IMF staff guidance in budget formation has also
been required. Given the High Representative’s priority on reducing the role of his office, the
parallel need for the authorities to take over this detailed budget-making role from IMF staff,
and the considerable fiscal pressures ahead, a coordinating framework will need to be very
robust, even in the absence of guidance from the OHR and IMF staff.
6.
The establishment of the BiH Fiscal Council is very welcome as a symbol of intent to
secure broader fiscal coordination. From this start, two issues will require further
consideration to ensure that the Council moves beyond its symbolic status. First, the Council
would be much strengthened by providing it with a legal foundation, notably establishing
that its provisions supersede current budget legislation. Without these, the underlying non
coordinated budget legislation will continue to underpin budget formulation and execution
whenever consensus eludes the Council. Second, given the envisaged unanimous decisionmaking process, deadlock breaking mechanisms will be required to ensure timely budget
decision-making.5 Without this legal foundation and the deadlock-breaking mechanisms, the
Council may encounter difficulties in securing coordinated budget making.

See SEI Chapter 10 for suggested deadlock breaking mechanisms.

Statement by Jeroen Kremers, Executive Director for Bosnia and Herzegovina
and Herman Litman, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
May 27, 2005
General
The macroeconomic indicators for 2004 show that Bosnia and Herzegovina continued
to strengthen its macroeconomic stability. Economic growth at close to 6 percent was one of
the highest among transition economies. In the last five years, the authorities have
demonstrated a strong degree of fiscal discipline, reducing the fiscal deficit from
unsustainably high levels of around 9 percent of GDP in 2000 to around only 1 percent of
GDP in 2004. Inflation remained low, reflecting the strong commitment to the currency
board. In the last three years, the growth rates for exports were higher than those for imports.
Since the war the export has increased tenfold. The external debt-to-GDP-ratio declined to
around 30 percent, which, together with a very favorable structure of the debt, makes Bosnia
a moderately indebted country. The favorable macroeconomic environment boosted further
private sector development. In 2004, the growth of industrial production, as well as of
Foreign Direct Investment was at a record high.
The authorities are grateful to the IMF for the help provided through two SBAs that
were successfully completed. However, it is important to emphasize that the macroeconomic
strengthening achieved in 2004 occurred in the absence of an IMF program. This clearly
indicates strong ownership, as the authorities continue to be committed to the implementation
of reforms even without having a binding program with the IMF. Within the government
there are no ‘calls for reorientation of the policy from “stability” to “development” ’(para 7).
The authorities are convinced that both should go hand in hand, and they are committed to
policies ensuring such balance.
Current account deficit
Although the current account deficit has constantly declined in the last three years,
the authorities concur with the staff’s assessment that its high level still presents the largest
threat to macroeconomic stability. Nonetheless, while noting the adjustment that staff made
to the estimate of the current account deficit (in chapter V of the selected issues paper), the
authorities believe that the true deficit will be significantly lower than staff’s estimate of
17 percent of GDP.
The Bosnian economy is becoming more and more sustainable as it keeps growing at
high rates, despite the sharp decline in foreign aid from around 20 percent of GDP in 1999 to
3 percent in 2004. The past high levels of the current account deficit stemmed from this
donor-led effort to revitalize the physical infrastructure destroyed by the war. Therefore, as
this effort is in its final phase, lower levels of the current account deficit are to be expected.
Moreover, buoyant export growth will strengthen this trend. The record level of foreign
reserves, which are equivalent to 6 months of imports, and falling external debt also mitigate
the risk of balance-of-payments difficulties.

-2As for the future policy, in order not to exacerbate current account problems, the
authorities concur with the staff’s recommendation to continue to maintain a disciplined
fiscal policy and to closely monitor credit growth. The authorities note the statement by staff
about uncertainties in the credit-external balance relationship. A government study found a
positive relation between credit growth and export growth in 2004. Because the banks in
Bosnia and Herzegovina lend more to the corporate than to the household sector, the
structure of imports has changed and investment goods (machinery and equipment) now are a
large part of imports. The authorities believe that the ensuing investment will spur
development of the private sector, and subsequently lead to higher exports and lower current
account deficits.
Building a viable state
Notwithstanding the complexity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, there is a country-wide
consensus to accelerate the pace of reforms in order to join the European Union. The
strengthening of State institutions represents a major precondition for it. This process is
supported, not only by the broad majority of Bosnian officials and population, but also by the
Office of the High Representative and other parts of the international community.
The authorities believe that the IMF’s recommendations should be more supportive to
this process. After all the authorities have proven, by implementing strong fiscal policies, that
state-building has been based on sustainable fiscal policies. They have demonstrated this
commitment by cuts in defense spending. Moreover, the strengthening of State institutions in
the past three years was followed by cutting the wage bill of the State and Entity
administrations by more than 1 percent of GDP. In 2005, the State administration
remuneration rates will be additionally cut by 10 percent. The authorities will continue to be
fully committed to a fiscally sustainable process of strengthening the State institutions.
Given the complexity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the coordination between the
various levels of government is crucial for responsible fiscal policies. The authorities have
followed staff’s recommendation and established the National Fiscal Council (NFC) with an
eye to coming to a consolidated budget, with appropriate subdivision of this budget between
the various levels of government and monitoring of the execution of this budget in a
consolidated manner. The establishment of the NFC should be regarded as an important step
in the right direction and it aims, inter alia, at taking over from IMF staff the core fiscal tasks
as mentioned in the report.
The authorities do not share staff’s assessment that the Office of the High
Representative (OHR) will lose its role as an organizing force in the near future. By the end
of this year the OHR role will be redefined, in line with the country’s efforts to join the EU.
The process of building State institutions, including the NFC, testifies that the authorities’
share in organizing the country’s affairs has been constantly growing, and that they are
prepared to take over from the OHR progressively more functions.
Internal debt
Lowering internal debt represents one of the highest priorities for the governments in
Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina has

-3challenged some parts of the governments’ domestic debt laws. The authorities would like to
emphasize that the strategy to lower the internal debt and the legal framework have been
drafted and approved under the IMF’s guidelines. With the benefit of hindsight, it is clear
that a different approach to solving the debt problem might have been more appropriate: first
to finalize the verification of all claims, and later, only after having a clear notion of the
magnitude of the problem, to find a workable strategy and acceptable legal framework.
The authorities are in the middle of the process of verification of claims and hope to
finalize it shortly. Under any scenario they are committed to lowering the domestic debt to a
fiscally sustainable level. Given the lessons learnt from dealing with the internal debt, the
authorities intend to consult with the IMF but also to take more ownership and a different
approach to deal with restitution. First priority will be given to verification of claims, and
then to drafting a legally and fiscally sustainable solution.
Other matters
As regards the staff’s assessment of “recent trade protectionist initiatives” (para 33),
the authorities have a different view and would like to highlight that Bosnia and Herzegovina
has the lowest tariff protection in the region. The recent partial abrogation of the regional free
trade agreements has been only in reaction to clear violation of them by some of the other
country signatories.
As regards the level of poverty (para 5), the authorities’ figures for the period
between 2001 and 2005 are around 18 percent, lower than the World Bank estimates
mentioned in the staff report (over 30 percent). These data are easily available as they were
published in the Midterm Development Strategy (PRSP) and by the EPPU (office for
monitoring its implementation). Given the fact that the Staff Report did not make any
reference to the PRSP, the authorities would like to encourage the IMF to show more interest
in this strategic document that has been approved by the State and Entity governments and
supported by civil society.
Future relations with the IMF
The authorities find it disappointing that the negotiations on a new SBA have taken
almost a year, especially given the fact that two previous SBAs have been successfully
completed and that the authorities strengthened macroeconomic stability in 2004 -- without
an IMF program. More than twenty requirements, including some very significant ones, like
approval of the domestic debt plan and its legal framework, approval of the legal framework
for introduction of the single-rate VAT, establishment of the single account for the indirect
tax revenues, establishment of the NFC, have already been met on the road to a program.
The authorities are keen to conclude these discussions shortly. They would like to
avoid loss of time and therefore recommendations should be based on both legally and
fiscally sustainable solutions. On the key issue of fiscal coordination, they do not find
acceptable the idea suggested by the IMF to introduce in the ITS law the requirement that the
Entities approve the State’s expenditure budget. This would go against state-building and has
also been assessed to be unconstitutional. However, the authorities clearly do support the

-4underlying objective to not only keep the deficit under control on a year-to-year basis, but
also make decisive progress regarding the architecture of fiscal coordination.
According to staff the non-existence of “purposeful formal coordination of fiscal
policy-making” impeded efforts so far to agree on a third SBA (para 10). The authorities are
of the view that this concern has been properly addressed by establishing the National Fiscal
Council. They would like to see the objectives of the NFC and the modalities of its
functioning clearly set out in the program’s LOI. Further steps of formal implementation as
needed could subsequently be undertaken as part of the program’s conditionality.
An early IMF mission with a clear mandate to continue and complete negotiations is
sought by the authorities. Concluding the SBA discussions and signing the LOI before the
summer will be important for Bosnia’s image with investors. This will also enable the
Bosnian authorities to agree on a solid and consolidated budget for 2006, as planned for
September. The authorities are aware of the challenges ahead and they are ready to confront
them. They ask the Executive Board for support in doing so.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with
Bosnia and Herzegovina
On May 27, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Bosnia and Herzegovina.1
Background
Economic activity strengthened in 2004, inflation remained low, and international reserves
continue to increase reaching almost 6 months of imports by end-2004. Real GDP growth
increased to an estimated 5.7 percent from 4.0 percent in 2003, buoyed by strong regional
export market growth, recent large company restructurings in the mining and manufacturing
sectors, and continued expansion of credit to the private sector of over 25 percent. Corporate
profitability does not appear to have improved in 2004 as increased production was fully
absorbed by employment in the Federation and by wages in the Republika Srpska.
Domestic savings remain low. But unemployment and poverty rates remain in the mid-20s and
over 30 percent respectively.
Alongside, the external current account deficit strengthened modestly. Despite strong export
growth of over 15 percent, imports, fuelled by the continued growth of credit, remained
buoyant.
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.

-2-

The fiscal deficit is estimated at 0.6 percent of GDP, excluding recapitalization of a bank. This is
slightly weaker than targeted due to lower than expected customs and excise duties, and slow
progress on military demobilization.
Some significant structural fiscal reforms were advanced during 2004, including the unification of
customs and indirect tax policies at the State-level, with part of indirect tax revenues pooled into
a single account from 2005. These arrangements pave the way for the introduction of VAT from
end 2005—with a single rate of 17 percent and an EU standard structure—to replace the dualsales tax. And a “Fiscal Sustainability Working Group” has recently been established to identify
spending efficiencies across all levels of government.
The broader fiscal challenges facing Bosnia and Herzegovina are deepening. Recent court
rulings reject key elements of the laws adopted in 2004 aimed at restructuring unsustainable
domestic claims on government of more than 200 percent of GDP. This raises the prospect of
deep expenditure retrenchment to fund the associated court-mandated debt service on these
claims. At the same time, plans to expand the State-level ministries imply significant increases in
consolidated primary spending in the near to medium term, and the planned introduction of VAT
from end-2005 presents revenue risks. These challenges arise in the context where there
remains no domestic institution tasked with controlling the consolidated fiscal balance.
Executive Board Assessment
They welcomed the further advances in economic performance that Bosnia and Herzegovina has
made during 2004: real GDP continued to grow strongly; significant fiscal consolidation was
achieved; international reserves rose; and consumer prices were flat. There has also been
progress in strengthening fiscal structures. This progress provided essential support for the
currency board and a good basis to pursue ambitions for EU membership. Notwithstanding these
achievements, Directors underscored that Bosnia and Herzegovina continues to face major
challenges: persistent fiscal problems, a weak corporate sector, and a large current account
deficit, in the context of a currency board. They noted that these challenges pose significant
risks, and encouraged the authorities to work closely with the international community to address
them. Directors emphasized the importance of institution-building, including self-sustained State
institutions.
Directors emphasized that the current account deficit remains a matter of concern, even taking
into account Bosnia and Herzegovina’s special circumstances and data weaknesses. Thus, they
underscored that policies should be geared toward ensuring that it moves toward a sustainable
range. In the near term, this will require a continued tight fiscal stance. In the medium-term,
maintenance of the tight fiscal stance alongside deep corporate restructuring will be required,
the latter aimed at establishing profit seeking behavior and raising domestic savings and exports.
Directors stressed that adequate fiscal structures will need to be further elaborated so as to
secure the necessary policies. Despite the significant progress on fiscal consolidation, work

-3-

should continue so as to formulate and administer a consolidated budget with an eye to
achieving and underpinning sustainability.
Directors urged the authorities to achieve further fiscal consolidation by targeting a primary fiscal
surplus in 2005 and 2006. This represents a minimum goal pending clarification of the additional
debt burden implied by the court rulings on domestic claims. In this context, several Directors
urged early action to address risks in the 2005 budgets, including unanticipated expenditure
increases in the Cantons, plans to increase police pay, the delay in cutting State remuneration
levels, and uncertainties in prospects for dividend receipts.
Directors underscored that plans for the 2006 budget should be adjusted as appropriate following
clarification of the court rulings. With regard to tax revenues, particular care would be required in
addressing VAT implementation and collection risks. In the event that collections exceed
expectations, the “permanent windfall” should be applied to reductions in labor taxation. Directors
also agreed that the authorities should seek improvements in tax administration, rather than tax
increases, as the tax regime is already burdensome.
Directors called for a rapid resolution of the internal debt settlement, with a settlement structure
that minimizes the impact on the budget. They cautioned, however, that public expenditure
adjustments will be needed in the near to medium term, if as now expected, the court-mandated
payouts on domestic claims significantly exceed the 10 percent of GDP in Net Present Value
terms anticipated in the 2004 domestic claims laws. This issue, alongside aspirations for a variety
of international community supported initiatives, underscores the need to identify offsetting
economies in budget expenditure. In this context, Directors welcomed the establishment of the
“Fiscal Sustainability Group” to identify such savings. Directors urged that efforts to build Statelevel institutions should proceed, with close attention to the budgetary implications so as to
secure fiscal sustainability.
Directors noted that fiscal challenges also require a marked strengthening of coordinating
mechanisms, particularly given the complex governing structure. They noted the establishment of
the Indirect Tax Authority (ITA) as an important step in this direction. Directors welcomed as also
an important step the establishment of the BiH Fiscal Council with representatives from the State
and Entity governments, charged with determining and guiding overall fiscal policies. Directors
looked forward to its development into an effective entity to execute budgetary policy.
They emphasized that the Fiscal Council will need considerable elaboration to secure
coordination and effective decision making in practice. In this context, some Directors noted that
the Council would also require legal underpinnings and appropriate deadlock-breaking
mechanisms. The Council would also require the support of much-improved and timely
macroeconomic data. Directors considered that this should form part of a broader effort to
address the serious deficiencies in the quality of macroeconomic data.
Directors welcomed the continued public confidence in the banking system and the authorities’
commitment to the currency board. At the same time, they noted with concern the persistence
and strength of the growth of credit which, while being supportive of reconstruction efforts,

-4-

raises prudential concerns. Directors therefore urged the authorities to conduct frequent reviews
of credit data and firmly enforce prudential regulations. Banking supervision should be
strengthened alongside, notably through early completion of plans to bring the banking agencies
into the central bank.
Directors emphasized that the recommended fiscal and external adjustment in 2005–06 is
contingent on decisive progress in restructuring the corporate sector and increasing the flexibility
of labor market structures. They regretted the slow progress recorded in both areas, emphasizing
that this compromises aspirations to curb unemployment and poverty, but they welcomed efforts
under way, with the help of the World Bank, to design a comprehensive corporate reform
package. Directors urged early completion of these design efforts, paving the way for
implementation. They cautioned that the authorities should avoid providing debt relief not linked
to sale of companies to strategic investors as this would only prolong corporate sector difficulties.
Directors considered that labor market institutions also need to be transformed to encourage job
creation during and after the corporate reforms. In this context, regulations allowing the indefinite
accrual of wage rights, regardless of attendance for work, should be rationalized, and restrictions
on the dismissal of workers relaxed. Directors were of the view that wage indexation should also
cease, so as to moderate wage growth and engender a better balance between wage and
employment growth.
Directors urged the authorities to move swiftly to fulfill their intentions to reinstate the regional
trade agreements partially abrogated in 2004-05, and, in that context, to intensify their efforts to
pursue WTO membership.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ interest in a further program arrangement with the IMF and
suggested early engagement to that end. Given the external and fiscal challenges ahead,
and the ambition of and need for the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina to progressively take
over responsibilities from the OHR and the IMF, they noted that an adequate fiscal stance,
improved fiscal coordinating structures, and significant progress on corporate restructuring would
be key. They noted that the objectives of the Fiscal Council and the modalities of its functioning
would need to be clearly set out in any program, and that further steps of formal implementation
as needed could subsequently be taken as part of program conditionality. Directors also
considered that the PRSP should be the focus of reform and development efforts. These efforts
should continue to be supported by the Fund working closely with other parts of the international
community carrying responsibilities in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
