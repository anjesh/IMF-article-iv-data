MAURITIUS
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
March 19, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Outlook and risks: Growth has been relatively resilient and is projected at 3¾ percent
in 2013, slightly below potential reflecting subdued demand from trading partners and
modest private investment. External shocks are the largest risk to the outlook, but
should be manageable with an appropriate policy response.
Fiscal policy and public debt sustainability: The authorities are planning a fiscal
consolidation for 2014–15 to reduce debt vulnerabilities, rebuild policy buffers, and
help reduce emerging external imbalances. Mauritius appears well-placed to meet its
statutory debt ceiling target of less than 50 percent of GDP by 2018. For 2013, a fully
neutral fiscal stance—similar to the 2012 outcome—would smooth the planned fiscal
adjustment, and could be achieved with only a small reduction in planned spending.
Spending savings could be realized through better targeting of social spending,
reduction of subsidies, revenue reform, and efficiency gains for public enterprises,
including by applying full cost recovery pricing policies.
Monetary policy: The current monetary policy stance has delivered low and stable
inflation, but inflationary pressures may arise in 2013 reflecting recent wage increases
and possible adjustments in administered prices. Controlling excess liquidity should
help reduce inflationary pressures and strengthen the interest rate transmission
mechanism.
External sustainability: Emerging external imbalances need to be addressed through
measures to increase national savings (including fiscal consolidation); to foster
competitiveness through structural reforms, and by investing in physical and human
capital, which is critical for longer-term growth prospects. Staff estimates suggest that
the real effective exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals.
Financial sector: Stress tests indicate that the Mauritian banking system is wellcapitalized and resilient against a range of shocks.

INTRODUCTION
1.

Economic growth has been resilient in an adverse external environment, but growth

slowed somewhat in 2012. After some signs of recovery following the aftermath of the global
financial crisis and ensuing stimulus policies, the Mauritian economy is still not operating at full
capacity although the output gap is small. Heavy dependence on demand from Europe for key
services exports and declining competitiveness are particular sources of risks going forward.
2.

The 2012 Article IV consultation recommended rebuilding fiscal buffers and

accelerating debt reduction, while the monetary policy stance was found to be broadly
appropriate. The staff appraisal called for better pricing and governance policies in state-owned
enterprises (SOEs) and targeting of the social protection system to contribute to more inclusive
growth. Policy making has reflected these recommendations with a less expansionary fiscal stance
than planned; and reforms have been initiated in the highlighted areas with support from
development partners.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
3.

The difficult external environment adversely impacted economic activity in 2012.

Growth decelerated to 3.3 percent, driven by weak sugar and textile exports and a slowdown in the
construction sector. Tourist arrivals increased slightly, but hotel occupancy was lower and profit
margins narrowed. On the upside, technology and financial services sectors maintained strong
growth. The output gap is estimated to be small (around ½ percent), with the unemployment rate
increasing marginally to 8 percent. CPI inflation moderated to 3.9 percent on average. Reflecting the
ongoing crisis in the EU, exports of goods and services increased by only 5 percent in dollar terms
(tourism receipts grew by 2 percent), with the external current account deficit narrowing slightly to
10 percent of GDP. In June 2012, Moody’s upgraded the country’s credit rating to Baa1.
4.

The fiscal stance was broadly neutral, thus supporting the overall macroeconomic

policy mix. The overall deficit including extra-budgetary funds is estimated at 2.3 percent of GDP.
The structural primary deficit excluding grants was broadly unchanged relative to 2011; so there was
no discretionary fiscal impulse (compared to an impulse of 1½ percentage points of GDP projected
in the last staff report). The good fiscal outturn was partly due to a reduction in transfers and
subsidies (which decreased by over 1 percent of GDP compared to 2011), particularly transfers to
SOEs. Also, expenditures on goods and services were 1 percent of GDP lower than expected. Better
than expected tax revenue (in particular for VAT receipts) was more than offset by lower levels of
non-tax revenue and grants than initially projected.

Monetary policy was accommodative during 2012. In March 2012, the Bank of Mauritius

(BOM) reduced the repo rate, which serves as the policy rate, by 50 basis points to 4.9 percent given
the deceleration in global growth and prudent fiscal policies. The BOM maintained the policy rate at
that level for the remainder of the year in light of continued uncertainty in the global outlook. Excess
liquidity in the banking system remained elevated; the yield on 3-month treasury bills fell by
120 basis points over the course of the year to 2.7 percent at end-2012 (substantially below the
policy rate) and credit growth to the private sector was robust at 17 percent.

capitalized, with 15 percent of Regulatory Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets at end-June, well
above Basel II and the proposed Basel III requirements. Non-performing loans (NPL) increased
slightly to 3.7 percent by June 2012 (Table 6), mainly in the construction and tourism sectors. Banks
have remained profitable with 20 percent return on equity, despite low leverage ratios. BOM
continued to publish its bi-annual CAMEL ratings for all domestic banks.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
8.

The outlook for 2013 and the medium-term is positive. Output growth in 2013 is

projected to increase to 3¾ percent, slightly below potential (Figure 2), reflecting still subdued
demand from Mauritius’ main markets and modest private investment. In subsequent years, real
GDP growth is expected to reach its estimated potential growth of around 4½ percent, with inflation
stabilizing at around 5 percent. Over the medium-term, the current account deficit is projected to
narrow gradually, falling to 7 percent of GDP by 2018, in part as a result of sustained fiscal
adjustment to attain the authorities’ legally mandated debt target and reforms improving external
competitiveness.

Growth prospects are significantly impacted by developments in the global economy,

especially Europe (see Table 7 for a description of risks and the suggested policy response). In the
short term, staff estimates that with an appropriate policy response, a resurgence of euro area
sovereign and banking stress with spillovers to other regions might reduce growth in Mauritius by
1¾ percentage points in 2013, with the shock transmitted through reduced tourism, trade, and FDI
inflows. Large short-term capital flows linked to the Global Business Corporations (GBCs) could also
prove to be more volatile than in the past. The policy response would include: (i) allowing automatic
fiscal stabilizers to work; (ii) limited targeted spending increases focused on specific growthsupporting interventions to facilitate labor market adjustment; (iii) moderately expansionary
monetary policy; and (iv) letting the exchange rate act as a shock absorber. Thus, with an
appropriate policy response, the economy would remain resilient, despite a significant negative
domestic impact, notably with an increase in public debt to 61 percent of GDP by 2017 under this
adverse scenario. Other risks to the outlook with a potentially high impact on the Mauritian
economy include a protracted period of slower European growth and the end of double taxation
agreement with India. A global oil shock triggered by geopolitical events or a fiscal policy shock in
the United States would be expected to have a more moderate impact on Mauritius in case they
materialize.
10.

In the longer term, the challenge will be to sustain reform efforts. These include

improving the targeting of social benefits, improving the cost-effectiveness of public sector delivery,
using full cost recovery pricing for public utilities and fuel, and enhancing overall productivity
through investments in physical and human capital. These risks appear manageable in view of
Mauritius’ well-established track record as an economic reformer, with a dynamic private sector,
sound macroeconomic fundamentals, and robust institutions.
11.

The authorities broadly agreed with the staff’s assessment of the outlook and

associated risks and policy options. While competiveness appeared to have declined over the last
decade they considered that planned fiscal consolidation and structural reforms would restore the
economy’s competitiveness and reduce the current account imbalance.

MACROECONOMIC POLICIES FOR 2013
Discussions centered on the appropriate fiscal and monetary policy mix for 2013 given the uncertain
external environment, weak private investment, and emerging inflationary pressures from increases in
wages and administered prices. Addressing external imbalances through fiscal consolidation and
structural reforms to increase savings and raise competitiveness was also central to the discussions.

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MAURITIUS

A. Fiscal Policy
12.

The 2013 budget reflects the authorities’ objectives of supporting growth, creating

employment, and ensuring sound macroeconomic management. A modest increase in the
overall deficit is envisaged by the authorities. Revenues are largely unchanged while spending
increases reflecting an increase in compensation of public employees in line with the
recommendations of the Pay Research Bureau (PRB) report, as well as a marginal increase in public
investment that are partially offset by a decline in transfers and subsidies. Nevertheless, the
reduction in transfers is accompanied by a marked increase in loans to SOEs, including for the road
decongestion program, which are expected to finance additional infrastructure investments. The
2013 budget introduced a pre-funded pension system for new civil servants and measures to
improve the performance monitoring system for SOEs, both of which should result in longer-term
savings. In addition, excises on alcohol and tobacco products and soft drinks were increased.
13.

Staff noted that a fully neutral fiscal stance would help with the overall policy mix and

provide a more consistent signal on the direction of fiscal policy. Based on the government’s
policy intentions and implementation history, staff projects that the budget would imply a positive
discretionary fiscal impulse of ½ percent of GDP (measured by the structural primary balance),
which is planned to be more than reversed in 2014. The fiscal impulse will likely have a limited
impact on growth, given that fiscal multipliers are typically low in small open economies with a
flexible exchange rate regime.1 Thus, despite the projected modest widening of the output gap for
2013, staff recommended that from a medium-term perspective, a neutral fiscal stance in 2013
might be preferable to smooth the strong fiscal adjustment planned for 2014–2015 and allow for a
somewhat more accommodative monetary policy.
14.

The authorities agreed with the staff’s analysis, but underscored the importance of

increasing public investment to reduce infrastructure bottlenecks and support domestic
demand. They noted that domestic demand remained weak, given that private investment is
projected to remain subdued in 2013. Moreover, the road decongestion project is meant to reduce
transport bottlenecks that are urgent; the authorities are working on addressing implementation
delays, which might otherwise result in a less expansionary ex-post outcome.

MAURITIUS

B. Monetary Policy
15.

The current moderately accommodative monetary policy stance is appropriate, but

inflationary pressures may arise in 2013 and need to be closely monitored and controlled
within the overall macroeconomic policy mix. Wage increases in the public and private sectors
and adjustments to some administrated prices might have secondary effects that need to be
controlled. Staff forecasts headline inflation to marginally exceed 5 percent in 2013, but decline
thereafter. Growth in credit to the private sector is expected to be modest in 2013 (about
11 percent). The authorities should stand ready to tighten monetary conditions if inflation
accelerates beyond current expectations, which appear to be well-anchored, as indicated by the
March 2013 Inflation Expectations Survey (IES) conducted by the BOM, which showed expected
inflation for 2013 dropping to 5.2 percent from the 5.8 percent expected in the September 2012 IES.
Even in the case when a rise in inflation is due to an increase in administrated prices, a tightening
monetary policy stance could help contain inflationary expectations and limit second-round price
pass-through effects. Staff also recommended removing excess liquidity to align the policy rate with
market rates.
16.

The authorities consider inflation risks to be well contained, but stand ready to

respond if inflation expectations deviate from target. The authorities project somewhat higher
inflation for 2013, but argued that second round effects of increases in administered prices should
be dampened by weak domestic demand. In addition, the magnitude of eventual spillovers from
increases in public sector wages to the private sector is uncertain. Furthermore, planned fiscal
consolidation should help to contain inflationary pressures going forward.

C. External Balance Assessment
17.

Staff estimates suggest that the real effective exchange rate (REER) is broadly in line

with fundamentals (Appendix II). The estimates point to a mild REER overvaluation of 5 percent
on average over the medium term (see Text Table 1), but there is uncertainty about the estimates.
The current account deficit is relatively large, which could suggest overvaluation, but it is not
significantly different from the estimated current account norm, particularly over the medium term.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MAURITIUS

Also, financial services exports may be underestimated,2 suggesting that the actual current account
deficit may be smaller.

Recent interventions in foreign exchange markets helped limit excessive fluctuations,

but are not sufficient to address underlying structural issues. Interventions have proven effective
in Mauritius because (i) there is imperfect substitutability between the Mauritian rupee and other
currencies; (ii) the BOM is a large player in a relatively small foreign exchange market; (iii) the
interventions were intended to move the currency towards equilibrium; and (iv) fiscal policy was
supportive. Thus, in the context of an appreciating real exchange rate, the interventions appeared
useful in supporting the overall macroeconomic policy mix and in enabling the BOM to rebuild its
reserve buffer. Given the uncertainty of the overvaluation estimates, staff advised that interventions
should focus on limiting excessive fluctuations and on avoiding significant REER misalignments
along the lines of the “two targets—two instruments” approach.3

2

The current account deficit was revised upward by 2 percentage points on average for 2011 and 2012 following a

new survey on Global Business Companies (GBCs). In most cases, the operations of GBCs would be expected to
generate net services exports, suggesting that the coverage of the survey may need to be broadened.

context, fiscal consolidation as envisioned by
the authorities should help facilitate external adjustment. Pension reform might also help improve
incentives for private savings over the medium-term (see below). Efforts to improve competitiveness
through structural reforms are also crucial, as are investments in infrastructure and human capital to
remove bottlenecks, and reduce skills mismatches in the labor market, wage policies that align real
wage increases closer to productivity improvements could also help gain competitiveness over time
(see below).
20.

The authorities are concerned about the economy’s competitiveness, and agree with

the need to focus on structural reforms. The impact of real exchange rate overvaluation on key
export sectors, which are also large employers, is an immediate source of concern. The Economic
and Social Transformation Plan (ESTP) has been launched to address competitiveness concerns,4 but
the authorities noted that the impact of the reforms will materialize over the medium-term. In the
meantime, they intend to continue trying to limit excessive overvaluation through sterilized
intervention as part of the macroeconomic policy mix, supported by relatively tighter fiscal policy
going forward.
21.

Reserves levels are adequate when measured against the traditional thresholds

(import cover and short-term debt) and are projected to remain so over the medium-term
(Appendix II). However, reserves are only slightly above 20 percent of M2, a benchmark intended
to capture the risk of capital flight and the potential need for bank support in/after a crisis. Against
the backdrop of the country’s exposure to natural disasters and its status as an international

financial center, there is a rationale for continuing to keep reserve coverage adequate (see also the
2012 Article IV report, IMF Country Report No. 12/62).

MEDIUM-TERM MACROECONOMIC AND STRUCTURAL
POLICIES
Discussions centered on debt sustainability and the specifics of medium-term fiscal consolidation;
structural reforms, and efforts to address infrastructure bottlenecks; the macroeconomic impact of
pension reform; the labor market and reforms to increase employment; the monetary policy
framework; and bank stress tests.

A. Medium-Term Debt Sustainability
22.

The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) shows a broadly positive debt outlook, as in the

previous DSA (Appendix I). Both total public and external debt are on sustainable trajectories and
the results of stress tests indicate that debt dynamics are resilient to most shocks. Structural primary
surpluses are projected to increase to 1 percent of GDP by 2015, an adjustment of 0.8 percent of
GDP relative to the 2012 outcome. The authorities’ fiscal adjustment plans are compatible with
reducing total public debt to below 50 percent of GDP by 2018. Recent empirical work suggests that
a debt ratio of 50 percent of GDP is close to the sustainability risk threshold for a typical emerging
market. 5 As a financial center, Mauritius might need larger policy buffers to respond to shocks, and
staff recommends continuing to target structural primary surpluses after 2018 to gradually reduce
public debt levels to 40 percent of GDP to further reduce vulnerabilities to adverse developments in
international capital markets, help address external imbalances, and strengthen policy buffers.
23.

Given large infrastructure needs, staff believes that medium-term fiscal consolidation

should seek to rationalize current expenditure and enhance revenues. In the short-run, there is
room for reducing expenditures through better targeting of social assistance and reduction in
transfers and subsidies, but some priority spending such as health and education might need to
increase over the medium-term. The authorities’ strategy of reducing medium-term capital
expenditures while increasing loans to SOEs destined for public investment places a premium on
strengthening capacity at SOEs to ensure that investments are commensurate to needs, properly
planned, tendered, and implemented. Loans to SOEs should be tied to strict conditions for
improving efficiency and ensuring repayment. In that context, authorities should continue to
5

IMF (2011) “Modernizing the Framework for Fiscal Policy and Public Debt Sustainability Analysis.” The 2011 Article IV

Consultation (SM/11/60) discussed the appropriateness of the debt ceiling and other fiscal rules.

strengthen the existing financial monitoring framework for SOEs, as discussed in the 2012 Article IV
Consultation report (IMF Country Report No. 12/62).
24.

Revenue raising measures could be an important component of a balanced adjustment

mix. Increases in the revenue-to-GDP ratio could be achieved through growth-friendly and
environmentally-sustainable taxes (including excises, VAT, and real estate taxation). The tax system
should also be reviewed with the objective of eliminating remaining exemptions (including several
of the VAT exemptions introduced in the 2013 budget) and improving the design and
administration of the major taxes. There is potential to introduce a true carbon tax, and also to raise
taxation of fuel products, both serving environmental and external balance objectives.
25.

The authorities’ broadly concurred with staff’s recommendations and noted that they

are on track to achieve fiscal adjustment targets. Current plans would maintain public investment
at stable levels through 2015,6 target reductions in transfers to SOEs, and keep other current
expenses constant in real terms. Plans thereafter might be revised in light of needs, and the
authorities indicated a willingness to review the tax system to make it more buoyant. Estimates of
the VAT “tax gap” suggest that there is some scope to increase revenue collection, although such
gains are likely to be limited as efficiency levels are already relatively high by international
comparison. The authorities have also pointed to progress made in establishing a comprehensive
performance monitoring framework to improve corporate governance in SOEs (the Parastatal
Information Management System) with assistance from the World Bank.

B. Physical Infrastructure Needs and Pricing Policies
26.

Physical infrastructure bottlenecks need to be addressed urgently. Key constraints are in

water, electricity, and transport sectors, and in each case assistance could be sought from
development partners to plan, assess and implement projects:
Water. A stable regulatory framework that allows for full cost recovery will be critical to



attracting investment. The impact of needed tariff increases on the poor should be mitigated
through lifeline tariffs (already in place) and/or targeted cash transfers through the recently
established Social Registry of Mauritius (SRM). An experienced private sector operator with a
well-defined performance contract may be able to solve problems more quickly and at lesser
cost than existing structures.

6

The current profile for public investment over the medium-term might have to be revisited once plans for the

construction of a Mass Transit System become more concrete.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MAURITIUS

Electricity. The electricity sector appears well managed, but would benefit from a move towards



automatic pricing policies to mitigate fiscal risks (Appendix III). Current energy generation costs
are vulnerable to swings in international energy prices. Moving to a formula-based tariff, which
reflects changes in international prices of input costs, exchange rates and inflation, would reduce
fiscal risks. Electricity tariffs should also cover costs of new investments, which are needed.
Current cross-subsidies for industrial consumers (whose tariffs are set below marginal costs)
should be gradually phased-out.
Transport. The road decongestion project is designed to enhance road capacity. Options for



charging motorists based on their impact on adding to congestion could also be considered—
such as through either electronic or GPS-metering—which could more reliably reduce
congestion and provide resources for public transportation.
27.

Subsidy reform could help achieve medium-term fiscal goals. Untargeted subsidies on

LPG, rice and flour are projected to cost 0.4 percent of GDP in 2013 and should be phased out.
These subsidies administered by the State Trading Corporation (STC) are not transparent because
they are not reflected in the budget. Moreover, in the case of LPG, subsidies subvert the carbon tax
(MID levy), which is part of the government’s green agenda. Before the latest adjustment in early
March 2013, retail prices for gasoline and diesel had not been adjusted since 2011, generating a net
loss for the STC during 2012.7 Staff recommends adopting a transparent automatic formula with
monthly adjustments up to a limit of 3 percent to smooth movements in retail prices. Targeted cash
transfers to the poor through the SRM could also be considered to mitigate the impact of price
increases.
28.

The authorities acknowledge the desirability of moving to automatic pricing formulas

for public utilities and fuel, but pointed to strong political economy constraints. In the water
sector, the authorities are working with Singapore on a government-to-government basis. They are
considering increasing water tariffs, although they would remain well below full cost recovery. Given
the small size of the domestic market, full fuel price liberalization is not feasible. The previous fuel
pricing mechanism resulted in high price volatility and price movements were not well understood.
The establishment of a better electricity tariff structure has not been a priority in light of the
relatively good performance of the sector so far. The authorities noted that utility prices were being
reviewed and could be adjusted further. Staff pointed to the importance of an effective public
communications campaign and transparency to build support for reform efforts in these areas.

7

In late 2012, the adjustment required by the established pricing mechanism was not adopted by cabinet.

C. Pension Reform and Its Macroeconomic Consequences
29.

Demographic trends will put pressures on the finance’s of the public pension system

(Appendix IV). Public pension expenditures in Mauritius amount to around 4 percent of GDP;
similar to other emerging markets, but they are projected to increase due to population ageing.
Preliminary staff estimates suggest that yearly imbalances between contributions and expenditures
might reach 5 percent of GDP by 2040. Initially, the non-contributory Basic Retirement Pension (BRP)
would be the main driver of imbalances, but civil servants’ pensions would pose an increasing
burden through 2040, which will be somewhat mitigated by significant reforms enacted in 2013. BRP
expenditures alone exceeded 2 percent of GDP in 2011. These expenditures are untargeted and
close to 40 percent of the benefits go to the richest 20 percent of the population.8 Thus, there is
substantial scope for fiscal savings and better incentives for savings.
30.

Important steps to reform the pension system have been taken, but the agenda is not

completed. The retirement age for participants in the National Pension Fund (NPF) and for public
servants is being gradually raised to 65 years.9 In 2013, a new system for new civil servants was
created which will be fiscally sustainable. These reform efforts will help address imbalances in the
system in the long-run; even if there will be some transition costs. Staff noted that additional
progress could be made on: the benefit design and asset management strategy for the new civil
servants’ pension fund; ensuring the sustainability of the NPF; and reviewing the overall investment
strategy and governance structure of the public pension system. In addition, merging the National
Savings Fund (NSF) and the new civil servants’ system with the NPF could be considered to achieve
economies of scale in administration and asset management costs.
31.

Additional pension reforms could increase private savings. The prevailing contribution

rate in Mauritius of 9 percent is low by international comparison (16th percentile of 120 countries).
Similarly, the targeted replacement rate of 33 percent after 40 years of contributions is low and may
not provide sufficient retirement income and thus create contingent fiscal liabilities. Jointly
increasing NPF contribution rates and pension benefits and the mandatory inclusion of selfemployed workers in the NPF could promote national savings and better achieve social protection
objectives.
32.

The external investment and financing strategy of the public sector should be viewed

from a sovereign asset liability management perspective. With more than 80 percent of the
8

David and Petri (2013) “Inclusive Growth and the Incidence of Fiscal Policy in Mauritius,” draft IMF working paper.

9

Nevertheless, the retirement age for the universal BRP has not been increased.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MAURITIUS

public pensions assets invested domestically, greater international diversification and passive
investment strategies should result in higher risk-adjusted returns. However, initially, there would be
capital outflows to be coordinated with the governments’ borrowing and the BOM’s reserve
accumulation strategy to ensure that overall public sector objectives are reached in a costminimizing way.
33.

The authorities welcomed the macroeconomic perspective on pension reforms, which

validates recent reform efforts. They highlighted efforts being undertaken with the World Bank to
implement a model to improve estimates of pension system imbalances and assess the impact of
reform options. The last full actuarial review focused only on the NPF and NSF and referred to the
state of these systems as of 2005, so a forward looking capability will be extremely valuable. The
authorities argued that the BRP is perceived to be part of the national social fabric and therefore
targeting these expenditures to the most vulnerable would be politically very difficult but they are
committed to exploring other options to meet social protection and national savings objectives.

D. Labor Market Outlook
34.

Unemployment seems to be largely structural affecting mostly the low-skilled young

and women (Appendix V). The latest overall unemployment rate is 8 percent; 44 percent of the
unemployed are below the age of 25 (with an unemployment rate of 22 percent). Female
unemployment declined but is still about 13 percent. Strong demand for skilled workers in the
financial services, ITC, health care, and tourism sectors has offset some employment losses for the
lower-skilled textile and sugar sectors, but the demand is partially unmet, which signals a skill
mismatch underpinned by low education attainment.
35.

Labor market reforms can increase the employment-growth elasticity. Staff estimates

an employment-growth elasticity of 0.3 for Mauritius, which is low compared to most countries.
Assuming baseline growth of 4.1 percent, unemployment might decline by one percentage point by
2017. Policy measures should primarily target the employability of low-skilled youth through
subsidized training, as already envisaged by the authorities. Better aligning the education curriculum
to industry demands and increasing private sector involvement in vocational education, particularly
for the young that do not stay within the traditional system would be important. Directly supporting
firms, particularly SMEs in the design of their job needs could also be helpful. An earned income tax
credit might encourage low-wage earners to take jobs on which they can acquire skills. Finally, the
wage setting mechanisms should be reviewed with the objective of aligning real wage increases
closer with labor productivity improvements.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

MAURITIUS

36.

The authorities agreed with the diagnosis of the labor market and noted that several

of the initiatives recommended by staff are already underway. The 2013 budget includes
actions to facilitate the skills acquisition and job placement for the unemployed up to the age of 25,
including the Youth Employment Program, which is jointly financed by government and the private
sector. The authorities also aim at improving their statistical databases to better measure
unemployment and capture and the factors that determine it.

E. Monetary Policy Framework and Financial Sector Issues
37.

The current “hybrid inflation targeting” framework remains well-suited for Mauritius,

but can be refined further. The law sets a dual primary objective for monetary policy: maintain
price stability and promote orderly and balanced economic development. It also assigns a dual
function to the BOM (conduct monetary policy and manage the exchange rate) and defines its dual
operational task: determine a range of rate of inflation and formulate and implement appropriate
policies to promote economic activities having due regard to domestic and international economic
developments. There is scope for a clearer definition of a consistent set of final policy objective(s),
intermediate target(s), and operational target(s)/instrument(s). At the request of the authorities, a
technical assistance mission to discuss the central bank act is planned for Q2 2013.
38.

The monetary policy transmission mechanism should be strengthened by reducing

excess liquidity in the banking system. Monetary transmission from the key repo rate to deposit
and lending rates is generally effective (Appendix VI). However, the interbank rate and 91-day T-bill
rate continue to be well below the key repo rate due excess liquidity within the banking system and
insufficient supply of liquid domestic assets. Reducing the misalignment of interest rates would
enhance monetary transmission and improve banking sector efficiency. Over the medium-term, the
monetary transmission mechanism could also be improved by liberalizing the relatively large
number of administered prices in the economy. The BOM should resume its repo operations to mop
up excess liquidity and it should be recapitalized with government bonds to have enough assets as
collateral for repo operations. Developing a secondary bond market could also help absorb bank
excess cash holdings by providing banks with a larger supply of liquid assets.
39.

Stress tests highlight the resilience of the Mauritian banking system (Appendix VII).

The banking system is well-capitalized and profitable, which provides important buffers against a
range of shocks to their credit portfolios. Direct exchange rate and interest rate risks appear to be
low, although concentration of lending remains a risk for some banks. Liquidity ratios have declined,
but the banking sector as a whole still has sufficient liquid assets to sustain a hypothetical bank-run
test, with the liquid assets-to-total assets ratio at 10 percent by the end of day 5. Distance-todefault analysis combining balance sheet information and stock prices also indicates that the
18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MAURITIUS

expected default risk is minimal for the two largest domestic banks. Developments in the real estate
sector should be monitored although it appears that lending is well-collateralized.
40.

The authorities welcomed the results of the staff’s stress testing exercise, which are in

line with the BOM’s own stress testing results. The BOM is undertaking steps to limit lending
concentration risks and is examining the interconnectedness of the Mauritian financial system,
gathering information on within-group exposures as well as on offshore activities. The BOM has also
circulated a consultative paper on Basel III requirements.
41.

The BOM is collaborating with the Financial Services Commission (FSC) and working

on other ways to strengthen the financial system. Regular meetings are taking place between
BOM and FSC to address supervisory and statistics coordination issues; the first BOM-FSC joint onsite inspection is expected this year. The FSC is contributing to the BOM’s Financial Stability Reports.
The BOM and the FSC should continue to strengthen their collaboration, particularly on the interlinkages between banks and non-bank financial institutions. A draft deposit insurance scheme (DIS)
bill was prepared by the BOM in consultation with stakeholders, reviewed by an IMF TA mission, and
submitted to the Ministry of Finance for review. Implementation of DIS would contribute to greater
financial system stability.

F. Statistical Issues
42.

Mauritius’ macroeconomic statistics are adequate for surveillance and statistical

capacity continues to be strengthened. The authorities aim at subscribing to SDDS Plus in the
future. Balance of payments and international investment position statistics should increasingly
improve coverage, frequency, and timeliness of data sources, with particular focus on the coverage
of GBCs. Monetary statistics could benefit from expanding coverage to Other Financial Companies.
There is need for assistance to improve labor statistics and public sector statistics. Consolidated
public sector statistics (general government, central bank, and SOEs) are needed to assess the true
macro-fiscal stance and the public sector’s net worth. Fully integrating the special funds into the
budget in 2014 would reduce budgetary fragmentation and facilitate more effective expenditure
management.

STAFF APPRAISAL
43.

The authorities have a good track record of prudent macroeconomic management and

implementing structural reforms even though challenges remain. Macroeconomic management
has delivered low inflation, declining debt-to-GDP ratios, and, given the difficult external
environment, satisfactory growth. This outcome has been helped by consistent efforts to improve

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

MAURITIUS

public financial management, the business climate, social assistance, and the sustainability of public
finances, including on pensions. Important challenges remain in the areas of public utilities. Recent
efforts to improve the human and capital infrastructure (especially road congestion) need to
continue.
44.

The outlook for 2013 is broadly positive. Growth is expected to reach 3¾ percent, close

to potential, with inflation projected at about 5 percent. The main risk to the outlook is a significant
deterioration of economic conditions in Europe, but with an appropriate policy response, the
Mauritian economy should remain resilient to external shocks.
45.

A neutral fiscal policy stance would be desirable for 2013 in order to smooth medium-

term fiscal consolidation and to facilitate external adjustment. The planned modest
expansionary fiscal impulse for 2013 is likely to have a limited impact given the low fiscal multipliers
typical of small highly open island economies with a floating exchange rate regime. In addition it
would delay debt reduction and send an unclear signal on the direction of fiscal policy. A neutral
stance is also likely to help to narrow the large current account deficit and facilitate the rebuilding of
policy buffers.
46.

The current accommodative monetary policy stance remains appropriate, but the

authorities should stand ready to tighten monetary conditions if inflation accelerates beyond
current expectations. Inflationary pressures relate to wage increases and adjustments in
administered prices, but expectations appear to be well-anchored. Excess liquidity should be
reduced to better align the policy rate with market rates and help strengthen the monetary
transmission mechanism. The Mauritian banking system is well-capitalized and profitable. Stress
testing indicates the sector to be resilient against a range of shocks. Real estate developments
should be monitored and cooperation between the BOM and the FSC further improved.
47.

Medium-term fiscal consolidation should focus on reductions in transfers and

subsidies and revenue raising measures. Expenditure measures could include better targeting of
social protection expenditures, phasing-out subsidies for LPG, rice and flour, and improving the
efficiency of SOEs. Full cost recovery pricing policies for water and electricity could also mitigate
quasi-fiscal deficits and facilitate much needed investments in these sectors to improve the quality
of service. The existing cash transfer mechanism could be expanded to protect the poor. Increases in
the revenue-to-GDP ratio would provide additional space for priority spending for building human
and physical capital. This could be achieved through improvements in the design and administration
of the main taxes (excises, VAT, income and real estate taxation).

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

MAURITIUS

48.

Increasing national savings and fostering competitiveness would reduce the large

external current account deficit. Medium-term fiscal consolidation should facilitate external
adjustment. Efforts to improve competitiveness through structural reforms and investment in
infrastructure and human capital are also crucial. The floating exchange rate regime continues to
serve the country well, in particular by allowing the exchange rate to act as a shock absorber. Staff
estimates that the real exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals.
49.

The pension system could be used as a lever to increase national savings. Recent

reforms have put the system on a much better footing, but further reforms would be helpful. An
increase in mandatory retirement savings combined with an actuarially-sustainable increase in
benefits is likely to lead to higher overall national savings. The inclusion of most public pensions
systems within a strengthened NPF and mandatory inclusion of self-employed workers in the NPF
might also be considered.
50.

Labor market reform should primarily target the employability of the low-skilled

youth and women who comprise the majority of the unemployed. Measures to better align the
education curriculum to the needs of industry and increase private sector involvement in vocational
education could also contribute to reduce skills mismatches, particularly for the young. Wage setting
mechanisms should be reviewed with the objective of aligning real wage increases closer with labor
productivity improvements. An earned income tax credit could be introduced to encourage lowwage earners to take jobs on which they can acquire skills.
51.

Mauritius’ macroeconomic statistics are strong and form a good basis for surveillance

and policy-making. Ongoing initiatives to further strengthen the coverage and timeliness of data
are welcome steps towards the goal of subscription to SDDS Plus.
52.

Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard

12-month cycle.

The 2011 foreign asset and liability survey has resulted in significant upward revisions in the stock of short term debt, thus leading to a sharp
reduction in the ratio compared to previous projections.

APPENDIX I. DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS1
I. Recent Debt Developments
Public debt has stabilized over the last three years, albeit at a relatively high level of
56 percent of GDP, highlighting the need for fiscal consolidation over the medium term.2 After
reaching a peak of close to 75 percent in 2003, the ratio of public debt to GDP had been on a
declining trend mainly due to strong economic growth and sound fiscal policy. Nevertheless, a series
of stimulus measures to counter the effects of the global financial crisis pushed up public debt to
almost 60 percent of GDP by the end of 2009. Although the comprehensive policy packages are
considered to have been broadly effective in facilitating economic recovery in 2010–11 and thus
bringing the debt ratio to close to 56 percent of GDP by end-2012, the Mauritian authorities are
cognizant of the need for further fiscal consolidation over the medium-term.
The central government relies mostly on domestic debt for its borrowing needs, whereas in
relative terms, state-owned firms have relied more heavily on external debt. As of December
2011, domestic debt represented over 80 percent of total central government debt, a small decline
with respect to the average share for the period 2003–09 (90 percent), as the government pursued a
strategy of seeking longer-term financing from multilateral and bilateral creditors under favorable
conditions (below-market terms). Over 25 percent of domestic central government debt is classified
as short-term (by original maturity). The debt of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) is estimated to
account for 10 percent of total public debt as of end-2011. External debt amounted to over
50 percent of total SOE debt in 2011, in line with the historical average for the period 2003–09.
The legally-mandated public debt ceilings defined in the 2008 Public Debt Management Act
(PDMA) are appropriate to anchor fiscal policy and ensure overall debt sustainability. The limits
are 60 percent of GDP until 2017 and 50 percent of GDP after 2018. The 2011 Article IV consultation
(SM/11/60) included discussions on the appropriateness of the debt ceiling rule contained in the
PDMA in supporting fiscal sustainability. Recent empirical work also suggests that a debt ratio of
50 percent of GDP is close to the sustainability risk threshold for a typical emerging market.3 In
addition, as a financial center, Mauritius might need larger policy buffers to respond to shocks.

The authorities are currently revising the debt management strategy. The strategy attempts to
meet the borrowing needs of the government in a manner that avoids market disruption; to
minimize the cost of the debt portfolio within an acceptable level of risk; and to support the
development of a well-functioning market for government securities. Among other objectives, the
strategy envisages lengthening the maturity profile of government debt (partly by increasing the
share of external debt in the total portfolio), increasing the issuance of long-term domestic debt
instruments, and increasing liquidity in the domestic market for government securities. In this
context, authorities have made progress in standardizing domestic issuances into fewer benchmark
maturities and in making public the issuance calendar for key benchmark maturities. Nevertheless,
the secondary market for government securities remains relatively thin and shallow.

II. Baseline Assumptions underlying the DSA
The results of this debt sustainability analysis are based on a number of important
assumptions, notably regarding fiscal consolidation, sound monetary policy and sustained
economic growth over the medium term. GDP growth is expected to increase, reaching
4.5 percent in 2018 driven by increased infrastructure investment and productivity improvements.
Inflation should remain moderate due to credible implementation of monetary policy by the Bank of
Mauritius. Furthermore, the macroeconomic framework used for this exercise assumes that the
government will resume fiscal consolidation after 2013, with a targeted primary surplus of about
1 percent of GDP by 2015. A reduction in transfers and subsidies and better enforcement of financial
discipline for public enterprises is expected to contribute to deficit reduction.
The current account deficit is expected to gradually narrow reaching about 7 percent of GDP
by 2018. The trade balance should improve over the projection period as imports stabilize, while
export growth continues to be robust at around 6.8 percent on average.
The baseline macroeconomic framework is subject to downside risks. Given the strong links
between Mauritius and advanced economies in Europe, the macroeconomic outlook remains
vulnerable to the volatile external environment. FDI inflows, tourism receipts and exports of
manufactured goods to European trading partners are particularly important transmission channels
for external shocks.

III. Public Debt Sustainability
The results of the debt sustainability analysis indicate that public debt is sustainable over the
medium-term (Table I.1 and Figure I.1). Despite the small fiscal expansion expected in the context
of the 2013 budget, public debt should gradually decline over the projection period, as fiscal

30

MAURITIUS

consolidation takes place. If the planned fiscal adjustment is implemented, Mauritius should be able
to reach the 50 percent debt-to-GDP target mandated by the PDMA by 2018. In fact, public debt is
projected to drop below 48 percent of GDP by 2018 even without discounting debt by SOEs.4
Public debt dynamics are resilient to several stress tests (Figure I.1). The results of standardized
sensitivity tests do not fundamentally alter the broadly positive outlook for public debt previously
discussed. In most cases, the public debt-to-GDP ratio does not approach 60 percent by the end of
the projection period under the different shocks considered,5 with two notable exceptions. The
scenario including an increase in contingent liabilities would cause the debt-to-GDP ratio to reach
65 percent in 2014 before falling back to 57 percent by 2018. The debt outlook is also vulnerable to a
large depreciation, which would push up the public debt-to-GDP ratio by over 10 percentage points
to 58 percent in 2018.

IV. External Debt Sustainability
External debt dynamics are sustainable in the baseline scenario (Table I.2 and Figure I.2).
External debt is estimated at 24 percent of GDP at the end of 2012. Gross bank external liabilities
surpassed 100 percent of GDP at the end-2012 and are not included in external debt figures, as bank
foreign assets are almost twice as large,6 and as in many international financial centers, it would be
misleading to include gross bank liabilities in the external debt measure. External debt is projected to
increase somewhat initially and then stabilize around 25 percent of GDP over the medium term, as
authorities take advantage of partially concessional long-term financing from multilateral and
bilateral sources.
Stress tests indicate that the external debt trajectory is particularly vulnerable to shocks to the
non-interest current account and large exchange rate depreciations. Sensitivity analysis suggests
that Mauritius’ external debt is resilient to interest rate and growth shocks, but a 30 percent real
depreciation would push up the external debt-to-GDP ratio to 35 percent in 2018. A current account
4

The discounting of the debt of certain types of SOEs is envisaged under the 2008 Public Debt Management Act for

the purposes of calculating the public debt ceiling. In 2011, the discount on SOE debt amounted to 3.3 percent of
GDP.
5

Sensitivity tests include shocks to the interest rate, to growth, to the primary balance, a combination of shocks, as

well as shocks to contingent liabilities, and a 30 percent exchange rate depreciation.
6

Bank investments of the GBC float—that is, money from foreign investors meant to be transferred to third countries

but held for a short period by GBCs in bank deposits—are included. Excluding these GBC counterpart investments
would still result in a positive bank net foreign asset position.

deficit that is 3 percentage points of GDP larger than projected in the baseline would also cause the
debt-to-GDP ratio to shoot up to close to 34 percent by 2018. Thus, moderating the non-interest
part of the external current account balance is key to maintaining external debt sustainability.

V. Conclusion
Overall, the DSA results indicate that the debt outlook for Mauritius is broadly positive. Both
total public debt and external debt are on sustainable trajectories in the baseline, and the results of
stress tests indicate that debt dynamics are resilient to several shocks. Nevertheless, the external
debt outlook is particularly vulnerable to a shock to the non-interest current account and to large
depreciations, which may lead to unsustainable trajectories. In addition, total public sector debt
could be significantly affected by shocks to contingent liabilities. It is important to note that the
simulated debt trajectories are based on the assumption that structural reforms will be implemented
to sustain growth rates and that some fiscal consolidation will take place over the medium-term.

The Mauritian rupee appreciated by an average of 1 percent in real effective terms during 2012

started intervening more actively in the foreign exchange market in June 2012 to build reserves and
smooth the fluctuation of the rupee. The rupee appreciated by 1.3 percent in real effective terms for the
year as a whole.

The rupee is estimated to be broadly in line with fundamentals. Staff applied the three Consultative
Group on Exchange Rate Issues (CGER) methodologies—macroeconomic balance (MB), equilibrium real
exchange rate (ERER), and external sustainability (ES) approaches. All three approaches consistently give
point estimates of a mild overvaluation (less than 5 percent over the medium-term, Table II.1.), but the
level of confidence in the estimates is not very high (see detailed discussion below). The results from
CGER methodologies are also consistent with two additional approaches: the purchasing power parity
(PPP) approach and the fundamental equilibrium exchange rate (FEER) approach, which point to smaller
or zero overvaluation. Following BOM’s sterilized interventions in late 2012, the estimated 2013
overvaluation declined with respect to 2012 for all methodologies. The limited targeted interventions
were successful because (i) the rupee is not considered a perfect substitute for other currencies; (ii) BOM
is a large player in a small market; (iii) interventions were aimed to move the currency towards the
estimated equilibrium; and (iv) fiscal policy was supportive of the overall policy mix.
Table II.1 summarizes the current and medium-term exchange rate misalignment computed under the
five different methodologies. Some results are sensitive to the estimates of the elasticity of the current

account with respect to the real exchange rate. The estimates used are Mauritius-specific because as a
small open economy, Mauritius is estimated to have higher import and export elasticities (Table II.I). If
standard CGER elasticities (exports = –0.71; imports = 0.92) were used instead of Mauritius-specific
elasticities, implied exchange rate misalignments would be larger for the MB and the ES approaches.

The results from CGER methodologies are in
line with the results from the two other
approaches. The PPP approach shows that the

its historical average. The fundamental

conceptually similar to the ERER approach; it also

The ES approach estimates the level of the CA
balance that stabilizes the level of net foreign
assets (NFA) (Figure II.4). It shows that the rupee
is projected to be overvalued by about 13 percent
in 2013 and 9 percent over the medium term due
to a projected decline in the CA deficit. The
estimated overvaluation under the ES approach is
slightly larger than that of the MB approach
because of the difference in the CA norms.

The ERER approach does not suggest a
significant misalignment. The ERER approach
signaled a significant overvaluation of the rupee in
2012, as the average real exchange rate breached
the upper 90 percent confidence interval. But the
rupee depreciated subsequently in the second half
of the year. The 2013 level of overvaluation,
estimated at 10 percent, is within the error bands
and is projected to decrease marginally over the
medium term (Figure II.3).

External Balance and Competitiveness: 2000–2012
The sustained increase in the current account deficit in the past decade is explained by a decrease
in private savings. By definition, the current account deficit is equal to the excess of domestic
investment over domestic savings. Because investment stayed relatively stable at around 25 percent of
GDP, most of the CA deficit is explained by the significant fall in national savings from over 25 percent of
GDP in the early 2000s to 15 percent in 2012. Almost the entire decline is due to a fall in private savings
as public savings stayed stable during the period.
Available indicators suggest that Mauritius has become less competitive. Between 2000 and 2012,
the exports-to-GDP ratio fell and the terms-of-trade worsened. Productivity indicators also point to
possible losses in competitiveness. On the one hand, compensation of employees in manufacturing more
than doubled in 2000–12, while labor productivity increased by only about 60 percent, resulting in
sustained increases in unit labor cost. On the other hand, capital productivity decreased in the same
period (Figure II.6). Indeed, rising labor costs might have reduced the return to capital and eroded
competitiveness of the economy.3

The emerging external imbalances should be addressed through measures to increase national
savings (including fiscal consolidation) and to foster competitiveness. Continued fiscal adjustments
could increase public savings, and pension reform could increase public and private savings. Productivity
could be enhanced by investments that reduce infrastructure bottlenecks and by training programs that
reduce skill mismatches in the labor market. Exchange rate policies could be used to resist further
appreciation of the rupee, but the current flexible exchange rate regime has served the country well, and
interventions should not be used as the primary policy instrument to correct external imbalances,
particularly if fundamentals do not suggest an overvaluation of the real exchange rate.

3

There are, however, two caveats to this labor cost-competitiveness analysis: (i) total factor productivity may have
increased because of technology and institutional improvements; and (ii) productivity increases in the services sector are
hard to measure and may have been underestimated.

Capital Flows and Reserve Adequacy
Despite significant volatility in external markets, Mauritius continues to attract sizeable private
capital inflows that have helped to finance the current account deficit. FDI flows and flows related to
the GBCs account for most capital inflows into Mauritius, with net inflows amounting to 1.6 percent and
7.8 percent of GDP respectively in 2011. After recovering to pre-global financial crisis levels in 2010 (to
about 3 percent of GDP), net FDI inflows decelerated in 2011 and are projected to remain relatively
subdued in 2012 and 2013. In the first three quarters of 2012, FDI inflows into the country were mostly
directed to real estate, financial, and hotel sectors. The flows originated mostly from Europe, South Africa
and Asia; although the share of FDI flows originating from Europe has been declining rapidly since 2010.
The quality of data on GBC flows has improved since the first surveys were undertaken in 2010, but it is
still too noisy to allow for a comprehensive analysis of the dynamics of these flows. The authorities
continue to pursue efforts to improve these balance of payments statistics with support from STA.
The Bank of Mauritius should continue to maintain adequate levels of international reserves. As
illustrated in Figure II.7, international reserves are comfortable when measured against the traditional
threshold of import cover (above four months against the benchmark of three months). Amounting to
about 10 times short-term external debt, reserves are also largely above the traditional benchmark of
100 percent. Reserves are also adequate relative to the IMF composite indicator (150 percent) and are
projected to remain so over the medium-term.4 However, reserves have barely kept up with financial
deepening and are only slightly above the 20 percent of M2, a benchmark intended to capture the risk of
capital flight and the potential need for bank support in/after crisis. Against the backdrop of the country’s
exposure to natural disasters and its status as an international financial center, there is a rationale for
continuing to accumulate reserves, so as to keep reserve coverage adequate as outlined in the BOM’s
reserve reconstitution program.

APPENDIX III. ENERGY PRICING AND SUBSIDY REFORM1
The pass-through of international prices to retail petroleum products is incomplete. The State
Trading Corporation (STC) is responsible for imports and sales to retailers of petroleum products, LPG,
wheat flour, and rice. Rice, flour and LPG prices are subsidized at a cost of about 0.3 percent of GDP in
2012, financed by cross-subsidies from sales of gasoline and diesel. Gasoline and diesel prices are set
administratively. Retail prices are only adjusted when there are significant changes in international prices,
according to a system of triggers and caps, subject to approval by the Petroleum Pricing Committee
(PPC). Before the latest adjustment in early March 2013, retail prices had not been adjusted since March
2011, despite significant movements in international prices (Figure III.1). Staff estimates that net losses
from the incomplete pass-through of international prices in 2012 reached 0.1 percent of GDP.

Electricity tariff adjustments are made mainly

2000s indicate that costs were relatively low and
mostly linked to excess distribution losses up to
the mid-2000s (Figure III.2).2 But inadequate
pricing of electricity posed a burden in 2006,
when underpricing costs are estimated to have
reached close to 0.4 percent of GDP. Despite its
overall positive performance, according to

sector is subject to significant vulnerabilities, in particular because of infrequent and backward looking
tariff adjustments that do not cover planned investment costs. Going forward, this could lead to the
emergence of supply bottlenecks, if not addressed.
Good Practices in Energy Pricing
Actual costs should guide the pricing of petroleum products. The international experience suggests
that the most sustainable policies for domestic pricing of petroleum products are either full liberalization
or transparent and simple automatic adjustment mechanisms for administered prices. Price adjustment
formulas should be based on actual costs of supply including full transport, storage and other costs
incurred assuming efficient operations. Price adjustment mechanisms should also include a desired level
of taxes and should be automatic and frequent in line with changes in international prices.
A simple and transparent adjustment mechanism is preferable. Excessive smoothing leads to low
pass-through and increases the volatility of fuel-related revenues. Simulations performed by FAD (Coady
and others, 2012) show that price bands with monthly adjustments with no minimum but a maximum of
(+/- 3 percent) provide the best results in terms of reducing retail price volatility while stabilizing fiscal
revenues. In practice, automatic price adjustment mechanisms are subject to significant implementation
risks. The pricing formula should be insulated from political influence, perhaps by delegating its
implementation to an independent and transparent body that includes representatives from different
stakeholders (importers, distributors, transporters, among others) and with appropriate disclosure to the
public.
Automatic adjustments also limit the risks of underpricing electricity. Kenya is an example of a
country that implemented automatic tariff adjustments over an extended period of time. There, tariffs are
based on a formula that reflects long-run marginal costs, but also features monthly automatic passthrough of fuel costs and exchange rate movements. Furthermore, every six months, the formula adjusts
for domestic inflation. The calculation of tariff adjustments is available on the regulator’s website.
Nevertheless, the tariff adjustment mechanism was not fully implemented recently due to political
economy constraints.
Energy pricing should be transparent and consider social impact. Recent IMF research (IMF 2013)
highlights the need for effective public communication campaigns and transparency (in particular
regarding the measurement and incidence of subsidies) to build support for reform efforts. Another
crucial aspect is the need to mitigate the impact of reform on the poor through the existing social
assistance programs (targeted cash transfers) or an increase in expenditure on public transportation. For
the electricity sector, lifeline tariffs for the poor are also an important mitigating measure.
Reform options for Mauritius
Fuel and electricity pricing have a different social impacts. Household survey data indicates that in
Mauritius, fuel-related expenditures (including transportation) are more concentrated towards richer
segments of the population, as the concentration curves for these expenditures lie well below the
45 degree line (see Figure III.3). Expenditures on electricity seem to be much more evenly distributed
across households than expenditures on petroleum products.

A fully automatic formula for pricing petroleum products would be appropriate for Mauritius.

implementing automatic formulas and the
challenge seems to be to find ways to actually

application of the formula, even in the face of
political pressure not to do so. The current

Electricity tariffs should reflect current costs and cover investment plans. Generation costs are
particularly vulnerable to swings in international fuel prices. It would be desirable to use an automatic
formula based on international prices, exchange rates and inflation to avoid the emergence of quasi-fiscal
deficits at CEB. Electricity tariffs should also cover the costs of new investments in generation. This would
help to ensure that there will not be future bottlenecks due to inadequate investment.
The impact of price increases on the most vulnerable should be mitigated. Mauritian authorities
could use the recently established Social Registry of Mauritians (SRM) to provide targeted cash transfers.
Potential fiscal savings could also be allocated to investments in public transportation.

This would help pass-through fuel costs to the rest of the economy and make the CPI more reflective of underlying
economic developments; something that is limited currently by the wide-spread use of administered prices.

APPENDIX IV. PENSION REFORM OPTIONS1
Mauritius recently implemented several reforms to ensure the long-run sustainability of the public pension
system, but additional actions would be desirable. This annex will review policy actions and analyze their
macroeconomic impact including on national savings and emerging external imbalances.
The pension system in Mauritius consists of five components: the universal basic retirement pension
(BRP); The National Pension Fund (NPF); pensions for public sector workers; the National Savings Fund
(NSF); and private pension plans. Overall, at 4 percent of GDP, public pension expenditures in Mauritius
are close to the typical level observed for an emerging market.
The BRP is a non-contributory pension payable to every Mauritian citizen aged 60 years and above.
In 2011, BRP expenditures amounted to 2.2 percent of GDP, but these expenditures are poorly targeted
with close to 39 percent of the pension benefits going to the richest 20 percent of the population (David
and Petri, 2013).
The NPF is a defined-benefit scheme for all private sector employees funded by mandatory
contributions from employees (3 percent of earnings) and employers (6 percent). The system is
partially pre-funded and as of end-2012, the total assets of the NPF amounted to 24 percent of GDP;
mainly invested in Mauritian government securities (around 60 percent). On the liability side, the NPF had
around 89,000 beneficiaries in 2011 and expenditures on benefits amounted to less than 0.5 percent of
GDP. The retirement age is being gradually increased from 60 to 65 years, with the full transition expected
to be implemented by 2018, to help secure its long-term sustainability because the increase in the oldage dependency ratio is a major factor in Mauritius (Figure IV.1).
Civil servants who joined before December
2012 have a defined-benefit scheme to
which they contribute 6 percent of earnings.
Expenditures on civil servants pensions were
1.3 percent of GDP in 2011, but are rising
rapidly. Since January 2013, all new entrants are
enrolled in a new system in which they pay
6 percent and the government 12 percent of
earnings. The new scheme will result in major
long-term fiscal savings, but its institutional setup, distribution rules, and the investment
strategy still need to be determined.

The NSF is a compulsory definedcontribution scheme for public and private sector workers funded by 2 percent of employees’
earnings. Beneficiaries receive a lump sum at retirement, which is determined by past contributions and
investment performance, subject to a “no-capital loss” guarantee. Total assets of the NSF amounted to
4.3 percent of GDP at end-2012, with over 75 percent of assets allocated to government bonds and
t-bills. In 2011, the NSF paid 0.1 percent of GDP to over 7,500 persons.

The outlook for the Pension System 2015–2050
Imbalances might reach close to 5 percent of GDP by 2040 (Figure IV.2). Following the methodology
outlined in IMF (2011) “The Challenge of Public Pension Reform in Advanced and Emerging Economies”,
staff projected the imbalances (flow difference between expenditures and contributions) for the three
main components of the public pension system for 2015–50 (Figure IV.2). The main assumptions were
(i) 4.5 percent in real GDP growth, in line with potential growth estimates; (ii) stable participation rates;
and (iii) inflation adjustments-only for BRP benefits. The projections take into account the recent reforms
to increase the retirement age in the NPF and civil servants’ system, but do not include the impact of the
new system for new entrants in the civil service.

Initially, the BRP would be the main driver of imbalances. BRP imbalances will remain around
2.2 percent of GDP until 2030, when they are expected to decline as a share of GDP given the
assumptions about the adjustment of benefits in line with CPI. This assumption reflects current policies,
but might be difficult to sustain politically as the economy grows and pressures to increase the real value
of pensions materialize.
Civil servants’ pensions would pose an increasing burden over the longer term. Imbalances for
public sector workers would increase from about 1 percent of GDP in 2015 to close to 3 percent of GDP
by 2045. This will be somewhat mitigated by the reforms enacted in 2013, but the new civil system will
generate savings only in about 30–40 years because until then retirees will be in the old system. During
the transition, imbalances will be higher than presented, as the government contributes to the new
system and pays pensions under the old system.
Expenditures of the NPF are projected to outstrip contributions by 2025, thus requiring
withdrawals from the fund to cover pension obligations. Figure IV.2 presents preliminary estimates of
the evolution of NPF assets under different assumptions about asset returns. Under the baseline scenario
of relatively high rates of return (4 percent in real terms, assumed for the last NPF actuarial report), the
fund would have sufficient resources to meet benefit obligations over the projection period. However,
under more realistic assumption of lower rates of return, the system could come under stress earlier.

Macroeconomic Implications and Considerations for Reform
Additional reforms to the public pension system are necessary and their macroeconomic impact
should be considered. Recent pension reforms should help reduce imbalances in the long-run, but they
are not enough. In addition, there will be some transition costs that will need to be financed in a context
of limited fiscal space. The sustained increase in the current account deficit in Mauritius over the past
decade is largely explained by a fall in national savings. In this context, the pension system might play an
important role in increasing savings and the recent reform of the civil servants system provides an
opportunity to reexamine the entire public system holistically.
Pension reforms in pay-as-you-go systems can have very different macroeconomic effects
depending on the nature of changes and assumptions about rationality. Overall, the less forwardlooking and credit constrained agents are, the less they change their voluntary (non-pension) savings and
the less they change their labor supply in response to reform.2 IMF (2012) shows that the introduction of
a defined-contribution pillar can increase private savings, although the overall impact on national savings
will depend on how the transition costs are financed (debt versus reductions in government
consumption).
There is some evidence that pre-funded mandatory retirement savings schemes can boost national
savings. While the empirical evidence on the impact of general pension reforms on savings tends to be
ambiguous (IMF, 2011), this appears less so for reforms that are designed to address behavioral problems
that might lead to insufficient retirement savings. For example, the high mandatory contribution rates are
thought to be a determinant of the high private savings rates in Singapore with an estimated elasticity of
national savings to pension wealth of 0.3 (Faruqee and Hussain, 1998). Similarly, national savings
increased after the introduction of a broadly pre-funded defined-contribution system in Chile in 1980.
Jointly increasing contribution rates and the target replacement rates of the NPF might increase
national savings and provide better social protection in Mauritius. Total mandatory contributions
from employees and employers to the NPF at 9 percent are at the 16th percentile internationally and thus
rather low (Figure IV.3). At the same time, the target replacement rate for the NPF of about 33 percent
might not be sufficient to provide adequate living standards to an ageing population and could result in
contingent liabilities.3 Raising contribution and replacement rates in an actuarially sustainable way might
meet social protection and national savings objectives (given imbalances for the NPF, the contribution
rates might have to be raised somewhat more than benefits to make the NPF fully sustainable). The
mandatory inclusion of self-employed workers in the NPF could also contribute to boost savings.
It would also be desirable to target BRP expenditures and to better integrate the BRP and NPF.
Projected BRP expenditures can be thought as a lower bound, because political pressures to increase BRP
benefits in real terms are likely to materialize as the economy grows. Given limited fiscal space and the
fact that most of the spending benefits the non-poor, it would make sense to means-test these pensions
to turn them into true poverty pensions. Moreover, it should be studied how the BRP could be integrated
into the NPF to provide greater savings incentives and a better overall protection system.

2

Catalan and Magud (2012) and IMF (2012) are recent applications in a dynamic general equilibrium context.

Including the BRP would only increase the average replacement rate to close to 40 percent, which is still low.

The authorities should consider merging the NSF and the new civil servants system into the NPF.
For the NSF, this would result in higher pension benefits instead of a lump-sum payment with beneficial
social protection results. For the new civil servants system, a merger with the NPF instead of setting up a
new defined contribution system should be beneficial because the risk-adjusted returns in an actuariallyfair, pre-funded defined benefit system are likely to exceed those of a defined contribution system.
Contribution rates could be harmonized in a reformed NPF or benefits adjusted in line with contributions

in an actuarially fair way, which would also allow for higher voluntary contributions. Combining the
different pension systems would also allow achieving economies of scale in administration costs.
The overall investment strategy for the NPF, NSF and the newly created fund for public sector
workers needs to be carefully reviewed. In addition to economies of scale, international portfolio
diversification should result in higher risk-adjusted returns for a small economy, as suggested by modern
portfolio theory. The investment governance structure and capacity of the NPF could be improved to
ensure better investment results. There may also be savings from pursuing a mostly index-based, passive
investment strategy, which is particularly suited for pension funds with limited investment capacity.
The external investment and financing strategy of the public sector should be viewed from a
sovereign asset liability management perspective. The move towards greater international
diversification of public pension fund investments will have macroeconomic consequences. Larger capital
outflows might initially result in exchange rate depreciation pressures, and would need to be coordinated
with BOM reserve accumulation policies. In addition, investing in non-government securities while
borrowing increases the leverage of the public sector. This is would only be beneficial, if the expected
long-run return on the marginal foreign investment is higher than the government borrowing rate. Thus,
the pension fund’s external investment, the governments’ borrowing, and the BOM’s reserve
accumulation strategy should be coordinated to ensure that overall public sector objectives are reached
in a cost minimizing way.

APPENDIX V. LABOR MARKET ISSUES AND OUTLOOK1
Unemployment in Mauritius predominantly affects the low-skilled young and women. After the
year 2000 there has been a moderate increase in unemployment driving up the total unemployment rate
to near 8 percent (Figure V.1). Stronger demand for skilled workers in the financial services, ITC, health
care and tourism sectors has partly offset the fall in labor demand for the lower-skilled textile and sugar
sectors, which also increasingly employ expatriate workers (4 percent of today’s total labor force). About
44 percent of the unemployed in 2012 were below the age of 25; this group experiences an
unemployment rate of 22 percent.

Weak educational attainment is a strong factor explaining unemployment. Around a third of
students fail to complete primary education, which does not compare well with countries such as Mexico,
Turkey, or Vietnam where 90 percent of students graduate from primary education. 2011 data show that
27 percent of the unemployed had only primary education. There are no statistics on unemployment by
educational attainment, but there is evidence that the unemployed have low educational attainment,
which is an impediment for vocational training and leads to skills mismatches.
Mauritius embarked on a broad set of labor reforms since 2006. Policies and institutional changes
included more flexible labor legislation and the launch of training and education reforms. The creation of
a more level playing field between large companies and SMEs bolstered economic competitiveness and
translated into strong job creation in the services sector. The introduction of the advisory National Pay
Council (NPC) in 2007 helped link wage growth better to productivity gains. Wage adjustments became
more differentiated across sectors thereby reducing wage rigidity and containing the wage-price spiral.
The unemployment rate fell from its 9.5 percent peak in 2005 (following the end of the Multifibre
Arrangement (MFA)) to 7.2 percent in 2008. Female unemployment fell by 3½ percentage points to

13 percent, as young female entrants continued to be absorbed into the services sector (Figure V.2). The
October 2010 decision to abolish the NPC might risk returning to a system where wage increases are
linked rigidly to the CPI: real wages grew faster than labor productivity before the NPC.

Some evidence suggests that unemployment is primarily of a structural nature. Preliminary
estimates show that the Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment (NAIRU) was generally in line
with the unemployment rate suggesting a narrow output gap.2 However the difference became positive
recently providing support for structural unemployment factors (Figure V.3). Also, there has been limited
job destruction during periods of economic slowdown, indicating that cyclical adjustments do not take
place through massive labor lay-offs. The reforms implemented after the 2008 crisis helped cushion the
impact on jobs and were complemented by short-term microeconomic measures to protect jobs, such as
the Mechanism for Transitional Support to Private Sector (MTSP), whereby the government took equity
stakes in weakening private firms participating in restructuring plans. In addition, previous studies

suggest that unemployment is largely related
to skills mismatches on the supply side and
rigidities on the labor demand side through
wage setting institutions and laws.3 Overall
indicators of labor market flexibility show that
Mauritius compares relatively well, but two
areas of particular rigidity are the hiring and
firing regulations and the centralized collective
bargaining.4 These two areas of concern are
also highlighted in the World Economic Forum
2012–2013 Global Competitiveness Report,
where Mauritius ranks 78th for ”stringent hiring
and firing practices” and 108th for “rigid wages
determination”.

in Mauritius. Based on historical data since
1990, using a newly developed IMF template, staff estimated an employment-output elasticity of 0.28,
which was used for baseline unemployment projections.
Unemployment should decline somewhat over the medium term, but Mauritius would need
stronger growth and targeted labor market reforms to reduce unemployment significantly
(Figure V.5). Under the baseline scenario (average real GDP growth of 4.1 percent) the unemployment
rate would decline by 1 percentage point to 7 percent over the next five years. An unemployment rate of
6 percent by 2017 would require real GDP growth of 5 percent, which is slightly above staff’s estimate of
potential economic growth (4½ percent). Structural reforms to increase the employment elasticity by
about one third (from 0.28 to 0.38), would more drastically contribute to a dent in unemployment.

mismatches is essential for increasing
employment in expanding sectors, most notably banking, ITC, health care and tourism. The experience of
Singapore’s Workforce Development Agency provides a relevant example of what can be done to
develop the labor force through education and training and support to SMEs’ management.
Supporting appropriately flexible labor markets, in particular with respect to the wage
determination process, could provide further incentive for job creation. The wage setting framework
should align real wage increases closer with labor productivity improvements. A review of relative public
sector wages might be useful in this respect because relatively high wages for low-skilled civil servants
can increase private sector reservation wages. In this context, the authorities could study introducing an
earned income tax credit to encourage low-wage earners to take jobs on which they can acquire skills.
The transition to a knowledge-based economy requires a labor market that supports flexibility (with
safeguards), rewards higher productivity and allows expansion into novel activities.
The most pressing longer-term challenge for Mauritius consists in enhancing educational
attainment and vocational training of the young. Raising the educational attainment is the best way to
upgrade the future workforce. The results of the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA)
2009+ indicate that the minimum proficiency in reading literacy, mathematics, and science is achieved by
respectively 53, 50 and 53 percent of students. This compares to an average of, respectively, 81, 75 and
82 percent in OECD countries. The passing rates of primary and secondary exams need to improve.
Continued cooperation between the Ministries of Finance and Education through the budget allocation
and performance monitoring processes will support achieving this objective. Equally important is to
ensure that those young that are not well served by the standard academically-oriented educational
system receive vocational training to provide them with practical skills. In this context, the authorities
should aim at better aligning the education and vocational curriculum to industry demands and increase
private sector involvement in vocational education

APPENDIX VI. ASPECTS OF THE MONETARY TRANSMISSION
MECHANISM1
Policy interest rate pass-through to other interest rates is important for effective monetary policy.
Under the current hybrid inflation targeting framework, monetary policy influences the real economy
mainly through moving the market interest rates, rather than other channels such as money aggregates
and exchange rates. Tsangarides (2010) emphasized the need for Mauritius to strengthen its monetary
policy transmission mechanism.2 The paper found that changes in the policy rate have a small impact on
CPI inflation, but a statistically insignificant impact on output.
Pass-through from the policy rate to deposit and lending rates appears strong (Figure VI.1, left
panel). Saborowski and Weber (2013) estimated that policy rate pass-through to the lending rate is about
80 percent in Mauritius, one of the highest among sub-Saharan African countries.3 Pass-through has
improved over the past decade because of increased competition and reduced non-performing loans and
also because that the BOM switched to using the more market-oriented key repo rate as its policy rate
instrument rather than using the Lombard rate.

However, policy rate pass-through to more market-determined interest rates appears to be weak
(Figure VI.1, right panel). The interbank overnight borrowing rate fell below the key repo rate in 2009 and
stayed significantly below since. As of end-2012 the gap widened to 330 basis points. The yield on 91-day
treasury bills fell also below the key repo rate in 2009; it was about 2 percentage points below the key
repo rate at end-2012.

The lack of pass-through is largely explained by excess liquidity in the banking system. The average
daily excess cash balance of banks (cash holdings in excess of required cash reserves; the required reserve
ratio is 7 percent currently) was about 3 billion rupees in 2012 (1 percent of GDP). Banks compete for
liquid assets when they hold excess cash, which drives down market interest rates. Indeed, as expected
there is a positive correlation between the excess cash holdings and the gaps between policy and the
interbank and T-bill interest rates (Figure VI.2).

Current liquidity and interest rate conditions are
suboptimal. Excess liquidity weakens monetary
transmission and reduces the effectiveness of
monetary policy. Ensuring that the interbank rate
stays within the mandated ±125bps band from the
repo rate would help with the signaling function of
the repo rate. Low money market rates also distort
banks’ deposit-taking and lending incentives. It
encourages banks to take more risks in asset
allocation, and discourages banks from taking
deposits. Already banks’ liquid assets' share in total
assets have decreased and credit to private sector has
increased over the past few years (Figure VI.3).

The BOM should resume its repo operations to remove excess liquidity. BOM is concerned about its
profitability, but it can be recapitalized with government bonds to ensure that it has enough repo
collateral assets. The market could also benefit from an increased supply of liquid assets. In the short term
government t-bills issuance can be increased and a secondary bond market for both government and
corporate bonds can be developed over the medium term.

APPENDIX VII. STRESS TESTING OF BANKS1
The recent global financial crisis revealed the importance of assessing financial stability at the level of
individual financial institutions. Staff applied several methodologies to assess the resilience of
Mauritian banks and to identify vulnerabilities of the system as a whole. The system appears sound, but
there are some vulnerabilities with respect to large borrower exposure and liquidity risks.
Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) and bank health heat map
FSIs at the aggregate level portray Mauritius as
a healthy banking system (Figure VII.1). The
capital adequacy ratio (CAR) stands well above
the regulatory minimum of 10 percent and has
increased over time. The non-performing loan
(NPL) ratio increased slightly from 2.8 percent to a
still low 3.7 percent in 2011, and provisions are
adequate. Profitability remains comfortable.
However, the liquidity ratio continued to
decline in 2012 (Figure VII.2). While the ratio was
stable for the onshore (Segment A) sector, it fell
from 40 percent in 2008 to 20 percent in 2012 for
the offshore (Segment B) sector. It is not entirely
clear why banks reduced holding of liquid assets for
the offshore business. Possible explanations include
(1) banks pursuing higher yield in a low interest rate
environment, and (2) a shift in business model as
banks diversify to the African market. The BOM is
analyzing this trend with a view to better
understand the offshore sector.

Results suggest that larger banks in Mauritius are healthier than smaller banks (Table VII.1). Large
banks appear to have higher CARs, better asset quality, and are more profitable. When compared to the
large international banks, the results show that the financial health of the larger Mauritian banks is similar
to or slightly better than the international banks in the reference group, while the smaller banks appear
relatively less healthy.

Sources: BankScope; and IMF staff calculations. A positive (negative) value indicates that the financial ratios are above (below)
the average of the banks in this sample. A positive (negative) value is relative, and does not imply that the bank is financially
healthy (unhealthy) in an absolute sense.

Stress-testing the banking system
Staff updated the 2012 Article IV consultation stress tests for 18 of the 20 Mauritian banks based
on June 2012 data. Banks were divided into four types for analytical purposes: (1) three large banks
serving both domestic and non-residents; (2) three large banks serving primarily non-residents; (3) six
medium-to-small banks serving both domestic and non-residents; and (4) six medium-to-small banks
serving mostly residents. Two smaller banks were excluded because they are primarily equity-funded,
which would have distorted results.
Stress tests suggest that bank capital is sufficient to withstand a wide range of shocks. Banks would
meet the Basel II capital adequacy requirement (CAR) under credit shocks, macroeconomic shocks,
exchange rate shocks and interest rate shocks.
The banking system appears to be resilient to credit risk shocks. A 100 percent increase in NPLs, in
proportion to existing loans, would only lead to limited drops in CARs (Figure VII.3, Panel 1). After-shock
CARs would be above 10 percent for all banks, thanks to the relatively low NPL ratios and adequate
capital in the banking system.

Banks have sufficient capital buffers against external growth shocks. The stress test scenario
envisaged a major slowdown in Europe that would lead to a 2 percentage point drop in real GDP growth
in Mauritius for 2013 (Figure III.3, Panel 2). The impact on Mauritian banks would be mainly through their
export financing business. The smaller banks (type-3 and type-4) with larger export exposures appear
more vulnerable with one type-3 bank’s CAR dropping marginally below 8 percent.
Exposure to large borrowers remains a concern. With a 50 percent loss from their largest borrowing
group, the median drop in CARs would be 3 percentage points (Figure VII.3, Panel 3). One type-3 bank
would see its CAR drop to below the required 8 percent. BOM considers the bank’s default risk to be
minimal in this case, but imposed additional capital adequacy requirements on this bank in line with
regulatory guidelines on credit concentration.
Direct exchange rate and interest rate risks appear contained, but credit risk may arise from
interest rate shocks. Most banks have small long net positions in foreign currency and FX loans to nonexporting companies appear to be minimal. Thus, a rupee depreciation equal to the most severe over the
last 10 years would result in a small gain (Figure VII.3, Panel 4). An increase in the policy interest rate
58

would be neutral because most deposits and loans have floating interest rates, but a rate increase might
generate credit risks, particularly in the real estate sector.
Liquidity is sufficient under most stress situations. Staff applied a hypothetical 5-day bank run across
all banks, assuming that 15 percent of domestic demand deposits and 10 percent of foreign demand
deposits would be withdrawn each day. 4 out of the 18 banks would run out of liquid assets in the
absence of any interbank borrowing or external support, but the banking system as a whole would still be
liquid, with the liquid assets-to-total assets ratio at 10 percent by the end of day 5.

Distance to Default Analysis
The expected default frequency is estimated for the two largest Mauritian banks. The Mauritius
Commercial Bank (MCB) and the State Bank of Mauritius (SBM) are the only two banks that meet the data
requirements of having been listed for more than 5 years. The approach estimates the implied probability
of default using stock market prices and balance sheet information, and it can be interpreted as the
market’s estimate of default probability. The main assumption for the approach is that the stock price can
be seen as a call option on the bank’s assets over a time horizon (12 months in this study). The payoff at
the end of the time horizon is the assets’ value in excess of liabilities when the bank is solvent (asset >
liability), or zero when the bank is insolvent (asset < liability). The payoff follows a probability distribution
and thus a probability that can be estimated by applying option pricing theory to the data.2
The implied default probabilities are zero for both MCB and SBM over the next 12 months
(Figure VII.4). This holds regardless of the assumption on default threshold. Interestingly, the results show
a moderate default probability during the 2008/09 financial crisis, which is perhaps a reflection of global
banking conditions at the time (contagion). Also, the trading activity is low for both banks and thus the
crisis results require careful interpretation. The latest results are consistent with stress test results that
capital is sufficient to withstand a broad range of shocks.

Given equity stock price E and default threshold B, and using the Black-Scholes-Merton formula:
can be estimated iteratively. The default threshold is a key
√ the asset value A and volatility
assumption because in practice many banks do not default even if their assets fall below liabilities as long as they do not
face liquidity pressures. Staff applied a conservative threshold of 100 percent of liabilities and an alternative default
threshold of 70 percent, with the true threshold likely in between the two estimates.

Exchange Rate Arrangement
Starting in July 1, 2010, Mauritius intervened occasionally in the foreign exchange market to
smooth excess volatility and the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified from free
floating to floating. Mauritius has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Section 2, 3, and 4. It
maintains an exchange system free of multiple currency practices and of restrictions on the
making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. Mauritius also maintains
a liberal capital account. On March 8, 2013, US$1 was equivalent to MUR 30.65.
Article IV Consultation
Mauritius is on the standard 12-month cycle. The last Article IV consultation staff report (Country
Report No. 12/62, March, 2012) was completed by the Executive Board on March 14, 2012. A
Financial System Stability Assessment update was completed by a joint IMF–World Bank team on

THE JMAP BANK-FUND MATRIX (2013)
(As of February 7, 2013)
The IMF and World Bank Mauritius teams met on January 21 to discuss a Joint Managerial Action
Plan (JMAP). The team from the World Bank comprised of Mr. Muñoz (Country Representative),
Mr. D’Hoore (lead Economist), Mrs. Mobasher (Research Analyst) and from the IMF of Messrs.
Petri, David, Gitton and Xiong (all AFR).
The IMF’s work program entails continued engagement through the Article IV consultation
process as well as technical assistance in: public financial management provided through
AFRITAC South (AFS); financial sector stability, monetary policy frameworks, and central bank
legislation through the Monetary and Capital Markets Department (MCM) and Legal (LEG)
Departments, and enhancements to macroeconomic statistics with the support of the Statistics
Department (STA).
The World Bank Group’s work program entails continuing work on infrastructure,
competitiveness, public sector reform and social sectors. The World Bank Country Partnership
Strategy for Mauritius up to 2015 aims at helping the Government to deal with (i) short-term
trade shocks and (ii) the transition to a more competitive and diversified economy, while
minimizing negative social impacts along the transition. On-going and planned Bank assistance
to Mauritius is:


Infrastructure. The Mauritius Infrastructure Project signed in December 2009 seeks to
support the government investment program in transport, water and electricity. The
Road Asset Management and Safety Project investment lending under preparation will
seek to reduce transport costs and improve maintenance on the primary and secondary
road network in two pilot regions over a 7 year period, whilst strengthening the
management of road safety in Mauritius. This is expected to be realized by the following
components: (a) the piloting of output and performance based road contracts for a seven
year period in two pilot regions of Mauritius; (b) the improvement of the management of
road safety; (c) the strengthening of the institutional framework for transport;
(d) institutional assistance and implementation support.



Preparation of a Grid Code, Feed-in-Tariffs & Model Energy Supply Purchase
Agreements for Renewable Energy Systems Greater than 50kW through a SIDS DOCK
Grant will seek to promote investment in renewable energy infrastructure, contribute to
energy security, reduce GHG emissions, and encourage household-private sector
investment in renewable energy technologies.



Policy Reforms. The Bank is expected to approve in March and April 2013 the Second
Public Sector Performance Development Policy Loan of US$20 million and the Second
Private Sector Competitiveness Development Policy Loan of US$15 million respectively.
The Public Sector Performance DPL aims to support improvement in the performance of

6

MAURITIUS

the public sector in Mauritius by assisting the government to implement reforms within
the following three pillars: (i) strengthening services that support and empower the most
vulnerable; (ii) streamlining trade regulation and processes; and (iii) improving human
resource management in the civil service and monitoring of SOE performance. The
Private Sector Competitiveness DPL aims to support competitiveness and enterprise
development in three areas: (i) improving competitiveness and growth of enterprises;
(ii) improving access to finance; and (iii) promoting ICT and e-Gov for enhancing
competitiveness and transparency.


Analytical support. The Bank is preparing a Public Expenditure Review report in FY13 to
increase efficiency and effectiveness in the public sector through a detailed review of the
education and health sectors. The Improving Competitiveness technical assistance will
aim to improve competitiveness and economic diversification.



Strengthening Public Sector Performance. The Strengthening Governance and AntiCorruption in Mauritius technical assistance will aim at strengthening governance and
anti-corruption in Mauritius through support to performance management, M&E and
institutional strengthening across the public sector, with a focus on strengthening M&E
at the MoFED.



International Finance Corporation (IFC). The IFC has focused its intervention in
Mauritius along three axes: (i) supporting the banking sector with access to long term
funding to offset local banks’ difficulty in accessing long term foreign exchange to
support trade finance, cross-border south–south initiatives and long term investments in
key infrastructure; (2) investing in regional private equity funds to increase regional
integration with investments mainly along the Madagascar-Mauritius axis; and,
(3) supporting IFC clients to improve internal capacity by providing specialist training to
bank’s SME loan officers and SME-Owner managers to improve financial and managerial
literacy.

RELATIONS WITH THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT
BANK GROUP
(As of February 7, 2013)
The African Development Bank (AfDB)’s 2009–2013 Country Strategy Paper (CSP) for Mauritius
provides the framework for its partnership with the country. The CSP has two pillars (i) reducing
bottlenecks to competitiveness and trade and (ii) Enhancing public sector efficiency and social
service delivery. The Bank’s assistance to Mauritius combines lending and non-lending activities.
Within the first pillar, the lending program currently focuses on infrastructure development
particularly transport, ports and energy. The lending program within the second pillar focuses on
an operation supporting water and sanitation services. The largest on-going lending operation is
a policy-based lending in form of direct budget support that supports both pillar I and II. About
US$200 million has been disbursed. The Bank is currently reviewing the Government’s request to
extend the operation for another two years to allow disbursement of the outstanding balance to
finance its infrastructure program. The Bank is also providing MIC grants to support policy
reforms, capacity building and studies in specific areas within the framework of the two strategic
pillars. These include support to public debt management, public sector investment program,
preparation of the sewerage master plan, review of outline planning, statistical capacity building
and preparation of sector strategies for health, gender and ICT to improve the Performance
based budgeting (PBB). In line with its Regional Integration Strategy for Southern African, the
Bank is supporting the country’s vision of becoming a regional center of excellence. In this area
the Bank has collaborated with the IOC in partnership with the EU, COMESA and SADC to
support the Regional Multi-Disciplinary Centre of Excellence. The Bank also partnered with the
Commonwealth Secretariat in supporting Capacity Building for Public Debt Management. Other
past collaboration with the World Bank (and other partners) has included the following sectors:
water, sewerage, and sanitation (the Plaines Wilhems Sewerage Project) and transport
(Southeastern Highway). The Bank also collaborates very closely with other development partners
including the World Bank, EU, AFD and UNDP in supporting structural reforms through its policy
based lending. The CSP Mid Term Review Report of 2011 envisages continued collaboration on
the policy based lending, MIC Grants and studies. The Bank will in 2013 prepare a new CSP for
Mauritius for period 2014–2018.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation
with Mauritius
On April 3, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Mauritius, and considered and endorsed the
staff appraisal without a meeting.1
Background
The Mauritian economy performed reasonably well in a difficult external environment in
2012. Growth decelerated to 3.3 percent, due to weak sugar and textile exports and a
slowdown in the construction sector, though the information and communication
technology and financial services sectors saw strong growth. The output gap is estimated
to have been small (around ½ percent) and consumer price inflation moderated to
3.9 percent. Estimates of the unemployment rate suggest a marginal increase from
7.9 percent in 2011 to 8 percent in 2012. Credit growth to the private sector was robust.
On the external front, the current account deficit narrowed, but remains relatively high at
10 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2012. The Bank of Mauritius (BOM)
managed to accumulate additional international reserves and the reserve cover of
imports of goods and services rose to 4.4 months from 4.3 months at end-2011. In June
2012, Moody’s upgraded the country’s credit rating to Baa1.
The fiscal policy stance was broadly neutral and less expansionary than previously
projected. The structural primary deficit was broadly unchanged relative to 2011. The
overall deficit including extra-budgetary funds is estimated at 2.3 percent of GDP, a
reduction of over 1 percentage point of GDP relative to previous projections and similar
to the 2011 outcome. The positive fiscal outturn was partly due to a reduction in transfers
and subsidies, which decreased by over 1 percent of GDP compared to 2011 (particularly
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

transfers to state-owned enterprises). Expenditures on goods and services were lower,
but extra-budgetary spending increased relative to 2011. On the revenue side, better
than expected tax revenue performance (in particular for value added tax receipts) was
offset by lower levels of non-tax revenue and grants so that total revenues remained
stable as a percentage of GDP.
Monetary policy was supportive of the overall policy mix. In March 2012, the BOM
reduced the policy rate by 50 basis points to 4.9 percent given the deceleration in global
growth and prudent fiscal policies. The BOM maintained the policy rate at that level in
light of continued uncertainty in the global outlook. Excess liquidity in the banking system
remained elevated, and the yield on 3-month treasury bills fell by 120 basis points to
2.7 percent at end-2012. After June 2012, the authorities started intervening more
actively in foreign exchange markets to build international reserves and moderate
excessive fluctuations of the rupee exchange rate.
The banking system is well-capitalized. Regulatory Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets
are well above Basel II and the proposed Basel III requirements. Non-performing loans
(NPL) increased slightly in 2012, but banks remained profitable with a 20 percent return
on equity, despite low leverage ratios. However, liquidity-to-assets ratios have worsened
in recent years and are on the low side in international comparisons. As a first step
towards gradual phase-in of the Basel III requirements, the BOM circulated a consultation
paper to banks in October 2012. BOM continued to publish its bi-annual CAMEL (capital
adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings & liquidity) ratings for all domestic
banks.
Over the past decade wide-ranging structural reforms supported by prudent
macroeconomic policies have established Mauritius as a top regional performer.
Mauritius statistical capacity continues to be strengthened; the country subscribed to the
IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) in February 2012, being the second
Sub-Saharan African country to do so. The authorities aim at subscribing to SDDS Plus
in the future.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2013 Article IV consultation with Mauritius, Executive Directors
endorsed the staff’s appraisal, as follows:
The authorities have a good track record of prudent macroeconomic management and
implementing structural reforms even though challenges remain. Macroeconomic
management has delivered low inflation, declining debt-to-GDP ratios, and, given the
difficult external environment, satisfactory growth. This outcome has been helped by
consistent efforts to improve public financial management, the business climate, social
assistance, and the sustainability of public finances. Recent efforts to improve the human
and capital infrastructure (especially road congestion) should continue.
Going forward, staff recommended a neutral fiscal policy stance for 2013 in order to
smooth medium-term fiscal consolidation and to facilitate external adjustment. A neutral
stance is also likely to facilitate the rebuilding of policy buffers. Over the medium term

3
staff suggested that fiscal consolidation should focus on reductions in transfers and
subsidies and revenue raising measures. Increases in the revenue-to-GDP ratio would
provide additional space for priority spending for building human and physical capital.
The current accommodative monetary policy stance remains appropriate, but the
authorities should stand ready to tighten monetary conditions if inflation accelerates
beyond current expectations. Inflationary pressures relate to wage increases and
adjustments in administered prices, but expectations appear to be well-anchored. Excess
liquidity should be reduced to better align the policy rate with market rates and help
strengthen the monetary transmission mechanism. The Mauritian banking system is wellcapitalized and profitable. Stress testing indicates the sector to be resilient against a
range of shocks. Real estate developments should be monitored and cooperation
between the BOM and the Financial Services Commission further improved.
Increasing national savings and fostering competitiveness would reduce the large
external current account deficit. Medium-term fiscal consolidation should facilitate
external adjustment. Efforts to improve competitiveness through structural reforms and
investment in infrastructure and human capital are also crucial. The floating exchange
rate regime continues to serve the country well, in particular by allowing the exchange
rate to act as a shock absorber. Staff estimates that the real exchange rate is broadly in
line with fundamentals.
The pension system could be used as a lever to increase national savings. Recent
reforms have put the system on a much better footing, but further reforms would be
helpful. An increase in mandatory contribution rates for the National Pension Fund (NPF)
combined with an actuarially-sustainable increase in benefits is likely to lead to higher
overall national savings. The inclusion of most public pensions systems within a
strengthened NPF and mandatory inclusion of self-employed workers in the NPF might
also be considered.
Labor market reform should primarily target the employability of the low-skilled youth and
women, who comprise the majority of the unemployed. Measures to better align the
education curriculum to the needs of industry and increase private sector involvement in
vocational education could also contribute to reduce skills mismatches, particularly for
the young. Wage setting mechanisms should be reviewed with the objective of aligning
real wage increases closer with labor productivity improvements. In addition, an earned
income tax credit could be introduced to encourage low-wage earners to take jobs on
which they can acquire skills.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
