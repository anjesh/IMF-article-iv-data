Staff Report for the 2012 Article IV Consultation and Request for Stand-By
Arrangement
Prepared by the European Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Aasim Husain and Masato Miyazaki
September 12, 2012


Key Issues and Policy Framework. Bosnia and Herzegovina’s (BiH) challenge is to cope with
the adverse economic environment and prepare the ground for achieving sustainable export-led
economic growth, raising living standards, and making progress toward EU accession. In addition
to fiscal consolidation, this will require reforms to improve the composition of public expenditure
and unlock the economy’s potential. Financial sector policies should aim at further enhancing the
authorities’ crisis preparedness and contingency planning. These policies would also provide a
solid basis for the stability of the currency board and enhanced national policy coordination.



Stand-By Arrangement (SBA). The authorities request a 24-month SDR338.2 million
(200 percent of quota) SBA. Approval of the program will help release €100 million in budget
support from the EU and could also facilitate budget support from the World Bank. The currency
board arrangement will remain the cornerstone of national macroeconomic policy and will be
supported by fiscal consolidation and structural reforms, steps to improve fiscal policy
coordination, and policies to enhance financial sector stability and crisis preparedness.



Response to Past Advice. Fund past advice—also in the context of the 2009 SBA—noted the
rising external imbalances and pointed out that expansionary fiscal and wage policies could
threaten competitiveness and increase risks to stability. In recent years, the authorities have made
progress in maintaining fiscal discipline and safeguarding financial sector stability, but progress
on structural reforms has been slow. The proposed program incorporates policies consistent with
the objectives of maintaining macro stability and developing conditions for sustainable growth.



Discussions. A staff team comprising Messrs. Christou (head), Zhan, Llaudes, Meyer Cirkel (all
EUR), Kapsoli (FAD), and Ms. Shirono (SPR) visited Sarajevo and Banja Luka during
May 16–29 and July 11–20. The team met with: (i) at the State level: Chair of the Council of
Ministers Bevanda, Minister of Finance and Treasury Špirić, and Central Bank Governor Kozarić;
(ii) in the Federation of BiH: Prime Minister Nikšić and Finance Minister Krajina; and (iii) in
Republika Srpska: Prime Minister Džombić and Finance Minister Tegeltija. Staff also met with
other senior officials, ambassadors, and private sector representatives. Mr. Cuc (resident
representative) and local staff assisted the missions. Messrs. Snel and Friedman (OED) attended
policy meetings.

I. INTRODUCTION
A. Context
1.
Bosnia and Herzegovina’s (BiH) past economic growth relied increasingly on
domestic demand as the key driver. Private sector demand expansion was fuelled by a
credit boom financed from abroad. This produced strong output growth amid a benign
external environment and ample bank financing. However, the associated vulnerabilities
became clear in the 2009 crisis when capital inflows came to a stop. Against this backdrop,
the currency board arrangement, fiscal tightening, and financial support under the 2009 SBA
helped safeguard macroeconomic stability (Box 1). But this has not been enough to propel
the economy forward—staff projects that real GDP will not regain its 2008 level until 2013.
Structural impediments continue to hamper economic performance—the large government
crowds out the private sector and the business environment discourages investment and
business expansion, leading to high unemployment and low labor force participation.
2.
The protracted political crisis slowed reforms and progress toward EU
accession. The long delay in the formation of a new State-level government and the
breakdown in national policy coordination following the October 2010 elections—evidenced
by the difficulty in reaching an agreement on the budget for the Institutions of BiH and the
temporary interruption in the servicing of BiH’s public debt to some IFIs in early-2012—
stalled economic reforms and progress toward EU accession. It also prevented completion of
SBA reviews since October 2010; the SBA expired in July 2012, with only ⅓ of the
approved amount disbursed. The new Council of Ministers that was confirmed in February
2012 has vowed to move expeditiously on EU issues. Cognizant of the risks emanating from
the present uncertain global and regional economic environment, the authorities have put
together a comprehensive program for which they are requesting Fund support.
B. Recent Economic Developments
3.
The slow post-2009 economic recovery is losing momentum. Following the 2009
recession, BiH’s economy grew at a moderate pace in 2010–11. However, the pickup in

high world oil and food prices, and increases in utility prices and tobacco excises. Core
inflation has remained below 1 percent, reflecting the softness of domestic demand.
4.
The current account deficit has started to narrow and official foreign exchange
reserves have been volatile in recent months. The surge in imports during 2010–11
outpaced the recovery in exports, thus leading to a widening in the current account deficit to
8¾ percent of GDP in 2011. However,

in exposure to banks was somewhat
more pronounced), with most of the decline (10 percentage points) experienced by end-2010.
Reserves came under renewed pressure earlier this year, mainly due to some banks’ and
corporates’ repatriation of profits, and banks’ reduced demand for foreign funding. Positive
momentum since the re-engagement with the Fund in program discussions contributed to a
pickup in reserves in recent weeks.
5.
The banking system has remained
relatively stable. The sector as a whole
returned to profitability and maintained its
capital adequacy through capital injections
and profit retention (Table 11). Aggregate
capital adequacy has remained above the
minimum requirement, and top-down stress
tests conducted by the authorities using endMarch 2012 bank-by-bank regulatory data
did not reveal significant weaknesses.
However, nonperforming loans (NPLs) have
remained at low double digits—12.6 percent

for the banking sector as a whole as of June 2012. Finally, provisioning at 67 percent of nonperforming assets at end-June 2012 is in line with the regional average.1
6.
Fiscal consolidation has continued but the composition of expenditure has not
improved. The overall fiscal deficit in 2010–11 stayed within the targets of the 2009 SBA.
In 2011, consolidation was dictated by the lack of foreign financing for the Entities and by
the temporary financing rules—that limit spending in the absence of an adopted budget—for

benefits and the average public wage
grew slower than inflation in 2008–11, which is a significant departure from past trends.
Overruns on wages and war-related benefits were partially offset by cuts in other current
spending and under execution of the capital budget.
7.
Structural reforms have stalled since the run-up to the October 2010 elections.
The reform of war-related benefits is well behind the schedule envisioned under the World
Bank’s Development Policy Loan (DPL) in both Entities. The finances of the Entity Health
Funds continue to be under pressure due to the high cost of health care for the growing
number of unemployed and pensioners. Delays in pension reform in the Federation, coupled
with the growing number of veterans qualifying for pensions under special conditions, have
increased the cost of subsidies for veteran pensions. Finally, little progress has been made on
improving the business environment and BiH continues to rank low among its regional peers
in both the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business and the World Economic Forum’s Global
Competitiveness rankings.

1

The sharp increase in provisioning at end-2011 is due to the implementation of IFRS standards encompassing
inclusion of category E loans that are fully provisioned and were previously kept off balance sheet.

2

The expenditure envelope of the Institutions of BiH in 2011 was constrained by its share of indirect tax
revenues that was fixed at the 2010 level. Thus, spending was reduced by 7 percent allowing for financing of its
ongoing operations (e.g., wages, some goods and services) but little else (e.g., capital spending was slashed).

3

A big part of the hike in the wage bill was due to the increase in the income tax and contributions rates in
Republika Srpska (RS) which guarantees take-home pay; thus resulting in an increase in gross public wages.

4

War-related benefits constitute a largely untargeted, entitlement-based system of non-insurance cash benefits
that are linked to the 1992-95 war.

7
II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS AND PROGRAM FOR 2012–14
8.
Discussions focused on policies to ensure macroeconomic stability and put BiH
on a sustainable growth path. There was agreement that as BiH navigates its way through
the current difficult economic environment it would need to set the stage for export-led
economic growth, improvements in living standards, and progress toward EU accession. This
would only be possible in a stable macro environment conducive to vigorous private sector
activity.
9.
The authorities’ program aims at countering the effects of the worsening
external environment and addressing domestic structural weaknesses. It is based on a
four-pronged approach: (i) improve national policy coordination; (ii) maintain fiscal
discipline, and advance public sector reforms to reduce the size of the government and
improve the composition of expenditure; (iii) safeguard financial sector stability in the
context of the currency board; and (iv) intensify reforms to improve the business and
investment environment to support growth, investment and job creation.
10.
Fund support for this policy agenda would help anchor policies and bolster their
credibility. Specifically, the authorities’ program seeks to: (i) reduce the structural fiscal
deficit to about ¾ percent of GDP in 2013; (ii) put in place an effective framework for fiscal
policy coordination and implement the fiscal reform agenda; and (iii) strengthen the banking
resolution frameworks and the authorities’ crisis preparedness. In support of their economic
program, the authorities are requesting Fund financial assistance in the context of a 24-month
SBA (Section III and Attachment I); Fund resources would be used to address the BOP need
by providing budget support and also allow for a smoother adjustment path. Finally, the
program would offer a catalytic role by unlocking EU and World Bank assistance, and
improving business and investor confidence—Moody’s latest report reaffirming “stable
outlook” was predicated on expectations of an IMF-supported program.
A. Outlook and Risks
11.
Economic growth is expected to start recovering in 2013. Given BiH’s strong links
to the euro area and neighboring countries, stagnation of economic activity and rising
financial stress in those countries are expected to continue to take a toll on BiH’s growth
prospects. Domestic demand is projected to remain subdued, held back by high
unemployment and fiscal restraint. The authorities’ policy framework is thus predicated on
flat real GDP in 2012 followed by modest growth of 1 percent in 2013. Underlying inflation
is projected to remain low. The relatively high stock of NPLs—and the need to resolve
them—will restrain the supply of bank credit.
12.
The adjustment of the balance of payments toward a more sustainable path is
expected to continue. Helped by a faster deceleration of import growth relative to export
growth and a moderation of international energy and food prices, the current account balance
is projected to improve by 1½ percentage points of GDP during 2012–13. Capital inflows are

8
expected to stabilize after the sharp drop of recent years, reflecting a gradual recovery in FDI
and broadly stable foreign bank exposure to BiH.
13.
BiH’s medium-term prospects depend critically on the implementation of
structural reforms to increase the country’s growth potential. Reforms aimed at
enhancing the business environment and better utilizing the country’s human capital would
strengthen the investment outlook, boost productivity, and help raise annual economic
growth to 4 percent—slightly below its pre-crisis average (Table 1).5 Fiscal restraint and
government access to external financing will limit governments’ bank financing needs.
Private sector credit should thus pick up gradually and along with improved consumer
confidence would help boost domestic demand. Inflation is expected to remain low in line
with inflation in the euro area. With the current account deficit gradually approaching
5 percent of GDP over the medium term, official foreign reserves would stabilize at about
4 months of imports of goods and services. The authorities broadly agreed with the analysis
and pointed out the need for ambitious structural reforms to help attract FDI which, along
with the faster implementation of externally-financed infrastructure projects, could raise
growth further.
14.
The risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. As highlighted in the Risk
Assessment Matrix (Annex I) and in Annex II, a strong intensification of the euro area crisis
would significantly affect BiH’s growth outlook mainly through its impact on exports,
remittances, and capital inflows. Foreign bank subsidiaries rely on continued funding from
their parents and are not immune to a loss of confidence triggered by events in home
countries. However, an abrupt withdrawal of parent bank support is not envisaged.6
Moreover, the fractured political scene, setbacks in progress toward EU integration, and
weak policy coordination—especially in light of the October 2012 local elections—could
delay the implementation of policies envisaged under the program. Such developments could
adversely affect the availability of IFI financing and BiH’s sovereign rating. A further
deterioration of credit quality could impede the fragile recovery in bank lending, and thereby
restrain the real economy. Export and output growth prospects could also be hampered by a
failure to harmonize export quality standards ahead of Croatia’s EU accession.7

5

The projection of BiH’s potential output growth rate is based on growth-accounting and H-P filter analysis
(SM/10/254) and is in line with the 4 percent annual average growth during 1999–2011.

6

In this respect, main parent banks fared well in last year’s EBA stress tests. Moreover, local subsidiaries and
supervisory authorities expressed confidence on continued parent bank support.

7

With Croatia’s expected EU membership in mid-2013, preparatory steps to harmonize quality standards for
agricultural, construction and other goods exports are required to avoid an interruption in exports to Croatia
(which account for about 15 percent of BiH’s exports).

9
15.
On the upside, a faster recovery in BiH’s trading partners may boost external
demand and private capital inflows. This, along with accelerated implementation of
foreign-financed projects, could support a faster upturn. Finally, the approval of the program
could boost market sentiment and economic activity.
B. National Policy Coordination
16.
An important element of the authorities’ program is their commitment to better
policy coordination and cooperation. In May 2012, the Fiscal Council (FC) adopted the
Global Framework of Fiscal Balance and Policies for 2013–15—the first time that a
comprehensive framework was adopted before the stipulated end-May deadline. Staff
welcomed the early adoption of the framework which sets the broad parameters for the
budget of the Institutions of BiH for the next three years—thus helping avoid recurring
disagreements over the appropriate size of budget—and also serves as an important input for
the preparation of the 2013 Entity budgets. The authorities also plan to further strengthen the
FC’s operational framework, with a view to making it the centerpiece for fiscal policy
coordination, by enhancing the role of the FC’s Advisory Group to include coordination of
all issues related to program implementation and monitoring. While supporting these
intentions, staff emphasized that, it would also be important to further enhance the role of the
FC in fiscal policy making by having it take the lead in the design of medium-term fiscal
policy and targets.
17.
The commitment to better cooperation will be supplemented by steps to preserve
the national system of indirect taxation (ITA) and ensure the uninterrupted servicing of
foreign debt obligations. Consequently, the authorities resolved the disputes over the
accuracy of final consumption data that govern the allocation of indirect tax revenue between
the Entities by adopting a decision on the settlement of disputed amounts through end-2011
(prior action). They also underscored their commitment to maintain the current single
account of the ITA and to reset the allocation coefficient between the Entities on a quarterly
basis to reduce the amount required for ex-post adjustments (LOI ¶9). Finally, an amendment
to the Law of Financing of the Institutions of BiH has been submitted to Parliament to allow
for continued servicing of foreign debt in the absence of an adopted budget (structural
benchmark).8
18.
Information sharing is crucial for closer coordination and cooperation. At
present, there is only limited information sharing among the three statistical agencies and the
three tax agencies, which inhibits economic analysis, and tax collection and enforcement
efforts. In this regard, staff welcomed the authorities’ intention to strengthen information

dispute over the legality of the temporary financing decision for the Institutions of BiH in the absence of an
adopted budget.

10
sharing among statistical agencies and tax agencies. As a first step, various memoranda of
understanding detailing the scope and modalities of information sharing among the agencies
will be signed in the coming months (LOI ¶12).
C. Ensuring Fiscal Sustainability
19.
Continued fiscal adjustment efforts supplemented by fiscal reform will be
needed to ensure fiscal sustainability. Following the fiscal consolidation efforts under the
2009 SBA, the structural fiscal deficit has already been reduced significantly. However,
restoring fiscal sustainability requires reversing the rising trajectory of the public debt in
recent years. Public debt is currently around 40 percent of GDP, a level which renders BiH,
an emerging economy with a fixed exchange rate and no access to international capital
markets, potentially vulnerable to shocks. There was thus agreement on the need to bring the
debt-to-GDP ratio on a firm downward path toward the pre-crisis level of 30 percent of
GDP—in line with the authorities’ medium-term fiscal framework—which would ensure
fiscal sustainability (Figure 9 and Table 13). The authorities also recognized the need to limit
domestic government financing to avoid crowding out, especially under the current tight
financing conditions. Discussions thus focused on the speed of the required adjustment
balancing short-term considerations—the economy’s weak cyclical position—with the need
for lasting structural reforms to reduce the size of the government and improve the
composition of expenditure.
20.
Against this backdrop, the proposed program envisages a gradual fiscal
adjustment. Under unchanged policies, the 2012 general government deficit would widen to
3½ percent of GDP in 2012 from about 3 percent in 2011, with the cyclically-adjusted deficit
remaining broadly unchanged, leaving a financing gap of about 2 percent of GDP.9 The
authorities committed to take measures to contain the deficit to 3 percent of GDP in 2012 and
further reduce it to 2⅓ percent in 2013, supported by expenditure reforms that would help
make the 2012 expenditure cuts permanent. There was agreement that the proposed fiscal
path—which implies an improvement of 1¾ percentage points of GDP in the cyclicallyadjusted deficit in 2012–13—strikes the right balance between BiH’s current cyclical
position and the necessity to reduce re-current spending (Table 4).

9

The definitions of the fiscal balance refer to net lending/borrowing (in line with the GFSM2001 which the
authorities adopted in 2012). Thus, the structural fiscal balance refers to the cyclically-adjusted net
lending/borrowing.

Achieving the program’s fiscal targets will require efforts by all governments to
rationalize public expenditure and improve the composition of spending. For this year,
the authorities will generate savings of some ½ percent of GDP. Specifically (LOI ¶16):

All the measures by the Entities were included in rebalanced budgets that have been
approved by entity parliaments (prior action).

12
22.
The authorities recognize that credible fiscal consolidation calls for progress on
structural fiscal reforms. As a first step, they appropriately plan to replace short-term
expenditure measures with reforms of the various components of expenditure, and to
maintain space for capital spending and targeted social protection (LOI ¶18). Specifically,
over the program period:


Federation and RS: Both Entities are committed to explore ways to better target
social benefits, including through the stepping up of eligibility audits. Staff urged
them to restart this agenda as it would also help unlock further budget support from
the World Bank. Moreover, both Entities recognize the urgency of improving the
financial situation of the Health Funds and will embark on a comprehensive reform.



Federation: The Federation will adopt a new law to govern various retirement
schemes under favorable conditions to be followed by a strategy for a comprehensive
pension reform.



RS: The RS will undertake a comprehensive review of the public employee
compensation system as part of the reform of public administration, and will freeze
the wage bill for 2013–14 at the 2012 level. It will also amend relevant legislation to
ensure that changes in income tax rates or social contribution rates do not
automatically lead to changes in the gross pay of public sector employees.

23.
Staff urged the authorities to keep up the reform momentum beyond the
program period and come up with a medium-term fiscal reform strategy. There was
agreement on the need to improve government revenue collection by strengthening tax
administration and tax compliance. A broader tax base would pave the way for reducing the
overall tax burden (by focusing mainly on a reduction in social contributions). On the
expenditure side, the overall envelope

13
D. Mitigating Financial Sector Risks
24.
Financial sector policies will aim at enhancing financial stability. A main
challenge facing the banking system is to make progress with the clean-up of bank lending
portfolios, while maintaining adequate capital buffers. In this context, staff urged vigilance in
monitoring any further deterioration in loan portfolios. In connection with Hypo Alpe
Adria’s restructuring operation,10 the authorities appropriately put in place enhanced
supervisory procedures, including operational limits and higher-frequency reporting. This
should help ensure stability as Hypo’s parent bank proceeds with preparations for the sale of
its operations in South-Eastern Europe.
25.
The authorities have improved their crisis preparedness and risk assessment
tools. Staff welcomed efforts by the central bank, with input from the banking agencies, to
conduct regular top down stress tests. These tests are in line with current regulatory
requirements and suit BiH’s reporting and provisioning standards well. The authorities
committed to further improve the coordination and communication among the agencies in
conducting stress tests as recommended by a recent MCM TA mission, and to strengthen the
role of the Standing Committee for Financial Stability (LOI ¶24 and 25) with a view to
establishing a comprehensive and inclusive framework for early warning and crisis
preparedness.
26.
Staff and the authorities agreed on the need to ensure that legal and institutional
frameworks encourage NPL resolution. High NPL ratios are a key vulnerability of the
financial system, limiting banks’ ability to provide credit and thus becoming a drag on
growth. Although BiH fares somewhat better than its peers in the region regarding the size of
NPLs, the process of NPL resolution in BiH has been hindered by legal, tax, and institutional
shortcomings: transferring of claims is loosely regulated, administrative and court
proceedings can be burdensome and lengthy, and the tax treatment of loan sales and loss
recognition is not properly defined. Staff encouraged the authorities to pursue a
comprehensive review of the legal and institutional frameworks—noting the possibility for
Fund TA as suggested by the MCM TA mission—with a view to encouraging NPL
resolution. In this context, the Entities plan to adopt laws on factoring and agencies for the
repurchase of claims (LOI ¶23) in order to better regulate the transferring of banks’ assets.
27.
Steps are being taken to strengthen bank supervision and the resolution
frameworks. The authorities noted that they have already strengthened their cooperation
with foreign home supervisors and are in the process of amending the legal frameworks
related to the treatment of confidential information to align them with EU requirements
(structural benchmarks)—this would pave the way for the signing of formal memoranda of
10

loan portfolio in its balance sheet.

14
understanding with the Austrian and Italian supervisors. Staff reiterated its earlier
recommendation to unify the two Entity banking agencies, but the authorities indicated that
this would need a political resolution—which was not realistic in the current circumstances.
To further strengthen the bank resolution frameworks, the provisional administration period
will be shortened to one year, with possible one-time extension of six months (structural
benchmark). Finally, the law governing the Deposit Insurance Agency (DIA) is being revised
in line with MCM recommendations to strengthen the role of deposit insurance in
safeguarding financial stability and contributing to crisis resolution (structural benchmark;
LOI ¶28).
28.
Maintenance of public confidence in the banking system is of paramount
importance to financial stability. The authorities recognize that the institutional
independence of the central bank and the banking agencies needs to be fully respected. To
this end, they are committed to adhering to the currency board arrangement as constituted
under the law. Moreover, the Federation authorities repealed two amendments to the
Federation Banking Agency Law (prior action), which were adopted earlier this year, that
could allow the government to initiate dismissal of the members of the Governing Board and
the Director and Deputy Director if the Agency’s annual report is not adopted by Parliament.
Such provisions deviate from international best practice and directly threaten the
independence of the banking agency.
E. Safeguarding External Stability
29.
Under current assumptions, official foreign exchange reserves are expected to
remain adequate to guarantee the stability of the currency board arrangement (CBA).
The CBA is the strongest institution in BiH: it has been immune to political interference and
remains a key macroeconomic

reserves would be at more than
three times the domestic currency outside banks; and cover 200 percent of short-term debt at
remaining maturity. The new metric for reserve adequacy developed recently by the IMF also
suggests the level of BiH’s reserves is adequate (118 percent of the new metric in 2011).
Staff and the authorities discussed the role of the central bank in providing liquidity support,

15
and agreed on the need to maintain the strictness of the CBA and instead to adjust banks’
reserve requirements to ease temporary tensions if needed. In this vein, the authorities
underscored their commitment to safeguard the CBA through continued political
commitment, and prudent macroeconomic and financial sector policies.
30.
External competitiveness appears adequate. In the wake of the global recession the
current account balance has moved closer to its sustainable path. Moreover, developments in
the ULC-based real effective exchange rate (REER) point to gains in competitiveness over
the past three years. Preliminary analysis suggests that the REER does not currently raise
significant external stability concerns. Specifically, CGER-type methodologies suggest that
the REER is broadly in line with fundamentals (Box 2). The authorities shared this
assessment and yet recognized the need to enhance external competitiveness through
continued fiscal consolidation and wage restraint, and structural reforms to improve the
business environment—as stipulated in their program.
31.
There was agreement that although external debt is sustainable, it is vulnerable
to a number of shocks (Figure 8 and Table 12). The external debt-to-GDP ratio, currently
around 50 percent of GDP, is projected to peak at below 54 percent in 2014 before starting to
decline over the medium term. Bound tests suggest that BiH’s external position would be
vulnerable to a number of shocks, especially real depreciation and noninterest current
account deterioration.
32.
Discussions also focused on the main spillover channels of external shocks.
Staff’s analysis suggests that trade, remittances, and bank-intermediated capital flows are the
main transmission channels (Annex II). So far, exports to Germany have offset the
downward trend caused by slowing exports to Croatia, Serbia, Italy, and Slovenia, but if the
ongoing trade slump intensifies, BiH growth could suffer. Economic activity could also be
constrained if lower growth and employment in Germany, Austria, and Croatia—the main
sources of worker remittances which currently stand at 12 percent of GDP—dampen
remittances to BiH. Finally, with the financial sector being dominated by subsidiaries of
foreign banks—with parents mainly in Austria and Italy—BiH is vulnerable to potential
parent bank deleveraging, which could translate into lower rollover rates and reduce the
likelihood of parent support in a stress scenario.
33.
There was agreement that a coordinated policy response would be needed to deal
with adverse external shocks that could spill over to BiH. The authorities confirmed their
readiness to swiftly and jointly act in the event of a strong intensification of the euro area
crisis. They concurred with staff that a well-coordinated and credible response would serve
best to confront these challenges. They agreed on the need to sustain the expenditure-based
fiscal adjustment in train by maintaining the targeted expenditure envelope supported by
fiscal reforms, while allowing automatic stabilizers to work. Some additional official
resources may be needed to avoid excessive reliance on costly domestic (bank) financing that
may further crowd out private sector credit. Should liquidity strains in the financial sector

16
emerge, the CBBH could lower banks’ reserve requirements, and to maintain depositor
confidence in the banking sector, the DIA could activate the credit line with the EBRD
established for this purpose. In this context, the authorities underscored the need to enhance
bank monitoring and stand ready to activate bank resolution powers, if necessary. Finally,
close engagement with foreign supervisors and parent banks was deemed essential.
34.
The authorities re-iterated their intention to accept the obligations under
Article VIII Sections 2(a), 3, and 4. BiH continues to avail itself of the transitional
arrangements under Article XIV, but it no longer maintains restrictions under Article XIV.
BiH maintains restrictions on the transferability of balances and interest accrued on frozen
foreign-currency deposits, subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII. Staff urged the
authorities to remove such restrictions and to follow the advice of the upcoming MCM/LEG
mission regarding BiH’s intentions to accept the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3,
and 4.
F. Structural Reforms to Unlock the Economy’s Potential
35.
Delivering stronger growth will require improving the business environment and
attracting foreign direct investment. BiH substantially lags regional peers in ease of doing
business indicators, and impediments to better business environment have been amply
documented in various surveys (Figure 6). The authorities noted some progress in
streamlining procedures and making business regulations more transparent; e.g., the
Federation has adopted a large part of IFC recommendations for streamlining laws and
regulations. Nevertheless, they acknowledged that more needs to be done to address
shortcomings and create a favorable environment for domestic and foreign investment. In
this regard, the RS is taking steps to set up a one-stop-shop registration system for new
businesses and the Federation will follow up with the steps already taken and aim at further
reducing the administrative burden on business (LOI ¶29). Finally, the authorities pointed out
that the liberalization of the trade regime with the EU, since the entry into force of the
Stabilization and Association Agreement in July 2008 would also help improve the business
and investment environment and pave the way for BiH’s WTO accession.
36.
There was agreement that a sustainable recovery will not be possible without a
vibrant/thriving private sector. Corporate sector performance is hampered by limited
progress in creating a single economic space within the country, loss-making state-owned
enterprises that could represent a drag on the budget, the stalled privatization of strategic
enterprises in the Federation, and inadequate infrastructure. To this end, staff argued that
restructuring underperforming state-owned enterprises, transferring assets of key sectors to
more productive uses through privatization and concessions would encourage private
investment and support long-term growth. That way BiH could attract much needed FDI
even if the overall investment climate in Europe remains unfavorable. The Federation
authorities acknowledged the potential benefits of privatization but remained cautious about
kick-starting privatization in the current unfavorable economic environment.

17
37.
Better utilization of human capital, including through faster job creation,
remains a difficult challenge. BiH has to tackle constraints undermining better functioning
of the labor market, namely: the low labor force participation rate; the large skill gaps; and
the market distortions created by the large informal and public sectors. The authorities
recognized these constraints and noted that their program already includes steps to reform the
system of sizeable non-insurance cash benefits, link them to the recipients’ income and
ability to work, expedite eligibility audits to weed out fraud, tighten eligibility requirements
for early retirement schemes, and reduce the share of public employment through a hiring
freeze and streamlining of government agencies.
G. Improving Data Quality
38.
While data are adequate for surveillance and program monitoring purposes,
further efforts will be needed to address remaining shortcomings. Significant efforts
have been made—with extensive Fund TA—to improve fiscal reporting and the authorities
have introduced a GFSM2001-compliant template for reporting by all government levels.
However, gaps remain in the quality of published data in the Federation due to long delays in
the reporting by lower levels of government, incomplete coverage, and partial
implementation of accrual accounting. The authorities are taking steps to address these
shortcomings (LOI ¶31), including by relying on continued Fund TA. Staff also urged the
authorities to improve real sector statistics, including by advancing their work on quarterly
GDP data, with STA technical assistance. Finally, the authorities plan to appoint a country
coordinator so as to begin preparations for participation in GDDS (LOI ¶30).
III. PROGRAM MODALITIES
A. Access and Phasing
39.
BiH faces moderate balance of payments financing needs during 2012–14. Under
the program’s conservative assumptions on rollover rates, in line with historical episodes and
recent developments in the banking sector, and to maintain a strong reserve cover, projected
gross financing needs of €1,411 million (10½ percent of GDP) in 2012 are expected to lead
to a financing gap of €171 million (1¼ percent of GDP), after the agreed policy measures.
From 2013 onward, adjustment measures as envisaged in the program will help to improve
the government’s overall balance, thus contributing to continued current account adjustment.
Enhanced confidence in economic policies will also help to boost FDI inflows. However,
with the scheduled repurchases of the disbursements under the 2009 SBA surging in
2013–14, gross financing needs in this period are projected to rise substantially. The total
financing gap under the program would amount to €703 million (Table 7a). Approval of the
arrangement will release €100 million in EU budget support during 2012–13. Under the
expectation that the Fund program remains on track and the implementation of social sector
reforms continues, the World Bank could also provide financing under DPL2 and DPL3 of

18
about €160 million during 2013–14. Filling the remainder of the gap will require
€440 million (200 percent of quota) from the Fund during the program period (Table 8).
B. Capacity to Repay the Fund and Risks to the Program
40.
BiH’s capacity to repay the Fund is expected to be good. The country has an
excellent record in serving its Fund obligations. Although BiH recently experienced a
temporary delay in servicing its debt obligations to the EBRD, the EU, and the World Bank,
steps are in train to ensure continued external debt service payments even in the absence of
an adopted budget. Furthermore, the program would lay the foundations for BiH’s return to a
sustainable medium-term growth path, thus providing assurances that BiH will be able to
discharge its Fund obligations in a timely manner. By the end of the proposed SBA, Fund
credit outstanding is projected to be 3 percent of GDP or 13 percent of gross reserves
(Table 10). After peaking at slightly below 54 percent of GDP in 2014, thus highlighting
moderate external debt sustainability risks, external debt is expected to move on a downward
trajectory and public debt to decline steadily to 31 percent of GDP.
41.
Nevertheless, the program is subject to high implementation risks. These risks
pertain to domestic policy implementation and the global economic environment. Despite
strong commitment by all policymakers to the program’s goal to improve cooperation and
restore fiscal sustainability, their resolve will be tested ahead of the October 2012 local
elections and during the preparation of the 2013 budgets. Moreover, while the currency board
enjoys strong political and public support, the needed policy adjustment and structural
reforms could create tensions with powerful interest groups. If adjustment is incomplete,
higher fiscal financing needs could widen the external financing gap, raising concerns about
BiH’s ability to repay the Fund. As for the global environment, a deeper recession and
further heightened stress in the euro area would lower trade flows more sharply than
projected, potentially leading to sharp capital outflows and putting pressure on the currency
board. It is also possible that foreign parent banks may reduce their exposure to BiH more
than programmed. The authorities recognize all these risks and stand ready to adjust their
policies as circumstances change.
42.
The program’s design aims at safeguarding Fund resources by requiring
upfront political commitment to be demonstrated by all governments. Parliamentary
approvals of re-balanced Entity budgets are prior actions for Board consideration of the
program request. The resolution of the long-standing dispute on the indirect tax revenue
allocation between the entities—which has been an obstacle to improving policy
coordination—and the repeal of two amendments to the Federation banking law, which could
jeopardize the independence of the banking agency, are also prior actions. A number of
structural benchmarks are included in the fiscal (to ensure sustained lower fiscal deficits) and
financial areas (to enhance financial stability and improve crisis preparedness). Moreover,
completion of the first review will be conditional on the approval of agreed budgets for 2013.

19
Finally, the proposed phasing of the arrangement is evenly distributed, thus requiring
continued adherence to the program’s objectives.
C. Program Monitoring, Conditionality, and Safeguard Assessment
43.
The SBA will run over 24 months from September 2012 to September 2014. The
size and timing of disbursements should ensure that the program is able to support BiH’s
economic policies in the current challenging external environment. Given the high level of
uncertainty surrounding the projections under the program, the authorities will consult with
staff on evolving risks and agree on policy adjustments needed to achieve the program’s
goals.
44.
Program performance will be monitored through quarterly reviews. The first
review under the program will be based on end-September 2012 targets and the second
review on end-December 2012 targets. Quantitative performance criteria for 2013 will be set
at the time of the first review in line with the approved 2013 budgets. Structural
conditionality is consistent with the program’s focus on the fiscal and financial sector
sustainability, and crisis preparedness. The quantitative performance criteria, indicative
target, structural benchmarks, and prior actions are indicated in Tables 9 and 9a.
45.
Staff has initiated an update safeguards assessment of the CBBH, which needs to
be completed no later than the first review under the SBA. This will update the
assessment completed in 2009. The CBBH meets the key requirements of the safeguards
policy, and latest information received from the authorities indicates that all of the
recommendations from the 2009 assessment have been implemented.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
46.
Bosnia and Herzegovina is trying to create conditions for a sustained recovery
amidst an adverse economic environment. Fiscal consolidation, steps to strengthen the
resilience of the financial sector, and financial support under the 2009 SBA helped safeguard
macroeconomic stability and limit the fallout of the global crisis on BiH. But this has not
been enough to propel the economy forward. At the same time, the protracted domestic
political impasse and headwinds from the euro area crisis have cast clouds on the timing and
strength of the recovery. Absent shocks, real GDP is expected to begin growing only in the
middle of next year, with correspondingly weak private sector employment growth. Although
risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside, with a lower fiscal deficit and an overall sound
banking sector, the BiH economy is in a better position to confront possible shocks than three
years ago.
47.
The authorities’ program—supported by the proposed SBA—represents an
appropriate step in the current uncertain economic environment. The program has four
main objectives. First, it aims at improving national policy coordination, including by
strengthening the role of the Fiscal Council. Second, fiscal consolidation is being

20
accompanied by structural fiscal reforms to safeguard medium-term fiscal sustainability.
Third, further steps to enhance the authorities’ crisis preparedness and contingency planning
will safeguard the currency board—which enjoys broad political support and has served the
country well— and improve the resilience of the financial sector. Finally, the arrangement is
expected to act as a catalyst for other reforms to create an environment conducive for private
sector development.
48.
Attaining the program’s 2012 fiscal targets should maintain the course toward
fiscal sustainability. Staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to expenditure restraint
and the measures to contain the 2012 general government deficit. The envisaged fiscal deficit
of 3 percent of GDP for 2012 strikes an appropriate balance between cyclical considerations
and BiH’s medium-term consolidation needs.
49.
Medium-term fiscal consolidation should continue to focus on reforms in
recurrent spending, while making room for capital expenditure. With expenditure some
50 percent of GDP, the focus of policies should be on reducing current expenditure while
allowing space for capital spending and targeted social protection. To this end, staff
welcomes the authorities’ intention to rein in the wage bill, reform the pension system, and
step up the systemic reforms of rights-based benefits and untargeted transfers. While the
reforms to the system of benefits are likely to be difficult, staff agrees that they have
important long-term benefits.
50.
The authorities’ plans to enhance the resilience of the financial sector through
improvements in crisis preparedness and contingency planning are appropriate. The
banking system has so far withstood the impact of the global economic and financial crisis
but continues to face some stress from high NPLs. The authorities need to remain vigilant
and monitor closely developments in credit quality and spillover risks from regional
developments. Staff welcomes steps to enhance the monitoring of financial stability, and
improve crisis preparedness and management, and urges the authorities to further strengthen
cooperation between the central bank and banking agencies as well as their cooperation with
home supervisors. The envisaged amendments of the legal frameworks regarding the
treatment of confidential information to bring them in line with EU standards are crucial
steps in that direction.
51.
Without improving BiH’s difficult business and investment environment, the
economy cannot deliver sustainable growth. Structural impediments continue to hamper
economic performance and are at the root of BiH’s struggle to achieve more balanced
growth. Consequently, BiH should use the opportunity provided by the program to accelerate
the pace of structural reforms necessary for the development of a vibrant private sector.
52.
BiH has not accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and
maintains restrictions on the transferability of balances and interest accrued on foreign

21
currency deposits, subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII. Staff does not recommend
approval of these restrictions.
53.
Taking into account the commitment by the authorities at all levels to steadfastly
implement their program and be ready to adjust policies as circumstances change, staff
expects the BiH economy to succeed in dealing with its present challenges. Therefore,
staff supports the authorities’ request for a 24-month Stand-By Arrangement. Significant
risks to program implementation stem from possible fading of political support for the fiscal
consolidation and reform agenda along with the commitment to national policy coordination
and cooperation in the period leading to and following the October local elections. To
minimize the risks, the program includes strong safeguards, including approval of rebalanced
budgets prior to Board consideration of the request for the program.
54.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the 24-month cycle,
subject to the decision on consultation cycles in program countries.

22
Box 1. BiH—Performance Under the 2009–12 SBA
The authorities’ program was designed to safeguard the currency board and cushion the effects of the
deteriorating external environment, while adopting policies to redress fiscal imbalances and strengthen
the financial sector. The program sought to: (i) reduce the structural fiscal deficit and bring public
finances on a sustainable medium-term path; (ii) re-establish public wage restraint; (iii) support adequate
liquidity and capitalization of banks; and (iv) secure external financing and improve confidence.

improved confidence and contributed to the stability of the currency board. Despite some loss of reserves
in 2009 amid heightened risk aversion towards emerging market assets, the NFA cover of reserve money
has been at around 1.1 throughout the period. Exchange rate stability and continued liquidity support from
parent banks have also helped the banking system weather the global financial crisis reasonably well.

Although progress was made on fiscal consolidation as envisaged under the program, the composition of
spending did not improve as the program envisioned. In 2011, with revenue overperformance more than
offsetting expenditure overruns, the overall fiscal balance was slightly better than the program target.1/
This, against the backdrop of overruns on the wage bill and social benefits in the order of 2¼ percentage
points of GDP, implied a severe compression of other spending, including capital outlays.

deficit may exceed sustainable levels based on certain methodologies, with large uncertainties
surrounding estimates due to data limitations and possible structural changes in the economy,
there is no strong evidence for real exchange rate misalignment that could result in future
external instability. Equilibrium current account deficit estimates are between 3.7–5.9 percent
of GDP compared to a medium-term projection of about 5 percent. The CGER macroeconomic
balance approach suggests an equilibrium deficit of 5.9 percent. The external sustainability
approach suggests that the equilibrium current account deficit, which would stabilize the net
foreign asset position to output at its 2010 level (of about 58 percent), would be 3.7 percent of
GDP. Based on the estimated alternative equilibrium current account norms, the REER
misalignment ranges from a small

Starting with the December 2010 data, the RS Banking Agency requires banks to record on-balance sheet the "loss" loans and related accrued interest and
provisions, which were previously recorded off-balance sheet. The data prior to December 2010 have not been revised, resulting in a structural break. Using
consistent series, the growth of credit to the private sector was only 0.8 percent at end-2010.

Prior to 2010, assets classified as loss, alongside the provisions made against them, were held off-balance sheet by banks in BiH.
This lowered the reported NPL ratios and coverage of nonperforming loans by provisions. Starting with the December 2010 data,
the RS Banking Agency requires banks to record on-balance sheet the "loss" loans and related accrued interest and provisions,
resulting in a structural break in the series. The Federation Banking Agency applied the same methodology starting in December 2011.

Annex II. BiH—Potential Crisis Spillover Channels
A. Real Sector Spillovers
1.
The strong links of the economy of Bosnia and Herzegovina with the euro area
and its close neighbors make it susceptible to crisis contagion. The interlinkages and
potential spillover channels of distress from the euro area to the local economies in the
European periphery are manifold and their impacts are of varying time spans and lags. Since
the largely disruptive process of disintegration of Former Yugoslavia, an increasing
orientation towards political and economic integration with the wider European continent has
taken place. The resulting development has been accompanied by a higher degree of
synchronicity of indicators such as industrial production, output, and international trade.
2.
Sizeable worker remittances represent a significant channel for the transmission
of external shocks to BiH. The contribution of remittances to BiH’s GDP has been declining
continuously over the past ten years to 12.2 percent in 2010 compared with 27.5 percent in
2000. Given the scarcity of reliable data on bilateral remittance flows, an inference on the
source country of remittances has to be made based on migrant flows and total outward
remittances. Besides neighboring states, Germany, Austria, and the US were the largest
recipients of BiH migrants, with about 250,000, 160,000, and 121,000 respectively
1
. Hence, developments in output and the labor market in these countries could have a
3.
sizeable impact on worker remittances to BiH.

4.
Trade links between BiH and the euro area and neighboring countries are
strong. Over 75 percent of BiH’s
BiH: Total Exports (in billion US$)
exports go to either direct
160
neighbors (Croatia, Serbia, and
140

last decade exposes the downsides of that linkage, given that BiH’s exports collapsed in
tandem with the rest of Europe’s trade slump.
5.
VAR analysis suggests that a weakening in international trade would harm BiH.
Notwithstanding the difficulty in precisely quantifying the strength of spillovers, a simple
quarterly VAR model including BiH exports, BiH REER, BiH short-term interest rates, BiH
industrial production, and Slovenian (SLV) exports2 is employed– all variables are computed
in log differences and are stationary. As an illustrative example, an export growth shock (of
one standard error of about 1.6 percent) in Slovenia would have a strong impact on export
growth in BiH after one quarter, reaching about 0.9 percent, but followed by a fast return to
the steady state level of growth.

6.
The worsening of BiH’s international investment position over the past decade
has made it more susceptible to contagion from external shocks. During the period of
rapid economic growth that preceded the global financial crisis the BiH economy
experienced greater integration with Western Europe. This was accompanied by a significant
deterioration in BiH’s international investment position: during 2004–10, net foreign
liabilities moved from around 35 percent to 60 percent of GDP. Nonetheless, the weakening
in BiH’s net external position has been somewhat smaller than that experienced by regional
peers. The worsening of BiH’s external investment position and the country’s higher
interconnectedness would suggest that BiH is now more exposed to shocks emanating from
the global financial sector.

2

Slovenia is the most important regional trade partner and among the three main destinations for BiH’s exports.

55
7.
The composition of BiH’s foreign liabilities has been dominated by external
loans and direct investment. The balanced composition of foreign liabilities between direct
investment and other investment liabilities helps to reduce exposure to global volatility and
to lessen vulnerabilities, as these external flows tend to be less volatile and more long-term in
nature than portfolio flows. In the case of BiH, the share of foreign direct investment
liabilities in total foreign liabilities is the lowest in the region. This could be evidence of a
lack of long-term investment opportunities in BiH and an adverse business climate, as well as
the result of a difficult political environment. The absence of portfolio flows to BiH and to
the region in general is likely a reflection of under-developed capital markets that may be
stifling growth.

Foreign banks have limited their exposure to BiH’s banking sector while funding
concentration has increased. As in other European emerging markets, the pre-crisis period
in BiH was characterized by increasing foreign bank inflows fueling domestic credit growth.
However, since early 2010, foreign
130

banks have limited their exposure to
BiH against the backdrop of heightened 120

(34 percent). Thus, BiH would be well

56
served by increasing the diversification in its funding sources as having a variety of sources
of financing would help BiH diversify risks from source countries and would reduce the
concentration risks from exposure to only a few funding sources.
9.
VAR analysis suggests that a negative shock to foreign bank flows would lead to
a significant contraction in credit growth in BiH. A simple quarterly VAR model
including BIS foreign bank claims on BiH,

In light of their low levels, FDI flows to BiH do not appear to be an important
transmission channel of spillovers. Since 2000, net FDI flows have averaged around
5 percent of GDP. Excluding a 2007 uptick
(associated with the privatization of
telecoms and the oil refinery in Republika
Srpska), this would have been the lowest
among regional peers. FDI sources are
more diverse, with close to 50 percent of
the flows originating in emerging European
economies including Russia, Serbia, and
Croatia. These low levels of FDI flows and
the greater diversification of sources would
suggest that FDI flows are not likely to be
an important transmission channel. On the
other hand, the upside for greater and more sustained FDI inflows represents an important
factor that may lead to higher future growth in BiH.

57
ATTACHMENT I. BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA: LETTER OF INTENT
Sarajevo and Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina
September 11, 2012
Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Ms. Lagarde:
1.
The economy of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) was hit hard by the global financial
crisis. The currency board arrangement (CBA) and fiscal restraint as well as multilateral
financial support including under the 2009 Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with the IMF
mitigated the adverse impact of the crisis and helped maintain macroeconomic stability and
public confidence.
2.
In recent months, the slow post-2009 economic recovery has stalled amid intensified
stress in the euro area, which has also contributed to a loss of international reserves. Together
with underlying imbalances in our domestic economy, these developments have raised
concerns about macroeconomic stability and BiH’s growth prospects. In response, the
Institutions of BiH, Federation and Republika Srpska governments and the Central Bank of
Bosnia and Herzegovina (CBBH) have developed an economic program to safeguard
macroeconomic stability and support sustainable growth over the medium term.
3.
Our economic program, for which we are seeking IMF support, is designed to counter
the effects of the worsening external environment and reduce domestic vulnerabilities. It
provides a roadmap in a difficult economic and financial environment and should give
confidence to the population, business community and investors by signaling our resolve to
improve policy coordination, maintain fiscal discipline, safeguard financial sector stability,
and improve the business environment.
4.
Under the program, we will: (i) reduce the fiscal deficit and improve medium-term
fiscal sustainability; (ii) enhance the role of the Fiscal Council in fiscal policy coordination;
(iii) implement agreed fiscal reforms; (iv) improve crisis preparedness and contingency
planning; and (v) promote structural reforms to enhance external competitiveness.
5.
In support of these policies and based on our balance of payments needs, we request
IMF support through an SBA in the amount equivalent to SDR 338.20 million (200 percent
of quota) for the period September 2012 through September 2014.

58
6.
We believe that the policies described in this letter are adequate to achieve the
objectives of our economic program, but we stand ready to take additional measures as
appropriate. During the period of the arrangement, we will consult in advance with the IMF
on the adoption of any new measures in accordance with the IMF’s policies on such
consultations. Further, we will provide the IMF with such information as it requests on policy
implementation and achievement of the program objectives.
I. Macroeconomic Framework
7.
Economic conditions have deteriorated in recent months. The global slowdown and
tighter financing conditions cloud BiH’s growth outlook, with real GDP likely to stay flat
this year and to grow by mere a 1 percent in 2013. With sluggish credit to the economy
domestic demand will be subdued, thus limiting CPI inflation to about 2 percent during
2012−13. Despite a deceleration of imports the external current account deficit is expected to
remain relatively large (7.5 percent of GDP). With limited access to private financing,
external financing requirements will need to be met in large part by drawing on official
resources.
II. Improving National Policy Coordination
8.
We are committed to maintaining the Currency Board Arrangement as
constituted by law (structural benchmark). The CBA remains the strongest guarantee of
macroeconomic stability and enjoys broad political and public support. The CBBH is
prohibited from extending credit to the government, from issuing central bank securities, and
from granting credit to banks and any other private agents. Mindful of the importance to
maintain public confidence in the stability of the convertible marka, we will refrain from
legislative actions that would weaken, or cast doubt on, the current arrangement and the
institution entrusted with its operation—the CBBH.
9.
We are committed to preserving the integrity of the national system of indirect
taxation. We will continue collecting indirect taxes at the BiH level and maintain the single
account of the Indirect Taxation Authority (ITA). We will strive to ensure its continued
effectiveness by working together in a constructive and timely manner to resolve any
contentious issues. In particular, on August 31, 2012 we adopted a decision on the settlement
of all disputed amounts through end-2011 (prior action) and we will settle them by end-2012.
To reduce the size of the required settlement in the future, we will reset the allocation
coefficient between entities on a quarterly basis and accelerate the verification of any
disputed claims.
10.
We will take steps to improve tax compliance. The large informal economy has
been undermining tax revenue collection and placing a disproportionate burden on the formal
sector, calling into question the fairness of the tax system. To improve compliance, we will
strengthen cooperation among tax administrations by formalizing information exchange. As

59
the first step, the ITA and Entity tax administrations will sign a memorandum on cooperation
and sharing of taxpayer information.
11.
The interruption in servicing foreign debt obligations experienced in early 2012
will not be repeated. We are putting in place safeguards to avoid any risks in this respect.
The Council of Ministers has approved an amendment to the law on financing of the
Institutions of BiH to allow for continued servicing of foreign debt even in the absence of an
adopted budget. We will have it approved by Parliament by end-2012 (structural benchmark).
12.
We will take steps to enhance statistics by removing any impediments to
information sharing. Specifically:


We will amend the relevant ITA laws, particularly Article 52 of the “Law on Indirect
Taxation Procedure” published on the Official Gazette of BiH No. 89/05 to allow the
Entity statistical agencies and the Agency for Statistics of Bosnia and Herzegovina
(BHAS) to access ITA’s foreign trade and VAT data.



The Entity statistical agencies and the BHAS will strengthen data sharing and
cooperation by agreeing on modalities of data exchange.



We recognize the importance of the Government Finance Statistics compliant with
the GFS2001 manual for both program monitoring and official statistics reporting
purposes. To that end, all levels of government in BiH will continue to provide all
necessary information to the CBBH required for timely compilation of a full set of
GFS statistics of BiH.
III. Maintaining Fiscal Discipline

13.
The large financing gaps and the existing structural fiscal deficit make a case for
fiscal adjustment. We will exercise firm control over current expenditure, while protecting
transfers to the most vulnerable population groups and spending on infrastructure.
14.
We will limit the 2012 general government deficit to about 3 percent of GDP. The
budget for the Institutions of BiH, which was approved by the BiH Parliament in May 2012,
is appropriately restrictive. The central Entity governments prepared rebalanced budgets,
consistent with policy commitments in this Letter, and had those budgets adopted by
Parliaments in early September (prior action). We recognize that there are downside risks to
our budgets, and we stand ready to take compensatory measures, if needed.
15.
On the revenue side, we will continue the step increase in excises on tobacco products
as prescribed in the law. The EU’s decision to raise the minimum excises on tobacco
products has enlarged the gap between BiH and the EU minimum. We will amend the current
law, and raise the excises on tobacco products to the EU minimum in order to harmonize our
excises with EU legislation over time.

60
16.

On the expenditure side:



The 2012 budget for the Institutions of BiH envisages limited new employment,
mainly related to the census, local elections and strengthening the capacities of the
anti-corruption agency; a 4.5 percent reduction in base wage effective May 2012,
except for those employees whose wage coefficient is 1; and a 12 percent reduction in
employee allowances. Total current expenditure (which includes employee
compensation and spending on goods and services) will be limited to 1.5 percent
below the 2011 execution. In 2013, Institutions of BiH will maintain the number of
employees at the 2012 level.



In the Federation, the central government will continue to exercise fiscal restraint and
will: (i) generate savings of KM 8 million in the compensation of employees; this will
be achieved by setting the base for calculation of wages and allowances to KM 315,
which will be maintained throughout 2012; a moratorium on payment of allowances
for work in committees and for overtime work; and through a restrictive employment
policy for the remainder of the year; (ii) re-assess the effectiveness of subsidies and
improve their targeting, thus saving KM 10 million; (iii) expedite the eligibility audits
of beneficiaries; (iv) ensure that the budgeted allocation of the transfer to the Pension
Fund will not be exceeded; this will be achieved by lowering the highest payment
coefficient for pensions under favorable conditions and by stepping up the collection
of overdue contribution obligations; (v) exercise strict expenditure control and put in
place measures to ensure the stability of the Health Fund by adjusting the scope of the
health protection program to the available funding and avoid accumulation of arrears;
(vi) reduce transfers to public enterprises by KM 17 million.



In Republika Srpska (RS), the central government will continue to exercise fiscal
restraint and freeze hiring for the remainder of this year, except in education; and will
generate savings in: (i) goods and services of KM 6.9 million; (ii) transfers to social
institutions of KM 8 million; (iii) transfers to other levels of government of KM 1.1
million; and (vi) Health Fund (FZO) financial plan in the amount of KM 5 million.
Also, we will generate savings in goods and services in municipality and city budgets
of KM 5 million. Moreover, operations funded by the escrow account will be reduced
by KM 35 million.

17.
All governments are committed to maintaining fiscal discipline over the medium
term. We therefore intend to continue consolidation in 2013, through a further reduction in
the consolidated general government deficit to around 2½ percent of GDP. Fiscal efforts will
continue to be concentrated on the expenditure side, which will benefit from the full-year
impact of the measures undertaken this year and from the structural fiscal reforms outlined
below.

61
IV. Advancing Public Sector Reform
18.
We are committed to carry out structural fiscal reforms to make the expenditure
reduction in 2012 permanent and to return public finances to a more sustainable path. We
have already adopted the “Global Framework of Fiscal Balance and Policies in Bosnia and
Herzegovina” for 2013–15. This Framework will provide the basis for the preparation of the
budgets of the Institutions of BiH and the Entities for 2013. In addition, the role of the
Advisory Group of the Fiscal Council will be enhanced with the task of coordinating all
issues related to program implementation and monitoring.
Institutions of BiH


We have amended the Law on Service in the Armed Forces of BiH, repealing the
provisions that grant eligibility for early retirement of army personnel. This
amendment does not compel the Entity governments to provide same or similar
benefits. All the obligations under the original law through end-May 2012 have been
provided for in the 2012 budget of the Institutions of BiH. Payments of these
obligations will be made during 2012 once the Ministry of Defense establishes the
exact amounts of the individual entitlements (structural benchmark).

Federation of BiH


We will draft a law on retirement under favorable conditions and submit it to
parliament by end-October 2012 for adoption by end-2012. This law will reform
privileged pensions in a comprehensive way, including aligning the average level of
these pensions with the one of contributory pensions, and limiting the payout of these
pensions to available funds in the budget through the application of a rationing
coefficient for all pensions under favorable conditions. Until this law comes into
force, we will not grant any new or additional special retirement benefits (structural
benchmark).



By end-2012 the government will adopt a strategy for a comprehensive pension
reform.



The government has adopted a decision on the settlement of central government debt
to the Pension Fund, which will be done in equal annual payments over the next ten
years beginning in 2013. This will be reflected in a law to be submitted to Parliament
by end-August 2012.



We will expedite the process of eligibility audits of war disability beneficiaries and
publish results on a quarterly basis (structural benchmark), and complete the process
by end-2014. In the meantime, we will explore ways to improve targeting of these
benefits.

62


We will establish a centralized database of all beneficiaries of social transfers,
operated by the Federation Taxation Authority. This will facilitate the tracking and
auditing of such benefits, yielding savings going forward. We plan to have this
operational by end-2012.



We will reach an agreement with representatives of the trade unions on the settlement
of government employees’ lawsuits arising from the 2009 and 2010 cuts in wages and
allowances by end-August 2012. This agreement will, inter alia, include amendments
to the collective agreement to prevent lawsuits in the future.



The government recognizes the need to amend the budget process to ensure that
approved legislation is backed by sufficient financial resources and the fiscal
spending will not jeopardize medium-term fiscal sustainability. To this end, we are
working toward a new law that will, inter alia, include penalty clauses for undertaking
commitments in excess of budget allocations. We plan to submit the draft to
parliament by end-2012.



Given the decentralized structure in Federation, expenditure control in lower levels of
governments is key to safeguarding fiscal sustainability. To this end, we will aim to
finalize the introduction of treasury systems at lower levels of government by end2013, and link them to the central government treasury system. This will also
improve the reporting system at all levels of governments.



We recognize the urgency of safeguarding the financial soundness of the Health
Fund. We will exercise strict expenditure control to secure its financial soundness.
We have adopted a consolidation plan to ensure that the health protection program is
consistent with the financial plan and that contracts with health providers are in line
with the program.

Republika Srpska


We will aim to reduce the wage bill as a share of GDP over the medium term by
reforming public administration and maintaining a prudent wage policy. To achieve
this, we will:
 As the first step, freeze the compensation of employees in 2013–14 at the 2012 level.
 Adopt a Law on Wages and Salaries of Public Service Employees (Pension and
Disability Insurance Fund, Health Insurance Fund, Child Protection Fund and
Employment Fund) to ensure that wages and salaries of employees in extrabudgetary
funds will be at the same level in all the funds, while being aligned with wages and
salaries of employees in the public administration. We plan to have the law adopted
by end-2012 and to enter into force as of January 1, 2013.

63
 Amend and supplement the Law on Wages and Salaries of Employees in the Public
Administration of Republika Srpska (Official Gazette of Republika Srpska, nos.
118/07, 116/09, 1/11 and 1/12) to prescribe similar coefficients for all employed civil
servants and government employees, depending on the complexity of their respective
tasks. We plan to have the law adopted by end-2012 and to enter into force as of
January 1, 2013.
 Amend the Law on Salaries and other Allowances of Judges and Prosecutors in
Republika Srpska (Official Gazette of Republika Srpska, nos. 115/05, 30/07 and
118/07) to abolish those provisions of the law related to linking the wage growth with
the growth of average monthly net wage in BiH. We plan to have the law adopted by
end-2012 and to enter into force as of January 1, 2013.
 Introduce a centralized payroll system for employees in the public sector, in order to
set up a system for recording, controlling and improved planning at the level of the
public sector. It is expected that the implementation process will start in July 2013
and be fully implemented as of July 2014.
 Review the operations of agencies with the objective of making savings, revisit the
rationale for their existence, as well as the manner of their organization and operation
in the future. Depending on the outcome of this process, we will consider merging or
abolishing some agencies which have not yielded the desired results. We plan to have
this process completed by end-2012.
 Amend the relevant legislation to ensure that changes in the statutory income tax rates
and contributions do not automatically lead to changes in the gross pay of civil
servants and employees, thus eliminating the take-home pay protection.


We plan to amend the Budget System Law so as to introduce penalty clauses for
undertaking commitments that exceed the level of budget allocations. The deadline to
amend the law is end-2012 with the enforcement date set to January 1, 2013.



We have enacted two important laws on pension and disability insurance and warveteran benefits. These laws separate the benefits based on past contributions from
those arising from special conditions. This progress will not only improve budget
transparency, but also allow the Ministry of Veteran Affairs to redouble its effort in
tightening eligibility criteria and expedite audits of beneficiaries. We intend to
publish the quarterly audit results (structural benchmark), and complete the review of
eligibility rights by end-March 2013. Following the audits, we will explore ways to
improve targeting of these benefits.



The newly enacted law on pension and disability insurance aims to ensure long-term
sustainability of the public pension system and improve its fairness. We will closely

64
monitor how well these two objectives are being met and stand ready to consider
modifications to the system if necessary.


We recognize the urgency of improving the financial soundness of the Health Fund
(FZO). To achieve this, we intend to enhance expenditure control through intensified
work of the internal audit department in the FZO and health institutions. In addition,
the internal audit department will develop and strengthen financial management
system and internal control procedures. Introduction of “e-health card” will enable
additional savings in the FZO. The FZO will appoint new committees and improve
assessments of working ability to eliminate misuse of sick leave. We will rationalize
employment in the FZO. We will take steps to reduce health care treatment costs
abroad. The Ministry of Health and Social Protection and the FZO will work together
to optimize the scope of the health care system.

19.
We understand that the unfavorable economic situation and our adjustment program
could adversely affect the vulnerable groups of our population. Thus, we will ensure that
public financial support for households is better targeted toward the most vulnerable groups,
and that financial integrity of public pension and unemployment insurance schemes is not
jeopardized.
V. Safeguarding Financial Sector Stability
20.
The banking system in BiH weathered the impact of the global financial crisis well.
Supported by the 2009 SBA, we swiftly responded to the crisis and adopted measures to
shore up confidence in the system and ensure the health of our banking sector. We lowered
bank reserve requirements to boost liquidity, established the Standing Committee for
Financial Stability (SCFS) to monitor vulnerabilities and enhanced crisis preparedness, and
increased deposit insurance coverage.
21.
While our banking system has remained stable recently, the uncertain financial
situation abroad and domestic economic vulnerabilities have created challenging conditions.
Against this backdrop, nonperforming loans (NPLs) have risen substantially and now stand at
12.1 percent of total loans. Moreover, foreign parent banks have reduced their exposure to
BiH over time, thus limiting the availability of long-term funding sources for our banks.
22.
Therefore, we will adopt necessary measures to further strengthen our financial
system as well as to enhance our crisis preparedness and institutional capacity to monitor
financial stability. We will proceed gradually toward risk-based supervision and Basel II/III
implementation. As the first step, we are establishing working groups to design the conduct
of bottom-up stress tests for large banks to be done on a regular basis.
23.
The high level of NPLs in BiH’s banks represents a key vulnerability of our financial
system with important negative effects for economic activity. To tackle this vulnerability, we

65
will review our legal and regulatory frameworks, seeking cooperation from financial sector
participants, with a view to creating an environment conducive to NPL resolution. In this
respect, we will adopt Entity laws on factoring and agencies for the repurchase of claims,
which would regulate the transferring of a portion of the banks' loan portfolios to a separate
legal entity and tax treatment of such transactions.
24.
In close collaboration with IMF staff we reviewed our crisis preparedness and
contingency planning frameworks and identified a number of areas where action is required.
We will strengthen the role of the SCFS in timely monitoring financial sector risks, by
having regular quarterly meetings and additional ad hoc ones as necessary. Furthermore, each
member of the SCFS will prepare contingency plans, including technical requirements, to be
rolled into a comprehensive contingency plan for financial stability. We will strengthen the
bank resolution framework by amending both banking laws by end-2012 to set the legal
expiration date for provisional administration to one year with a possible six month extension
(structural benchmarks).
25.
We are committed to further enhancing the resilience of the system and coordination
among agencies. The CBBH together with the Banking Agencies will continue to review
periodically the stress test results with individual banks, and to monitor the exposure of
foreign parent banks vis-à-vis BiH. In this context, coordination of the stress tests will be
further formalized with the signing of the “Internal Guidelines on Stress Testing,” with a
view to ensuring the credibility, objectivity, and timeliness of top-down stress tests.
26.
The Banking Agencies have strengthened their cooperation with foreign home
supervisors including through their participation in colleges of supervisors. We will remove
remaining impediments to signing bilateral Memoranda of Understanding with Austria’s and
Italy’s banking supervisors. We are amending the legal frameworks related to the treatment
of confidential information in order to align them with EU requirements, and plan to have
these approved by the parliaments by end-2012 (structural benchmark).
27.
Public confidence in the banking system is of paramount importance to financial
stability. In this context, institutional independence of the Banking Agencies will be
respected. To this end, we repealed the amendments to the Federation Banking Agency Law,
Articles 15 and 27, that were adopted in 2012 (prior action).
28.
To strengthen the role of deposit insurance in our financial system, we are revising
the law governing our Deposit Insurance Agency (DIA), including along the following lines:
(i) the DIA will cover those most in need of protection by extending coverage to small- and
medium-sized enterprises; (ii) all BiH banks will be members of the DIA, including those
that may fall under provisional administration subsequent to the adoption of the new law; and
(iii) Article 18 related to governance of the DIA will be amended to ensure compliance with
international standards. We will submit the revised DIA law to the BiH Parliament by endMarch 2013 (structural benchmark).

66
VI. Improving the Business Environment
29.
BiH’s recovery will not be possible without a vigorous private sector. Improving the
business environment will encourage private investment and support long-term growth and
contribute to improved market sentiment. We have made some progress in streamlining
procedures and creating transparency regarding business regulation, but much more remains
to be done. Specifically:


In the RS, we will implement a “one-stop-shop” registration system. This involves
removing the registration of companies from the economic courts and entrepreneurs
from the municipalities, simplifying and combining the steps needed, and
concentrating the whole procedure at a single institution. The realization of the
project requires an amendment of 21 laws, and will be concluded by end-2013.



In the Federation, we will reduce the administrative burden on business, ensure
efficient organization and simplify administrative procedures related to export-import
operations, establish and strengthen the quality assurance system, support export
growth in key areas and enhance competitiveness of the agriculture sector, as well as
continue work to create more favorable environment for domestic and foreign
investments. In this regard, we will follow up on the steps we have already taken in
partnership with the IFC to simplify the regulatory environment and improve
administrative capacity for dealing with business operations, and we will aim to fully
implement the remaining IFC recommendations.
VII. Data Issues

30.
We recognize the importance of improving the quality of statistics. The BHAS and
the two Entity Statistics Agencies commit to reconcile the expenditure and production GDP
data and publish them in a timely manner. Furthermore, all three Statistics Agencies, with
assistance from the IMF regional resident TA advisor, will accelerate the development of
quarterly GDP data, aiming at the first publication of the historical time series by mid-2013.
In addition, we intend to make every effort to improve necessary capacity, so as to participate
in the IMF’s general data dissemination system (GDDS). As the first step, we will appoint a
country coordinator by end-September 2012.
31.
We have made important progress in improving the quality of fiscal statistics,
including a gradual introduction of the harmonized fiscal reporting template (HRT), jointly
developed with IMF staff. We will continue the publication of consolidated general
government fiscal data according to the HRT on a quarterly basis (structural benchmark). At
the same time, we are mindful of the significant gaps in the quality of published data, due to
incomplete coverage of off-budget spending and foreign-financed projects, partial
implementation of accrual accounting; and long delays in reporting by lower levels of
government, particularly in the Federation. To address these weaknesses,

67


we will apply international accounting standards and adopt the HRT together with
reporting deadlines at all levels of government and formalize the procedure for
publication of consolidated reports.



we will broaden the coverage of reporting on fiscal execution to include foreignfinanced projects and off-budget spending in general government fiscal accounts.



we will continue to improve data collection, and reconciliation of external grants and
loan disbursements, and external debt service.



the Federation Ministry of Finance will strengthen the staffing and capacity in the
area of monitoring and consolidating financial reports from lower level governments
and funds. The objective is to prepare consolidated reports of fiscal operations at the
level of the Federation general government by end-2012.
VIII. Program Modalities and Other Issues

32.
The program will be monitored through quarterly (and continuous) quantitative
performance criteria, indicative targets, prior actions, structural benchmarks, quarterly
reviews and consultation clauses. Quantitative performance criteria for 2012 and indicative
quantitative targets for 2013 are set out in Table 1; and prior actions and structural
benchmarks are set out in Table 2. The understandings between the authorities of BiH and
IMF staff regarding the quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets are further
discussed in the attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU).
33.
IMF resources under the arrangement will be disbursed to the central bank, and
credited to an account of the Institutions of BiH, earmarked for the budgets of Federation of
BiH and Republika Srpska on the 2/3:1/3 split. Upon the approval of the arrangement by the
IMF Executive Board, we plan to draw the whole available amount of SDR 50.73 million
(30 percent of quota) to support the Entity budgets. The first review of the program is
expected to take place on or after December 15, 2012.
34.
We recognize the importance of completing a safeguards assessment by the first
review of the SBA. In this regard, the CBBH will provide as soon as feasible the necessary
documentation required for completing such an assessment and receive a safeguards mission
from the IMF as necessary.

ATTACHMENT II. TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING ON DEFINITIONS AND
REPORTING UNDER THE 2012–14 STAND-BY ARRANGEMENT
September 11, 2012
1.
This Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) sets out the understanding
between the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the IMF mission regarding the
definitions of quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets for the Stand-By
Arrangement (SBA) (Tables 1) as well as data reporting requirements for program
monitoring (Table 3).
I.

PERFORMANCE CRITERIA AND INDICATIVE TARGET

2.
In the following definitions, the end-quarter test dates apply to the last working day of
each quarter.
3.
The definitions of all fiscal variables contained in this TMU are based, unless
otherwise specified, on the IMF’s Manual on Government Finance Statistics 2001.
A. Floor on the Net Lending of (i) the Institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, (ii)
Central Government of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and (iii)
Central Government of the Republika Srpska (Performance Criteria)
Definitions
4.
The Institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina is defined to comprise all spending units
depending on its budget. The central government of the Federation of Bosnia and
Herzegovina is defined to include all spending units depending on its budget whether these
units are included or not in the treasury system. The central government of the Republika
Srpska includes all spending units depending on its budget whether these units are included
(entirely or partially) or not in the treasury system, and the operations funded by escrow
accounts.
5.

Net lending is defined as revenue minus expenditure.

Application of performance criterion
6.
Program targets will be individually monitored quarterly through the respective
accrual balances and measured as the cumulative change from the level existing on
December 31 of the previous year.
7.
For the purposes of program monitoring, compliance with the floor on the net lending
will require that each of the three above-defined floors be observed independently.

70

Adjustors to performance criterion
8.
The definition of net lending will exclude spending on investment projects financed
by external official creditors either through loans or grants.
9.
The floor on the net lending will be adjusted upward by the full amount of any
shortfall in programmed disbursements of budget support loans. Program budget support
disbursements are defined as external disbursements from official creditors (e.g., World Bank
and European Commission) used for financing of government budget deficits.
Reporting requirements
10.
Data on monthly execution, including revenues, expenditure and financing, will be
provided by the ministries of finance of the respective Entities and no later than five weeks
after the end of each month (six weeks for end-year numbers). The Ministry of Finance of the
Institutions of BiH will provide monthly data on revenue and expenditure no later than five
weeks after the end of each month (six weeks for end-year numbers) and quarterly data on
financing no later than six weeks after the end of each quarter.
B. Floor on the Net Lending of the General Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina
(Indicative Target)
Definitions
11.
The general government of Bosnia and Herzegovina is defined to include the
Institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the general governments of Federation of Bosnia
and Herzegovina Entity (Federation), Republika Srpska Entity (RS), and the District Brcko.
The Federation general government is defined to include the central government, the
cantonal governments, the municipal governments, the federal and cantonal extrabudgetary
funds and the road and highways funds. The RS general government is defined to include the
central government, the municipal governments, the extrabudgetary funds and the road and
highway funds. The District Brcko is defined to include the central government with all
spending units depending on its budget and extrabudgetary funds. Extrabudgetary funds
include, but are not limited to, pension funds, health funds, unemployment funds, and
children's fund. Any new budgetary or extra budgetary fund, created during the program
period will also be included in the definition of the general government. The BiH authorities
will inform IMF staff of the creation of any such new funds. Any fund that uses public
resources not included in the definitions above will be automatically allocated either to one
of the entity general governments or to the Institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The BiH
authorities will promptly inform IMF staff of the existence of any of such funds.

71
12.
The net lending of the General Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina is defined as
revenue minus expenditure. The floor on the net lending of the General Government of
Bosnia and Herzegovina will be defined, for each test date, as the cumulative change from
the level existing on December 31 of the previous year.
Adjustors to indicative target
13.
The definition of net lending will exclude spending on investment projects financed
by external official creditors either through loans or grants.
14.
The target will be adjusted upward by the full amount of any shortfall in programmed
disbursements of budget support loans. Program budget support disbursements are defined as
external disbursements from official creditors (e.g., World Bank and European Commission)
used for financing of general government budget deficit.
Reporting requirements
15.
Data on quarterly general government execution, including revenues, expenditure and
financing, will be provided by the ministries of finance of the respective Entities and District
Brcko no later than six weeks after the end of each quarter.
C. Ceiling on Contracting or Guaranteeing of New Nonconcessional Short-Term
External Debt by Institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Federation and
Republika Srpska General Governments, and CBBH (Performance Criterion)
Definitions
16.
Definition of debt. The term “debt” is defined to include all current liabilities to nonresidents, which are created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value
in the form of assets (including currency) or services, and which require the Institutions of
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Federation and Republika Srpska general governments or CBBH to
make one or more payments in the form of assets (including currency), at some future
point(s) in time to discharge principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract
1
(No. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt,
17.
Decision No. 6230-(79/140), August 3, 1979, as amended by Decision Nos. 11096-(95/100),
October 25, 1995, 12274-(00/85), August 24, 2000, and 14416-(09/91), August 31, 2009,
effective December 1, 2009). In effect, all instruments that share the characteristics of debt as
described above (including loans, suppliers' credits and leases) will be included in the
definition.
1

See Debt Limits in Fund-Supported Programs—Proposed New Guidelines 6230-(79/140)

72

18.
New nonconcessional external debt is defined as including all external debt (as
defined above) contracted or guaranteed by the Institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina,
Federation and Republika Srpska general governments or CBBH during the program period
that is not on concessional terms.
19.
Concessional loans are defined as those with a grant element of at least 35 percent of
the value of the loan, using currency-specific discount rates based on the commercial interest
rates reported by the OECD (CIRRS). For short-term loans, the average CIRRs of the
proceeding six-month period (plus a margin of 0.75 percent) will be used.
20.
Short-term external debt is defined as external debt contracted or guaranteed with
an original maturity of up to and including one year
Application of performance criterion
21.
The zero ceiling on contracting or guaranteeing new nonconcessional short-term
external debt applies to obligations of the Institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Federation
and Republika Srpska general governments, and CBBH. This criterion will be measured
quarterly on the basis of end-of-quarter data.
Reporting requirements
22.
Data on newly contracted or guaranteed nonconcessional short-term external debt will
be provided by the Ministries of Finance of the Institutions of BiH and the respective Entities
and by the CBBH on a quarterly basis within six weeks of the end of each quarter.
D. Ceiling on the Accumulation of External Payments Arrears by the Institutions of
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Federation and Republika Srpska General
Governments, and CBBH (Performance Criterion)
Definitions
23.
External payment arrears are defined as overdue debt service arising in respect of
debt obligations (as described above) incurred directly or guaranteed by the Institutions of
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Federation and Republika Srpska general governments, and CBBH,
except on debt subject to rescheduling or restructuring.
Application of performance criterion
24.
The zero ceiling on accumulation of external payments arrears applies to the change
in the stock of overdue payments on medium- and long-term debt contracted or guaranteed

73
by the Institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Federation and Republika Srpska general
governments, or CBBH. This criterion will apply continuously.
25.
The limit on the change in external payments arrears also applies to the change in the
stock of overdue payments on short term debt in convertible currencies with an original
maturity of up to and including one year.
26.

Accumulation of new external payments arrears is prohibited under the program.

Reporting requirements
27.
The Ministries of Finance of the Institutions of BiH and the respective Entities and
the CBBH will inform Fund staff immediately of any accumulation of external payments
arrears.
E. Ceiling on the Accumulation of Domestic Arrears by the Institutions of Bosnia
and Herzegovina, and Federation and Republika Srpska General Governments
(Performance Criterion)
Definition
28.
The performance criterion established on the stock of domestic arrears contemplates a
zero ceiling on the increase in the stock of domestic arrears compared with the stock as of
December 31 of the previous year. The stock of domestic arrears is defined as the sum of
payments obligations (accounts payable) past the due date stipulated by the contractual or
legal payment period for each expenditure item and are nondisputed. They can arise on any
expenditure item, including transfers to individuals, debt service, wages, pensions, energy
payments and goods and services. Past-due payments obligations on inter-governmental
transfers (i.e., transfers between Entity central governments and local governments, and
extrabudgetary funds) are not included in the stock of arrears.
Application of performance criterion
29.
The zero ceiling on accumulation of domestic arrears applies to obligations of the
Institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Federation and Republika Srpska general
governments. This criterion will be measured quarterly on the basis of end-of-quarter data.
Thus, if at the end of any given quarter any of the three governments exceeds the zero ceiling
on the change in the stock of its arrears compared with the stock of the same government’s
arrears as of December 31 of the previous year, the performance criterion will be missed.

74
30.
Reporting requirements: Data on domestic arrears will be transmitted on a quarterly
basis by the Ministries of Finance of the Institutions of BiH and the respective Entities within
five weeks of the end of each quarter.
II.

OTHER DATA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

31.
The Bosnia and Herzegovina authorities will report the following data to the Fund
within the time limits listed below (Table 3). In addition, the authorities will provide, no later
than the fourth week of each quarter, a summary of key macroeconomic policy decisions
taken during the previous quarter; a summary of regulatory changes in the area of banking
and financial sector, report any amendments to the Entity and state budgets within a week
after their government approval.
32.
Any revisions to past data previously reported to the Fund will be reported to the
Fund promptly, together with necessary explanation. All data will be provided in an
electronic form.
33.
All magnitudes subject to performance criteria or indicative targets will be reported in
millions of convertible marka.
34.
The Bosnia and Herzegovina authorities will supply the Fund with any additional
information that the Fund requests in connection with monitoring performance under the
program on a timely basis.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
2012 Article IV Consultation and Request for Stand-By Arrangement—Informational
Annex
Prepared by the European Department
September 12, 2012


Relations with the Fund: Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) has been a member of
the International Monetary Fund since 1992. BiH has not accepted the obligations
under Article VIII Sections 2(a), 3, and 4 and, therefore, avails itself of the
transitional arrangements under Article XIV. An upcoming MCM/LEG mission
will advise the authorities regarding BiH’s intentions to accept the Article VIII
obligations. Staff-level agreement on a two-year, SDR 338.2 million (200 percent
of quota) Stand-By Arrangement was reached on July 20, 2012.



Bank-Fund Collaboration: The Fund and World Bank BiH teams meet regularly
to consult on and coordinate the two institutions’ activities and plans. They have
identified seven areas of structural reform as macrocritical in light of their
importance for fiscal sustainability and financial sector stability. These include
social safety nets and rights-based benefits, public sector pay and wage bill
management, labor taxation, budget planning, fiscal reporting, tax administration,
and financial sector supervision and contingency planning.



Exchange rate regime: The currency of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the
convertible marka (KM), introduced on August 11, 1997. On September 5, 2002,
the State parliament approved an amendment to the CBBH law that changed the
peg of the KM from the DM to the Euro under a currency board arrangement. The
KM is pegged to the euro at KM 1 = 0.5113 euro.



Statistical Issues: Data provision is adequate for surveillance and for program
monitoring, although areas for improvement remain. Those pertain mainly to the
timeliness and comprehensiveness of fiscal data, and discrepancies between the
production and expenditure measures of GDP. Nonetheless, BiH authorities have
made concerted efforts to improve the quality of statistics in recent years,
leveraging on TA provided by the EU and the IMF.

VII. Safeguards Assessment
Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina
(CBBH) was subject to an assessment in the context of a potential successor for the 2002
commerce arrangement. The assessment was completed on January 24, 2005 and
recommendations were made to address weaknesses identified in the Bank's safeguards.

4
Based on the information received from the authorities, all the recommendations have been
implemented.
An update of safeguards assessment of the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina
(CBBH) was conducted in connection with the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) approved on
July 8, 2009. The update found that the CBBH has further improved its safeguards
framework since the 2005 assessment. Developments include the adoption of a bank wide
risk assessment methodology, strengthening of the internal audit function, and amending
the Audit Committee’s (AC) by-laws to limit the number of its members and assure their
independence from executive activities at the bank. The CBBH has also adopted a formal
policy for the appointment and rotation of external auditors. This update assessment found
that the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s (CBBH) financial reporting, control and
audit practices generally comply with international standards and best practices. However,
some aspects of the audit oversight mechanism should be strengthened.
VIII. Exchange Rate Arrangements
The currency of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the convertible marka (KM), introduced on
August 11, 1997. On September 5, 2002, the State parliament approved an amendment to
the CBBH law that changes the peg of the KM from the DM to the Euro under a currency
board arrangement. The KM is pegged to the euro at KM 1 = 0.5113 euro. Bosnia and
Herzegovina (BiH) has not accepted the obligations under Article VIII Sections 2(a), 3, and
4 and therefore avails itself of the transitional arrangements under Article XIV. BiH no
longer maintains restrictions under the transitional provisions of Art XIV. It maintains
restrictions on the transferability of balances and interest accrued on frozen foreigncurrency deposits, subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII. An upcoming
MCM/LEG mission will advise the authorities regarding BiH’s intentions to accept the
Article VIII obligations.
IX. FSAP
Two FSAP missions took place in December 2005 and March 2006, and an Aide Mémoire
was presented to the authorities. The FSAP assessed risks to financial stability and
weaknesses in banking supervision using a Basel Core Principles assessment. It also
considers financial sector development needs in the areas of insurance, access to finance,
the insolvency regime and corporate governance, drawing on a detailed assessment of the
OECD Principles of Good Corporate Governance. The FSSA was presented to the Board
along with the 2006 Article IV consultation (SM/06/335).

X. Last Article IV Consultation
The last Article IV consultation was concluded on October 15, 2010 (IMF Country Report
No. 10/348).

II. BANK-FUND COLLABORATION
1.
The Fund BiH team meets on a regular basis with the representatives of the World
Bank BiH team to consult on and coordinate the two institutions’ activities and plans.
2.
The Fund and Bank BiH teams share the view that economic recovery has been
weak in BiH, and the country faces substantial internal and external macroeconomic
challenges. While the crisis has reversed a long lasting trend of positive economic growth,
it has caused no major disturbances. The currency board arrangement and the whole
banking sector have weathered the crisis well. In 2012, BiH economy is facing stagnation
with significantly weakening external demand and stagnating domestic demand. Access to
foreign private capital (both FDI and credit) has been very limited and investment growth
has not resumed yet. National savings are inadequate to finance pre-crisis investment
levels. The reforms to improve the efficiency of the public sector and restore fiscal
sustainability (which are expected to increase public saving) have been launched, but have
yet to be implemented.
3.
Based on this shared assessment, the teams identified seven areas of structural
reform as macrocritical in light of their importance for fiscal sustainability and financial
sector stability.


Social safety nets and rights-based benefits. The social safety net is complex, with a
large number of overlapping non-contributory based cash transfer programs that are not
well-targeted and fail to reach some of the most vulnerable groups in society. This is
especially the case for the panoply of transfers directed at various veterans categories.
The authorities launched an ambitious reform agenda to overhaul the benefits system in
late 2009 and early 2010. However, implementation of legislated reforms aimed at
improving targeting of cash transfers has not started.



Public sector pay and wage bill management. In 2011, BiH spent more than
13 percent of GDP on public sector wages. The wage bill has grown significantly since
2006 (about 2 percentage points) and has been one of the main contributors to a
widening fiscal deficit. Furthermore, while significant improvements have been made
to reform very compressed salary scales in public administration, reduce the number of
non-wage benefits and increase transparency in line with good international practice,
there is still significant scope for improvement in this area.



Labor taxation. The tax wedge related to formal employment, particularly in the
Federation, is high (37.8% of gross wage1). Social contribution payments, which are

1

The tax wedge is defined as the share of income tax and social security contributions by employers and
employees over total labor costs.

8
higher than in the majority of OECD countries, increase the cost of labor, hinder
competitiveness, and contribute to informality. Reducing the rates of social contribution
through a combination of efficiency improvements in the health and pension systems
and substituting a share of financing with less distorting revenue sources is needed to
improve the competitiveness of the BiH economy, while reducing informality.


Budget planning. Accurate revenue and expenditure forecasts are needed to ensure
realistic budgets and avoid supplementary budgets and under-execution of the budget
that result from revenue underperformance or underestimation of expenditure.
Moreover, a medium-term fiscal framework would help to anchor fiscal policy around
the goal of public debt sustainability. There is an urgent need to strengthen mediumterm budgeting and improve the effectiveness of the Fiscal Council including via
ensuring accurate and timely fiscal reporting by all levels of government (see below).



Fiscal reporting. Progress in this area should help improve fiscal policy coordination,
fiscal planning, and performance monitoring. The multi-layer system of government
and lack of common reporting standards have hampered efforts to present a
consolidated and timely picture of government finances to date. The Fund program and
provision of technical assistance are expected to provide sufficient leverage for
renewed efforts on this front.



Tax administration. Improvements in tax administration should aim at better control,
improvements in cooperation as well as transparency across agencies and Entities, and
a broadening of the tax base. It is crucial to maintain indirect tax collection at BiH level
and maintain the single account of the Indirect Tax Authority (ITA). Equally important
is the maintenance of a cooperative work environment enabling fast solutions to
contentious issues. Improvements are also needed in formalizing the grey economy,
which has been undermining tax revenue collection while also placing an unequal
burden on the formal sector.



Financial sector. Stronger financial sector supervision and contingency planning
should help ensure that the authorities are able to monitor the health of the system and
respond appropriately to any emerging problems. Following substantial support for
strengthening the stress-testing capacity of the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina
(CBBH), further efforts are needed to strengthen the capacity of the Banking Agencies.
A framework for cooperation between the CBBH, the Finance Ministries, and other
agencies, along the lines recommended by the January 2009 IMF technical assistance
mission, has partially been put in place and the Standing Committee for Financial
Stability has been established. Nevertheless, additional banking sector contingency
planning for crisis preparedness, strengthening of banking supervision and bank stress
tests are needed as recommended by the May 2012 IMF technical assistance mission.

9
4.

The teams agreed on the following division of labor:



Social safety net and rights-based benefits. The Bank will continue to advise the
authorities and provide implementation support for measures to consolidate various
programs and improve targeting. The Social Safety Net and Employment Project,
approved by the World Bank Executive Board in February 2010, is financing technical
assistance and capacity building services related to the reforms of the social protection
system. The project will also continue to support active labor market programs for
active job seekers among vulnerable categories. In addition, the Bank is currently
preparing a new Public Expenditure Development Policy Loan (DPL) the approval of
which will depend on the readiness of BiH authorities to implement reforms related to
targeting of non-contributory cash transfers to the poor while reducing the fiscal deficit
via more effective, efficient and equitable social protection policies. The DPL would
also support the design of the pension reform strategy in the FBH and support further
improvements in the pension legislation in the RS.



Public sector wages. The Bank will continue to provide assistance to the authorities in
improving the wage bill management and public sector pay practices with the aim of
increasing transparency, improving the link between pay levels, job complexity, and
performance, and contributing to fiscal sustainability. The DPL aims to reform public
expenditures that have been the main driver of pro-cyclical fiscal policies, notably the
high wage bill and excessive and regressive social transfers.



Labor taxation. Over the medium term, the Bank will support the authorities in efforts
to reduce the burden of social contributions on formal employment and harmonizing
the bases for payment of income tax and social contributions between the two BiH
Entities with the aim of increasing competitiveness in the formal sector and
strengthening the single economic space across the BiH. To this end, future Bank
support will aim at lowering social contribution rates to encourage formal sector
employment and enhance competitiveness and private sector development while
indentifying sustainable and less distortionary financing of health care services



Budget planning. Both the Fund and the Bank will encourage the authorities to
implement realistic, predictable, and transparent budget procedures. The Fund and the
Bank will also continue advising the authorities to improve the medium-term budget
planning. To this end, the Fund and the Bank will continue urging the authorities to
strengthen the Fiscal Council’s operational framework by improving fiscal
methodology and multi-annual planning for the Global Framework, drafting proposals
for short-term and long-term macroeconomic projections, and implementing established
goals and criteria when adopting and executing the budget, and incorporating foreignfinanced projects. Medium-term fiscal planning in the Federation will have to address
substantial needs for capital investments in infrastructure.

10


Fiscal Reporting. The Fund will continue to advise the authorities and provide
technical assistance to improve fiscal reporting. The priority for the coming year is
putting in place a coherent system of fiscal reporting for all levels of government which
will permit quick and flexible consolidation. For FY 2012, technical assistance will
continue to be provided by the Center in Ljubljana through visits by a peripatetic PFM
advisor. The objective would be to set up processes for timely data reports by lower
levels of governments and for consolidation of source data into general government
accounts.



Tax Administration. The Fund has technical assistance in the area of tax
administration, including through a diagnostic mission in April 2011. This has been
followed by regular visits by a peripatetic advisor. A follow-up mission to assess
progress in various areas is scheduled for the Fall of 2012.



Financial sector. The Fund is actively engaged in providing technical assistance in the
area of stress testing of bank balance sheets. To this end, an MCM mission on stress
testing last visited the country in January 2012, providing assistance to the two Banking
Agencies. On the area of contingency planning and crisis preparedness, a follow-up
mission took place in May 2012. Finally, joint MCM/LEG TA could help put in place
recommendations for strengthening the bank resolution framework and the legal and
institutional frameworks for NPL resolution.

11
III. STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
While data are adequate for surveillance and program monitoring purposes, areas
for improvement still remain.
2.
Statistical functions spread across different levels of government. The Dayton
peace treaty, which ended the 1992–95 war, implicitly gave responsibility for statistical
functions to the two Entities (The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika
Srpska (RS)). In August 1998, the State created its own statistical institute, the Bosnia &
Herzegovina Agency for Statistics (BHAS), with a view to compiling country-wide
statistics in accordance with internationally-accepted methodologies, consolidating data
produced by the Entities’ Statistical Institutes, and acting as the primary coordinating
agency for contacts with international agencies. Significant technical assistance has been
provided in recent years, mainly by the European Union. An IFS country page has been in
existence since July 2001. A Fund resident statistical advisor was assigned to the Central
Bank of Bosnia & Herzegovina (CBBH) during May 1999–June 2004 to provide technical
assistance in the development of all areas of macroeconomic statistics. An STA resident
real sector statistical advisor was appointed in the period November 2005–November 2007,
and the same advisor has recently returned to Sarajevo in order to support the ongoing
efforts of statistics improvement. A mission to prepare the ROSC Data Module took place
in March 2007 and the report was published in February 2008.
3.
As the first step to prepare for BiH’s participation in the IMF’s General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS), a national coordinator will be appointed by end-September
2012.
A. Real Sector Statistics
4.
Efforts have been made in both Entities to improve real sector statistics. The
Federation and RS have both published nominal GDP estimates using the production
approach consistent with the 1993 SNA, since 1998 and 1999, respectively. Compilation of
the GDP by production approach for both entities and the country as a whole at constant
prices (at prices of previous year) started in 2006, with technical assistance from the IMF.
Expenditure-based GDP data at current and constant prices have been published for the
period 2004–11. However, discrepancies between the production and expenditure measures
of GDP are relatively high and more work is needed to reconcile these estimates. The RS
started publishing volume indices of quarterly GDP, starting in 2009 Q3, but revisions are
frequent and sizeable.
5.
A consumer price index (CPI), based on internationally-recommended practices,
has been implemented with the technical and financial support of the Italian government.
This CPI was released in 2007, and consistent series are available monthly countrywide
and for each entity, with the series starting in January 2005. The CPI weights are derived
from the household budget survey, which has been conducted since 2004. Also, producer

12
price indices (PPI) are now available for both Entities. Industrial production indices are
prepared in each Entity. The Industrial Production index at the country level has been made
available in 2009 with historical time series going back till 2006. Both the industrial
production index and the producer price index are compiled and disseminated at the entity
and the country level based on harmonized methodology. Whereas the statistical institutes
of both Entities compile data on employment, unemployment, and wages based on
questionable methodologies, the annual Labor Force Survey follows international
methodological standards and provides data on employment, unemployment, population
and labor force for the country and the entities since 2006.
B. External Sector Statistics
6.
Despite resource constraints, continuing improvements have been made to the
quality of the balance of payments data, particularly in terms of services and financial
transactions. Concepts and definitions follow international standards, as stated in the fifth
edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5), including the residence concept.
Nevertheless, many shortcomings remain. Some of these shortcomings arise from intrinsic
measurement difficulties, such as the frequent small transactions and workers’ remittances.
As a result, a degree of uncertainty remains about several important components of the
balance of payments, where source data are inadequate due to the lack of comprehensive
surveys on services and remittances and to the difficulty of recording the large number of
small cash transactions. The authorities are currently in the process of adopting the sixth
edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM6).
7.
Trade data are published by the BHAS and balance of payments statistics by the
CBBH. Merchandise trade is recorded using the Automated System for Customs Data
processing system. The customs administration for the whole country has been reorganized,
and a trade classification system introduced. BHAS now produces export and import data
from customs records, but needs to produce the data on a general trade basis and not on a
special trade basis. Trade data may also be subject to incomplete coverage and underinvoicing. The data coverage remains poor in areas of foreign grants, workers’ remittances,
income received by residents working for international organizations in the country,
spending by their nonresident staff, informal trade, and changes in foreign currency cash
holdings. All foreign grants, loans, loan repayments, and interest payments for which the
state government has assumed responsibility, are consistent with the balance of payments
data, as the same source data are used for the compilation of GFS and the balance of
payments. However, the balance of payments data also include an estimate of foreignfinanced projects which are currently partly excluded from GFS.1 Data are consistent with
monetary statistics.

1

GFS includes foreign-financed projects funded by loans, excludes only the grant components.

13
C. Government Finance Statistics
8.
The CBBH compiles government finance statistics (GFS) in accordance with the
definitions and concepts of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001. The
periodicity and timeliness of data on government operations and quarterly consolidated
central government operations meet or exceed GDDS recommendations. While the
institutional coverage of the GFS is broadly consistent with international guidelines, its
scope does not cover all economic stocks (balance sheet data) and flows (cash flow data).
To address this issue and with help of the IMF TA, the CBBH plans to have a first initial
balance sheet by mid-2013. In addition, the GFS does not include transactions related to
projects directly financed by international donors, and quarterly statistics exclude all
transactions in financial assets and liabilities due to incomplete quarterly source data.
Because accrual accounting has not yet been fully introduced in all government institutions,
transactions are recorded on a mixed accrual/cash basis.2 External government debt data are
published quarterly, and data on domestic debt were published for the first time in the
annual Global Fiscal Framework document in 2007. GFS data are broadly consistent with
the balance of payments, but cannot be reconciled with monetary statistics, due to
differences in sectorization and data gaps, and are not reconciled with national accounts
data.
9.
The authorities have been making concerted effort to improve the quality of the
GFS data. They established a coordinating group, including representatives of the central
bank and ministries of finance of the two Entities and the state institutions, to provide data
for monitoring of the 2009 Stand-By Arrangement. With the help of a peripatetic PFM
advisor, the State, Federation and Republika Srpska implemented bridge tables from the
existing chart of accounts to formats compatible with GFS 2001 and ESA 95 to improve
the quality of consolidated general government data. As a result of these efforts a
harmonized reporting template has been introduced for reporting by all governments.
However, the long delays in reporting by lower levels of government in the Federation
remain.

Standardized Report Forms developed by STA that embody the methodology of the
Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. The CBBH already collects data using the
standardized report forms 1SR (Central bank), 2SR (commercial banks), and 4SR (Other

financial institutions). Furthermore, the CBBH expanded the coverage of the weighted
average interest rates from four indicators to 26 indicators (14 active interest rates and 12
passive interest rates with breakdown by maturity, currency, and sectors). Finally, the
CBBH extended the coverage of its annual financial sector statistics to encompass
approximately 120 financial institutions (investment funds, insurance companies,
microcredit institutions, leasing companies, brokerage houses, and stock exchanges).

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Bosnia and Herzegovina
On September 26, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Bosnia and Herzegovina.1
Background
Bosnia and Herzegovina’s (BiH) growth in the years leading to the global financial crisis
increasingly relied on domestic demand expansion, which was fuelled by a credit boom
financed from abroad. This produced strong output growth amid a benign external environment
and ample bank financing. However, the associated vulnerabilities crystallized in the 2009 crisis
when capital inflows came to a stop. Against this backdrop, the currency board arrangement,
fiscal tightening, and financial support under the 2009 Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) helped
safeguard macroeconomic stability, but were not enough to propel the economy forward.
Structural impediments continue to hamper economic performance—the large government
crowds out the private sector and the business environment discourages investment and
business expansion, leading to high unemployment and low labor force participation.
Following the 2009 recession, BiH’s economy grew at a moderate pace in 2010–11. However,
the pickup in economic activity did not spread from export-oriented industries to the wider
economy and has lost momentum in recent months. Latest high frequency indicators point to a

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

marked slowdown of activity amid falling external demand. Meanwhile, reflecting the softness of
domestic demand, core inflation remains subdued (below 1 percent) and the current account
deficit has started to narrow. Fiscal restraint has continued—with the overall fiscal deficit in
2010–11 having stayed within the targets of the 2009 SBA—but the composition of expenditure
has not improved, as spending on public wages and war-related benefits remains high. The
banking sector has remained broadly stable despite an elevated level of non-performing loans.
The authorities have requested IMF’s financial assistance in support of their program. The
program aims at countering the effects of the worsening external environment and addressing
domestic structural weaknesses. The authorities’ agenda encompasses a four-pronged
approach. The first priority is to improve national policy coordination, including by strengthening
the role of the Fiscal Council. The second priority is to continue fiscal consolidation
accompanied by structural fiscal reforms to safeguard medium-term fiscal sustainability. The
third priority is to enhance the authorities’ crisis preparedness and contingency planning to
safeguard the currency board and improve the resilience of the financial sector. Finally, the
authorities’ program is expected to act as a catalyst for other reforms to create an environment
conducive for private sector development. It will be supported by a Stand-By Arrangement with
the IMF, which was also approved by the Executive Board on September 26, 2012.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that the recovery that started in 2010 has been losing momentum,
and challenging external and internal environments are threatening the economic outlook.
Against this background, Directors supported the authorities’ economic program, which focuses
on maintaining fiscal discipline, safeguarding the soundness of the financial sector, and
intensifying reforms to improve the business and investment environment.
Directors emphasized that better policy coordination is key to macroeconomic stability. They
welcomed the recent steps to enhance cooperation within the Fiscal Council and called for
further efforts to strengthen the council’s operational framework.
Directors agreed that continued fiscal adjustment, including measures to meet the program’s
fiscal targets, is necessary to ensure fiscal sustainability and support the currency board
arrangement. They welcomed the authorities’ commitment to expenditure restraint and the
measures to contain the 2012 general government deficit, which strike an appropriate balance
between cyclical considerations and medium-term policy requirements.
Directors underscored that medium-term fiscal consolidation should be accompanied by a
rationalization of recurrent spending with a view to creating space for capital expenditure and
protecting the poorest. They welcomed the authorities’ commitment to rein in the wage bill,
overhaul the pension system, and step up reforms of rights-based benefits and transfers.
Broadening the tax base should also be an important policy objective.

Directors commended the authorities for prudent financial policies which have helped the
financial system weather the global financial crisis well. In this regard, they supported recent
efforts to better monitor financial stability, and improve crisis preparedness and resolution.
Directors urged the authorities to further strengthen cooperation between the central bank and
the banking agencies as well as cross-border collaboration with other bank supervisors. Noting
that non-performing loans remain pervasive, they encouraged the authorities to closely monitor
credit quality and spillover risks from regional developments.
Directors emphasized that accelerating the pace of structural reforms is critical for unlocking the
economy’s potential. Reforms to improve the business environment and the labor market would
help boost private sector activity and the medium-term prospects for growth. Directors also
highlighted the importance of improving data quality.
Directors noted the risks to the program from a further deterioration in the external environment
and the challenging political situation. They welcomed the authorities’ strong commitment to the
program’s objectives and their willingness to take additional measures if necessary.

IMF Executive Board Approves €405.3 million Stand-By Arrangement for
Bosnia and Herzegovina
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a 24-month
SDR 338.2 million (about €405.3 million or about US$ 520.6 million) Stand-By
Arrangement (SBA) for Bosnia and Herzegovina in support of the government’s economic
program for 2012–14. The program aims at countering the effects of the worsening external
environment and addressing domestic structural weaknesses. The Board’s decision enables
the initial disbursement of SDR 50.73 million (about €60.8 million or US$78.1 million), with
the remaining amount to be phased in over the duration of the arrangement, subject to
successful completion of quarterly reviews.
The Executive Board also completed today the 2012 Article IV Consultation with Bosnia and
Herzegovina, which discusses economic policies from a medium-term perspective. The
Article IV Consultation usually occurs on an annual or biannual cycle for all IMF member
countries, and is distinct from the approval of the SBA.
Following the Executive Board discussion on Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ms. Nemat Shafik,
Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair, said:
“In recent months, Bosnia and Herzegovina’s economic recovery has been losing momentum
and risks to the outlook have tilted to the downside. In this context, the authorities’
comprehensive economic program for the period ahead is timely and welcome.
“Better policy coordination and cooperation are key to economic success. To this end, further
strengthening the Fiscal Council’s operational framework and efforts to make it the focal
point for fiscal policy coordination would be essential.
“The authorities’ commitment to continued fiscal prudence is welcome. The measures to
contain the 2012 general government deficit strike an appropriate balance between cyclical
and longer-term fiscal considerations. Over the medium term, lasting improvements to the
fiscal position can be achieved by reining in the wage bill, overhauling the pension system,

2

and stepping up reforms of rights-based benefits and transfers. Freed-up budgetary resources
would help finance much-needed infrastructure investment, which along with reforms to
improve the business environment, will foster private sector activity and raise the country’s
growth potential.
“Prudent financial sector policies have helped the financial system weather the global
financial crisis well. Nevertheless, further enhancing the resilience of the financial sector
calls for better cooperation between the central bank and the banking agencies as well as
greater collaboration with supervisors abroad. With nonperforming loans trending up,
continued close monitoring of credit quality and spillover risks from regional developments
will be needed.”
ANNEX
Recent Economic Developments
Bosnia and Herzegovina’s past economic growth relied increasingly on domestic demand as
the key driver. Private sector demand expansion was fuelled by a credit boom financed from
abroad. This produced strong output growth amid a benign external environment and ample
bank financing. However, the associated vulnerabilities became clear in the 2009 crisis when
capital inflows came to a stop. Against this backdrop, the currency board arrangement, fiscal
tightening, and financial support under the IMF’s previous SBA in 2009 helped safeguard
macroeconomic stability.
The slow post-2009 economic recovery is losing momentum. Following the 2009 recession,
the economy grew at a moderate pace in 2010–11. However, the pickup in economic activity
did not spread from export-oriented industries to the wider economy. Domestic demand has
been held back by stagnant wages and employment, and slow credit growth. Following steep
declines in 2009–10, domestic investment has recovered some ground. Latest indicators point
to a marked slowdown of economic activity amid falling external demand. Headline inflation
has declined despite high world oil and food prices, and increases in utility prices and
tobacco excises, while core inflation has remained below 1 percent, reflecting the softness of
domestic demand. The current account deficit has started to narrow and official foreign
exchange reserves have been volatile in recent months. Fiscal consolidation has continued,
but the composition of expenditure has not improved. The banking system has remained
relatively stable.
Program Summary
The authorities, cognizant of the risks emanating from the present uncertain global economic
environment, have put together an economic program to create conditions for a sustained
recovery.

3

The authorities’ economic program has four main objectives. First, it aims at improving
national policy coordination, including by strengthening the role of the Fiscal Council.
Second, fiscal consolidation is being accompanied by structural fiscal reforms to safeguard
medium-term fiscal sustainability. Third, further steps to enhance the authorities’ crisis
preparedness and contingency planning will safeguard the currency board and improve the
resilience of the financial sector. Finally, the arrangement is expected to act as a catalyst for
other reforms to create an environment conducive for private sector development.
Bosnia and Herzegovina joined the IMF on December 14, 1992, and its quota is
SDR 169.10 million (about €202.7 million or US$260.3 million).

Statement by Mr. Yakusha and Mr. Friedman on Bosnia and Herzegovina
September 26, 2012
1.

Background

The economy of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) is expected to stagnate in 2012, as the fragile
and tepid recovery in 2011 has lost momentum. BiH is highly exposed to the European
economies through trade, remittances and financial linkages. The deterioration in external
conditions, mainly lower activity in BiH’s main European trading partners, resulted in lower
exports, national income and private consumption.
The situation was further complicated by the political deadlock following the 2010 elections,
which lingered until February 2012, and resulted in a pause in the necessary process of
structural reforms. With a new government in place and in order to reverse these negative
developments, the authorities of BiH have prepared an adjustment plan, which is described in
the Letter of Intent, and request that this plan be supported by a Stand-By Arrangement with
the Fund. The policies as described in the Letter of Intent provide a solid framework for
tackling the major structural weaknesses of the economy. Fund support can provide an
anchor to, and increase the credibility of the program and contribute to macroeconomic and
financial stability.
2.

Macroeconomic adjustment program

The program described in the Letter of Intent is designed to facilitate a balanced, gradual
fiscal consolidation process that will put public finance on a sustainable footing. The target
for the 2012 budget deficit is now set at 3 percent of GDP. Further consolidation in 2013 is
expected to lead to a substantial reduction in public debt by the end of that year to about the
indicative level of 40 percent.
In May 2012, shortly after it had been established in February, the new state government
approved a restrictive, responsible budget that included substantial savings, including
nominal wage and allowance cuts. A full-year effect, on top of an employment freeze, will
pave the way for further consolidation in 2013.
In September 2012, the entities of BiH, the Federation of BiH and Republika Srpska,
legislated rebalanced budgets that include savings measures as detailed in the Letter of Intent,
which amounted to 0.5 percent of GDP. Rebalancing took place late in the fiscal year, after
most of the budget was executed and commitments were made. These rebalanced budgets are
based on updated, more realistic revenue forecasts.
In addition to the steps above, the fiscal council has adopted a global fiscal framework for the
period 2013-2015, which will support the preparation of the yearly budgets and contribute to
stability. Next year’s budgets will be prepared in order to achieve a 2.5 percent deficit target.
Equally important, consolidation will be done through a reduction in current expenditure and

2
not through reduction in capital expenditure. An entitlements reform is planned, in areas
where it has not been done, despite the strong resistance by interest groups.
3.

Structural Reforms and Financial Stability

The BiH economy is not utilizing its full potential. The labor market is not competitive
enough, and lacks dynamism. The bulk of employees are employed by the public sector.
A generous, non-targeted entitlements system does not sufficiently incentivize labor force
participation. There are still problems with the ease of doing business and incentives for
investment. The authorities are well aware of the necessity to make progress on these fronts.
With its low level of output per-capita relative to its peers, and the substantial slack in the
labor market, BiH growth potential in the medium run can be even higher than the 4 percent
rate estimated by staff. Financial stability is key to achieving this growth potential.
The reform agenda, both in the Federation of BiH and in Republika Srpska, includes
ambitious goals. These reforms will work to better target war benefits by expediting
eligibility audits, which is a very contentious issue; to improve the monitoring and ability to
control expenditures in lower-level governments; to rationalize the pension systems where it
has not been done yet; and to improve the business environment.
A number of important steps were made in recent years in order to ensure financial stability
and to enhance crisis preparedness. The authorities plan to further strengthen financial
stability by conducting stress tests of individual banks, shifting gradually toward risk-based
supervision and implementation of the Basel principles, creating an environment conducive
to NPL resolution, improving coordination with Austrian and Italian supervisors by signing
MOU’s, and strengthening the role of the Deposit Insurance Agency.
4.

National Coordination

Apart from the policy measures, the authorities are committed to strengthening policy
coordination, which is a challenge in any federal or decentralized system, but even more so
in BiH. At the outset, it is important to note that, for the first time, all levels of government
accepted to share the burden of adjustment, as well as to take future steps that will ensure the
program’s success.
It is worth mentioning that the process of program negotiations contributed to an
improvement in intergovernmental fiscal policy coordination through the Fiscal council of
BiH. A long standing revenue dispute between the entities on the distribution of indirect tax
revenues was resolved, and a mechanism to avoid such a dispute in the future will be put in
place. The authorities are amending the legislation in order to enhance data quality and data
sharing among government agencies, and are committed to improving coordination in order
to take part in the IMF’s General Data Dissemination System. Most importantly, the
authorities are closing a legal lacuna that resulted in temporary interruptions to servicing
foreign debt in early 2012.

3
5.

Fund support

The authorities are of the opinion that the previous SBA, which expired in July 2012,
contributed to economic development and stability, although it was implemented only
partially. The arrangement increased the credibility of the currency board arrangement, an
important backbone of macroeconomic stability; it enhanced the national coordination and
decision making processes; and it also served as a catalyst for the implementation of
economic reforms.
Although the program reviews could not take place after the 2010 elections, fiscal
responsibility was maintained since then. This demonstrates the self-discipline of the BiH
central government as well as of the entities of BiH, notwithstanding political difficulties and
uncertainty.
The authorities see Fund support as a crucial part of their adjustment plan. They are looking
forward to cooperating with the Fund and are committed to the success of the proposed
program, which strikes a realistic and reasonable balance between optimal and feasible
economic policies.
Finally, the authorities would like to express sincere gratitude to the IMF staff, headed by
Mr. Christou, for the useful and productive discussions as well as for the excellent report.
