EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The 2008 Article IV consultation discussions took place against the backdrop of rapidly
deteriorating external conditions, with the global financial crisis adversely affecting
Cambodia’s economy. Growth is slowing, liquidity is tightening, and, as a result, banks’
balance sheets are coming under strain. Competitiveness has eroded given the recent sharp real
appreciation of the Cambodian riel and U.S. dollar. On the other hand, inflation pressures are
easing as commodity prices fall and demand pressures moderate. However, external
vulnerability, which had declined significantly in recent years, could be rising given the
near-term outlook. Therefore, discussions focused on sound policy responses to better manage
emerging risks and ensure stable domestic conditions.
The immediate risks to Cambodia arise from liquidity shortages among banks owing to a
sharp slowing in external inflows and deposit growth. Over the past few years, these
inflows have fueled rapid credit expansion, which has bolstered economic activity and
contributed to a boom in the property sector. As conditions tighten, bank lending has
moderated, construction activity has slowed, and property prices—after reaching historic
peaks—appear to be declining. Some banks, including several large ones, could face a large
deterioration in credit quality and a need for recapitalization, depending on the magnitude of
the current slowdown and effectiveness of the policy response. Others have entered Cambodia
recently with limited banking experience or large exposure to the property sector, making
them especially vulnerable to external conditions and an economic slowdown.
On its part, the Royal Government of Cambodia has done a commendable job in recent
years in pursing stabilization efforts through a sound fiscal stance. As a result, the overall
budget deficit has remained low, with revenue rising rapidly and expenditure appropriately
restrained. To the government’s credit, national elections in mid-2008, which were largely
peaceful, and ongoing border tensions with Thailand have not exerted extraordinary pressures
on the budget so far. At the same time, the lack of an operational framework and high degree
of financial dollarization continue to constrain the National Bank of Cambodia’s ability to
manage domestic liquidity conditions. Combined with limited supervisory oversight and
enforcement, recent conditions have contributed to heightened risks among banks.
Going forward, the authorities agreed that credible policy actions are needed to maintain
macroeconomic stability, improve bank soundness, and strengthen external
competitiveness. Staff’s main recommendations build on those made during earlier
consultations, as well as address the near-term challenges posed by external conditions and
policy weaknesses—notably on monetary operations and banking supervision. The authorities
will need to implement decisive measures to manage risks faced by banks and reduce
vulnerabilities to further shocks that could arise given Cambodia’s openness and dependence
on inflows.

4
I. MACROECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Cambodia’s exceptional growth performance the past five years is coming under
increasing strain from the global financial crisis and weakening external demand
(Box 1). The economy has been particularly vulnerable to recent shocks given its narrow
production base, concentration of exports by product and destination, and dependence on
external inflows. As a result, economic activity is slowing in most sectors and liquidity
conditions are tightening as funding sources dry up. Rapid credit expansion since 2007
combined with long-standing weaknesses in bank oversight and now falling property prices
have heightened credit and solvency risk among a number of banks, including a few
systemically important ones.
2.

Core macroeconomic developments are summarized as follows:

•

Real GDP growth is projected at
6½ percent in 2008, compared to
10¼ percent in 2007 (Table 1).
Garment exports and tourism
activity moderated as external
demand weakened. Tourism has
also been adversely affected by
border tensions that emerged
between Cambodia and Thailand
in mid-2008. Agricultural growth
is expected to be below-trend due
to adverse weather. New
construction activity—strong in
the first half of the year—
faltered, as foreign direct
investment (FDI) slowed and
credit growth decelerated.

• Construction approvals were up 38 percent in
the first nine months of 2008, compared to
100 percent in the same period last year. Property
prices in and around Phnom Penh are reportedly
down as much as 25 percent from historic highs
in mid-2008, after rising 50–100 percent in the
preceding year. Since the global financial crisis
hit, a few major urban projects have been scaled
back or cancelled outright, as foreign investors
(mainly from Korea) reassess their commitments
in the face of tighter funding conditions abroad
and weaker near-term prospects in Cambodia.

(Seasonally adjusted, 3-month moving average)

• Tourist arrivals are also slowing given
external conditions, with rising costs and
regional instability also factors. Growth was
3 percent (y/y) in the third quarter of 2008,
compared to 17 percent in the same quarter last
year. As a further indicator, ticket sales at Angkor
Wat were up only ½ percent in the first eight
months of 2008, compared to 36 percent for the
same period in 2007. With the peak travel season
now upon Cambodia, hotel operators are
reporting a significant drop in forward bookings
for this period compared to the previous year. A
prolonged downturn could have serious fiscal
implications, given the sector’s contribution to
domestic revenues, in particular the VAT.

Cambodia: Garment Exports and U.S. Retail Sales
Growth, 2006–08

Jan-07

• On the real side, garment export growth has
fallen sharply in Cambodia, consistent with
weak retail sales in the United States (around
three-quarters of the market). Garment sector
employment (the largest source of formal
employment) is also declining, down 6 percent
(y/y) for the year ending July 2008, or to 330,000
workers. Near-term prospects for the sector are
poor from both an output and employment
perspective, because of demand concentration in
the U.S. and competition abroad (see Box 4).

Sources: Data provided by the Cambodian authorities; and IMF staff estimates.

• However, lower commodity prices have helped bring down inflation and temper the rise in the

current account deficit. Since the May 2008 peak, food and fuel prices are responsible for around
80 percent of the decline in headline inflation. In the event world oil prices had stayed at mid-year levels,
the oil import bill for Cambodia would likely be around US$210 million (2 percent of GDP) higher in
2008 than currently projected.

12 percent in 2008 compared to
about 3½ percent in 2007
(Table 2). Notwithstanding recent
developments, the overall external
position for 2008 should improve
on strong official inflows as well
as private inflows earlier in the
year, with gross official reserves
projected at US$2.0 billion
(3.5 months of prospective
imports) by year-end, compared
to US$1.6 billion (2.5 months) at
end-2007.

The fiscal stance continued to
underpin the government’s
stabilization efforts in 2008. The overall
deficit is expected at around 1¾ percent
of GDP, against an official target of
4¼ percent and an outturn of around
3 percent in 2007 (Table 3). Revenue
continues to rise (including as a share of
GDP), owing to a buoyant domestic
economy and improved tax and customs
administration, with a pilot of the
ASYCUDA system launched and ad hoc
tariff exemptions reduced. Current
expenditure has been in line with planned
allocations, including a mid-year fiscal
package.1 Capital expenditure is expected
to be slightly higher than budgeted, but
precise estimates of actual spending are
hampered by weaknesses in recording
payment orders and slow progress in
budget integration.

Monetary conditions have tightened as external inflows slow and policy measures
take hold. Broad money growth is expected to decline from 63 percent at end-2007 to around
5 percent by end-2008 (Table 4). In response to excessively loose conditions in the first half of

As noted, the banking system is
under increasing strain. The global
financial crisis has exposed vulnerabilities
among Cambodia’s banks and is beginning
to affect their financial soundness (Box 2
and Table 5). Liquidity shortages have
arisen at some banks. In response, banks
have been raising deposit rates, drawing
excess reserves and, in few cases,
borrowing from abroad (mainly from parent
institutions). 3 At the same time, loan rates
have been sticky, suggesting bank spreads
are narrowing and profits may be squeezed
going forward. The number of banks has
also increased rapidly during the past two
years—by nearly 50 percent to 28 licensed
institutions in late 2008, putting added
pressure on the NBC’s supervisory
capacity.

Jan-05

2008, the National Bank of Cambodia
(NBC) doubled the reserve requirement on
foreign currency deposits (FCDs) to 16
percent in June.2 It also placed caps on
banks’ lending to the real estate sector.
Credit growth, which exceeded
100 percent (y/y) in mid-2008, is expected
to fall to around 60 percent by year-end.
Despite recent global developments, the
riel has remained generally stable against
the U.S. dollar since mid-year. Lacking an
effective interbank market, the NBC
continued to use foreign exchange market
intervention to inject riel liquidity
necessary to meet transaction demand, with
the effect of limiting riel strengthening.

For riel deposits, the reserve requirement was kept at 8 percent, but few banks hold significant amounts.

As of end-October 2008, banks’ excess reserves were 94 percent of required reserves, but down from
227 percent at end-June 2008, immediately following the latest hike in the reserve requirement on FCDs.

Box 2. Cambodia: Global Volatility and Bank Vulnerabilities
The global financial crisis has increased risks and exposed weaknesses in Cambodia’s highly dollarized
banking system. Liquidity risk is an upfront concern, compounded by a potentially volatile deposit base. Bank
deposit growth (resident and nonresident) has slowed significantly in recent months, turning negative (month-onmonth) since September 2008. Large withdrawals have reportedly been made by firms concentrated in the
property sector, notably at Korean-owned banks. Combined with rapid credit growth, the loan-to-deposit ratio for
commercial and specialized banks breached 100 percent for the first time in October 2008—up from 68 percent
one year before. Currently, the nine largest banks control nearly 90 percent of deposits, with six having an
average level of deposits in excess of US$10,000. Credit risk may also be increasing as growth slows and
property prices decline. Asset quality at some banks has been compromised by poor risk management and weak
internal controls. Loan delinquencies appear on the rise, in particular in construction and real estate, and loan
recoveries may face difficulties owing to a weak legal system and poor collateral quality. New banks with loans
concentrated in the property sector and large banks with weak capital bases are especially vulnerable.
Financial soundness indicators (FSIs) show that banks remain well capitalized, hold sizable liquid assets,
and have low nonperforming loans (NPLs), but the picture could be misleading (Table 5). First, rapid credit
growth since 2007 may have masked emerging NPL problems. Second, banks’ compliance with prudential
regulations remains weak. Mid-year audits by the National Bank of Cambodia revealed NPLs (as a share of loans)
higher by two percentage points than previously reported by banks. Third, the FSIs show a move toward more
risky lending activities, as suggested by the sharp increase in large exposures in 2008, partly related to real estate,
and a continuing rise in consumer loans, mainly mortgage lending. Regarding liquidity, the decline in the liquid
asset ratio net of short-term liabilities in 2008 is partly due to the increasing reliance on short-term external
financing, mainly by foreign banks from their overseas parents, in light of tighter liquidity conditions.
Sensitivity analysis performed on the nine largest banks reveals the following:
•

Credit risk: Different assumptions were used for the quality of the banks’ loan portfolio, with higher NPLs
assumed for real estate and textile sector loans, followed by new loans (see table below). In the most benign
scenario (1), average NPLs would increase by about 4 percentage points to 6.5 percent, bringing the
risk-weighted capital-asset ratio (RWKA) below the regulatory minimum of 15 percent for four banks. In the
most extreme scenario (3)—with average NPLs increasing to 13 percent—six banks fall below the RWKA
required minimum, with the capital deficiency equivalent to 1.2 percent of GDP.

Liquidity risk: Different scenarios for a decline in deposits bring the average liquid asset to deposit ratios (LAD)
to between 38–45 percent. However, a deposit reduction by 20 percent (Scenario 2) would take the LAD below
15 percent for a few banks (i.e. below required reserves). At a reduction by 25 percent, four banks would see their
LAD decline below 20 percent, extremely low for a financial system lacking liquidity instruments and central
bank facilities.
Risks may compound if the global financial environment deteriorates further. Deposit growth could slow
more. Banks’ access to external financing could also become restrictive, with foreign parents facing their own
financial strain. In the event, banks in Cambodia might be unable or reluctant to renew credit lines, which could
affect borrowers’ capacity to repay.

II. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
6.
The near-term outlook for Cambodia points to a further slowing in economic
activity in 2009, as the impact of negative external shocks becomes more pronounced.
•

Growth is projected at 4.8 percent in 2009. While agricultural output is expected to
pick up, garments and tourism would act as a significant drag given weak external
conditions. Real estate and construction activity is expected to decelerate further, as
investment becomes more constrained by inflows and credit.

•

Inflation should continue to fall, based on the IMF’s latest commodity price
outlook and moderating demand pressures. Headline inflation is projected to
decline to around 7½ percent (y/y) by end-2009. However, the lagged effects of high
inflation in 2008 could still yield upward wage pressures.

•

The current account deficit is expected to decline to around 7 percent of GDP in
2009, but the overall external position will likely deteriorate. Factors that drove the
deficit higher in 2008 are expected to reverse and more than offset a sharp drop in
export growth. Official inflows should remain strong, but FDI and other private
inflows are expected to decline, likely resulting in a moderate deterioration in the
overall external position in 2009. Based on this outlook, gross official reserves would
fall to around US$1.9 billion (3.1 months of imports) by end-2009.

The balance of risks is clearly to the downside, because of uncertainty about the
length and depth of the global recession and its impact on trade and capital flows. Adding to
pressures is a recent loss in competitiveness stemming from high domestic inflation coupled
with U.S. dollar strength vis-à-vis most major currencies, leading to a sizable real
appreciation. In the event of a sharper pullback in external demand or reversal in foreign
inflows, with high dollarization, Cambodia could experience a pronounced liquidity
contraction and possible large reserve loss, with limited policy options available to cushion the
adjustment. A risk scenario such as this would put an even tighter squeeze on private credit
availability, increase risks in the banking system, and raise external vulnerability.

10
8.
Medium-term prospects depend on maintaining macroeconomic and financial
stability, improving governance and infrastructure, and taking other actions to
strengthen competitiveness. Under the current baseline, growth is projected to rise gradually
to 7–7½ percent a year (Table 6), driven by FDI-promoted export opportunities, broader
tourism development, and higher agricultural yields—each critical to sustained growth and
poverty reduction, including meeting the Millennium Development Goals (Table 7).4 The
current account deficit would narrow to 5–6 percent of GDP with further export
diversification, even accounting for large investment-related imports. Under this scenario, the
reserve cover would settle around 2½–3 months of imports. Underpinning stabilization efforts
would be modest fiscal consolidation over the medium term, with the overall budget deficit
narrowing to less than 2 percent of GDP by 2012.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
9.
Policy discussions centered on formulating effective responses to the sharp global
slowdown. Given recent developments, the policy focus has shifted quickly away from
dealing with excessive inflation pressures to preventing a sharp economic downturn. The
authorities recognized that sudden and rapid change in underlying macroeconomic and
financial conditions required careful policy considerations, in particular to manage the impact
of a weakening economy and external inflows on the banking sector. Staff urged quick and
decisive action on all fronts to contain the impact of the global crisis through moderate fiscal
easing, improved liquidity management, and measures to protect the banking system. The
authorities generally concurred with these priorities.
A. Fiscal Policy
10.
In view of the near-team outlook, a countercyclical easing of fiscal policy is being
targeted in 2009. The authorities proposed a preliminary 2009 budget with an overall budget
deficit of 4¼ percent of GDP. Staff indicated a deficit of around 3¼ percent of GDP in 2009
would provide an adequate fiscal impulse without undermining stabilization efforts (Box 3).
The main difference is the revenue outlook. The authorities argued that revenue would decline
more sharply (as a share of GDP) than staff envisaged, due mainly to lower expected
automobile imports. Staff noted that even taking into account expected weaknesses in import
growth and corporate profits, revenue would only be expected to decline by around ½ percent
of GDP, absent any new measures. However, staff recognized that in the event of a sharperthan-expected growth slowdown, scope could remain for even further easing, in the form of

select (temporary) tax relief and spending aimed at protecting the most vulnerable groups. In
this case, caution was urged, taking into account limited implementation capacity, with a view
to avoiding any serious recourse to domestic financing or weakening in the external position.5
Box 3. Cambodia: 2009 Budget—Fiscal Impulse1

The 2009 budget yields a fiscal impulse of
2¼ percentage point of GDP compared to the
projected outturn for 2008.2 The staff’s 2009
outlook is also expansionary, but less so than the
draft budget.

Cambodia’s 2009 draft budget is significantly
more expansionary than recent outturns. This
was also true for the 2008 budget, but the actual
outturn is likely to be contractionary (consistent
with the authorities’ policy response to domestic
inflation pressures).

projections for 2009, the stimulus effect would
come from revenue and expenditure. For the
budget, the revenue impulse is more pronounced, mainly because of lower expected trade tax collections. Staff
projections are already conservative here, with trade taxes as a share of retained imports expected to remain
constant in 2009 despite further expected administrative improvements (imports exclude those for garment
production and changes in oil prices—the latter due to the use of fixed reference prices on petroleum taxation). On
the other hand, staff projections yield a slightly larger expenditure impulse than the 2009 budget, due mostly to
higher capital spending coming from recently announced loans from China, partially offset by lower recurrent
spending.

Cyclical components were extracted using trend GDP (calculated by the HP filter with a smoothing parameter of 6.25).

The government issues no securities. Thus, any domestic financing would come as a reduction in deposits held
in the banking system. As of end-October 2008, these deposits were equivalent to around 6½ percent of GDP.

12
11.
Main policy recommendations focused on improving revenue performance, ensuring
proper spending allocation, and strengthening public financial management (PFM).
•

On revenue, staff argued that as conditions improve, new revenue measures should be
considered, in keeping with the government’s medium-term revenue strategy.
Additional revenue could come from a gradual rise in the reference price for petroleum
taxation (unchanged since 2004), select increases in excises (mainly beer and
cigarettes), and a broadening of the VAT base, including covering utilities—all in
keeping with previous recommendations to improve tax efficiency. The authorities
indicated tax increases, in particular on petroleum, remained politically sensitive, but
that they planned to expand the VAT base in 2009 to cover electricity in line with their
medium-term revenue strategy, which staff welcomed. Staff also continued to urge
adoption of transparent fiscal regime for extractive industries, in the context of
amending the Law on Taxation, which the authorities broadly agreed.

•

On expenditure, staff noted that the large budgeted increase in nonwage recurrent
spending should be oriented toward pro-poor social outlays (including locally-financed
capital expenditure) to mitigate the impact of the projected growth slowdown.6 The
authorities mostly agreed, but explained the final budget might need to accommodate
higher military spending. Staff also noted concerns about rising government wage and
administration costs, including those associated with a recently expanded cabinet, and
urged further wage increases be linked to comprehensive civil service reform given
still limited capacity and skill deficiencies.7 The authorities noted staff’s concerns, but
cited the wage bill is lower as a share of GDP than neighboring countries and that
cabinet-related expenses are needed to accommodate the political process.

•

In line with IMF technical assistance (TA) recommendations, staff urged PFM reforms
be accelerated, including tackling budget integration, particularly as it pertains to the
recording of donor-financed capital spending. The authorities agreed that reform
efforts had been slower than desired due to the elections and adoption of new
procurement procedures, and reiterated their commitment to renew momentum.
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy

12.
The current monetary stance is seen as broadly appropriate, but conditions have
tightened rapidly, bearing close watch. Staff recommended that as credit growth decreases
and inflation pressures subside, a moderate cut in the reserve requirement on FCDs would be
justified. Under the current baseline, broad money is expected to increase by only around

The government has indicated it will use Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) proceeds to address rural
infrastructure gaps.

Ministry of Economy and Finance; it is now being extended to donor-financed activities in other ministries.

13
2½ percent in 2009, with weak inflows significantly constraining liquidity growth. As a result
and also reflecting demand conditions, private sector credit growth is expected to expand by
only 10 percent (y/y) in 2009. Staff and authorities agreed temporary liquidity shortages could
arise in individual banks over the near term, but that these would be better handled through
improved liquidity operations rather than through general policy easing.
13.
With strains already emerging, discussions focused on need to strengthen
liquidity management at the NBC and reduce liquidity risk among banks. Staff and the
authorities recognized an effective policy response continues to be constrained by an
underdeveloped operational framework, lack of instruments, and weak banking sector, with
dollarization limiting available options. The authorities concurred immediate priority should
be placed on (i) improving the liquidity monitoring framework through more frequent
reporting of banks’ liquidity position to better understand factors driving their reserves at the
NBC; and (ii) developing an overdraft facility to address temporary liquidity shortages, with
new regulations being formulated, including on acceptable collateral. With government
securities nonexistent, staff cautioned the need under this facility to assess carefully any assets
banks pledge as collateral. The authorities also agreed improvements are needed in the
required reserve system—mainly reducing the maintenance period from 28 to 14 days, so
banks can better manage their own liquidity needs.
14.
Staff recommended steps be taken over the medium term toward greater exchange
rate flexibility. In the past, the exchange rate served as a useful nominal anchor, given
Cambodia’s low level of financial development, ongoing need to improve bank soundness, and
until recently, moderate imported inflation. Staff noted that greater flexibility could help deepen
the foreign exchange market and facilitate an orderly progression toward de-dollarization,
supported by more effective monetary controls. The authorities agreed on a more flexible
exchange rate regime as a medium-term policy objective, but for now viewed the heavily
managed float vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar as appropriate. Staff urged that intervention be limited to
smoothing short-term volatility, so as to maintain adequate reserves in the event of a further
sharp deterioration in external conditions or the NBC were called to act as lender of last resort.
C. Banking Sector Issues
15.
Excessive credit growth, regulatory forbearance, and now tighter funding
conditions have heightened risks to the banking sector. Staff urged much closer monitoring
by the NBC of banks’ compliance with prudential regulations to prevent systemic problems.
The NBC continues to improve supervisory capacity, with plans in 2009 for more intensive
on- and off-site monitoring. However, enforcement remains weak, in particular dealing
effectively with capital adequacy and loan provisioning. Staff also noted that bank licensing
procedures need to be strengthened, with new entry reserved to those entities with a significant
banking background. To this end, the NBC was urged to ensure close coordination between its
recently established Financial Intelligence Unit and Banking Supervision Department to

14
ensure new and existing banks complied fully with anti-money laundering guidelines. Finally,
staff welcomed the updating of fit-and-proper rules.
16.
To safeguard against risks, staff urged the NBC take quick and forceful action in
several critical areas. First, loan classification standards should be revised to force banks to
take into account borrowers’ ability to repay and underlying risks. Closer monitoring of large
exposure loans is also necessary, and higher risk weights should be attached to more risky
types of lending, including to the real estate sector (in place of sector lending caps). Second,
new minimum capital requirements established to take effect in 2010 should be brought
forward for banks facing elevated solvency risk.8 Third, given limited resources, bank
supervisors should prioritize their inspections and coordinate with external auditors, focusing
on those banks with a history of lax adherence to prudential regulations and on the large
systemically-important banks. Finally, banking resolution plans should be formulated
facilitating bank consolidation, if necessary; designating a clear role for the NBC as lender of
last resort; and providing a credible settlement mechanism, for which the authorities requested
IMF TA. They also indicated interest in pursuing a Financial Sector Assessment Program
(FSAP) to ensure proper oversight of the financial sector.

Box 4. Cambodia: Exchange Rate Assessment and External Stability

The need to improve productivity is more important
than ever. Greater regional competition in garment
exports, rising local wages (in dollars), and higher
material costs portend difficulties ahead, including
further loss in market share.1 Moreover, global business
climate indicators tend to rank Cambodia at the lower
end. Better infrastructure (notably roads and electricity),
a more skilled workforce, and less burdensome business
regulation, along with maintenance of a stable
macroeconomic environment, would address the major
impediments to improving competitiveness.

Based on the CGER-type assessments, Cambodia’s
current exchange rate appears overvalued in the
range of 11–13 percent. However, these are broad
estimates and should be interpreted cautiously, as
structural changes in the economy and weak
macroeconomic data complicate the analysis. For the
garment industry, the U.S. dollar-Cambodian riel
exchange rate per se may be less of a factor than
external demand conditions, given mostly U.S. dollardenominated costs. Nevertheless, an overvalued riel
could hurt some producers, as well as the tourism
industry, combined with other factors constraining
competitiveness.

Since 2006, Cambodia’s share of U.S. garment imports has risen by 0.3 percentage points to 2.6 percent (for the year
ending September 2008). During the same period, the share of imports from Vietnam and China increased from 3.6 to
5.8 percent and from 29.0 to 34.4 percent, respectively (based U.S. Department of Commerce data).

16
18.
Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA): Given longer-term prospects, Cambodia currently
faces a moderate risk of external debt distress. In the DSA, no thresholds are breached under the
baseline scenario and standard stress tests and alternative scenarios, except one bound tests
(Appendix I). However, this benign outlook is subject to substantial downside risk, as shown in
the DSA, in the event of a prolonged economic downturn, but the likelihood of debt distress
remains moderate. Under the baseline scenario, the public external debt (projected at 27 percent
of GDP at end-2008) should decline steadily over the medium term. The debt service-to-exports
ratio is expected to stay below 3 percent. These results presume that external borrowing would
gradually move toward less concessional terms and no resolution of external debt arrears with
either the Russian Federation or United States takes place.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
19.
Cambodia is facing its most challenging macroeconomic and financial conditions
this decade. External shocks have been magnified by the concentration of economic
activity, dependence on external inflows, and weaknesses in the banking system. The
Cambodian authorities have swiftly recognized the serious challenges that lie ahead and agree
on the necessity of a clear and timely policy response to manage the risks and avoid an even
deeper downturn.
20.
Fiscal policy is expected to continue to underpin stabilization efforts, with a more
expansionary stance in 2009 appropriate. The government is to be commended for strong
budget performance so far in 2008, especially given potential pressures arising from national
elections, border security issues, and a weakening economy. Moderate fiscal easing in 2009
could help mitigate the impact of an expected growth slowdown, focused on higher pro-poor
social and infrastructure outlays. However, continued efforts are needed to strengthen revenue
administration and, as conditions permit, broaden the tax base. More control should also be
exercised over the government’s wage bill, with future increases linked to comprehensive civil
service reform. Recognizing security concerns, military spending should avoid crowding out
other essential spending. Concerted efforts are also needed to strengthen PFM, in particular on
improving Treasury management and budget coordination and integration, including the
recording of donor inflows. Finally, to maximize public gain, future oil and mineral production
should be guided by a transparent fiscal regime.
21.
The current monetary stance is broadly appropriate, but conditions require close
watch to avoid excessive tightening and aggravating risks to banking system. As credit
growth drops and inflation pressures subside, moderate easing could be justified. However,
further steps are needed to improve policy effectiveness along the lines of longstanding IMF
TA recommendations. Sound monetary operations at the NBC also hinge on better internal
coordination to ensure policy consistency. A more developed framework will be needed in the
years ahead, with a new nominal anchor that relies more on market-based instruments and
prioritizes greater inflation control.

17
22.
A clear strategy must be put in place to manage liquidity risk. Upfront action should
be taken to strengthen the liquidity management framework to deal with potential pressures. The
NBC’s recent moves toward putting in place an overdraft facility is a critical step in this
direction, but caution will need to be exercised in assessing eligible collateral and distinguishing
liquidity from solvency pressures facing banks. In providing any liquidity support, the NBC
should consider potential risks to its own balance sheet in the event banks are unable to repay,
since reserve losses could further undermine confidence and increase external vulnerability. Staff
urges equally swift measures be enacted to improve the required reserve system.
23.
Beyond immediate actions to contain liquidity risk, swift and comprehensive
measures are needed to improve banking soundness, including on solvency issues. The
NBC continues to strengthen the prudential framework, but more systematic efforts are needed
in supervising banks and enforcing regulations, given the likelihood nonperforming loans will
rise as the economy further slows. The authorities should also develop banking resolution
plans, in view of solvency risk faced by some banks, and strengthen bank licensing
procedures. New minimum capital requirements should be brought forward, with those banks
facing heightened solvency risks required to be in compliance immediately. An FSAP could
help identify other vulnerabilities to the financial system and prioritize further policy actions.
24.
In light of recent developments, more efforts are needed to improve external
competitiveness. The exchange rate assessment points to an overvaluation of the riel. However,
with a highly dollarized economy, exchange rate adjustment would play a limited role in
resolving imbalances. On the other hand, competition gains should arise from maintaining a
stable macroeconomic environment, along with taking steps to develop a more skilled workforce,
improve public services and infrastructure, and streamline business regulation.
25.
Risk of external debt distress is moderate, but could become more pronounced
with a prolonged downturn. In light of this possibility and given a large external borrowing
requirement, prudent debt management remains essential, with Cambodia expected continue to
borrow on largely concessional terms in the foreseeable future. The authorities are also
encouraged to continue seeking agreements to resolve outstanding debt obligations with the
Russian Federation and United States.
26.
If the need were to arise and understandings could be reached on outstanding
debt arrears, staff would support a request for a new PRGF arrangement. Any such
arrangement would need to be underpinned by a strong reform agenda aimed at strengthening
competitiveness, reducing vulnerabilities, and ensuring a viable external position. Under any
circumstances, staff urge the authorities to carry on their reform efforts, which the IMF will
continue to support through intensive TA and policy dialogue.
27.

It is recommended that Cambodia remain on the 12-month consultation cycle.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND AND
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
CAMBODIA
Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis 20081
Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association
Approved by Jerald Schiff and Dominique Desruelle (IMF)
and Carlos Braga and Vikram Nehru (IDA)
December 23, 2008
This document presents the joint IMF-World Bank debt sustainability analysis (DSA) for
Cambodia using the Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries (LIC).2 It
shows that external debt burden indicators do not breach the relevant policy-dependent
indicative thresholds under the baseline scenario. However, given recent global
developments and Cambodia’s vulnerability to external shocks, there are considerable
downside risks to the baseline scenario. An assessment of the impact of various exogenous
shocks on the sustainability of external and public sector debt shows Cambodia would face a
moderate risk of debt distress.3
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Cambodia’s DSA indicates that the risk of debt distress remains moderate. At
end-September 2008, the total value of its external public debt was US$2.8 billion
1

This DSA was prepared jointly by the IMF and World Bank. The staffs also consulted with the Asian
Development Bank. The debt data underlying this exercise were provided by the Cambodian authorities and
donor partners.

2

See “Debt Sustainability in Low-Income Countries: Proposal for an Operational Framework and Policy
Implications” (http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/sustain/2004/020304.htm and IDA/SECM2004/0035, 2/3/04)
and “Debt Sustainability in Low-Income Countries: Further Considerations on an Operational Framework,
Policy Implications” (http://www.imf.org/external/np/pdr/sustain/2004/091004.htm and IDA/SECM2004/0629,
9/10/04) and “Applying the Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries Post Debt Relief,”
(www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2006/110606.pdf and IDA/SecM2006–0564, 8/11/06).

3

The low income country debt sustainability framework (LIC DSF) recognizes that better policies and
institutions allow countries to manage higher levels of debt, and thus the threshold levels are policy dependent.
Cambodia’s policies and institutions, as measured by the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment (CPIA), averaged 3.17 percent over the past three years, placing it as a “weak performer.” The
relevant indicative thresholds for this category are: 30 percent for the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio, 100 percent
for the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio, 200 percent for the NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio, 15 percent for the debt
service-to-exports ratio, and 25 percent for the debt service-to-revenue ratio. These thresholds are applicable to
public and publicly guaranteed external debt.

2
(27 percent of GDP) and domestic debt was US$0.1 billion (¾ percent of GDP), one-third of
which was denominated in foreign currency. 4 Under the baseline scenario and standard
alternative scenarios and stress tests, all debt burden indicators are well below the relevant
policy-dependent indicative thresholds with one exception—the net present value (NPV) of
debt-to-revenue ratio, which exceeds the threshold over brief periods in the standard tests.
This finding represents a modest improvement from the last DSA conducted during the
IMF’s 2007 Article IV consultation, in which thresholds were breached for two indicators.5
However, in view of recent developments and Cambodia’s vulnerability to external shocks,
staffs have analyzed a few additional scenarios. They show that in the event of a prolonged
economic downturn, debt burden indicators would breach the indicative thresholds over
extended periods.
II. BACKGROUND AND ASSUMPTIONS
2.
The main underlying macroeconomic assumptions are presented in Box 1. They
reflect Cambodia’s continued pursuit of sound macroeconomic and financial policies and
structural reforms in support of growth and poverty reduction and low external vulnerability.
Growth prospects are predicated on implementation of necessary banking, fiscal, and
regulatory reforms and improvements to public infrastructure and services, helping to raise
productivity and strengthen competitiveness. However, the development of extractive
industries is not factored into the baseline, given uncertainties about the timing and impact of
new oil and mineral production. Resources development could create considerable fiscal
space, but also pose challenges for macroeconomic management.
3.
Cambodia remains in arrears to the Russian Federation and the United States.
Following a Paris Club agreement in 1995, Cambodia concluded agreements with France,
Germany, Italy, and Japan. Negotiations of outstanding debt obligations with the Russian
Federation and the United States are still ongoing, with their status unchanged since the last
DSA. Currently, Cambodia is not servicing its debt with either of these creditors, but is
making efforts to conclude agreements with each under the framework of the Paris Club.
Since prospects for resolution are unclear, the current DSA assumes no restructuring in its
baseline, with arrears continuing to build up throughout the projection period. In measuring
debt levels, the DSA incorporates the negotiated debt stock for the Russian Federation
(US$457 million) and the agreed amount of total principal due for the United States
(US$162 million).6

4

Cambodia received debt relief from the IMF under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) of

Box 1: Main Assumptions for the Baseline Scenario (2008–28)
•

Real GDP growth is projected to average slightly under 6 percent a year in 2008–10 compared with an
average of 11 percent over the previous five years. The slowdown is due to some catch-up effects earlier on
and less benign global conditions more recently, including spillover effects from the global financial crisis and
weak external demand. Growth is expected to rise thereafter to around 7½ percent by 2014 as global and
domestic conditions improve. Important drivers of future growth will be new export opportunities in light
manufactures and agribusiness, as well as more expansive tourism activity. The construction and
infrastructure sectors are also expected to be major contributors. These activities would depend on an
improved investment climate as well as a recovery in foreign direct investment (FDI) starting in 2010,
following an expected reduction in 2009 by around one-third from the previous year’s level owing to global
conditions. Over the longer term, growth is projected to be sustained in the range of 6–7 percent a year,
supported by export growth and assuming maintenance of macroeconomic stability.

•

The external current account deficit (including official transfers) is projected to decline in 2009 to 8 percent
of GDP, compared to 12 percent in 2008, mainly due to lower oil prices and non-oil import growth, which
more than offset low expected growth in garment exports and tourism services. Over the medium term,
garment exports will continue to underpin export performance. Tourism growth should also strengthen as
global conditions improve and given promotion efforts. Over the longer term, the current account deficit is
expected to settle in the range of 5–6 percent of GDP a year. Official assistance (grants and loans) would
decline gradually as a share of GDP, while FDI and other private inflows would rise. The baseline scenario
also assumes an increasing but moderate level of external borrowing would be on less concessional terms,
including from some bilateral creditors. With FDI and other private inflows expected to decline, the overall
external position would weaken somewhat in 2009. Thereafter, gross official reserves would begin to build
up slowly again in U.S. dollar terms, with the import coverage in the range of 2½–3 months from 2014
onward.

•

Macroeconomic stability is underpinned by a moderate fiscal stance. Given weak global conditions, modest
countercyclical easing is likely in 2009, with the overall fiscal deficit (excluding grants) expected to rise to
around 3¼ percent of GDP in 2009 compared to a projected 1¾ percent in 2008. Thereafter, the deficit would
be expected to decline gradually to under 2 percent by 2012, mostly financed externally. Revenue would rise
over the medium term by about 3/4 percentage point to around 13¼ percent of GDP by 2012 on increased tax
buoyancy and a broadening of the tax base, with more moderate increases thereafter. Grants are projected to
decline as a share of GDP from around 2¼ percent in recent years to 1½ percent in the outer years.
Expenditure would stay around 15¼ percent of GDP over the medium term, but then rise gradually owing
mainly to higher locally-financed capital spending.

4.
Cambodia received several speculative-grade sovereign credit ratings in 2007,
which could provide an opportunity for commercial borrowing. No plans have been
announced and prospects appear remote at this time. However, bonds could be issued to
finance infrastructure development, possibly for the oil sector. Several build-operate-transfer
(BOT) projects have been signed with firms from China, but possible contingent liabilities
arising from these types of contracts are not incorporated in this DSA. Greater transparency
is needed in this area to facilitate the monitoring of these liabilities and mitigation of any
associated fiscal risks.
III. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
5.
All external debt indicators remain below the policy-dependent debt burden
thresholds under the baseline scenario, but one threshold is breached under the most
extreme standard stress test. The main results of the external DSA are as follows:

4
•

The NPV of external debt as a share of GDP is expected to remain below the 30 percent
indicative threshold over period covered (Table 1a). Under the most extreme stress test—
a one-time 30 percent nominal depreciation of the Cambodian riel vis-à-vis the U.S.
dollar relative to the 2008 baseline—the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio would increase by
about 7 percentage points to 27 percent by end-2009, but still remain well below the
indicative threshold over the projection period (Figure 1 and Table 1b).

•

The NPV of external debt-to-revenue ratio remains below the threshold for all years in
the baseline scenario, declining from 162 percent in 2008 to 128 percent by 2013, and
further decreasing over the long

during the period 2009–11, and then
falls below the indicative threshold for the rest of the projection period.

6.
In staffs’ view, Cambodia faces a moderate risk of debt distress. This assessment
is based on the standard alternative scenarios and bound tests of the DSA, which are
predicated on strong past performance.7 However, it also takes into account current global
conditions and the possibility of a prolonged economic downturn. As an illustrative exercise,
a few additional alternative scenarios are examined, based on different assumptions from the
baseline They are (i) lower annual real GDP growth (4½ percent over the medium term) and
smaller FDI inflows (the average of 2000–04 level as a share of GDP); and (ii) smaller FDI
flows and higher borrowing costs (an average nominal interest rate of 6 percent on new
loans) (Figure 2 and 3). The latter scenario presumes low FDI would be indicative of a
persistence of a weak business and investment climate, with a lack of reforms and the
resulting financing gap necessitating that Cambodia resort to more costly borrowing. The
results indicate that the NPV of external debt as a share of GDP breaches the indicative
thresholds under both scenarios, and with (ii) remains well above the threshold at the end of
the projection period.

7

Because of double-digit growth in recent years, the standard alternative scenarios and stress tests based on
average past performance show a continued decline in debt and debt service levels. However, in view of the
sharp downturn in global economic activity in the second half of 2008 and uncertain prospects about the degree
and timing of a recovery, past performance may not be instructive of future trends.

5
IV. PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
7.
Given that most public debt is external, the overall public and external debt
dynamics are very similar. The nominal stock of public debt, equivalent to 30½ percent of
GDP at end-2007, is expected to decline to 27½ percent by end-2008 (Figure 4 and Table 2a).
The NPV of public sector debt-to-GDP ratio would fall steadily from 21 percent in 2008 to
12 percent by 2028. The NPV of public debt-to-revenue ratio, which is projected to be
142 percent in 2008, would decline to 70 percent by 2028. The debt-service-to-revenue ratio
remains low in most scenarios for the entire projection period because of the concessionality
of the existing debts. However under the standard alternative scenarios and bound tests,
public debt ratios are particularly sensitive to a real exchange rate depreciation. A one-time
30 percent riel depreciation relative to the 2008 baseline would raise the NPV of public debtto-GDP and the public debt-to-revenue ratios by around 8 and 51 percentage points,
respectively, by end-2009, but eventually decline over the projection period.
8.
The DSA does not account for possible contingent liabilities, notably those
arising from large infrastructure investment. More careful assessment is needed of plans
in this area, including examination of BOT contracts for possible guarantees offered. The
authorities will need to monitor commitments closely and transparently, including developing
and maintaining an inventory of all concessions granted, in particular for infrastructure, and
building and improving capacity to analyze the impact of contingent liabilities on debt
sustainability, should they arise.
V. CONCLUSION
9.
Staffs conclude that Cambodia faces a moderate risk of debt distress. No
thresholds are breached under the baseline scenario and standard stress tests and alternative
scenarios, except one bound test. However, this benign outlook is subject to substantial
downside risks, as it rests on a pick up in the pace of economic activity from 2010 onward,
notably economic growth and external inflows. Additional scenarios reflecting a prolonged
downturn in global economic activity indicate that external debt could exceed indicative
thresholds for extended periods. This outlook could be further weakened in the event actual
liabilities arise from contingent obligations, mainly those entered for infrastructure
development, which further underscores the rationale for the designation of risk.
10.
Given uncertainty about near-to medium-term prospects, staffs urge the Royal
Government of Cambodia continue pursuing a sound strategy for public debt
management. Careful consideration is needed in possibly contracting less concessional
loans, as they could impair sustainability, in particular if the revenue base remains low and
institutions weak. Stronger capacity in debt management is an essential pre-requisite for this
type of borrowing. To this end, a full accounting of all commitments, including from newly
emerging creditors, and better monitoring of contingent liabilities will be necessary to ensure
debt sustainability. Staffs also encourage the authorities to continue seeking agreements to
resolve outstanding arrears.

Source: Staffs' projections and simulations.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in US dolar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP and non-debt creating flows.
Due to large swings in GDP, deflator and current accout in 2008, compared to historical average, debt falls sharply under this scenario.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative:

As part of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), the IMF Executive Board on January 5,
2006 approved relief on 100 percent of debt incurred by Cambodia to the IMF before January 1,
2005. This resulted in the forgiving of all of Cambodia’s outstanding debt to the IMF, a total of
SDR 56.8 million (about US$82 million). The authorities intend to spend the resources over a
number of years, initially on rural irrigation projects. The National Bank of Cambodia (NBC)
transferred the full MDRI proceeds to the Ministry of Economy and Finance effective March 2006.

3
VIII.

Safeguards Assessment:

Under the IMF’s safeguard assessment policy, the NBC was subject to a full safeguard assessment
with respect to a possible successor PRGF Arrangement. A previous safeguards assessment of the
NBC was completed on March 24, 2004; it identified certain weaknesses, mostly in the area of
internal audit and control and made appropriate recommendations.
IX.

Exchange Rate Arrangement and Payments System:

Cambodia officially follows a managed float with no pre-announced exchange rate path. The
official exchange rate, which is expressed in riels per U.S. dollar, applies to all official external
transactions conducted by the central government and state enterprises and is used for accounting
purposes by the NBC. It is determined by the foreign exchange market, with the official rate
adjusted to be within 1 percent of the market rate on a daily basis.
Cambodia accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 on January 1, 2002, and
maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers
for current international transactions.
X.

Article IV Consultation:

Cambodia is subject to the provisions on consultation cycles approved on July 15, 2002. The
last Article IV consultation discussions were held in Phnom Penh during May 21–June 5, 2007.
The Executive Board discussed the staff report (Country Report No. 07/290) and concluded the
consultation on July 25, 2007.
XI.

Technical Assistance:

Technical assistance is currently focused on bank supervision, monetary operations, public
financial management, customs administration, and macro-financial statistics. Delivery is through
a resident advisor at the NBC, peripatetic experts, and short-term visits from headquarters.
XI.

Resident Representative:

The resident representative office was closed in October 1997 and re-opened in
October 1999. Mr. John Nelmes, the current Resident Representative, assumed the post in
November 2005.

ANNEX II. CAMBODIA: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP1
(As of November 2008)
I. OVERVIEW
The World Bank Group’s 2005–08 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) stresses the need to
improve governance in order to maximize the impact of development efforts. The CAS
activities are intended to contribute to six objectives, which are clustered under two
over-arching pillars. In May 2008, the CAS period was extended until 2011 so that the World
Bank and other development partners could better align their support around the next
National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP). The approach and objectives of the original
CAS will be maintained throughout the extended CAS period.
Activities under Pillar 1 are intended to help implement improvements in governance that are
needed if Cambodia is to meet the Cambodia Millennium Development Goals (CMDGs). To
this end, the CAS establishes four objectives: (i) promote private sector development for
poverty reduction; (ii) improve natural resources management; (iii) improve service delivery
and public financial management; and (iv) support decentralization and promote citizens’
partnerships for better governance. These four objectives were chosen because of their
importance for growth and poverty reduction and the strong ownership and leadership from
the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC). The selection was also informed by lessons
from successes and failures in past strategies, and by the comparative advantage of
development partners.
Pillar 2 of the CAS allocates World Bank resources to supporting the strategy development
and investments needed to attain the CMDGs. To these ends the CAS has two other
objectives. First, the Bank will encourage the emergence of poverty-focused approaches in
the formulation and implementation of public policy by supporting the NSDP 2006–10.
Second, where there are clear gaps in critical infrastructure and human development subsectors, the Bank will support the emergence of a nationally-owned vision and strategy
through the provision of analytical and investment services.
II. PILLAR 1: REMOVING THE GOVERNANCE CONSTRAINTS TO ATTAINING THE CMDGS
A. Private Sector Development (PSD)
Country Progress: Progress in this area has been mixed. On the trade facilitation front, there
has been steady movement towards a customs automation program (ASYCUDA), with
adoption of the Single Administrative Document (SAD) import/export declaration format and a
pilot test of the automated customs procedures, commencing in Sihanoukville in May 2008 and
1

Prepared by World Bank staff.

5
with a nationwide roll-out scheduled in 2009. The Law on Customs, which is instrumental to
customs reforms and to the implementation of ASYCUDA, was passed by the National
Assembly in 2007. A risk management strategy has been adopted and is being implemented.
Some progress has also been made in developing Special Economic Zones. With respect to
improving the legal framework for investment and private sector development, the Law on
Commercial Arbitration and the Law on Concessions were passed by the National Assembly in
March 2006 and September 2007, respectively, but implementation of these laws has lagged.
Role of the World Bank Group: The focus of the Bank’s PSD program in Cambodia is on
supporting investment climate development through trade facilitation and improving the
legal framework for investment. Policy reforms in both of these areas have been supported
through the first a the series of Poverty Reduction and Growth Operations (PRGO) approved
in July 2007. The 2005 Trade Facilitation and Competitiveness Project is helping improve
Cambodia’s competitiveness by streamlining import/export formalities and reducing the
costs of trade-related activities. The IFC’s Mekong Private Sector Development Facility
(MPDF) prepared the Cambodian Provincial Business Environment Scorecards in ten
provinces, and the Bank has recently started a new Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) to
monitor results since the 2004 ICA, identify new issues, and design future support. The Bank
has also led the Technical Working Group (TWG) on PSD, supported the
Government/Private Sector Forum, and participated actively in the dialogue on private sector
issues with the RGC, donors, and the private sector.
B. Natural Resources Management (NRM)
Country Progress: Progress in this area has been satisfactory, but a number of concerns
remain. Sub-decrees on State Land Management and on Economic Land Concessions (ELCs)
have been adopted, including provisions for reviewing and cancelling nonperforming
economic land concessions and assigning the land for use as social land concessions for the
poor. The RGC has distributed more than 800,000 titles and has also started a dialogue on
titling of communally-owned land by indigenous people. Actions were also taken to
strengthen systems for forestry management, including community based forest activities,
with the RGC recently issuing a new Protected Areas Law to provide greater clarity on
institutional roles, responsibilities, and obligations. However, transparency in the issuance of
ELCs still needs to be improved, and the social land concessions program needs to be
accelerated. Implementation of the laws governing access and title to natural resources has
also been slow, and governance weaknesses in the forestry sector are still a major concern to
all stakeholders.
Role of the World Bank Group: To better integrate the Bank’s efforts across land, forestry,
and biodiversity conservation, the Bank has developed a natural resources management
framework that seeks to summarize the main challenges and required actions to move the
overall agenda forward. The Bank has used this framework in its engagement with the TWGs
on land, agriculture, poverty, environment, and water. Policy reforms in NRM are being

6
supported through additional analytical and advisory activities (AAA), including an agrarian
structures study and an environment monitor, the PRGO, and a range of investment and
technical support operations. Of particular importance are the Land Management and
Administration Project (LMAP), which has supported notable progress on land titling, and
the Biodiversity and Protected Areas Management Project, which has successfully piloted
measures for ensuring sound management of protected areas. However, irregularities in the
implementation of both of these projects as well as three other projects (the Forest
Concession Management and Control Pilot Project, Flood Emergency Rehabilitation Project,
and Agricultural Productivity Improvement Project) have resulted in delays. A Japan Social
Development Fund Grant has been mobilized to foster NGO, local community, and RGC
capacity to expand community forestry activities. Finally, in 2008, the Land Allocation for
Social and Economic Development project was adopted to support the implementation of the
RGC’s Social Land Concession strategy.
C. Public Financial Management (PFM)
Country Progress: Progress in this area has been satisfactory. Good progress has been made
in implementing improved arrangements for budget formulation, budget classification, cash
and bank account management, financial control, and transaction management. Procurement
responsibility has been increasingly deconcentrated to line agencies, and an improved
procurement sub-decree and the supporting implementing regulations have been adopted,
incorporating numerous measures for increasing competition, transparency, and
accountability in the procurement process. This has contributed to a strengthening of the
overall PFM system, with the latest indicators showing aggregate actual expenditures to be
within 5 percent of the budget, revenues continuing to grow, and arrears being largely
eliminated. An innovative merit-based pay initiative (MBPI) was implemented in the
Ministry of Economy and Finance to tackle the issues of civil service incentives,
performance, and capacity. This system is now being extended progressively to all
development partner-financed strategic reforms with a view to eliminating current
distortionary salary supplement schemes, harmonizing RGC and partner approaches to
incentives, and beginning to address the broader needs for civil service reform.
Role of World Bank Group: The Bank has worked closely with the RGC and helped
coordinate the 13 development partners in the TWG on PFM in the design and implementation
of the RGC’s PFM Reform Program (PFMRP). The Bank has also supported the program
through the PRGO as well as the PFM Accountability Project. The PFMRP is the first
operation to support a sector-wide approach in Cambodia and has been recognized as a model
of aid effectiveness globally. The Bank has also initiated a dialogue on oil revenue
management, engaged civil society in the dialogue on PFM, and assisted the RGC in adopting
and extending the MBPI. AAA on public expenditure tracking surveys (PETS) in education
and health sectors as well as civil service reform for teachers have been completed, and grants
from trust funds are supporting strengthened National Assembly oversight of the budget.

7
D. Decentralization and Accountability
Country Progress: Progress in this area has been considerable. In line with the goal of
decentralizing resources to local government units, average funds to commune/sangkats are
projected to double by 2010. A second round of commune/sangkat council elections in 2007
has strengthened the foundation for enhanced accountability at the local level. The Ministry
of Interior has successfully piloted “One Window Service” and a District Ombudsman’s
office to enhance local governance. After some delay, the National Assembly adopted the
Organic Laws on Decentralization and Deconcentration in April 2008. However, progress on
improving access to information, including drafting of an access to information law, has been
delayed, and civil society involvement in policy-making processes is developing slowly, as
there is still insufficient constructive engagement with the RGC.
Role of the World Bank Group: The Bank has provided substantial support for
decentralization through the Rural Investment and Local Governance Project. The Bank has
also conducted a series of studies on justice for the poor as well as a village level and dispute
resolution study. In addition, it has provided advice through the TWG on the RGC’s
decentralization policy and strategy and mobilized grant finance to support government-civil
society consultations on the decentralization strategy as well as to build the capacity of civil
society on social accountability.
III. PILLAR 2: SUPPORTING STRATEGY AND INVESTMENTS TO ATTAIN THE CMDGS
A. Formulation and Implementation of the NSDP, 2006–10
Country Progress: Progress toward this objective has been impressive. The RGC adopted the
NSDP in 2006, replacing previous donor-driven plans with a single national development
strategy. The TWG for Planning and Poverty Reduction provides a forum for regular
dialogue between the RGC, development partners, and civil society on the implementation of
the NSDP. Over the last two years, the Ministry of Planning (MoP) has developed (with
support from the TWG) a strategic plan to refocus the ministry and help build its capacity to
coordinate the implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of the NSDP. The TWG has also
provided a forum for shifting external support towards a ministry-wide, program-based
approach, by which development partners supporting the MoP will coordinate their
assistance with the NSDP. On gender equality, improvements have also been made,
including an increase in female’s representation in commune councils from 8 percent to
15 percent following the 2007 elections.
Role of the World Bank Group: The Bank, together in other development partners, has
provided technical and financial support to the MoP in the formulation and implementation of
the NSDP, with the Bank and UNDP serving as development partner co-facilitators of the
TWG. In addition to direct support to RGC institutions and processes related to the NSDP, the
Bank has helped to improve the knowledge base for policymakers and other stakeholders

8
through the 2006 Poverty Assessment and the 2007 Sharing Growth: Equity and Development
Report. The Bank has also provided support to the Ministry of Womens’ and Veterans’ Affairs
through an Institutional Development Fund grant, which funded a Gender Budgeting Project,
as well as a number of smaller stand-alone grants for various outreach, training, and advocacy
activities, including study tours for women in leadership, a regional workshop on
mainstreaming gender in aid effectiveness, and local-level dissemination activities.
B. Analytical and Investment Support for Achieving the CMDGs–Human
Development and Infrastructure
Country Progress: Progress towards CAS outcomes has been impressive. In both the social and
infrastructure sectors, significant progress has been made towards government-owned strategies
around which donors can coordinate their financial and technical support. Improvements have
also been made in most human development outcomes such as the infant mortality rate, fertility
rate, HIV prevalence rates, and school enrollment rates. There has been greater access to and
utilization of health, education, and infrastructure services, and better targeting of health and
education subsidies. More resources have been allocated to interventions in priority sectors,
such as to reducing child and maternal mortality. Access to education and health, including by
disadvantaged/vulnerable communities, has expanded, and the perception of service delivery in
health and education among users of these services has improved. Nevertheless, other
indicators such as maternal mortality or drop-out rates are lagging.
Role of the World Bank Group: The Bank has continued to provide support for the
development and implementation of effective strategies in the social sectors through the
ongoing Health Sector Support and Education Sector Support Projects, as well as through
participation in the TWGs. In the health sector, a major step toward a sector-wide approach
was taken in 2008 to support the new RGC health sector strategy in partnership with AusAid,
DFID, France, UNFPA, and UNICEF. In the education sector, support from the Education
For All Fast Track Initiative Catalytic Fund was approved in 2008. As mentioned previously,
the Bank has also undertaken PETS in health and education to promote PFM reforms in these
sectors, and has supported additional analytical work in education.
In infrastructure, the Bank has helped in the development of sub-sector strategies through a
range of AAA (Energy Sector Strategy Review, Transport Sector Update, Implementation
Strategy for Urban Water Supply Policy, and briefing notes on oil and gas sector policy
issues) as well as through participation in the TWGs. The Bank has also engaged in a number
of investment projects that have had a high development impact for the intended
beneficiaries. However, the temporary suspension of two such projects—the Provincial and
Rural Infrastructure Project (PRIP) and the Provincial and Peri-Urban Water and Sanitation
Project (PPUWSP)—has delayed somewhat the anticipated results.

9
IV. LENDING OPERATIONS AND NON-LENDING INSTRUMENTS
Proactive portfolio management continues to be a very high priority for the World Bank
Group. Following the 2004–05 Fiduciary Review (carried out in partnership with the RGC),
the World Bank's Institutional Integrity Department (INT) undertook separate investigations
in 2005–06. The INT investigations substantiated allegations of corruption, collusion, and
fraudulent practices on several contracts under seven projects for which “misprocurement”
was declared in June 2006. As a result, the Bank temporarily suspended disbursements under
three projects (LMAP, PRIP and PPUWSP) and established action plans for the concerned
government agencies to execute in order to lift the suspensions.2 These action plans were
completed in January 2007, and the Bank lifted the suspensions on all three projects in
February 2007.
The RGC and the World Bank have established a number of preventive and oversight
measures to mitigate fiduciary risks in Bank-financed projects. One important measure has
been the use of anti-corruption action plans knowing Good Governance Frameworks (GGFs).
The GGFs—adopted for all on-going and future Bank-financed projects—include measures
to strengthen procurement procedures, financial management processes, staff conduct,
complaint mechanisms, disclosure, and internal controls. Although the GGFs have been in
place for less than a year, early implementation reviews indicate an increasing level of
implementation during this initial period. Another important measure is the use of an
International Procurement Agent (IPA) since December 2007 for all ongoing and future
Bank-financed projects. This action is evidence of the RGC’s commitment to ensuring the
integrity of the procurement process and to breaking established collusive and cartel
arrangements. Finally, the Bank is also providing technical support to the RGC to reinforce
its own ability to identify and remedy fraud and corruption problems.
The disbursement ratio in FY08—at 16.1 percent—was low mainly due to the after-effects of
the project suspension and the delay in engagement of the IPA.
Non-lending instruments and operations (credits and grants) are described in Tables 1 and 2.

2

Suspension is a remedial measure available under all World Bank legal agreements. It can be exercised by the
Bank in a number of situations, including when the Borrower is not fulfilling its obligations under the legal
agreement. Suspension entails a temporary freeze on the Bank’s financing of implementation, but does not mean
that the Bank withdraws from the project. Rather, the Bank steps up its supervision, dialogue, and other
activities to help the government in its efforts to meet the conditions for lifting the suspension.

The sector composition and loan/grant amounts of the remaining active portfolio as of
August 31, 2008 is as follows: agriculture and natural resources ($73.6 million); education
($70.1 million); energy ($64.3 million); finance ($0.0 million); health, nutrition, and social
protection ($29.0 million); industry and trade ($35.6 million); law, economic management,
and public policy ($7.8 million); multi-sector ($63.2 million); transport and communication
($105.0 million); and water supply, sanitation, and waste management ($18.0 million).
AsDB’s overarching goal in Cambodia is sustainable poverty reduction. The AsDB’s
Country Strategy and Program (CSP 2005–09) midterm review (MTR), finalized in August

13
2007, concluded that the strategic thrust of the AsDB in Cambodia remains appropriately
targeted on poverty reduction through broad-based private sector-led growth, inclusive social
development, and stronger governance for sustainable development. The AsDB’s proposed
Country Operations Business Plan 2008–10 (COBP) will strongly focus on the priority areas
of agricultural and rural development, private sector development, governance and capacity
development, and the Greater Mekang Sub-region (GMS). In the near term, interventions
would mostly center around the Tonle Sap basin area and be geared to improving the
management of water resources and irrigation assets, as well as that of flood and drought risk
and mitigation; expanding the connectivity internally between rural roads and the provincial
and national network and externally with emerging subregional transport corridors; fostering
the development of smallholder agricultural producers; and widening access for the poorest
to rural water supply and sanitation while strengthening local community management
capacity.
In the area of private sector development, the AsDB would support improvements in
competitiveness by helping reduce border-related costs and distortions; enhancing domestic
and external trade facilitation, including through promoting compliance with sanitary and
phytosanitary standards; and fostering improved and cheaper access to information and
communication technology. Later interventions would be more focused on improving the
trade facilitation and logistics links to the GMS as systems and procedures become more
developed and integrated. Supporting financial sector interventions would be aimed at
improving financial intermediation, including the outreach of microfinance institutions
(MFIs) and reducing the cost of finance in rural areas; enhancing the resilience of the
financial sector; promoting good governance; and improving financial sector efficiency.
Education-related interventions would be aimed at enhancing technical and vocational
education training to achieve a closer match between the skills of a rapidly growing and
young rural labor force and emerging employment opportunities. There will also be a gradual
increase in private sector operations, beginning with interventions to expand trade and access
to rural finance, including proposed non-recourse interventions by ASDB’s private sector
department to guarantee trade financing and extend MFI reach in rural areas. Other
infrastructure loans or investment opportunities are being sought, including in the areas of
thermal and hydropower.
With respect to governance and capacity building, the COBP proposes a long-term
programmatic approach to public financial management (PFM) reform with interventions in
2008 and 2010 to underpin rolling out of PFM to rural development line ministries. At the
decentralized level, it will be backed by a credible independent enforcement of
accountability oversight in the form of the National Audit Authority. The COBP also
proposes a sequence of interventions to support local accountability through particular
projects and capacity building ahead of support for fiscal decentralization.

ANNEX IV. CAMBODIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. However, national accounts,
price indices, government finance, balance of payments statistics, and external debt have
various shortcomings that hamper analysis. Greater use of direct surveys is needed in the
compilation of national accounts, BOP, and employment data, including enterprise surveys.
2.
Extensive technical assistance from the IMF, UNDP, Asian Development Bank, and
World Bank, as well as from bilateral partners (namely Japan and Sweden), has contributed
to substantial improvements in macroeconomic statistics. The IMF provided a long-term
multisector statistics advisor at the National Institute of Statistics during the period
October 2001–January 2008 (with a one-year interruption) to assist the authorities in
upgrading macroeconomic and financial statistics.
3.
Metadata have been posted on the IMF’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
since March 2002. Cambodia also began participation in the IMF’s General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS). The country’s GDDS metadata were last updated in August
2007.
National accounts and price statistics
4.
Recent efforts have been made to improve the consistency of national accounts
statistics with the United Nations’ System of National Accounts 1993, to expand the range of
annual national account aggregates, and to produce a quarterly national accounts series
(starting in June 2005). However, the quality of GDP estimates remains hampered by the
lack of comprehensive and reliable source data on a production and expenditure basis, in part
stemming from the need to improve data collection techniques.
5.
A new CPI series was compiled starting in October 2006. Data were published
through January 2008, but thereafter halted given the authorities’ view that a much higher
level of inflation from the new CPI was attributable to methodological weaknesses. The
authorities have reverted to the old CPI series that has a narrower geographical coverage
(limited to Phnom Penh and surrounding areas as opposed the new series’ all-Cambodia
index). They are seeking assistance from Statistics Sweden on a nationwide CPI, following
up on earlier work done by the IMF advisor. A quarterly producer price index (PPI) was
developed, with support from the IMF and financing from the AsDB. It led to the release of
an experimental PPI in April 2005. However, compilation of the PPI has been discontinued
owing to resource constraints.
Government finance statistics
6.
Progress had been made recently in strengthening the reporting and compilation of
government finance statistics (GFS), but gaps remain the coverage under new methodologies.
With the support of an IMF Treasury advisor and the above-mentioned statistical advisor, the

16
authorities began implementing in 2007 a reform of the government accounting system and
budgetary nomenclature based on the Government Finance Statistics Manual (GSFM) 2001.
In addition, several recent STA missions have assisted with improving GFS compilation
procedures within the GSFM 2001 framework. The latest was in April 2008, which assessed
progress and assisted with establishing a bridge between the government’s new chart of
accounts (COA) and the GSFM 2001 classifications so that accounting records can be used
as source data in compiling GFS. Currently, however, the new COA has not been
implemented widely, limiting its use and coverage. Since 2005, the authorities have provided
quarterly fiscal data for publication in International Finance Statistics and annual data for
publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook.
Monetary and financial statistics
7.
The National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) compiles the sectoral balance sheet and the
survey for central bank and other depository institutions in accordance with the methodology
recommended in the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. Since August 2005,
the NBC has reported monthly monetary and financial statistics to the IMF using the
standardized report forms with about five-week lag. The NBC also began compiling and
publishing financial soundness indicators in 2005 in its annual supervisory report, but as
these data may partly rely on unaudited financial accounts, considerable scope remains for
improving their accuracy and reliability.
External sector statistics
8.
Despite recent improvements, more work is needed to improve balance of payments
statistics. Customs data have substantial coverage and valuation problems arising from the
use of reference prices and limited recording of non-dutiable imports, underreporting of reexports, and weaknesses in customs controls. Enterprise transactions, such as payment for
imported services, income payments, and portfolio investment abroad are excluded or
underreported. Foreign direct investment, which is believed to be large, relies excessively on
approvals data. Regarding external debt statistics, gross external debt data are provided by
the Ministry of Economy and Finance, but gaps exist in the data, in particular public and
publicly-guaranteed debt by maturity, the external debt service schedule, and timely
information on disbursements by bilateral donors.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation
with Cambodia
On January 16, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Cambodia. 1
Background
Cambodia’s economy has performed well in recent years, owing to a stable macroeconomic
environment and double-digit growth. However, in 2008, conditions became less settled,
owing to spillover effects from the global financial crisis and weakening external demand.
Cambodia has been particularly vulnerable to recent shocks given its narrow production
base, concentration of exports by product and destination, and dependence on external
inflows. As a result, economic activity is slowing in most sectors and liquidity conditions are
tightening. Rapid credit expansion since 2007 combined with weaknesses in bank
supervision have heightened risks faced by a number of banks, including a few systemically
important ones. On a positive note, inflation pressures, which were intensifying until mid2008, has decreased owing mainly to the fall in commodity prices.
Real GDP growth is projected at 6½ percent in 2008 and 4¾ percent in 2008, compared to
10¼ percent in 2007. In 2008, garment exports and tourism activity moderated as external
demand weakened. Agricultural growth was likely below-trend due to adverse weather.
Construction activity—strong in the first half of the year—also faltered, as foreign direct
investment slowed and credit growth decelerated. While agricultural output should pick up in
2009, garments and tourism are expected to act as significant drag on growth given weak
external conditions. Real estate and construction activity will also likely slow further, as
investment becomes more constrained by inflows and credit. Headline inflation is projected to
moderate to 15½ percent (year-on-year) in December 2008 and 7½ percent (y/y) by end1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director,
as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
2009 on lower commodity prices and easing demand pressures. The current account deficit
rose sharply in 2008 due to high oil prices and strong non-oil imports, but with these factors
now reversing, the deficit in 2009 is projected to narrow. Nonetheless, the overall external
position, which improved in 2008, could weaken in 2009 given decreasing private inflows.
Gross official reserves, projected at US$2.0 billion (3.5 months of prospective imports), would
fall to around US$1.9 billion (3.1 months of imports) by end-2009.
The fiscal stance continued to underpin stabilization efforts in 2008. The overall deficit is
expected at around 1¾ percent of GDP, against an official target of 4¼ percent and an
outturn of around 3 percent in 2007. Revenue performance was strong, in part due to
improved tax and customs administration, and expenditure remained appropriately
constrained. However, public financial management reforms lagged, in particular budget
integration. Given the near-term outlook, the 2009 budget has a deficit target of 4¼ percent of
GDP, leaving scope for countercyclical fiscal easing.
Monetary conditions, lax in the first half of 2008, have tightened as external inflows slow and
policy measures take hold—mainly a doubling of the reserve requirement on foreign currency
deposits to 16 percent in June. Credit growth, which exceeded 100 percent (y/y) in mid-2008,
is expected to fall to around 60 percent by year-end, with growth likely to be significantly
lower in 2009 as liquidity remains tight. However, liquidity management remains constrained
by the lack of an operational framework at the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC), although
gradual steps are being taken to address this weakness. Despite recent global developments,
the riel was relatively stable against the U.S. dollar in 2008, as transaction demand for riel
balances stayed strong with inflation high.
With the banking system under increased strain, tighter monitoring is required by the NBC of
banks’ compliance with prudential regulations to prevent systemic problems. The NBC
continues to improve its supervisory capacity, but enforcement remains weak, in particular in
dealing effectively with capital adequacy and loan provisioning. New minimum capital
requirements have been approved for 2010. In addition, steps are being taken to strengthen
loan classification standards and improve bank licensing procedures. Bank resolution plans
are also being formulated to provide a solid framework for dealing effectively with troubled
banks.

Over the near term, the balance of risk is to the downside, because of uncertainty about
the length and depth of the global recession and its impact on external inflows. Adding to
pressures is a recent loss in competitiveness stemming from high domestic inflation
coupled with U.S. dollar strength vis-à-vis most major currencies, leading to a sharp real
appreciation. Medium-term prospects for Cambodia will depend on maintaining
macroeconomic and financial stability, improving governance and infrastructure, and
taking other actions to strengthen competitiveness, including addressing skill deficiencies
and streamlining business regulation.

3
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Cambodian authorities for maintaining sound
macroeconomic policies, including strong budget performance, against the backdrop of
an increasingly difficult external environment. Directors noted that the global economic
downturn and financial crisis pose serious challenges to Cambodia, with potential
adverse effects on economic activity, capital inflows, and the banking system. They
welcomed the authorities’ recognition of the need for a timely and decisive policy
response. This will need to involve supportive fiscal and monetary policies, as well as
improvements in financial sector oversight, public services delivery, and external
competitiveness, aimed at reducing vulnerabilities and sustaining growth and poverty
reduction.
Directors considered the modest easing of fiscal policy envisaged for 2009 as broadly
appropriate, and recommended that the increase in government spending be focused on
pro-poor social and infrastructure outlays. They encouraged the authorities to continue to
strengthen revenue administration and, as conditions permit, broaden the tax base,
building on recent improvements. Greater control over the government’s wage bill could
be exercised by linking future increases to comprehensive civil service reform. Directors
also called for concerted efforts to strengthen public financial management by improving
Treasury operations and budget coordination and integration, as well as a transparent
fiscal regime for extractive industries.
Directors supported the current monetary policy stance, and saw room for a moderate
easing as credit growth drops and aggregate demand pressures ease. They encouraged
the authorities to make further efforts to increase policy effectiveness in the context of
high dollarization, building on the Fund’s technical assistance recommendations, and to
work toward a more developed monetary framework. Directors saw the adoption of a
clear strategy to manage liquidity risk as an immediate priority. In this context, they
welcomed steps to develop a sound, transparent overdraft facility, but stressed the need
for caution in designating eligible collateral. Efforts should also continue to improve the
required reserve system.
Directors stressed the need for comprehensive measures to improve banking soundness,
notably in the areas of supervision, enforcement of regulations, and bank licensing
procedures. They commended the NBC for taking further steps to strengthen the
prudential framework and capital requirements. Directors also stressed the importance of
formulating banking resolution plans should the need arise, with a view to containing
fiscal risk. They welcomed the authorities’ intent to participate in the Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP) in early 2010.
Directors took note of the staff’s assessment that the real effective exchange rate
appears overvalued. They generally considered that the present exchange rate regime
continues to provide an appropriate nominal anchor, given the high degree of
dollarization and the stage of financial development. Directors agreed that greater
exchange rate flexibility is the appropriate medium-term objective. In the meantime,
external competitiveness should be safeguarded by maintaining a stable macroeconomic
environment, along with steps to develop a more skilled workforce, improve public
services and infrastructure, and streamline business regulations.

4

Directors encouraged the authorities to continue pursuing a prudent debt management
strategy, given the moderate risk of external debt distress and uncertainty about nearterm prospects. Consistent with this strategy, Cambodia should continue to borrow
largely on concessional terms in the foreseeable future.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue efforts to resolve outstanding arrears
with official creditors, noting that a successful resolution could pave the way for
consideration of a Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)-supported arrangement
should the authorities request it. They welcomed the authorities’ commitment to remain
closely engaged with the Fund and Cambodia’s development partners, in support of the
country’s reform agenda.
