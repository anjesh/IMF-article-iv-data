EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
Morocco’s recent economic performance has been favorable. With a more diversified
economy, stronger public finances, and a sound financial sector, Morocco is well-poised to
continue its progress despite the current difficult global economic and financial climate. The
outlook is encouraging, with growth projected to remain strong and the external position
sound. Risks to the outlook are generally tilted to the downside. Inflation could well be
higher than projected, due largely to the impact of imported inflation.
Key Issues and Policy Discussions
Public finances have strengthened significantly in recent years, but the cost of fuel and
food subsidies presents a major challenge. The very strong revenue performance of recent
years allows the authorities to absorb the costs of the subsidies in the short term without
undermining macroeconomic stability. The specific measures the authorities intend to
introduce, and their commitment to the 2008 deficit target, are welcome.
Over the medium term, a better targeting of subsidies will be crucial. Gradually
unwinding subsidies will allow for greater spending on investment and education, and a
continued reduction in debt ratios. Morocco would be well served by more ambitious fiscal
consolidation, which would assure macroeconomic stability and reduce fiscal risks.
The financial sector is sound. The sector is resilient to shocks, and little affected by ongoing
turmoil in international credit markets. Ongoing efforts to strengthen banking supervision
should be maintained. The authorities’ continued close attention to the rapid credit growth is
warranted, notably concerning the real estate sector. The authorities’ intention to raise the
capital adequacy ratio to 12 percent by end-2009 is also welcome.
The central bank’s monetary policy stance is appropriate. Inflationary pressures thus far
are primarily imported, and there is no evidence of excess domestic demand. Looking ahead,
the authorities should remain vigilant to second round effects on inflation.
The exchange rate peg has served as an anchor of macroeconomic stability, and appears
in line with its fundamentals. The authorities should continue their preparations for an
eventual move to a more open monetary policy and exchange rate regime, including by
deepening the foreign exchange market.
The authorities are deepening structural reforms to boost medium-term growth
prospects. Key reform areas include agriculture, infrastructure, and energy, and a particular
attention to education. Morocco is encouraged to continue its trade liberalization efforts.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Morocco has made major progress in recent years to increase economic growth
and strengthen the economy’s resilience to shocks, although important challenges
remain. The gains reflect sound macroeconomic policies, sustained structural reforms, and
taking advantage of opportunities provided by globalization. The result has been a gradual
improvement in living standards and per capita income. At the same time, overall economic
growth is still vulnerable to agricultural volatility, and despite the improvements in social
indicators, unemployment—notably among the youth—remains a challenge.

Morocco is well-positioned to weather today’s more difficult global economic
and financial climate. With a more diversified economy, stronger public finances, and a
sound financial sector, Morocco can largely avoid negative effects from the current period of
turbulence, and continue its strong macroeconomic performance, provided policy making
remains proactive. Morocco’s political stability continues to serve the country well as it
modernizes and reforms the economy.
3.
The Article IV consultation discussions focused on the appropriate policies to
navigate the more difficult environment and achieve greater prosperity, in particular:
•
•
•

Maintaining sound public finances and addressing fiscal risks;
Pursuing appropriate monetary and financial sector policies; and
Strengthening Morocco’s integration into the world economy.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS

4.
Morocco’s recent economic performance has been favorable. Nonagricultural
GDP growth reached 6.6 percent in 2007, although overall real GDP slowed to 2.7 percent
due to a sharp fall in cereal production (Figure 1). Thus far in 2008, growth has been strong,
driven by a rebound in agriculture, continued strong private investment, and vibrant activity
in construction and services.

5
5.
Consumer price inflation remains low, in part because administered prices have
not been adjusted since the beginning of 2007. Year-on-year consumer price inflation was
2 percent in 2007 (Figure 2), down from about 3 percent in 2006, although full pass-through
of oil and wheat prices would have pushed inflation higher (administered prices account for
about 20 percent of the consumer price index). Inflation has picked up in 2008, reaching
3.7 percent in April 2008, driven mainly by sharply rising food prices.
6.
Morocco’s external position is sound. Exports have performed well, although
imports have been rising even faster, with robust demand for capital and consumer goods,
greater food imports to offset the drop in cereal production, and the rise in the world prices of
petroleum and food products. Robust tourism receipts and remittances have mostly offset the
negative trade balance, and with strong capital flows, external reserves rose from $22 billion
at end-2006 to $26.5 billion at end-May 2008, equivalent to 6.4 months of 2009 imports.
7.
Public finances further strengthened in 2007, continuing the trend of fiscal
consolidation observed over the last five years, due largely to robust revenue (Box 1).1
The overall fiscal deficit improved from

8.
Monetary policy remained geared toward maintaining low and stable inflation,
in the context of the exchange rate peg. The central bank left its key policy rate unchanged
at 3.25 percent since early 2007, and lowered reserve requirements from 16.5 percent to
15 percent in December 2007 because of reduced bank liquidity.2 Monetary aggregates
continued their strong rise, with broad money up by 15 percent (y-o-y) at end-April 2008, and
private credit rising by 28 percent (Figure 4). The current level of the dirham’s exchange rate
is broadly in line with economic fundamentals (Box 2).
1

As a result, perceptions of Morocco’s creditworthiness improved, leading two of the major rating agencies to
grant an investment grade rating to Morocco’s latest sovereign bond issue in 2007.

2

Bank liquidity fell because two former specialized state-owned banks started complying with reserve
requirements in August 2007; bank liquidity also dropped due to the strong growth in lending activity.

Box 1. Morocco’s Strong Revenue Performance
The recent improvement in Morocco’s revenue performance has been remarkable, with total tax intake
increasing by 26 percent on average each year since 2005. Tax buoyancy—defined as the responsiveness of
revenue to changes in nonagricultural GDP1—is now one of the highest in the world.
Key factors that have contributed to the revenue surge include:

Strengthening of tax administration and broader
improvements in tax compliance. The number of
firms liable for corporate income tax has increased by
25 percent in the last two years, suggesting a widening
of the tax base beyond the well-established formal
sector firms. During the same period, the number of
private sector and self-employed workers filing for
income tax increased by more than 20 percent.

Ongoing tax policy reform, particularly of the three
main taxes—VAT, and corporate and income
taxes—through the reduction in the number of
special regimes and the closing of loopholes. Key
measures include the gradual phasing out of some
region and sector-specific tax incentives. In line with
staff advice, the reform of the VAT has been at the
center of this effort. In particular, the number of
products benefiting from a reduced VAT rate has
been decreased, and the efficiency of the VAT credit
reimbursement mechanism has improved. By 2007,
the most commonly used indicator of VAT
performance—the c-efficiency ratio2—had been
brought broadly in line with international norms.

Box 2. Assessment of the Real Exchange Rate
An assessment of the real exchange rate using the CGER methodologies suggests that overall, the level of
the exchange rate is consistent with current fundamentals. Using data from the April 2008 WEO, the CGER
approaches for macroeconomic balance, external sustainability, and equilibrium real exchange rate—evaluated
by stripping out temporary factors from the 2007 current account and correcting for the lagged impact of REER
changes—show an average percentage deviation from the estimated equilibrium of the real exchange rate of
-4.5 percent.

imports due to the drought) and correcting for the lagged impact of REER changes.

Traditional indicators based on prices and current account flows provide more mixed results on
Morocco’s external competitiveness. The CPI-based real effective exchange rate (REER) has depreciated by
7 percent relative to its peak in 2000, and by end-2007 was below its 10-year average. Regarding external sector
indicators, the current account had been in balance since 2001, but in 2007 it posted a minor deficit partly owing
to poor domestic agricultural output and soaring international commodity prices. Exports of goods have
remained relatively stable in percent of GDP while market shares have declined since 1990, despite a small
upturn in 2007.
A chapter in the selected issues paper supplements this analysis with other indicators, including a number
of price-based and current account flow indicators as well as export performance. Some of these indicators
suggest competitiveness challenges at the sectoral level, but nonetheless the real exchange rate is in line with
fundamentals.

III. MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK AND RISKS
9.
Morocco is now presented with a more difficult external environment compared
to 2007. While spillovers from turmoil in global credit markets have had no discernible
impact (Box 3), external risks have been transmitted primarily through real sector channels:
•

The increase in world fuel and food prices has degraded the trade balance, and
because of subsidies, brought sizeable fiscal costs.

•

The mild growth slowdown in Europe, Morocco’s principal trade partner, is
likely to present some headwinds to growth in exports and perhaps tourism
receipts. Remittances flows, which for Morocco are not very sensitive to
economic cycles, are projected to be broadly stable.

10.
At the same time, Morocco is becoming increasingly attractive for foreign direct
investment (FDI). By emerging market standards, net FDI flows into Morocco are low, but
gross flows from the Gulf states have

reach 6½ in 2008, reflecting in part a
rebound in agriculture, before falling back a bit in 2009 as the agriculture sector returns to
trend and some limited effects from the slowdown in Europe take hold. Inflation is projected
to be around 3 percent in 2008 and 2009, and between 2½–3 percent over the medium term—
higher than projected at the time of the 2007 Article IV consultation—reflecting imported
inflation and a gradual narrowing of the gap between world and domestic prices for
subsidized goods. The external current account balance is projected to remain slightly
negative over the medium term, although with inflows of FDI expected to continue, foreign
reserves should strengthen further. Reducing unemployment, notably among the youth, will
be a key challenge for the authorities over the medium term.
12.
The risks are generally tilted to the downside. The authorities consider that the
pace of FDI, in particular from the Gulf states, could accelerate, potentially boosting growth.
At the same time, sustaining the current high investment rates and activity in construction and
services may be difficult, and the slowdown in Europe could have a greater impact than

9
Box 3. Financial Spillovers from Global Credit Turmoil
Purely financial spillovers from the global credit turmoil have so far been very limited because Morocco’s
external debt is low and its duration long, and because of strengthened macroeconomic policies.
The global credit turmoil has so far had little impact on Morocco. Financial market indicators show no
noticeable deterioration of Morocco’s

emerging markets based on such
fundamentals, and this is reflected in the small increase in Morocco’s risk perception as expressed in global
capital markets. Morocco’s major remaining vulnerability is its still high public sector debt.

The government, corporates, and banks have minimal financing—and therefore, rollover risk—from
external debt markets. Only one sovereign bond remains outstanding, worth about 1 percent of GDP and
maturing in 2017. The remainder of central government external debt (10 percent of GDP) and governmentguaranteed debt (a further 10 percent of GDP) is mostly owed to official creditors, with just 2 percent of GDP
due to foreign banks. External debt of the
private sector represents 4 percent of

Moroccan stock prices have not
noticeably softened since the onset of
the global turmoil. This may change if
recessionary tendencies elsewhere were to
affect remittances, exports, or tourism.
However, a downturn would not have

that shares are not widely held by the

anticipated. While not affecting average growth, volatility in the agriculture sector will
continue to impact total output. The balance of payments risk of higher import prices is partly
mitigated by upside risks for prices of phosphates (a key export). However, commodity prices
pose important fiscal risks in the medium term in the absence of measures to address
subsidies, notably if world prices for commodities move higher. Inflation could well be
higher than projected, largely due to imported inflation, although the authorities intend to
resist inflationary pressures and expect structural reforms to help lower domestic costs.
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Ensuring Sound Medium-Term Public Finances
13.
The authorities are committed to preserving the fiscal consolidation gains of
recent years. They reaffirmed their commitment to the 2008 budget deficit target of
3.5 percent of GDP and a medium-term objective of a deficit of no more than 3 percent of
GDP. Their fiscal outlook is predicated on sound expenditure controls and reorientation of
spending to investment and education; further strengthening tax administration and
simplifying the tax regime, with some lowering of rates; and prudent debt and treasury
management.
14.
However, the decision to not pass on increases in world commodity prices to
domestic prices poses a major challenge.
Subsidies
For 2008, subsidies are projected to rise from
(In percent of GDP)
2½ percent to 5 percent of GDP as consumer

unchanged.3 In addition, to further address a

1 percent of GDP.
15.
The authorities recognize that the fiscal outlook hinges on effectively managing
the subsidy issue, and they intend to reform the system in two broad steps:

3

The subsidy system is open-ended (i.e., not targeted), with the key subsidized products being bread, sugar,
petroleum products, and cooking gas.

11
•

In the short term, they intend to use the fiscal space to absorb the higher cost
of the subsidies. Given their concern for social and political sensitivities,
consumer confidence, and the fact that a fundamental reform of the subsidy system
will take time, the authorities have decided to adopt only a limited set of short-term
measures (with an impact of about ½ a percentage point of GDP). The authorities
indicated that these measures, which they intend to introduce shortly, would keep
the deficit in line with the 2008 budget target of 3.5 percent of GDP, and include
raising the price of products mostly consumed by higher income households and
trimming nonessential current spending.4

•

Over the medium term, the authorities intend to better target subsidies toward the
poorest segments of the population, and thus gradually unwind the universal
subsidies. These reforms would be introduced starting in 2009.

16.
Attaining the medium-term fiscal objective will also depend on curbing the
growth of other current spending and ensuring solid revenue. On the wage bill—another
major source of fiscal rigidity in the past—the authorities emphasized that increases for the
lower end of the public salary scale would be paired with tax reductions for higher paid civil
servants, consistent with their objective of keeping the wage bill under 10 percent of GDP in
the medium term. Revenue is projected to decline slightly as a share of GDP from 2010,
reflecting the expiration of some exceptional factors in 2008, and planned rate reductions in
coming years.5 The authorities were open to staff’s suggestion that a more ambitious fiscal
target, such as a small primary surplus, would lower fiscal risks, bring Morocco’s public debt
ratios closer to those of its emerging market peers, and continue to reinforce Morocco’s
attractiveness to investors.6
B. Minimizing Risks through a Stronger Financial System
17.
Overall, the financial sector is sound and resilient to shocks. Banks are generally
well-provisioned and have little foreign exposure on either the asset or liability side,
minimizing the transmission of risks from global financial markets to the real economy.
Moreover, the authorities continue to improve supervision with a view to monitoring risks
more closely as the economy opens up (Box 4).

Under the current system, diesel and gasoline subsidies disproportionately benefit higher income households.
According to the World Bank, households in the top quintile of the income distribution receive more than
three-quarters of these subsidies, while the poorest quintile receives less than one percent.

The aim is to unify progressively VAT rates and lower tax rates on personal income and business profits.

Box 4. FSAP Update: Overview and Main Recommendations
Major structural reforms have been achieved since the 2002 FSAP, and the financial sector is sound. Asset
quality in the banking sector has improved, reflecting in large part the near-completion of the restructuring of the
former specialized state-owned banks. The authorities’ strategy of further economic and financial openness—
notably through the liberalization of capital flows and increased exchange rate flexibility—presents
opportunities and challenges for regulators and supervisors, and financial institutions and markets. In this
context, the main recommendations of the report were:
• Continue strengthening banking soundness and supervision, including by reducing concentration risk in
some banks, issuing a new regulation pertaining to country and transfer risk as well as ensuring appropriate risk
management in banks, continuing training of supervisors to match the growing sophistication of the regulatory
and operational environment.
• Continue to monitor closely NPL levels in former public banks; these have declined substantially, but remain
higher than in the sector as a whole.
• Build up the preparedness of financial institutions to a more open economic and financial system, in
particular their ability to manage risks associated with potentially greater exchange and interest rate volatility;
and carry out more regular and more extreme stress tests.
• Maintain effective communication on capital account liberalization, reforms of the monetary and exchange
rate regime and their sequencing, to help financial institutions prepare for change.
• Ensure the prerequisites for further economic and financial sector liberalization, including the preconditions
for inflation targeting, are in place to be able to respond effectively to external shocks.
• Continue developing the insurance and capital markets, and payments and settlement infrastructures to
deepen financial intermediation to levels compatible with a modern and growing economy.
• Continue implementation of recommendations of the Middle East and North Africa FATF (MENAFATF)
made in 2007 to strengthen anti-money laundering and combat the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). These
include updating the legal framework and making operational the financial intelligence unit.

18.
The authorities are paying close attention to the recent brisk credit growth.
Credit grew 60 percent during April 2006–April 2008, and default rates could rise in the
coming years. However, some catch-up is at work, as financial intermediation continues to
deepen. Moreover, credit growth is broad-based, including long-term investment credit,
which bodes well for lifting potential output. Also, BAM’s latest loan officer survey suggests
tighter credit conditions for large corporates, in part to rein in concentration risk.
19.
Credit has grown fastest in real estate, reflecting pent-up housing demand in urban
areas, falling mortgage rates (to 5 percent on average in Q4 2007), and zoning restrictions
that limit land for development. But higher loan-to-value (LTV) ratios and greater use of
floating rate mortgages also suggest the surge in real estate credit has been accompanied by
somewhat looser lending standards. Although the authorities noted that floating rate
mortgages help banks contain interest rate risk, transferring too much interest rate risk to
households could produce credit risk, if reference rates increase from their current low levels.

13
20.
The authorities stressed that a three-pronged policy response is underway:
(a) enhanced surveillance of real estate lending through specific, now half-yearly surveys;7
(b) targeted on-site inspections; and (c) adoption of a code of good practice on mortgages,
with fuller disclosure of risks to prospective borrowers. Although not explicitly directed at
real estate lending, the authorities’ intention to increase the minimum capital adequacy ratio
from 8 percent to 12 percent by end-2009 would strengthen the system and be in line with
best practices in emerging markets. Finally, a credit bureau is expected to be operational in
the coming months.
C. Progress Toward a More Flexible Monetary and Exchange Rate Regime
21.
The monetary policy stance has been appropriate, and BAM is fully aware that
the road ahead may be more challenging. BAM’s decision to leave its key interest rate
unchanged reflects both its willingness to accept temporarily higher inflation from higher
import prices, and its view that the strong credit growth has not contributed to higher
inflation. Going forward, BAM and staff concurred on three upside risks to the inflation
outlook: (a) second-round effects from higher import prices; (b) potential adjustments to fuel
and food prices; and (c) the possibility that a somewhat looser fiscal stance, rapid credit
growth, and increases in disposable income via higher wages/lower tax bills could fuel
demand. BAM declared itself ready to increase policy rates to fulfill its statutory mandate of
price stability.
22.
Over the medium term, the authorities intend to move to a more flexible
exchange rate and monetary regime, which would advance Morocco’s integration into the
global economy. Important groundwork is taking place toward inflation targeting, with BAM
strengthening its analysis of the inflation process and the monetary transmission mechanism.
BAM’s communication of monetary policy has gained depth and sophistication, particularly
its dialogue with market participants. Ongoing deepening of foreign exchange and money
markets will help economic agents to manage a broader array of risks related to the
economy’s opening.
23.
The authorities are considering measures to deepen the money and foreign
exchange markets. BAM uses its 7-day main refinancing operations to implement changes
in policy rates, with the reserve requirement setting the system’s short liquidity position. Staff
and the authorities agreed that the development of the money market beyond weekly
maturities would establish timely short-term reference rates, which in turn would help deepen
the foreign exchange market.

7

In addition, BAM is working on producing reliable house price indices.

14
24.
The authorities underscored that the pace of capital account liberalization will
continue to mirror the pace at which the exchange rate gains flexibility. They noted that
the capital account liberalization measures of August 2007 have had little impact so far, but
expect they will have a greater impact when financial intermediaries develop new products
and practices. The authorities are considering next steps on exchange rate flexibility,
including potentially a gradual widening of the fluctuation band of the dirham.
D. Additional Policies to Boost Growth and Strengthen Economic Management
25.
The authorities continue to move ahead on the various regional integration
initiatives and trade liberalization efforts. A key focus will be to reduce high MFN import
tax rates. The staff noted the importance of ensuring the coherence of the different regional
accords, and stressed that further steps should not create the potential for welfare-reducing
trade diversion.
26.
The authorities are deepening structural reforms to increase productivity, boost
growth, and improve the economy’s resilience to shocks. In the agricultural sector, the
“Plan Maroc Vert” was initiated this year. This program aims to raise output, productivity,
and value added, while diversifying the choice of crops and targeting those which are less
water intensive; it also aims to use more fertile and easily accessible lands and reduce
impediments to internal trade in agricultural products. In the education sector, reforms are
ongoing to ensure a better match of skilled labor to the needs of the market. In addition, the
effort to upgrade the country’s transport infrastructure is well underway, and the authorities
plan significant investments to boost the production of electricity, including from renewable
sources.
27.
The authorities are continuing their efforts to strengthen the statistics base.
These efforts include increasing the frequency of surveys to allow the monitoring of
consumption, investment, and employment, and moving ahead on introducing a new updated
consumer price index. These efforts should allow the authorities to monitor economic
developments in real time and adjust policies as necessary.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
Morocco’s recent economic performance has been favorable, and the outlook
remains encouraging. The continued strong nonagricultural growth demonstrates that
Morocco has transitioned to a higher growth path, and the economy is now more resistant to
shocks. The country is well-placed to avoid knock-on effects from the more difficult
international environment, but there are some risks to the outlook, including that inflation
could well emerge as a more pressing challenge. Policies have been consistent with external
stability.

15
29.
The immediate policy dilemma facing the authorities is the system of universal
subsidies. The strong revenue performance of recent years, reflecting the authorities’ effort to
improve the integrity of the tax system, has provided fiscal space. Thus, in the short term, the
budget can absorb the impact of higher world prices for subsidized products without
undermining macroeconomic stability. The authorities’ commitment to the 2008 deficit target
is welcome. The planned measures should enable them to meet the target, assuming world
prices do not move much higher, and should be implemented as soon as feasible.
30.
Over the medium term, a better targeting of subsidies will be crucial. At current
world prices, the subsidies have a tremendous opportunity cost in terms of foregone public
investment and education spending, undermining medium-term growth prospects. Moreover,
not reforming the system would stall the lowering of debt ratios, with implications for risk
premia and borrowing costs in the economy, and could pose major fiscal risks and undermine
macroeconomic stability should world commodity prices move higher. Also, the gains from
past efforts to bring the wage bill under control should be preserved. Morocco would be well
served by more ambitious fiscal consolidation, which would provide greater assurances of
macroeconomic stability. Robust public finances would provide a stronger basis for moving
ahead with full convertibility and an inflation targeting framework.
31.
Morocco has made substantial progress on financial sector reform, and the
sector is sound and supervision strong. The financial sector is resilient to shocks, and little
affected by ongoing turmoil in international credit markets. Efforts to strengthen banking
supervision should continue, including reducing concentration risk and strengthening the risk
management capabilities of Moroccan financial institutions in preparation for a more open
economic and financial system.
32.
Close surveillance of rapid credit growth should continue, notably concerning
the real estate sector. Although recent credit growth represents a welcome catch-up, softer
lending standards have emerged, particularly in real estate credit. The policy response thus far
is broadly appropriate, and continued vigilance is warranted. The authorities’ intention to
raise the capital adequacy ratio to 12 percent by end-2009 is welcome, and in line with best
practices in emerging markets.
33.
In this context, the central bank’s monetary stance remains appropriate.
Inflationary pressures thus far are primarily imported, and there is little evidence of excess
domestic demand. However, the authorities should remain vigilant to second round effects,
notably as wage increases take effect and administered prices are eventually adjusted. In such
a scenario, the authorities will need to follow through on their intention to adjust rates as
needed to prevent a cementing of inflationary expectations.
34.
The exchange rate peg has served as an anchor of macroeconomic stability, and
its level appears broadly in line with fundamentals. The authorities should continue

16
preparing for an eventual move to a more flexible monetary and exchange rate regime. Their
groundwork in preparing for inflation targeting and the steps taken to improve central bank
communications are noteworthy. The authorities are advised to continue deepening the
money and foreign exchange markets. Major steps to further liberalize the capital account
should go hand in hand with progress on the flexibility of the exchange rate.
35.
Continued structural reforms will be crucial to medium-term growth prospects
and to reduce unemployment. Agriculture investment and reforms will be important to
buffer Morocco from international prices, and ensure that the sector serves as a source of
economic growth. Likewise, education reforms are needed to boost productivity and living
standards, and infrastructure investment will help reduce costs. Morocco is encouraged to
advance on trade liberalization, in particular on lowering its general tariffs.
36.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ (1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar
terms, g = real GDP growth rate, ε = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and α = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency
(ε > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both noninterest current account and nondebt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and nondebt inflows in percent of
GDP) remain at their levels of the last projection year.

Sources: Moroccan authorities; and Fund staff estimates.

Exchange Rate Arrangement and Exchange System
Morocco maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments
and transfers on current international transactions. However, Morocco maintains certain
restrictions relating to Iraq and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro),
pursuant to UN Security Council Resolutions. These are subject to notification to the Fund in
accordance with Decision 144 (52/51). The exchange rate is freely determined in the
interbank foreign exchange market, which was created in 1996. Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM)
intervenes in the market to maintain the exchange rate within its target range, defined around
a fixed central rate. Morocco has a conventional peg arrangement. The current exchange rate
of the Moroccan dirham is pegged to a basket of currencies comprising the euro and the
U.S. dollar, with respective weights of 80 and 20 percent. BAM fixes daily rates for the rated
currencies on the basis of variations on the value of the basket. Rates for most currencies
quoted in Morocco are established on the basis of the daily dirham-euro rate and the cross
rates for those currencies in relation to the euro in the international exchange markets. As of
June 13, 2008, the SDR/dirham exchange rate was SDR 1=MAD 11.97.
Article IV Consultation
Morocco is on the 12-month cycle. The last discussions of the Article IV consultation were
held in Rabat during May 31–June 11, 2007, and were concluded by the Executive Board on

ANNEX III. STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of June 18, 2008)
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. Economic and financial data have been provided
to the staff on a regular basis and most of these data are also published or made available on
publicly accessible web sites. The results of a data ROSC mission that took place in January
2002 were published in April 2003 (Country Report No. 03/92). Morocco is a SDDS
subscriber since December 2005.
Real sector
The Statistical Office rebased national accounts from 1980 to 1998 and brought it in
conformity with the System of National Accounts 1993. The series of accounts for 1998-2005
were released on October 2006, and the preliminary accounts for 2006, on June 2007. They
are also in the process of revising the consumer price index, with updated expenditure
weights based on the results of the 2001 household budget survey. A consistent monthly time
series for the producer price index (with weights derived from the 1997 annual survey) are
available.
Government finance
A February 1999 mission and a follow-up February 2000 mission advised on improvements
in the compilation of both central and local government statistics and assisted the government
in establishing appropriate consolidation procedures for a presentation of general government
data. Substantial progress has been made by the Accounting Office for the compilation of
local government data and their consolidation with central government budgetary data. The
actual use of those source data for general government compilation require critical
clarification of responsibilities between various directorates. Regarding the monthly
Treasury’s Expenditure and Revenue Table, the 2002 data ROSC mission recommended
some reclassifications (e.g., transfers and privatization), to maintain the Fonds Hassan II
within the coverage of the table, and, for dissemination purposes, to complement the table
with more details and data on financing and to improve the format of dissemination. A 2005
SDDS assessment mission prepared an action plan for the production of data on the
consolidated general government operations. A 2007 mission invited by the authorities to
conduct a government finance pilot study was unable to obtain data beyond those for
budgetary central government due to burdensome administrative procedures.
Central government finance data are generally available with a few months lag. GFS data
coverage reported for publication in the GFS Yearbook is limited to the budgetary central
government from 2005 onwards. The reporting of data on a monthly or quarterly basis for
publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS) is irregular.

7
Monetary and financial statistics
The degree of detail in the breakdown of financial assets and liabilities by resident
institutional sector could be more extensive; at present, this problem is reflected in the lack of
precision in some of the monetary aggregates, including credit indicators. A monetary and
financial statistics mission will visit Rabat during June 24–July 7, 2008. The main objectives
of the mission are (1) to improve monetary statistics to be in line with the methodology in the
Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual and (2) to assist Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM) staff in
implementing the reporting of monetary data to the Fund using the Standardized Report
Forms (SRFs).
BAM disseminates monetary and financial and other macroeconomic statistics to the general
public primarily through its website (www.bkam.ma). The statistical part of the site includes
web-based versions of the Bank’s weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual publications.
Balance of payments
The 2002 data ROSC mission found that in general the balance of payments data are in line
with the concepts and definitions set out in the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments
Manual (BPM5). However, further work is needed to implement certain recommendations on
scope, classification, and basis for recording. Thus, recent measures to exclude the effects of
changes in exchange rates from the valuation of transactions in reserve assets should be
continued, and transactions in foreign currency assets and liabilities of intermediary banks at
their correspondent banks should be excluded from transactions in reserve assets. Also, the
Office des Changes (OC) started to treat operators in free trade zones as residents since 2005.
Offshore banks located in Morocco should also be considered residents. The OC lacks a firm
legal basis for compiling and disseminating balance of payments statistics, relying for the
time being exclusively on customs and exchange control data. These data are gradually to
become less available as exchange liberalization proceeds and as participation of foreign
investors in the economy increases further. The OC has initiated legislative measures that
would give it access to statistical data collected directly from economic operators, to record
among other things, private foreign debt, and more generally the international investment
position. Furthermore, the data ROSC mission recommended the introduction of quarterly
surveys of enterprises and other agencies to improve the scope, classification, and valuation
of balance of payments transactions, in particular for goods for processing, transportation
services, and financial transactions. Since May 1998, the OC has been publishing, on its
internet site, monthly statistics on trade, tourism, private transfers, and incoming foreign
direct investment in accordance with the BPM5. The quality of balance of payments statistics
has significantly improved with the inclusion of free zones located in Morocco.
The latest BOP and IIP information received from Morocco, and published in the IFS, relates
to BOP data for first quarter of 2007 and annual IIP data for 2006. Furthermore, Morocco
reports on a regular basis international liquidity data to STA for publication in the IFS.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Morocco
July 23, 2008
1.
This statement provides additional information that has become available since the
circulation of the staff report. It does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Inflation has picked up further. Year-on-year consumer price inflation stood at
4.7 percent at end-June, up from the end-April figure of 3.7 percent reported in the staff
report. The recent boost in inflation has been driven primarily by higher prices for food items.
Nonfood inflation remains low, registering an increase of 1.4 percent year-on-year at endJune. As highlighted in the staff report, higher inflation remains a risk to the outlook.
3.
As envisaged in the staff report, the authorities adopted on July 1 a set of
measures to mitigate partly the impact of high world commodity prices on the budget.
Cuts in operating and travel expenditures for the administration are being implemented. In
addition, consumer prices have been increased for gasoline, premium diesel, and industrial
fuel by 10–17 percent (depending on the product). Subsidies for these items, however, have
not been eliminated and the prices for regular diesel fuel and cooking gas—which represent
the bulk of petroleum products consumed in Morocco—remain unchanged. Taken together,
the expected savings from the July 1 measures total half a percent of GDP, and are consistent
with the authorities’ budget deficit target of 3.5 percent of GDP.
4.
The authorities also announced in early July several planned measures to
strengthen financial sector supervision. In particular, they intend to make the insurance
supervisor an autonomous entity, and will grant full independence to the capital market
regulatory authority. These measures are in line with the recommendations of the Financial
System Stability Assessment Update.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
Morocco
On July 23, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Morocco.1
Background
Morocco’s recent economic performance has been favorable. Nonagricultural GDP growth
reached 6.6 percent in 2007, although overall real GDP slowed to 2.7 percent due to a sharp fall
in cereal production. Thus far in 2008, growth has been strong, driven by a rebound in
agriculture, continued strong private investment, and vibrant activity in construction and services.
Sound macroeconomic policies combined with sustained structural reforms and the opportunities
provided by globalization have resulted in a gradual improvement in living standards and per
capita income. However, unemployment, notably among the youth, remains a challenge.
Consumer price inflation remains low, in part because administered prices have not been
adjusted since the beginning of 2007. Year-on-year consumer price inflation was 2 percent in
2007, down from about 3 percent in 2006, and would have been higher if there had been full

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities.

2
pass-through of world oil and commodity prices on administered prices. Inflation has picked up in
2008, reaching 3.7 percent in April 2008, driven mainly by sharply rising food prices.
Morocco’s external position is sound. Exports have performed well, although imports have been
rising even faster, with robust demand for capital and consumer goods, greater food imports to
offset the drop in cereal production, and the sharp rise in the world prices of petroleum and food
products. Robust tourism receipts and remittance flows have mostly offset the negative trade
balance, and with strong capital flows, external reserves rose from $22 billion at end-2006 to
$26.5 billion at end-May 2008, equivalent to 6.4 months of 2009 imports of goods and services.
Public finances further strengthened in 2007 due largely to robust revenue. The overall fiscal
deficit improved from 2 percent of GDP in 2006 to close to balance in 2007 reflecting higher
revenue, which was only partly offset by increased capital expenditure and a pick-up in outlays
for the authorities’ open-ended subsidy system. Total government debt was 54 percent of GDP
at end 2007, down from 58 percent in 2006. Tax revenue has continued to surge during the first
quarter of 2008 but the cost of subsidies is expected to rise significantly in 2008.
Monetary policy remained geared toward maintaining low and stable inflation, in the context of
the exchange rate peg. The central bank has left its key policy rate unchanged at 3.25 percent
since early 2007, and lowered reserve requirements from 16.5 percent to 15 percent in
December 2007 because of reduced bank liquidity. Monetary aggregates continued their strong
rise, with broad money up by 15 percent (y-o-y) at end-April 2008, and private credit rising by 28
percent. The current level of the dirham’s exchange rate is broadly in line with economic
fundamentals.
Overall, the financial sector is sound and resilient to shocks. Banks are generally wellprovisioned and have little foreign exposure on either the asset or liability side, minimizing the
transmission of risks from global financial markets to the real economy. Moreover, the authorities
continue to improve supervision with a view to monitoring risks more closely as the economy
opens up.
The authorities are deepening structural reforms to increase productivity, boost growth, and
improve the economy’s resilience to shocks. These include reforms in the agricultural sector and
education, and boosting investment in infrastructure and energy. The authorities continue to
move ahead on various regional integration initiatives and trade liberalization efforts.
The authorities intend to continue publishing all documents relating to the Article IV consultation.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Morocco’s continued good economic performance, and concurred
that, owing to an increasingly diversified economy, stronger public finances, and a

3
sound financial sector, the outlook remains favorable in spite of the more difficult global
environment. Directors noted that key risks to the outlook include possible fiscal and inflation
risks stemming from continued increases in world commodity prices.
Directors noted that the remarkable fiscal consolidation efforts of recent years—which brought
the budget close to balance in 2007—have provided the fiscal space in the short term to absorb
the impact of higher world prices for subsidized products without undermining macroeconomic
stability. They welcomed the authorities’ commitment to adhere to the 2008 budget target, and
agreed that the measures announced in mid-2008 would help the authorities to meet this goal.
Directors considered however that Morocco’s universal subsidy scheme is the most important
policy issue facing the authorities. A better targeting of subsidies over the medium term will be
crucial to minimize fiscal risks and ensure adequate financing of the government’s policy
priorities. Directors noted the regressive nature of the current subsidy system, and pointed to its
high opportunity cost in terms of foregone public investment and social spending. Directors also
encouraged the authorities to preserve the gains from past efforts to bring the wage bill under
control. They noted that more ambitious fiscal consolidation would further strengthen
macroeconomic stability, and stressed that robust public finances constitute a key prerequisite to
Morocco’s planned move over the medium term to a more flexible exchange rate regime.
Directors commended the progress made in strengthening the financial sector, including with
respect to implementation of the key recommendations of the 2002 FSAP. They agreed that the
financial sector is sound and resilient to shocks, and shared the assessment that the banking
sector is stable, adequately capitalized, and profitable. Directors welcomed ongoing efforts to
strengthen banking supervision, and agreed that rapid credit growth, particularly in the real
estate sector, continues to warrant close attention.
Directors considered that the central bank’s monetary policy stance remains appropriate. They
shared the authorities’ assessment of the main upside risks to inflation, including possible
second-round effects from higher imported prices, the impact of adjustments to food and fuel
prices, and increased demand pressures. Directors praised the central bank’s determination to
defend price stability.
Directors agreed that the dirham’s peg to a basket of currencies has anchored macroeconomic
stability, and that its level appears broadly in line with fundamentals. They encouraged the
authorities to continue preparing for an eventual move to a more flexible monetary and exchange
rate regime, and welcomed the steps taken by the central bank to prepare for inflation targeting.
Directors saw the further deepening of the money and exchange rate markets as important next
steps, and encouraged the authorities to continue to ensure that the pace of further capital
account liberalization is adequately sequenced with greater exchange rate flexibility.

4
Directors stressed that continued structural reforms remain crucial to further lift growth and
reduce its volatility, and to continue to make progress in reducing unemployment. They
welcomed the authorities’ efforts to boost agricultural productivity, upgrade infrastructure, and
reform the education system. Directors encouraged Morocco to make further inroads in trade
liberalization, in particular by lowering its general tariffs.

Statement by Mohammed Daïri
Alternate Executive Director for Morocco
July 23, 2008
My authorities asked me to convey their appreciation and gratitude to staff for the highquality papers and the useful policy dialogue in the context of the Article IV discussions and
the FSAP Update, and to the Board and Management for their valuable support and advice.
Supported by prudent macroeconomic policies and broad structural reforms as well as strong
investor confidence, underpinned by an open political and social system, Morocco has
continued to make progress in improving growth performance and the standards of living of
the population despite a challenging economic environment. The economy has reached a
higher growth trajectory, with real GDP growth increasing by close to 6 percent on average
since 2002, driven mainly by private consumption and investment, and unemployment
declining from 11.6 percent to less than 10 percent. While the economy suffered from a very
severe drought and the sharp increase in international fuel and food prices in 2007, it
remained remarkably resilient, reflecting significant progress in diversification, and exhibited
a very satisfactory overall performance. Real GDP increased by 2.7 percent in 2007, with
nonagricultural sectors growing by 6 percent, and inflation was brought down to 2 percent
from 3.3 percent in 2006. A surge in tax revenue led to a significant fiscal overperformance,
with the overall fiscal position close to balance as against a budget deficit target of 3 percent
and the debt-to-GDP ratio declining further. The external current account remained broadly
in equilibrium, although fuel and food imports increased by 2.3 percent of GDP, reflecting
Morocco’s high dependence on energy and cereals imports. Reserves increased further,
including from strong FDI, and external debt indicators continued to improve. Strong
incomes growth and increased social spending, mainly on health, education, and rural
development, including under the priority Human Development National Initiative (INDH)
program, led to a substantial decline in poverty from 19% in 1998-99 to 9% in 2007. With
cereal production in 2008 recovering close to its long-term average and continued buoyant
nonagricultural sector, growth is projected to recover to 6 ½ -7 percent. While the impact of
the global financial turbulence on the economy has been limited, spillover effects from the
weakening of growth in major trading partners should not be ruled out.
Outstanding tax revenue performance,
Recent progress made in reforming the tax system, reducing exemptions, and strengthening
tax administration, as well as strong contribution from high growth sectors and higher tax
compliance, has significantly improved tax buoyancy, leading to a sharp increase in revenue,
notwithstanding further reductions in import duties under FTAs with the EU and other

2
partners. The tax revenue-to-GDP ratio, which increased by 2.1 percentage points during the
two previous years, gained an additional 3.1 percentage points in 2007. This performance is
likely to be sustained, as evinced by strong revenue continuing through June 2008.
...along with expenditure control and rationalization, have created fiscal space to absorb
the exogenous shocks,
The authorities attach high priority to rationalizing expenditure and reducing budget
rigidities. The escalating trend in the wage bill through 2005 was reversed in 2006 following
the success of the voluntary retirement program. The net gain from the program, combined
with continued restrictive recruitment policy, contributed to a decline in the wage bill as a
share of GDP of 1.2 percentage points. Revenue performance and prudent spending have
created crucial fiscal space, which is being used temporarily to absorb the impact of the
increase in fuel and food prices, pending completion of the ongoing work on the reform of
the subsidy system. The authorities’ immediate concern was to prevent the kind of social
unrest that has affected many countries in the Middle East and Africa recently. They
responded in 2007 by reducing tariffs on cereals and milk imports and keeping the prices of
subsidized food and fuel prices unchanged. While cognizant of the inefficiencies of the
subsidy system, they were also concerned by the effect of rising fuel prices on consumption
and economic activity.
...further reduce the fiscal deficit and the debt-to-GDP ratio,
The overall deficit declined by 5% of GDP since 2005. This improvement reflects not only
the impact of revenue performance, but also a decline in expenditure to GDP ratio,
notwithstanding the higher capital expenditure and food and fuel subsidies. As a result, the
debt–to-GDP ratio, which declined by 5 percentage points in 2006, was reduced further by
4.5 percentage points in 2007.
... and start a program of tax rate reduction.
Strong tax revenue performance also provides a window of opportunity for reducing tax rates,
consistent with recent trend in emerging market countries and to enhance incentives for
investment, job creation, and productivity. The marginal income tax rate was reduced by 2
percentage points in each of 2007 and 2008, together with an increase in the taxation
threshold, and the corporate tax rate was reduced from 35% to 30% in 2008. Further
reductions are contemplated, contingent on progress in broadening the tax base.
The authorities are fully committed to their fiscal consolidation targets,
The authorities are committed to maintaining the overall deficit in 2008 at 3 percent of GDP,
in line with their original budget target and their medium-term objective, despite the increase
in the subsidy cost. The moderate increase in public sector wages, mainly benefiting the

3
lowest salary grades, should not derail the wage bill from its declining trend as a ratio to
GDP. The extension of social negotiations to include not only wages but also income tax
reductions helped moderate the wage increase. Moreover, effective July 1, the authorities
increased fuel prices of products that are not highly economically or socially sensitive by
between 11% and 17%, with a full year impact of 0.3 percent of GDP. They have also
decided to increase contribution from highly profitable public enterprises (0.15 %) and to cut
nonessential spending (0.1%). A decree providing the additional budget appropriations to
finance the increase in subsidies will be adopted shortly.
The authorities consider that achieving their medium-term fiscal consolidation target is
crucial to preserve fiscal sustainability and create the conditions for faster and more
sustainable growth and greater integration into the world economy. In this regard, they attach
high priority to replacing current universal subsidies with a well-targeted system. Work is
underway to identify available options and mechanisms, drawing on successful experiences
with World Bank support. However, the challenge of establishing an efficient and credible
targeting system should not be underestimated and the authorities recognize the importance
of ensuring the necessary conditions for its successful implementation. They also intend to
keep the wage bill firmly under control, including through a prudent wage and recruitment
policy and a comprehensive reform of the civil service carried out with World Bank support.
The authorities appreciate the useful exchange of views with the mission and the interesting
Selected Issues paper on the medium-term budget. Although the accelerated adjustment
scenario is attractive, they consider the baseline scenario as more realistic and balanced,
given the overarching social objectives. They believe, however, that the projected decline in
the tax-to-GDP ratio under the baseline scenario is too pessimistic in view of the improved
tax buoyancy. Moreover, in Morocco’s circumstances, the impact of the growth shock on the
fiscal position in the sustainability analysis should be assessed in relation to nonagricultural
GDP, in view of the large volatility of agricultural production and the fact that tax revenue
from this sector is marginal. This being said, they remain open to exploring the possibility of
a faster fiscal consolidation path and adopting a fiscal rule to better anchor fiscal policy.
Strengthened monetary policy framework has enhanced its effectiveness,
The governance structure of Bank-Al Maghrib (BAM) has been modernized, following the
adoption of a new central bank charter that established its independence, and the monetary
policy framework has been strengthened, with transparency of monetary policy brought in
line with best international practices. BAM strengthened its research and analytical capacity
in monitoring economic activity, analyzing price developments, and forecasting inflation,
thereby improving effectiveness of monetary policy. These enhancements place the central
bank in a favorable position to adopt an inflation targeting framework.

4
In view of its assessment of economic trends and its inflation forecasts, on the one hand, and
the risks from lower domestic food supply, higher international energy prices, and high credit
growth, on the other, the central bank’s Board decided during its regular meetings in 2007 to
maintain the policy rate unchanged at 3.25 percent, while calling for vigilance. In an overall
tight liquidity environment, following a period of 6 years of excess liquidity, BAM’s
interventions aimed at ensuring that the interbank rate remained within close range of the
policy rate. In view of the structural nature of the tight bank liquidity situation, the reserve
requirement was lowered by 1½ percent at the end of the year.
BAM is closely monitoring the pick-up in inflation since the beginning of 2008, much of it
stemming mainly from imported food prices. During its March meeting, the central bank’s
Board kept the policy rate unchanged, with its central inflation forecast for 2008 at 2.2%, and
called for high vigilance in view of the persistence of upside risk factors. In its June 2008
meeting, the central bank’s Board raised its central inflation forecast through March 2009 to
2.7 percent and decided to keep its policy rate unchanged, while emphasizing the need for
greater vigilance in view of the upside risks from further increases in international
commodity prices and uncertainties regarding domestic price adjustments, as well as from
credit growth and recent wage increases. The central bank will continue to monitor closely
any signs of second round effects and of transmission of tradable goods prices to
nontradables and will remain vigilant to preserve the credibility of monetary policy.
...with BAM closely monitoring credit developments.
The authorities view the recent surge in credit growth as reflecting the strong growth
performance, as well as successful efforts to promote competition among banks and improve
SMEs’ access to credit. Credit to real estate and consumption is increasing at a high rate, but
from a relatively low level. Real estate credit is driven mainly by the acute shortage in lowincome housing and government incentives, including greater availability of land for housing
projects. BAM is closely monitoring credit developments and bank risks, including through
regular surveys, and has called for banks’ increased vigilance and development of a code of
ethics in real estate financing. The implementation of Basel II (standardized approach) in
June 2007 and IFRS in January 2008 have significantly enhanced the regulatory framework.
While the FSAP Update has confirmed the soundness of the financial sector,
Considerable progress has been made in improving the soundness of the financial sector and
in financial deepening, including in implementing the 2002 FSAP recommendations. The
authorities share the mission’s view that the banking sector is “stable, adequately capitalized,
profitable, and resilient to shocks.” Following completion of their restructuring, the public
financial institutions are now broadly compliant with prudential regulations. NPLs have
declined significantly and their provisioning has increased. Strengthening of BAM’s
regulatory powers, as provided for in the new banking law, and of its risk assessment and

5
human resources, and close coordination among financial sector supervisors have also
improved the regulatory framework. The stock market performance has remained strong,
reflecting the economy’s sound fundamentals and highly successful new listings. As
indicated in the FSSA, banks’ direct exposure to the stock market is limited.
...the authorities are committed to continue improving its soundness and resilience.
Although the solvency of the banking sector is broadly adequate, BAM has increased the
capital adequacy ratio from 8 percent to 10 percent at end-2008 and has announced its
intention to increase it further on a selective basis to 12 percent at end-2009, depending on
banks’ risk profile. A directive containing new rules on country and transfer risk was adopted
on July 8, in line with the FSAP Update recommendations, and will be published shortly. A
new credit bureau is slated to start its operations soon. Also in line with the FSAP Update
recommendations, the authorities announced on July 15, that the supervisors of the capital
market and the insurance sector would be granted full independence and that the public
financial institutions will be open further to private capital. The financial intelligence unit
will be operational soon, following the recent adoption of the appropriate regulation, thereby
completing the new AML/CFT framework. These reforms will help prepare the financial
sector for greater competition in a globalized environment and for transforming Casablanca
into a regional financial center.
Exchange rate policy is appropriate and external developments are favorable,
The authorities share staff conclusions that the exchange rate peg has served as a useful
anchor to macroeconomic stability and that the exchange rate level is broadly in line with
economic fundamentals. The increase in food and oil prices and a possible slowdown in
tourism and workers remittances in 2008, following lower growth in Europe, are expected to
be largely offset by higher exports of phosphates and derivatives, supported by higher world
prices. While the current account deficit is expected to increase marginally to 0.7 percent of
GDP, it will be more than offset by continued high FDI, leading to a further reserves buildup. The medium-term outlook is also favorable, with continued strong external position,
supported by growth in traditional and nontraditional exports of goods and rising exports of
services as well as FDI inflows.
Following the additional liberalization measures enacted in 2007, which signaled their
commitment in this area, the authorities intend to move gradually to full capital account
liberalization. Work is underway to meet all the prerequisites to a successful transition,
including continued progress in strengthening the fiscal position and the financial sector and
in modernizing the monetary framework. Preparations are well advanced for the adoption of
inflation targeting and greater exchange rate flexibility, including through appropriate

6
communication of the authorities’ intentions and enhancing preparedness of economic agents
to the transition. In the meantime, consideration is given to measures to deepen the foreign
exchange market, including a widening of the band.
...with continued structural reforms to enhance competitiveness and growth potential.
Significant advances have been made in improving the business climate, further liberalizing
the economy, and alleviating impediments to private sector development. In close
coordination with the business community, the authorities have developed a number of
strategies to increase investment and productivity in sectors of the economy with high growth
potential, including textiles, tourism, offshoring, agriculture. A strategy for the energy sector,
for which donor support has been earmarked, has been announced recently. Major port
facilities and infrastructure projects, with private sector contribution, and development of
new high value-added activities, including IT and related services, automobiles, and aircraft
components, are reflecting increased attractiveness of the economy to investors and reshaping
the economic landscape. Greater attention is given to improving the education system and
accelerating training programs to meet the growing demand for qualified work force.
The authorities are committed to regional and multilateral trade liberalization, including in
services. While they view Morocco’s membership in a number of bilateral and regional FTAs
as opportunities to strengthen growth and export performance, they will continue to reduce
MFN tariffs to avoid trade diversion. They attach the utmost importance to Maghreb
integration and will continue to work closely with their partners to foster cooperation and
intraregional trade and investment.
