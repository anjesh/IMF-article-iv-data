STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 11, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Outlook and risks. The economy will remain vulnerable over the medium term, with
sluggish real GDP growth, rising public debt and widening external current account
deficits. International reserves could decline to uncomfortably low levels. The financial
system would continue to be hampered by high NPLs and low capital buffers, especially
at a systemic bank. Main fiscal risks include a court decision that could lead to a larger
than expected compensation to the former owners of the nationalized companies,
weaknesses in a systemic bank, and the cost of the new public bank.
Focus of the Consultation. Discussions focused on measures that would place public
debt on a sustainable path; address weaknesses in the financial system, particularly in a
systemic bank; buttress external sector resilience; and enhance competitiveness and
inclusive growth.
Key policy advice.


Improve the primary fiscal balance to about 4.5 percent of GDP starting in 2015. This
could be achieved mainly by allowing spending on goods and services to rise only in
line with inflation; containing the expansion in the wage bill; requiring public workers to
contribute to their pensions; and by widening the tax base and strengthening revenue
administration. Active debt management, including refinancing of expensive debt with
low-earning deposits (essentially from PetroCaribe), would support these efforts.



Address banking sector vulnerabilities through improving capital buffers.



Improve public financial management (PFM) to contain low-quality spending,
strengthen budget formulation, preparation, and execution, and improve the coverage
and accuracy of budget documents.



Further improve the business environment to attract more private investment, boost
competitiveness, and enhance job-creating and inclusive growth.

Implementation of staff advice. Implementation of recent staff advice is mixed. The
breathing room provided by the debt restructuring was not used to improve the primary
fiscal balance. The authorities plan to review exemptions and zero-ratings under the GST.

BACKGROUND
1.
The political outlook, including the forthcoming municipal elections in March 2015,
is building pressure for more government spending. The government created a new public
bank in September 2013 that would essentially provide loans to public employees and teachers
on concessional terms. Recently, it announced sizeable wage increases for public employees and
committed to allocating half of the annual growth in recurrent revenues to increases in public
sector wages during FY2014/15–FY2016/17.

2.
Social challenges remain daunting, adding to spending pressures. Unemployment
stood at 14.2 percent in September 2013 and is on Unemployment Rate
an upward trend since it hit its lowest level in 2008 (percent)
18
(Text chart). The latest country poverty
assessment (CPA) was conducted in 2009, which
16
showed that poverty increased substantially since
the previous assessment in 2002. The share of
14
households living in poverty increased from
12
25 percent to 33 percent, with the share living in
severe poverty rising from 8 to 10 percent. Poverty 10
increased mainly because of stagnating economic
8
growth. According to the 2013 UN Global Study
Sept. 2013 =
14.2%
on Homicide, Belize has one of the world’s highest
6
homicide rates with 44.7 homicides per 100,000
inhabitants.

3.
The authorities’ track record in implementing recent Fund advice has been mixed.
They agreed to large wage increases for public employees, and the fiscal space created by the
debt restructuring of March 2013 has not been used to put the fiscal position on a sustainable
path. In particular, the primary surplus remains well below levels recommended by staff. On tax
reform, the authorities still plan to review the list of exemptions and zero-ratings under the GST.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
4.

Macroeconomic performance has weakened (Figures 1–5):



Real GDP growth plummeted to 0.7 percent in 2013, from 4 percent in 2012, mainly due
to continued declines in oil production and weak agricultural output, especially sugarcane
and citrus. Average inflation eased to 0.5 percent from 1.3 percent a year ago, as commodity
price pressures abated. In March 2014, inflation picked up to 1.4 percent (y/y), mainly as a
result of higher prices in the food and housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels
categories.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELIZE



The external current account deficit widened to 4.5 percent of GDP in 2013 up from
1.2 percent in 2012, as exports of oil and agricultural products fell sharply, while
imports of fuel and electricity picked up. In January–February 2014, export revenues fell by
16.5 percent (y/y), as higher receipts from shrimp and lobster could not compensate for
lower earnings from citrus, banana, petroleum and sugar. Imports fell by 1.0 percent, mainly
due to reductions in electricity imports. International reserves improved to 4.7 months of
imports at end-March 2014 (up from 3.3 months at end-2012) mainly owing to PetroCaribe
financing and private inflows.



The primary surplus for FY2013/14 (fiscal year ends in March) is estimated to have
fallen to 1 percent of GDP, from 1.4 percent of GDP in FY2012/13. Revenue is expected
to be better-than-budgeted, as robust tax revenues more than offset the decline in non-tax
revenues. However, substantial increases in wages and salaries, transfers and interest
payments drove up current expenditure. Capital expenditures were higher than budgeted
because of the need to rebuild the infrastructure that was badly damaged by rain.



Credit growth and monetary policy continued to be hampered by weaknesses in the
financial system, including in a systemic bank. Private sector credit grew by 3.8 percent
(y/y) in March 2014, while broad money grew by 5.2 percent. The banking system remained
highly liquid. At end-March 2014, commercial banks’ excess cash reserves and liquid assets
reserves were respectively 120 percent and 70 percent of requirements. In one domestic
bank, excess liquidity is over 200 percent of required reserves, and accounts for 60 percent of
system’s total. High liquidity levels have helped to keep T-bill rates below 1 percent, and
commercial banks’ lending rates are slowly declining. While declining, non-performing loans
(NPLs) remained high at 16.7percent of total loans at end-March 2014. The banking system’s
capital adequacy ratio (CAR) improved to 23.4 percent, but still masks weaknesses in a
systemic bank. Loan write-offs by the banking system amounted to 2.5 percent of private
sector credit in 2013, and total loan write-offs for the last three years represented 3.4 percent
of total assets of the banking system at end-2013.



The authorities stepped up their efforts to address other weaknesses of the financial
system, including the adoption of new AML/CFT legislation after the Caribbean Financial
Action Task Force decided in November 2013 to call for counter measures against Belize due
to unresolved AML/CFT deficiencies (Annex I). After the CFATF’s November statement, some
foreign financial institutions have started to put restrictions on their transactions with Belize,
though the impact remains limited. The CFAFT public statement of May 2014 noted that
Belize had made significant progress in addressing its AML/CFT deficiencies.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS
5.
Staff’s assessment of the medium-term outlook is worse than envisaged during the
2013 Article IV Consultation. Real GDP growth would be weaker than expected in the near term
but hover around 2.5 percent over the medium term as declining oil production would be
partially offset by higher output of other commodity exports, tourism and construction. Inflation
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELIZE

would remain low owing to the exchange rate peg and subdued inflation in trading partners. The
authorities’ medium-term policy plans would maintain the primary surplus around 1 percent of
GDP, as in FY2013/14 (Annex II). However, the fiscal outturn in FY2013/14 is considerably worse
than expected, and the government’s gross financing requirement in 2017–2019 has been
revised upward considerably. In this context, the low primary surpluses together with the
recognition of debt related to nationalizations (see paragraph 8) would bring the public debt-toGDP ratio to about 90 percent by FY2019/20, more than 5 percentage points of GDP above
projections during the 2013 Article IV Consultation. Debt sustainability would remain uncertain
(Annex III). Expansionary fiscal policies, including large wage increases, would fuel higher
domestic consumption and upward pressures on the external current account deficit.
International reserves would decline substantially to very uncomfortable levels over the medium
term as a result of both shortfalls in capital inflows needed to finance the current account deficit
and the assumed repatriation of compensation payments for the nationalized companies.
PetroCaribe flows will continue to play a major role in the financing of the budget and the
external current account deficit. From the perspective of external stability, the exchange rate is
estimated to be moderately overvalued, reflecting the current unsustainable policy mix
(Annex IV).
6.
Risks continue to be tilted to the downside and the fiscal impact of key new
vulnerabilities could reach several percentage points of GDP (Annex V). Main risks to the
baseline include lower-than-projected primary balances; a court decision that leads to a larger
than expected compensation to the former owners of the nationalized companies (see
paragraph 8); banking sector vulnerabilities, especially the systemic bank’s low capital buffers;
fiscal risks from state-owned entities (Annex VI); the cost of the new public bank; and the cost of
new policy initiatives such as the expansion of the national health insurance scheme (Annex VII).
Additional external vulnerabilities could arise from a protracted period of weak growth in
advanced economies or the end of PetroCaribe financing, which could lead to faster erosion of
the international reserve cushion. New oil discoveries and growth-enhancing projects that are
currently being implemented or envisaged could mitigate these risks.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Staff urged the authorities to put the fiscal position on a sustainable path and create the buffers
needed to address mounting vulnerabilities and emerging risks, while boosting inclusive growth
prospects. It also encouraged them to continue strengthening the financial sector and buttressing
external sector resilience.

A. A More Ambitious Fiscal Stance to Restore Debt Sustainability and
Create Credible Policy Buffers
7.
Staff urged the authorities to set fiscal policy to reduce public debt to 70 percent of
GDP by FY2019/20, compared with a target of 75 percent of GDP in last year’s Article IV

BELIZE

Consultation (Text Table 1). The authorities’ current fiscal strategy leaves the country in a
highly vulnerable position, introduces significant rigidities in the budget, and does not
sufficiently provide for growth-enhancing expenditures (Annex II). In this context, staff
recommended that the authorities raise the primary surplus to 3.5 percent of GDP in FY2014/15
and then raise it further closer to 4–5 percent of GDP in the medium term to bring debt to about
70 percent of GDP by FY2019/20. Continued efforts afterwards would further reduce debt to
below 60 percent of GDP a few years later, a debt target the authorities should adopt for the
medium-to-long term.

Staff continues to assume that courts would decide in 2016 that the government
owes compensation equivalent to about 20 percent of GDP to the former owners of the
nationalized companies, including capitalized accrued interest (Text Table 2). 1,2 The

On May 15, the Court of Appeal ruled that nationalizations of BTL and BEL were constitutional. Both claimants
are expected to appeal this decision in the Caribbean Court of Justice, where the final ruling on constitutionality
could be issued by March 2015. Settlement on the compensation amounts could take another 12–18 months.

Electricity Limited (BEL) constitutes the government’s largest contingent liability. Staff assumes
that the liability would amount to the mid-point between the government’s valuation of the
companies at end-2012 (US$85 million) and the former owners’ valuation (US$450 million), and
adds capitalized accrued interest up to 2016, using an interest rate of about 8 percent. Staff
further assumed that compensation would be paid in five installments, staring in 2017, adding to
external outflows.

A combination of revenue, expenditure, public financial management, and debt
management measures would help achieve credible fiscal consolidation (Text Table 3).


Revenue measures. A recent FAD TA report suggests that the authorities can realistically
collect more than 1–2 percent of GDP of additional non-oil revenue by removing exemptions
and zero-ratings from the GST. Staff also urged the authorities to step up efforts to
modernize tax administration, including by making greater use of information technology
and by frequently publishing reports that would make revenue administration accountable.
Currently, less than a third of active businesses registered with the tax administration are
current on their tax filing obligations. The ratio of import duty to total imports and the ratio
of GST collected on imports to total imports are both close to 4 percent. Import duty rates
range from 10 to 90 percent and the GST rate is 12.5 percent. Exemptions and zero-ratings
are unlikely to explain such underperformance in revenue collection.



Expenditure measures. Staff encouraged the authorities to undo their recent commitment
to allocate half of the annual growth in recurrent revenue to raise public wages. Staff also
encouraged both the authorities and labor unions to adopt a wage negotiation framework
that would ensure fiscal sustainability and presented an example of such a framework.3 Staff
noted that primary expenditures can also be contained by freezing spending on goods and
services in real terms; limiting the wage bill and wage-related outlays under transfers by
letting the public labor force decline through attrition; asking public employees to contribute

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELIZE

10 percent of their wages to their pension fund, which is currently noncontributory; and
adjusting pensions only with changes in the cost of living. Staff encouraged the authorities to
update the legislation on pensions, which should increase flexibility in adjusting parameters
of the pension scheme, including contribution rates and the maximum pensionable salary, to
support fiscal consolidation and strengthen the actuarial position of pension funds.


Public Financial Management (PFM). Staff urged the authorities to strengthen PFM in
general and procurement in particular, which would help control outlays on goods and
services. The government’s financial statements for the last three fiscal years must be
submitted to the Auditor General and then to parliament so that the related budget review
laws can be passed by parliament. Staff commended the authorities for successfully
completing the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment and
encouraged them to implement its recommendations, which include strengthening internal
controls and the internal audit function. Further progress in this area will also help control
low-quality spending.



Debt management. The forthcoming IMF TA mission on debt management will help
establish a sound debt management framework and identify effective refinancing and
borrowing strategies.

10.
Staff emphasized the risks of a weak fiscal adjustment. The path of debt would be
well above levels considered as sustainable by staff, undermining the authorities’ credibility and
investors’ confidence. As recent experience elsewhere in Caribbean countries shows, unfavorable
developments in the global economy have the potential to quickly deplete Central Bank’s
reserves and force governments to borrow in international markets at very high interest rates just
to rebuild reserves. Finally, a higher debt path would translate into higher debt service going
forward, crowding out growth-enhancing spending.

Authorities’ views
11.
The authorities noted that Belize’s debt should be in the range of 60–65 percent of
GDP to be considered sustainable in their view. They clearly acknowledged that such a debt
target will create the policy buffers they need to face adverse shocks requiring public

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

BELIZE

intervention such as those described by staff (see paragraph 6). This lower debt would also create
additional fiscal space by reducing interest payments and would reduce gross financing needs as
well as the associated risks. They concurred with staff that achieving such a debt target in the
medium term would require an annual primary balance close to 5 percent of GDP.
12.
The authorities did not commit to any specific measure to achieve their debt target
of 60-65 percent of GDP. As indicated in the Prime Minister’s 2014 budget speech, the
authorities will set up a committee to review the list of exempted and zero-rated items under the
GST. They agreed to hold revenue administration more accountable. They were fully cognizant of
the risks of largely relying on revenue measures to achieve significant fiscal consolidation. They
pointed out that back tracking on their commitments under the February 2014 wage agreement
is not politically feasible. However, they were determined to implement a fiscally sustainable
wage negotiation framework, and plan to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with
labor unions on such a framework.4 The permanent committee established under the 2014 wage
agreement will help identify savings in the budget, including through tighter controls on
spending on goods and services as well as on recruitments and ghost workers in the public
service. The tasks of the permanent committee will be extended to also consider reforms in the
pension framework in collaboration with all stakeholders.
13.
The authorities reiterated that the true value of the nationalized companies is
closer to the government’s valuation and should courts adopt it, the macroeconomic
outlook would be better than staff’s baseline projections. With the authorities’ valuation of
nationalized companies at 8 percent of GDP (BZ$281 million), debt would decline to about
75 percent of GDP by 2019 under current policies and the reserves cover would decline to about
3 months of imports (Text Table 4). With this more favorable outlook on debt and reserves, the
fiscal measures the authorities will put forward in the coming months combined with better
growth prospects than staff’s projections, if upside risks materialize (see paragraph 6), should
help them reach their debt target in the medium term.

B. A Stronger Financial System to Reduce Financial Stability and Fiscal
Risks
14.
Belize’s financial sector continues to strengthen owing to implementation of key
recommendations of the 2011 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP).5 Progress in
strengthening banks’ balance sheets is visible as banks’ NPLs have been on a declining trend,
including because of loan write-offs (Text Table 5). CARs and provisioning of NPLs have also
been improving. Since the 2011 FSAP, loan classification strengthened in line with FSAP
recommendations and banks have been addressing the resulting shortfalls in provisioning. They
have until 2016 to bring the level of provisions up to standards and most banks are on track to
meeting their bank-specific deadlines. The new loan classification and provisioning rules force
banks to focus more on the borrower’s capacity to repay their loan rather than on the value of
the loan’s collateral. A revised Domestic Banks and Financial Institutions Act addressed a number
of gaps identified by the FSAP mission, including related party transactions, consolidated
supervision and bank resolution. It also strengthened Central Bank powers, including by raising
penalties for violating central bank regulations and guidelines.

15.
Nonetheless, Belize’s financial sector remains vulnerable and merits very close
monitoring. NPLs remain high, especially at a systemic bank (32 and 35 percent of domestic
banks’ assets and deposits respectively), and capital buffers may be overestimated because
provisioning of NPLs is still insufficient. Moreover, banking system stress tests suggests that with
the exception of two banks, capital buffers may not be large enough to absorb sizable but
plausible losses.
16.
Staff encouraged the authorities to undertake an asset quality review (AQR) of all
banks. The AQR would provide a thorough review of banks’ portfolios and complement reviews
from the Central Bank’s examiners. Staff also urged the Central Bank to go beyond the static
banks’ portfolios stress tests and start conducting forward-looking ones, in line with those
conducted by the 2011 FSAP mission. An update of the 2011 FSAP stress tests that staff has
conducted in collaboration with the authorities point to capital shortfalls in some adverse
scenarios.
17.
Staff also encouraged the authorities to further strengthen the Central Bank’s
supervision department. In particular, examiners specializing in information technologies
should be recruited. Staff also urged the authorities to request IMF TA to further strengthen the
management of the Central Bank’s supervision department and to provide guidance on the
classification of loans and their provisioning under IFRS.
18.
Staff encouraged the authorities to step up efforts to address remaining
weaknesses in the financial system. The authorities are using the 2011 FSAP recommendations
as a base for their financial sector reforms, and significant progress was highlighted during the
2013 Article IV Consultation. Nonetheless, notable weaknesses remain. The Central Bank should

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELIZE

be able to enforce remedial action on banks without prior consultation with or approval of the
Minister of Finance. Improvements are also needed in the frameworks for international banking,
credit unions, domestic insurance, financial stability analysis, crisis management and bank
resolution, and AML/CFT, notably with regard to transparency and regulation of international
business companies (IBCs) and trusts.

Authorities’ views
19.
The authorities will continue to strengthen their supervisory and crisis management
frameworks. They agreed with the thrust of banking system stress tests’ results that were
prepared by staff (see paragraph 16), and they will continue to improve their own stress testing
capacity. They took note of the usefulness of asset quality reviews of banks, but they did not
commit to undertake them. They emphasized that a Financial Management Plan for Banks and
Financial Institutions has been prepared and the various elements of this plan are currently under
review, including emergency liquidity assistance to solvent institutions, a deposit insurance
scheme, and the resolution process for insolvent institutions.
20.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to addressing remaining weaknesses in
the financial system, including their supervisory framework.

On Central Bank independence, the authorities agreed that ideally, approval from the
Ministry of Finance should not be required when the Central Bank has to impose corrective
measures to strengthen a weak bank or safeguard the financial system. However, they noted that
the Ministry of Finance’s approval was introduced in the Domestic Banks and Financial
Institutions Act (2012) to prevent abuses and ensure strong policy coordination. They
emphasized that for a small economy like Belize, the impact of Central Bank actions can easily be
magnified. They insisted that the current Domestic Banks and Financial Institutions Act (2012)
was a major improvement on the previous law.

As per remaining reforms, the authorities plan to hire an in-house legal expert to
further strengthen the Central Bank’s legal capacity. Notable progress was made in laying the
groundwork for the establishment of a national credit bureau. The Central Bank has also made
further progress in modernizing Belize's national payments system. A very critical part of the
project, namely the legal framework, is expected to be completed this year. The authorities
agreed to request TA from the IMF as recommended by staff.

C. More Proactive Policies to Buttress External Sector Resilience, and
Enhance Competitiveness and Inclusive Growth
21.
Staff urged the authorities to further accelerate the implementation of policies that
would buttress external sector resilience, enhance competitiveness and support privatesector-led and inclusive growth. Such policies and reforms are even more important now that
wage increases will likely weaken competitiveness and reduce significantly any projected fiscal

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

BELIZE

space, leaving little room for growth-enhancing public investment. The fiscal consolidation path
proposed by staff would initially have an adverse impact on growth and improve the current
account through import contraction (Text Table 1).6 However, as interest rates decline, banks’
balance sheets strengthen and investors’ confidence rises with better fiscal management and
other reforms described in this section and above, private-sector led growth would pick up,
supported by stronger exports and foreign direct investment. Given the small size of the Belizean
market, policies will have to significantly rely on foreign markets and investors and diversify the
export base. It will be important to reassure investors that additional nationalizations of private
companies are not part of the country’s development strategy. With its huge land mass (23,000
sq km for a population of only 341,000), Belize could attract greater foreign direct investment,
including in agriculture and tourism, well-designed public-private partnerships, and the
accompanying human capital and know-how to further develop domestic human and physical
capital, raise productivity and gain greater access to foreign markets.
22.
Growth, competitiveness and external sector stability and resilience are intertwined
in Belize. Belize can only grow by attracting foreign investment in the context of macroeconomic
stability in general and external stability in particular. Given the small overvaluation of the real
effective exchange rate and the importance of preserving the exchange rate peg, policies should
aim at enhancing external price competitiveness and at improving the current account balance to
levels consistent with external stability (about -3 percent of GDP). Enhancing external price
competitiveness could be achieved by further reducing production costs, including the cost of
doing business. Fiscal, monetary, and financial sector policies that could help achieve this
objective are described below. Other measures include public sector wage policies that take into
account the impact of wage policy on competitiveness and fiscal sustainability, quicker judicial
resolution of contract disputes and implementation of reforms that make it easier to start a new
business and to register property. Greater flexibility in labor markets, especially working hours,
and greater liberalization of the economy would foster Belize’s competitiveness.
23.
Fiscal policies could better promote inclusive growth. Tax policy should aim at
reducing or eliminating government charges that raise labor costs, especially for low-skilled
workers. Measures that would help recoup foregone revenue were discussed during the 2013
Article IV Consultation. They include removing exemptions and zero-ratings on the GST,
broadening the base of the business income tax to include capital gains and income from capital,
and discontinuing tax and dividend holidays for specific economic zones. On the spending side,
the overarching objective should be to enhance human and physical capital, and private sector
involvement is crucial given the reduced fiscal space. In particular, education programs have to
provide skills needed in the evolving job market, and health program must be means-tested.

6

The assumed low multipliers (-0.3 in 2014 and -0.2 in 2015) are in line with regional estimates and reflect the
openness of the Belizean economy.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELIZE

Physical infrastructure must be enhanced in agricultural areas. Public spending should also aim at
promoting e-government, further improving public safety and reinforcing institutions, including
the judiciary and the land registry. Strengthening PFM, including procurement and the budget
process itself would help reduce low-quality spending and create more room for pro-growth and
pro-poor spending.
24.
Monetary and financial sector policies should be geared toward stronger and
affordable credit to the private sector, including farmers and other small businesses that
employ low-skilled workers. There is no reason to maintain an interest rate floor of 2.5 percent
on savings deposits. This clearly raises the cost of financial intermediation and negatively impacts
the cost of credit. Moreover, with banks’ balance sheets already weak and reliable information on
borrowers lacking, such a floor on savings deposits very likely contributes to skewing banks’
lending away from the riskiest borrowers, who also happen to be farmers and other small
businesses employing low-skilled workers. Policies should aim at giving a greater role to
competition among banks in determining interest rates. This competition can be enhanced with
a modern financial market infrastructure that makes greater use of information technologies to
facilitate transactions and reduce transaction costs. Policies could also play a greater role in
accelerating disbursement of existing credit lines that have been set up for farmers by
international partners. Such lending would greatly improve financing conditions to farmers.
Commercial banks currently provide agricultural loans that are tightly linked to crop seasons and
come with short maturities and double-digit interest rates.

Authorities’ views
25.
The authorities concurred with the thrust of staff’s external assessment and the
need to further strengthen external net inflows, though they did not commit to any
specific measure. The authorities agreed that the external current account should indeed
improve notably to ensure the medium-term external stability of the Belizean economy. They
continue to view the nominal exchange rate peg as a key anchor of macroeconomic policies.
They noted that their recent decision to review the list of exemptions and zero-ratings on the
GST, their efforts to upgrade the road network and attract more FDI, especially in tourism, and
agriculture will create a more level playing field that promotes competition, reduce overall
production costs and lead to lower producer prices in Belize.
26.
The authorities emphasized that nationalizations are not part of their growth
strategy and that recent nationalizations of the electricity and telecommunications utilities
were forced by extraordinary circumstances. They pointed out that the owners of the utilities
asked for measures that were not acceptable to the government, including huge increases in
tariffs without going through consultation protocols required by law, loan guarantees by the
government, and advance payments of government utility bills.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

BELIZE

27.
The authorities pointed out that stronger credit to the economy is still hampered
by remaining weaknesses in banks’ balance sheets, lack of adequate financial market
infrastructure, and the reluctance of some businesses to adhere to transparency
requirements that a more modern financial market infrastructure would impose. The
authorities noted that their monetary reform included phasing out the floor on interest rates on
savings with the view of lowering lending rates. However, they noted that past reductions of this
floor did not translate into lower lending rates as banks used the additional profit margins they
gained to strengthen their balance sheets, including through greater provisionning. As the
transition period for provisionning is coming to an end, banks’ lending rates should start
declining and the average lending rate on the most recent loans has moved to single digits. As
lending rates continue to decline, the phasing out of the interest rate floor will be accompanied
by the modernisation of the financial market infrastructure, which would allow participants to sell
or buy various financial instruments, including corporate bonds and shares. Steps in this direction
include current efforts to modernize of the payments system and set up a credit bureau. They
acknowledged that the budget may have to bear the cost of modernizing the financial market
infrastructure and this investment would be recouped later on with higher economic growth and
tax collection or receipts from user fees. The authorities noted that resistance to the
development of capital markets will likely come from businesses themselves, some of which
would oppose transparency requirements that will be needed to protect investors.
28.
The authorities emphasized that other policies recommended by staff to promote
greater inclusive growth are taken into account in their growth and development strategy
(Annex VIII). This strategy does indeed deal with the thrust of policies recommended by staff.
However, it does not envisage specific reforms on labor markets and the authorities did not
commit to specific measures in this area. They have taken steps toward meeting their strategy’s
objectives, stepping up spending on the road network in 2013, and expanding the National
Health Insurance (NHI) scheme beyond the sourthern region. The challenge is to now translate
their long term strategy into a set of programmes and activities that can be implemented during
the remainder of the current government’s term in office, which ends in 2017. A strategy
implementation document covering this period is currently being prepared. Financing will be
very diffcult given the limited fiscal space.

29.
The authorities are closely monitoring spillover risks to and from other countries.
Several of the large financial institutions in the country are part of financial conglomerates
owned by foreigners.7 The authorities are monitoring risks arising from these linkages, and in
particular linkages with banks in Antigua that are currently under receivership. In any event, the
Central Bank is confident that related local banks will continue to be adequately capitalized
should they take some losses from these linkages. The Central Bank is actively supporting efforts
to promote stronger cooperation among regional supervisors and has contributed to a new
MOU among regional supervisors. This MOU has more stringent requirements for member
countries. Most banks in Belize, including the Central Bank, maintain corresponding banking
operations with one US bank, pointing to concentration risks. Nonetheless, the authorities see
risks from US banks as limited. Trade is another spillover channel given Belize’s strong links to
the EU and the US for major exports of goods and services, including tourism. This risk would be
mitigated through further diversification of the export base and markets.
30.
Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. In general, the quality, coverage,
and timeliness of statistics permit an adequate monitoring of economic developments.8 In the
context of 2013 debt exchange, the authorities committed to subscribing to the Fund’s Special
Data Dissemination Standard. Progress toward this goal has been very slow. Staff encouraged the
authorities to address the remaining data provision and capacity issues, including with regard to
international investment position (IIP) data.

7

There are 6 domestic and 6 international (offshore) banks operating in Belize. One domestic bank is a subsidiary
of the Canadian bank Bank of Nova Scotia. Another domestic bank is a branch of First Caribbean International
Bank of Barbados, a Canadian bank ultimately owned by the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC). One
other domestic bank is majority–owned by a Honduran holding company (55 percent), Sociededad Nacional de
Inversiones, S.A. (SONISA). This bank is in the same group with a domestic insurance company. A systemic bank,
which is ultimately owned by a holding company controlled by a prominent investor, also owns an international
bank in Belize and is indirectly linked to a bank in Turks and Caicos through a parallel banking structure. A small
domestic bank is majority-owned by an international bank (84 percent). Both banks maintain integrated functions
and share the same board, management and staff. Meanwhile, the international bank is majority-owned by a
private locally incorporated holding company (52 percent), and partly by an international bank in Antigua (38
percent), Antigua Overseas Bank Limited – which itself is ultimately owned by another holding company, ABI
Financial Group.

STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
Belize’s recent macroeconomic performance has been relatively weak. In 2013, real
GDP growth was weak at only 0.7 percent, hampered by declining oil production and weak
agricultural output. Inflation remained subdued, but the external current account significantly
widened. The primary fiscal balance fell to 1 percent of GDP. Credit growth remained modest
owing to continued weaknesses in the financial system.
32.
The macroeconomic outlook has worsened compared with staff’s assessment
during the 2013 Article IV Consultation. The weak GDP growth and fiscal stance combined
with recognition of liabilities from nationalizations (20 percent of GDP) would raise debt to about
90 percent of GDP in the medium term, 5 percentage points of GDP above projections during the
2013 Article IV Consultation. International reserves would fall to uncomfortably low levels mainly
because of the widening external current account deficits and the assumed repatriation of
compensation payments for the nationalized companies. From the perspective of external
stability, the exchange rate appears moderately overvalued, reflecting the current policy mix.
33.
Significant risks are looming in the horizon. In particular, courts may order the
government to pay much more than staff’s current projected payments for the nationalized
companies. Banking sector vulnerabilities are significant. Adverse developments in the global
economy could accentuate pressures on the external current account deficit, which may require
the government to borrow in international markets to preserve international reserves.
34.
The fiscal strategy should place public debt on a sustainable path and create the
policy buffers to guard against these risks. A primary fiscal balance of 4–5 percent of GDP
would reduce public debt to 70 percent of GDP by FY2019/20 and to below 60 percent of GDP a
few years later. This could be achieved by bringing many exemptions and zero-ratings under the
GST into the tax net. A more accountable revenue administration should reduce revenue
leakages. Spending could be reduced by allowing outlays on goods and services to grow only
with inflation, containing wage-related outlays by letting the labor force decline through
attrition, asking public employees to contribute 10 percent of their wages to their pension
system, and adjusting pensions only with changes in the cost of living. Strengthening PFM in
general and procurement in particular, would help reduce low-quality spending.
35.
Efforts to strengthen the financial sector should continue. Given remaining
weaknesses in the supervisory framework, banks’ actual strength should be reassessed through
an asset quality review. The supervision department of the Central Bank must be strengthened
with more examiners, including experts in information technologies. Forward-looking stress tests
must complement banking system’s stress tests currently done at the Central Bank. The Central
Bank should be able to take corrective measures against problem banks without approval from
the Minister of Finance. The authorities should continue strengthening their AML/CFT framework,
notably with regard to transparency of IBCs and trusts.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELIZE

36.
Adequate reforms could enhance Belize’s competitiveness and boost GDP growth.
Given the limited fiscal space, greater emphasis should be on the use of private resources
including through well-designed public-private partnerships. Promoting an attractive business
environment will be essential. Ensuring that growth strategies are inclusive will help reduce
poverty, inequality as well as crime. Given Belize’s small market size, priority should be given to
export sectors and policies should aim at reducing the cost of doing business and enhancing the
country’s competitiveness, including through better knowledge of foreign markets.
37.
It is recommended that the next Article IV Consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

Annex I. Remaining Gaps in AML/CFT Framework
The Belizean authorities further accelerated their efforts to address remaining gaps in their antimoney laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) framework, after the
Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF) called on its member countries in November 2013
to “consider implementing counter measures to protect their financial systems from on-going
money laundering and terrorist financing risk that could be emanating from Belize.” New
important laws and regulations were adopted in February 2014. Carrying out an effective plan to
enforce them will be critical for satisfactorily completing its Action Plan with the CFATF and
developing a robust AML/CFT regime that meets the requirements of the Financial Action Task
Force (FATF) recommendations.
In 2011, the CFATF conducted an evaluation of the AML/ CFT regime of Belize and identified a
number of deficiencies. The 2011 Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) summarized the AML/CFT
measures in place, set out Belize’s level of compliance with FATF recommendations, and
suggested certain aspects of the regime that could be strengthened, including preventive
measures, supervision of financial and non financial institutions, operational independence of the
financial intelligence unit (FIU), and transparency of legal persons and arrangements.
In November 2011, the CFATF listed Belize as a jurisdiction with significant strategic deficiencies
in its AML/CFT regime and worked with the country to develop an Action Plan to address the
deficiencies identified. The Action Plan covered measures notably related to (i) customer due
diligence (CDD) requirements, (ii) implementation of the CFT framework, (iii) extension of the
AML/CFT framework to designated non-financial businesses and professions (DNFBPs),
(iv) operational independence of the FIU, and (v) prohibition of dealings with shell banks. The
authorities took some steps to address the supervision of financial institutions. An AML Unit was
established within the Financial Sector Supervision Department of the Central Bank of Belize
(CBB) that year, and is staffed with three examiners, one of whom is a Certified Anti-Money
Laundering Specialist. On-site AML compliance examinations of one credit union and two
international banks were completed in 2011. Thereafter, examinations of five credit unions, two
domestic banks and three international banks were completed in 2012 and in 2013.
In May 2013, the CFATF issued a public statement noting that Belize was making insufficient
progress in addressing identified deficiencies. It recommended that Belize enact legislation and
issue relevant guidelines to address the deficiencies. Between January and October 2013, the
authorities made several legislative amendments. Nevertheless, a number of deficiencies
remained and the CFATF issued a statement in November 2013, calling on member countries to
consider taking counter measures against Belize. The CFATF planned to refer Belize to the
Financial Action Task Force (FATF) International Cooperation Review Group (ICRG) if sufficient
progress was not made in implementing the agreed Action Plan by May 2014.
In February 2014, Belize approved six laws and three regulations, including (i) comprehensive
amendments to the Money Laundering and Terrorism Prevention Act (MLTPA), which included
the establishment of the National Anti-Money Laundering Committee as a statutory body to
32

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELIZE

advise the Minister of Finance and co-ordinate national AML/CFT efforts;9 (ii) Amendments to the
Financial Intelligence Unit Act to strengthen its operational independence, enhance security of
tenure for the FIU Director and minimise opportunity for political interference; and (iii) New
regulations to more fully articulate the supervisory regime applicable to Designated Non
Financial Business Professionals (DNFBPs) and to set out details regarding the constitution and
procedures of the National Anti-Money Laundering Committee. Other reforms contributed
indirectly to the objectives of the program.10
Following the enactment of the new legislation, the CFAFT public statement of May 2014 noted
that Belize had made significant progress in addressing its deficiencies. The public statement
recommends that Belize continue to work with the CFATF to ensure that its reform process is
completed, by addressing its remaining deficiencies, and continue implementing its Action Plan.
Belize will be required to report on further progress to the CFATF in November 2014.
Belize received AML/CFT technical assistance (TA) from the Fund through the AML/CFT Topical
Trust Fund. The overall objective of the project was to assist the CBB to (i) strengthen its
AML/CFT regulatory and supervisory framework and practices for domestic and offshore banks
by the introduction of a risk-based approach (RBA) to AML/CFT supervision and (ii) enhance the
analytical and operational capability of the FIU. With respect to work undertaken with the FIU,
staff drafted guidance for reporting entities on suspicious transaction indicators, developed a
financial analysis operations manual, a template for financial intelligence products and policies
and procedures for the financial intelligence function. Staff also assisted the FIU and CBB in
drafting a memorandum of understanding to facilitate collaboration and information exchange
on AML/CFT issues. Due to limited resources and capacity, not much progress has been made in
implementing the reforms that were initiated under the TA project, in particular in terms of RBA
supervision and the development of the operational capacity and independence of the FIU.
The authorities are encouraged to continue strengthening and effectively implementing their
AML/CFT framework. If the authorities are to effectively implement the changes brought about
by the recently introduced laws and regulations, it will be important to ensure that the CBB, the
FIU and all agencies that play a part in national AML/CFT arrangements are properly resourced.
In addition, transparency and regulation of international business companies and trusts should
be strengthened.

Other amendments to the MLTPA included: (i) strengthening customer due diligence, record keeping,
compliance and reporting obligations for financial institutions; (ii) enhancing compliance with CFT obligations;
(iii) strengthening and clarifying the sanctions regime, including implementation of a comprehensive
administrative penalty regime; and (iv) extending the AML/CFT framework to DNFBPs.

The Domestic Banking and Financial Institutions Act was amended to specifically prohibit formation of and
dealing with shell banks. Shareholders or owners of international financial service providers are now subject to a
fit and proper test by virtue of an amendment to the International Financial Services Commission (Licensing)
Regulations. The Companies Act was amended to ensure that information on the beneficial ownership of
registered companies is maintained in the Companies Register.

Annex II. The 2014/15 Budget and the Medium-Term Fiscal
Framework
The 2014/15 budget and the underlying medium-term fiscal framework further increase budget
rigidity by scaling up spending on rigid wage-related items. Little room is left for growth-enhancing
capital expenditure. The medium-term path of the primary balance is not ambitious. Efficiency
gains from ongoing PFM reforms will not be sufficient to bring the fiscal position on a sustainable
path.
The fiscal stance and underlying policies
The policies described in the FY2014/15 budget and in the authorities’ medium-term fiscal
framework introduce greater budget rigidities and leave little room for growth-enhancing capital
expenditure (see budget table below). Most spending outlays will be allocated to rigid current
expenditure items. The projected improvement in the primary surplus for FY2015/16 and
FY2016/17 would require a drastic cut in capital expenditure, which would clearly hamper the
development of production capacity. Cuts in subsidies and transfers would be difficult as most of
these outlays help pay for teachers’ salaries in government-supported private schools. The
improvement in the primary balance is thus likely unrealistic. Given the weak domestic-supply
response of the Belizean economy, which itself stems from weak domestic production capacity,
recent increases in current expenditures would mostly translate into greater imports, and have a
dubious impact on GDP growth. Under the authorities’ current expenditure polices, staff
projections suggest that the primary balance surplus would hover around 1 percent of GDP,
which would be insufficient to reduce the high public debt and vulnerability to shocks.
In the budget speech, the authorities have committed to salary increases in addition to the
automatic annual salary adjustments of about 2.5 percent that have been taking place for years.
Specifically, half of the growth in actual recurrent revenue collection between successive fiscal
years will be allocated to these additional salary increases, and the first took effect on 1st April
2014, bringing the overall salary increase to about 7.5 percent in FY2014/15. In turn, the salary
increases will trigger automatic increases in pensions, and transfers. With the exception of
support to municipalities that have to rehabilitate their infrastructure damaged by the rainy
season, budget allocations to growth-enhancing capital projects would remain relatively low.
The budget does not explicitly introduce any new revenue measure, and would rely mostly on
improved tax administration and robust performance of the newly acquired ship registries. A
review of exemptions could take place with a view to bringing some exempted or zero-rated
items into the tax net, in line with recommendations of recent IMF TA on the tax system. The
authorities hope to mobilize additional revenue from the current major taxes without having to
resort to new ones. No timeline is provided for these planned tax reforms.

Public financial management
A second Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) Assessment was conducted at
end-2013 by the European Union, as scheduled. The authorities are committed to addressing
remaining weaknesses identified by the PEFA mission, including: (i) the lack of transparency in
the system of fiscal transfers to municipal governments; (ii) the fiscal risks posed by state-owned
enterprises and municipal governments; (iii) the insufficient development of forward expenditure
estimates, a pre-requisite for the development of a medium term perspective in budgeting, and,
within this, the effective introduction of program budgeting; (iv) weaknesses in procurement,
including the legal framework, the lack of justification for use of limited competition, insufficient
transparency, and ineffective appeals process; (v) shortcomings in internal controls as indicated
in the annual reports of the Auditor General; and (vi) challenges in preparing annual financial
statements, which lead to their insufficient comprehensiveness and accuracy, as well as delays in
submitting the statements to the Auditor General.

Annex III. Belize—Debt Sustainability Analysis
Belize’s public debt will remain high and unsustainable because of recognition of liabilities and a
weak fiscal stance, despite the cash flow relief provided by the March 2013 debt restructuring. The
main risk is the size of the compensation that justice courts will order the government to pay for
the nationalized companies. This remains uncertain and staff continues to assume the mid-point
valuation of these companies. Other important risks include additional contingent liabilities from
the financial sector, the fiscal cost of rebuilding central bank reserves, and shocks on the primary
balance, the exchange rate and GDP growth. Belize is expected to rely massively on domestic
financing as well as asset reductions to meet its gross financing requirements in the medium term
as official external disbursement is projected to gradually decline. Refinancing risks are expected
also to increase with rising gross financing requirements. External debt would gradually decline
over the medium term mainly because of non-debt creating inflows and asset reductions (mostly
reserves). External financing would remain a challenge. The public debt burden underlines the need
for further fiscal consolidation, more robust debt management, and the development of the
domestic debt market.
Macroeconomic Framework
Economic growth is projected to remain relatively low at 2.5 percent in the medium term.
Commodity exports, tourism, and construction, coupled with low inflation will support real
output growth, offsetting the decline in oil production. However, growth will remain vulnerable
to external and weather-related shocks that could further deteriorate the debt outlook.
Enhancing the business environment and attracting FDI will be critical to improving growth
prospects.
Belize is expected to rely massively on domestic financing as well as asset reductions to meet its
gross financing requirements in the medium term. Although the authorities may opt to issue new
US$ 2038 bonds up to a maximum US$75 million to pay part of the compensation, the DSA has
assumed no new issuance of new U.S. bonds given the uncertainties regarding the demand for
these bonds. As a result, the bulk of projected financing would need to be covered by domestic
borrowing, as official external disbursements are projected to gradually decline and very limited
external commercial borrowing is expected within the projection horizon. Nominal interest of
domestic borrowing is expected to increase (assumed between 5 and 8 percent) as public debt
rises, increasing the nominal debt service burden. The DSA also assumes that the government
uses its assets, mainly international reserves, to service debt.
Public Debt
Total public debt was 76.4 percent of GDP (US$1,235 million) at end of 2013, of which 85 percent
is external debt and 15 percent domestic debt. Public external debt amounted to 66 percent of
GDP at end of 2013, of which 25 percent was multilateral, 22 percent bilateral and 53 percent

36

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELIZE

commercial (US$ 2038 bonds). Venezuela has become an important bilateral creditor through
PetroCaribe, accounting for about 7 percent of total external debt (5.5 percent of GDP).
The recognition of liabilities related to the nationalization of two utilities could raise the level of
debt by 22 percentage points of GDP in 2016. Although the Court of Appeals has ruled that the
nationalization of the two utilities was constitutional, the amount of compensation to the former
owners of these companies is still unsettled. The DSA assumes that the government recognizes
the additional liabilities at end 2016, with compensation payments of about BZ$726 million
(20 percent of GDP)—the mid-point valuation between the authorities’ assessment and the
former owners’ claims, including capitalized accrued interests since 2011 and assuming interest
rates in the range 6-8 percent. The DSA also assumes that the government utilizes the proceeds
from the sale of one of the utilities’ shares (BZ$75 million) to pay part of the compensation, and
pays the remaining balance in five equal payments starting in 2017. It finally assumes that the
government also repays US$94 million (2 percent of GDP) in compensation to owners of land
appropriated by the government.
The heat map suggests the risks to debt sustainability remain high (Annex III. Figure 1).
Subjecting the baseline to stress testing indicates that Belize’s debt burden exceeds the
benchmark for market access countries. The heat map highlights significant risks to the debt
profile, including when it comes to market perception (high spreads), external financing
requirements, the residency of debt holders, and the currency composition of Belize’s debt. The
increasing share of short-term debt in total debt is not yet a major source of concern as its level
is relatively low. The fan charts show the possible evolution of debt over the medium term under
both symmetric and asymmetric distributions of risk. The asymmetric fan chat shows that risks to
the debt outlook are on the upside.
There appears to be no systematic projection bias in the macro assumptions in recent years
(Annex III. Figure 2). In the past, staff projections of GDP growth and inflation have been on
average close to outcomes, with the median forecast errors of 0 and -0.58 respectively percent
during 2005–13, though inflation forecast errors have a percentile rank of 11 percent, suggesting
that forecast errors have been high relative to pears. Projections of the primary balance have
been relatively pessimistic, with a median forecast errors of 0.91 percent of GDP during the same
period. Nonetheless, staff’s projections of the primary balance have been more accurate in recent
years.
Under the baseline scenario, Belize’s public debt will remain high and unsustainable because of
recognition of liabilities and a weak fiscal stance (Annex III. Figures 3 and 4). Public debt would
experience a hike to 97 percent of GDP in 2016 as a result of an assumption that the courts
would require the government to recognize liabilities in the amount of 20 percent of GDP to the
former owners of the nationalized utility companies. Debt is projected to decline slowly, owing to
weak fiscal efforts under the baseline (primary surplus of only about 1 percent of GDP in the
medium term) and relatively low growth. At the current primary surplus of 1 percent of GDP, it
would take about 60 years to bring public debt to 60 percent of GDP, levels seen by staff as

sustainable. Financing conditions would gradually deteriorate, as public sector gross financing
needs would increase to 20 percent of GDP in 2019 mainly due to the maturing principal of the
additional liabilities from the nationalizations and high interest rates charged on domestic
financing. Moreover, short-term debt is assumed to represent an increasing share of debt as the
perceived riskiness of government paper increases. Finally, financing needs would rise even more
starting in 2019, when the amortization of the new external bond starts.
Stress tests highlight the fact that that the public debt trajectory is vulnerable to various shocks
(Annex III. Figure 5). As 86 percent of total public debt was denominated in foreign currency at
end of 2013, the debt profile is particularly sensitive to an exchange rate shock: a 10 percent real
depreciation in 2014 combined with the baseline assumption of the recognition of additional
liabilities related to nationalization (20 percent of GDP) would boost total public debt to
105 percent of GDP in 2016. A financial sector contingent liability shock that increases public
spending by the equivalent of 10 percent of banking sector’s assets associated with
recapitalization needs of a few banks would raise total public debt to 120 percent of GDP in
2015. The debt-to-GDP ratio is also sensitive to shocks in growth, interest rate, and the primary
balance. The fiscal consolidation scenario aiming at a debt-to-GDP ratio of 70 percent in 2019
illustrates the magnitude of the fiscal adjustment needed: 4.5 percent of GDP compared to
1 percent in the baseline scenario. This fiscal adjustment path proposed by staff would imply
cyclically adjusted primary balances that are well above 3 percent of GDP, putting Belize in the
top quartile of historical cross-country outturns. It is nonetheless realistic as staff has identified
feasible measures that would help achieve it.
External Debt
The external debt ratio11 is projected to gradually decline over the medium term to around
55 percent of GDP by 2019 mainly because of non-debt creating inflows and asset reductions,
mostly international reserves (Annex III. Figure 6 and Table 1). External current account deficits
would continue to put upward pressures on external debt. Bound tests suggest that the external
debt is mostly sensitive to nominal exchange rate devaluation and current account shocks. In
particular, under a 30 percent depreciation of domestic currency, external debt would surge to
100 percent of GDP in 2016 and remain elevated at 84 percent of GDP in 2019. Further
vulnerability stems from a non-interest current account shock that would boost the external debt
to above 68 percent of GDP over the medium-term horizon. In light of limited options for
external financing, high gross external financing needs—8.5 percent of GDP on average annually
over the next 5 years — pose additional risk to the debt outlook.

In the absence of data on private external debt, the external DSA was limited to external public debt.

Summary Assessment
Under the baseline scenario, Belize’s public debt will remain high and unsustainable because of
the recognition of liabilities and a weak fiscal stance. Debt reduction is projected to be slow,
owing to weak fiscal efforts under the baseline (1 percent of GDP primary surplus in the medium
term) and relatively low growth and high interest rates. Liquidity conditions would gradually
deteriorate, as public sector gross financing needs would increase to 20 percent of GDP in 2019
mainly due to maturing principal of the additional liabilities and high interest rates charged on
domestic financing. Belize is expected to rely massively on domestic financing as well as asset
reductions to meet its gross financing requirements in the medium term as official external
disbursement is projected to gradually decline. Refinancing risks are expected also to increase
with rising gross financing requirements. External debt would gradually decline over the medium
term mainly because of non-debt creating inflows and asset reductions (mostly reserves).
External financing would remain a challenge. Bound tests highlight that the public debt trajectory
is highly vulnerable to various shocks, especially on the exchange rate and contingent liabilities,
including compensation for nationalized utilities and potential recapitalization needs of a few
banks.
Further fiscal consolidation efforts are essential to bringing public debt back to a sustainable
path. The repeated debt restructuring episodes suggests that the country’s current debt level is
not sustainable debt and it would be prudent for the authorities to adopt a more ambitious
target around 50–60 percent of GDP for the medium to long term. Policies to improve growth,
deepen domestic financial market and improve public debt management will be also critical to
improve the debt outlook.
Authorities’ views
The authorities noted that the debt sustainability assessment is significantly driven by staff’s
assumption on the compensation for the nationalizations. They agreed with staff’s analysis of the
risks to debt sustainability.

Annex IV. External Stability Assessment
The exchange rate is estimated to be moderately overvalued from the perspective of external stability.
The overvaluation reflects a policy mix that is projected to generate rising current account deficits and
net external indebtedness. International reserves appear comfortable at the moment, but are projected
to fall to uncomfortably low levels.
External stability tools used by staff are highly suggestive for small countries like Belize. External
stability in Belize was assessed applying external stability (ES), macroeconomic balance (MB), and
equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) approaches. The ES approach assumes a gradual
strengthening of the NFA position from -119 percent at end-2011 to -100 percent of GDP by 2024, a
path consistent with the sustainable financing required to stabilize the NFA-to-GDP ratio. This would
imply an external current account deficit of -2.9 percent of GDP per year. From this perspective, the
real exchange rate is estimated to be overvalued by about 10 percent. The MB and ERER approaches
point to smaller misalignments and imply equilibrium current account deficits of 6-7 percent of GDP.
These last two approaches do not capture developments in the capital and financial account of the
balance of payments. In the case of Belize, such flows would be influenced by the assumed
repatriation of compensation payments for the nationalized companies and would matter
significantly for external stability.

2018 to respectively reach 59 percent and
61 percent of the adequate level under
these two metrics (see Text Table below).

suggests that while reserves stood at 110 percent at end-2013, above the lower bound of the
adequacy region of 100–150 percent, they are expected to decline below the threshold in 2017 and
be almost depleted at just 8 percent by 2019. The second risk-weighted measure, adjusted for small
island developing states (SIDS), signals a similar trend––with a current ratio of 74 percent, just below
the lower benchmark and a projected decline of the ratio to 5 percent by 2019. In light of the
expected widening of the current account deficit and limited access to external financing, the low
level of international reserves and their projected depletion over the medium term pose a risk to
Belize’s external stability and the budget as the authorities would have to borrow to rebuild reserves.

Relative Likelihood

1.

Fiscal policy implementation: the
adoption of a lower fiscal primary
balance will leave the country in a
highly vulnerable position.



2.

Distress in the banking system.



3.

Surge in contingent liabilities.



High
Under current policies, the primary surplus for 2013/14 will likely be
about 1 percent of GDP, well below the previously announced target
of 2 percent. Declining petroleum revenue, the announced increases
in compensations for civil servants, and the rolling out of the national
health insurance scheme have reduced the likelihood of a significant
improvement in the primary balance. Moreover, the authorities are of
the view that deteriorating social, infrastructure, and security
conditions constrain Belize from tightening the fiscal stance beyond
the primary surplus target of 1 percent of GDP.
Medium
While declining, non-performing loans remain high, and while
improving, provisioning remains relatively low. Some domestic banks,
including the largest bank, which is of systemic proportions, still have
low capital buffers, and raising new capital to avoid a deterioration of
their capital adequacy ratios could be a challenge, increasing the risk
of public sector intervention.
High
Courts still have to rule on the size, modality, and timing of the
compensation the government has to pay to the former owners of
the two nationalized utility companies. Payments could turn out to be
closer to the claimants’(upper) valuation of 35 percent of GDP.
Moreover, nonresidents, who account for a significant portion of the
compensation claims, would likely not roll over their debt holdings.

Further decline in tourism and
exports related to a protracted
period of slower growth in advanced
economies (owing to larger than
expected deleveraging, negative
surprises on potential growth, or
geopolitical risks).



In addition to a possible intervention for the financial sector, the
government may have to incur more external liabilities, just to build
up reserves and support the current exchange rate peg should BOP
pressures become more severe than envisaged.
Medium
A protracted period of weak demand could take a toll on productive
capacity across advanced economies. In Europe in particular, the risk
of deflation has increased, and the adverse impact of public and
private sector deleveraging on the real economy may be larger than
currently expected. The growth impact of increasing geopolitical
tensions surrounding Russia/Ukraine on advanced countries is
expected to be temporary.



High
Credit intermediation could be damaged, and
absorption of the financial cost of recapitalizing
distressed banks by the government could entail
significant fiscal costs, putting additional pressure on
public finances.
High
Debt could suddenly increase by tens of percentage
points of GDP because of the compensation for the
nationalized companies, further threatening fiscal
sustainability and aggravating refinancing risks as
nonresident debt holders pull out.
Even though additional external borrowing was
envisaged at the time of the 2013 debt restructuring,
new external lending to Belize will likely be very costly.
It will also further weaken debt sustainability and
undermine investors’ confidence in the Belizean
economy and the currency peg.
High
A weak recovery in advanced economies, especially the
US and Europe could significantly undermine growth in
Belize, restrain public finances, and put pressures on
the BOP and reserves. Belize’s share of exports to the
US and the EU is very high. Growth in Belize is also very
sensitive to tourist arrivals from major source markets,
the US in particular.



High
Debt will continue to increase in an unsustainable
manner. Gross financing needs would rise sharply and
continue to rise over the medium term. Securing such
financing would be a challenge due to undeveloped
domestic market and limited external market access.

Annex VI. Fiscal Risks from State-Owned Enterprises
Operational risks of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) to the budget appear limited at the moment, but
are clearly on a rising trend. Balance sheet risks are much more important mainly because of recent
nationalizations.
The consolidated balance of the three
largest SOEs shows large volatility,
pointing to a large deficit in FY2010/11
and a small surplus in FY 2011/12,
underlying the SOEs’ risk to the public
sector fiscal balance. Overall revenues
have been stagnant, while
expenditures have increased. By far,
Belize Electricity Limited (BEL) has
posted the largest deficits, although
declining. BEL is particularly vulnerable
to weather conditions, which could
reduce the domestic production of
electricity and increase energy imports
from Mexico. Belize Telemedia Limited
(BTL) has posted declining surpluses,
while Belize Water Services (BWS) has
turned into surplus in FY2011/12.

Annex VII. National Health Insurance12
Following the inability of the Social Security Board to finance the expansion of the national health
insurance program beyond its pilot phase, the authorities have decided to finance this expansion with
budget resources, thus creating significant and rigid new outlays in the budget.
The goal of developing a national health insurance program is to provide affordable and accessible
quality care to the population. A pilot project was established in the south side of Belize City in 2001
and was expanded to the southern region of Belize in 2006. A separate agency within the Social
Security Board has been established to oversee the financing and purchasing duties for the NHI
fund, while the Ministry of Health remains in charge of the regulatory and policy-making functions.
An important component of the NHI program is the implementation of a pay for performance
system that provides financial incentives for meeting specified quality performance standards. The
authorities plan to expand the NHI program throughout Belize.
In the first phase, the pilot project was

Annex VIII. The National Development Framework for Belize
2010–2030
The Belizean authorities’ growth and development strategy is anchored by a national plan
(Horizon 2030) that centers around governnance, education, health, ecoomic resilience, and the
environment. Operationalizing this strategy through annual budgets remains a challenge.
The authorities growth and poverty reduction strategy is guided by Belize’s national development
framework covering the period 2010-30 (Horizon 2030).13 The Horizon 2030 framework covers
several thematic areas that are organized under four main pillars:


Democratic governance for effective public administration and sustainable development. This pillar
aims to ensure citizen participation in the development strategy, accountability of political
leaders and effective management of public resources to meet public needs. Among other
goals, the authorities intend to make the Senate an elected body with the capacity to hold the
government accountable; clarify in law and regulations the roles and responsibilities at the
various levels of government; raise the qualification requirements for police officers and
implement a more rigorous recruitment process; implement key infrastructural improvements to
strengthen investigative capabilities of the Police Department; provide on-going training
opportunities for magistrates and police officers; strengthen laws regarding oversight of
government ministries; implement multi-year planning of activities and budgets and require
regular reporting on clear and measurable objectives; enforce regulations for the transparent
and fair hiring of public officers; and streamline government processes to achieve efficient and
cost effective delivery of services.



Education for development-Education for life. Recent data indicates that more than 11,000
primary school age children are not attending school and that almost 60 percent of the
secondary school age population is not enrolled in school. The authorities’ most important goal
is to provide quality education that is free and compulsory to at least the secondary school level.
Their second education goal is to ensure delivery of quality and relevance in the curriculum by
integrating the expressive arts, sports and physical education, science and technology,
environmental education, and entrepreneurship. Their third goal is to create an education
system that is inclusive, reflecting Belize’s multi-ethnic, multi-cultural, multilingual society. They
plan to reform the system for allocating financial resources to primary and secondary schools to
provide equitable access to education for children across the country; expand teacher education
and develop a salary and incentives package to attract and retain qualified managers and
counselors within the education system; expand the number of secondary school places,

especially in rural communities; develop alternate mechanisms for delivery of education, using
TV, radio, and the internet; expand the schools feeding programmes; provide apprenticeship and
mentorship programmes for children who require additional out-of-school support; and expand
the national library system so that it can be a more active partner in promoting reading and
language skills.


Economic resilience-Generating resources for long-term development. Under this pillar, the
authorities essentially plan to increase agricultural production in a sustainable way and increase
local value added through the development of agro-processing, and ensure a sustainable and
profitable tourism sector. In particular, they plan to increase government investment in
technology, irrigation, development of seeds and green pesticides and provide technical support
to farmers through rebuilding of demonstration plots across the country; develop agricultural
insurance options to cover crop losses; create support mechanisms to pool resources and
investment capital for entrepreneurs including cooperatives and credit unions; develop a
support system for small business that includes market information, management support,
planning advice; simplify the tax structure and make the system more equitable; enact
appropriate legislation to protect and regulate microfinance; implement a coordinated credit
referral system or credit bureau; and make key public investments in economic infrastructure,
especially the road network and transportation system.



The bricks and the mortar-Healthy citizens and a healthy environment. Under this fourth pillar,
the authorities plan to implement a comprehensive natural resources and environmental policy
that includes planning for climate change and its effects. They also plan to provide incentives for
reforestation; increase the number of Belizean professionals specializing in environmental issues,
including coastal zone management; provide incentives to promote energy saving and
investment in production and use of renewable energy in the areas of wind, solar, biomass, geothermal and hydroelectricity; set up renewable energy purchase arrangements for those who
have excess to sell to the main grid; provide tax and other incentives for households to more
easily adopt “green” technologies and impose penalties for the use of hazardous materials;
expand the National Health Insurance (NHI) scheme countrywide; improve access to health
services for rural communities including proper staffing and equipping of clinics that have been
constructed; and invest more in primary healthcare and on preventive health strategies.

BANK-FUND COLLABORATION UNDER THE JMAP
AND RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK2
(As of May 2014)

A. Bank-Fund Collaboration Under the JMAP
1.
The World Bank’s program in Belize is guided by a new four-year Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) for FY2012–2015. Under the CPS, the focus is on assisting Belize to achieve
inclusive and sustainable natural resource-based growth and enhanced climate resilience. The CPS
builds on lessons learned from the implementation of the Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for
FY2009–2011.
2.
The overall size of the envelope during the new CPS period is around
US$20–28 million. Activities include a US$15 million municipal development loan, approved by the
World Bank Board on September 16, 2010. Under the CPS, an investment lending operation is
planned to support the improvement and/or development of climate resilient infrastructure.
3.
The IMF and World Bank teams agree that Belize’s main macroeconomic challenges
are to enhance the economy’s resilience to shocks and strengthen growth and social
prospects. In particular, the teams agree on the need to enhance banking system stability and debt
sustainability, and to strengthen the policy framework, while reinforcing the implementation
capacity of the Belizean authorities.
4.
The teams of the Fund and the World Bank meet on a regular basis to coordinate the
work on Belize. Going forward, the work of the teams will be organized along the following
lines:


Public Financial Management (PFM). The Fund is assisting in the reform of PFM processes and
institutions by optimizing the use of available information technology to ensure that future ICT
is geared to sound and best practice business processes.



Medium-Term Debt Management. The Fund will continue assisting the authorities in building
analytical capacity for developing a debt management strategy and enhancing the domestic
public debt market.



Banking Sector. The Fund, through CARTAC, plans to continue assisting the authorities in the
preparation of guidance on corporate governance, internal controls, operational risks, and
valuation of collateral. CARTAC also plans to assist the central bank to develop its financial
stability framework and preparation of its first financial stability report. The Fund is ready to

assist the authorities in updating the crisis management plan, as well as bank restructuring and
resolution framework. The Fund is also assisting in the enhancement of the regulatory and
supervisory framework of the central bank to support the proper adoption, development, and
implementation of a risk-based approach to AML/CFT.


Infrastructure. Through the ongoing Municipal Development Project, the Bank supports
improved access to basic municipal infrastructure and enhanced municipal management in
selected town and city councils of Belize.



Natural Resource Management. The Bank will support Belize in adopting a sustainable natural
resources based economic model while enhancing its resilience to climate change and natural
hazards. A range of potential activities include: i) policies and strategies for mainstreaming of
natural resources and climate resilience; ii) institutional capacity strengthening for natural
resource management and climate change; and iii) investments to strengthen climate resilience.

1.
Country Strategy with Belize (2013–2017). The Country Strategy aims to support the
Government of Belize in improving public expenditure efficiency and effectiveness and promoting
private sector development and sustainable export-led growth, by concentrating on four priority
areas: (i) education; (ii) tourism; (iii) transport; and (iv) trade and tax policy. There have been no
approvals to date under this strategy, two new investment loans are in the 2014 pipeline, one for the
education sector and one for a road rehabilitation project.
2.
Technical cooperation operations (grants) in execution include efforts to advance the
implementation of the Tourism Master Plan, to finance feasibility studies for several transportation
and water and sanitation projects, to enhance public financial management, to develop a Crime
Information System for Belize, to analyze pension reform, and to support teacher training and
improved education governance, credit unions, cocoa farmers, competitiveness and investment
promotion, and natural disaster risk management.
3.
Strategy results: The strategy is in an early stage of implementation; initial results are
expected in the medium-term.

B. Economic and Sector Work
7.
To support the government of Belize (GOB) in achieving its development objectives, the
Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) has continued to provide financing for a number of important
projects, as the Bank’s country strategy for Belize for the period 2011 to 2015 remains under
implementation.
8.
CDB has been supporting efforts to expand, rehabilitate or reconstruct critical transportation
and water infrastructure. In that regard, work has progressed on the US$8.8 million project for the
reconstruction of the Kendall (Sittee River) and Mullins River bridges, which were destroyed by
floods generated from the passage of tropical storm Arthur. The reconstruction of these strategically
important bridges started in 2010 and work has already been completed on the Kendall Bridge. A
Fourth Road loan of US$24.7 million was approved in 2010 for a bypass road through the twin
towns of Santa Elena and San Ignacio and a new road and bridge crossing the Macal River. The
project, on which construction activity commenced in 2012, with completion slated for early 2015, is
expected to contribute to sustaining and increasing economic activity in and through the area,
which is important for tourism, the transportation of crude oil, and for trade with Guatemala.
Building on a previous loan to conduct a feasibility study and detailed designs for the upgrade of
the Northern Highway, the Fifth Road loan for US$29.1 million was approved in May 2014, which
should see work commence on the Philip S. W. Goldson (formerly Northern) Highway in 2015. The
intervention seeks to reduce congestion and climate change vulnerability and improve road safety
on this economically important road, while also enhancing the capacity of GOB and Belizean
contractors to address gender equality and social inclusion in current and future projects.
Complementing the significant investments in road infrastructure, the CDB approved a loan of
US$5.4 million in 2012 to assist GOB in enhancing road safety along a demonstration corridor on the
Western Highway from Belize City to Belmopan.
9.
In 2012, the CDB approved a loan of US$0.7 million to enable GOB to undertake detailed
designs for the expansion of water and sewerage on Ambergris Caye. This builds on a 2010
feasibility study that was funded by the CDB. Ambergris Caye is an important area of concentrated
tourism activity for Belize. The improvement of the water and sewerage system is thought to be
important to sustain and boost tourism activity in the area and to protect the sensitive environment.
Procurement activities have been completed.
10.
To support private sector development in 2009, the CDB approved a line of credit of
US$10 million to the GOB, for the financing of projects in agriculture, industry, housing, and
education sectors. The funds are being managed by the Development Finance Corporation (DFC) on
an agency basis. The line of credit was fully committed as at end-2013. The CDB also provided a TA
grant for institutional strengthening of DFC, and implementation of recommendations from the
consultant’s report is ongoing. With regard to the public sector, a technical assistance loan for the
modernization of the Customs and Excise Department is practically complete, pending submission
of the Final Report on the project.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BELIZE

11.
With respect to critical social sector investments, approximately US$3.3 million was
approved by the CDB in 2010, for GOB to establish a potable water supply system to serve nine
villages in the Belize River Valley. The project consists of installation of pipeline, storage tanks,
pumps and boreholes for the system, as well as connection of the system to BWSL mains. It is
expected to contribute to a reduction of risks to food and water-borne diseases and, in general, will
facilitate the reduction of poverty and general living conditions of residents. Construction activities
are ongoing, with works expected to be completed in 2014.
12.
The Belize Social Investment Fund (BSIF) was established by legislation in 1996, to appraise,
finance, and supervise small and medium-sized sub-projects in underserved poor communities. CDB
has made US$15 million available to BSIF through a second loan approved in 2010, following on
from a loan of US$7 million approved in 2003. Belize has also been the beneficiary of grant funding
from the CDB through the Basic Needs Trust Fund (BNTF). All resources under the 6th cycle of the
BNTF (US$3 million) have been committed and implementation of interventions is nearing
completion. Belize’s allocation under the 7th cycle of US$6.1 million is currently being programmed.
Interventions under the BSIF and the BNTF are community-based, and are usually concentrated in
the areas of water and sanitation, education, and health. Interventions under these programs are an
integral component of Belize’s poverty reduction strategy and action plan. Sub-projects financed
through loan and grant resources are expected to help improve living conditions and enhance social
capital in poor rural communities in Belize. The CDB funds will also allow for the development of a
comprehensive results-based monitoring and evaluation system.
13.
With grant assistance from the CDB in 2010, GOB formulated a policy and strategic
framework for the education sector. This involved the development of a comprehensive education
sector strategy. Based on this work, in 2012, the CDB approved a loan to GOB of US$2.0 million
(Education Sector Reform Project). The objective of the project is to enhance learning outcomes
across all levels of the education sector in the country. The project seeks to address institutional
strengthening processes to underpin the success of the Education Sector Strategy. In this regard,
activities have commenced on five of 12 planned consultancies. These include the development of a
comprehensive school location plan, which will guide infrastructural development in the short to
medium term, and which is nearing completion.
14.
In December 2012, CDB approved a loan of US$5.2 million to the GOB, for a Youth and
Community Transformation Project, based on a previous CDB-financed feasibility study. In
accordance with the priority that GOB has given to strategies to reduce crime and improve citizen
security, the aim of the project is to contribute towards building human capital, particularly among
youth and children from poor communities in Belize City, as part of an attempt to reduce socially
deviant behavior. Conditions precedents to first disbursement were met during 2013 and the project
is currently in the initial stages of implementation.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of May 15, 2014)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Most affected areas are:
national accounts, labor, and fiscal sector statistics.

Real sector: The accuracy and reliability of the data are affected by inadequate source data. The Statistical Institute
of Belize (SIB) continues to face human and financial limitations for undertaking surveys and processing the data.
Lack of reliable data on expenditure components hampers estimation of national savings and domestic investment.
To address these shortcomings the SIB is planning to conduct a comprehensive business census in 2014, which will
provide the basis for the completion of the Statistical Business Register and the compilation of supply and use tables.
Price and labor statistics: Labor market statistics are scarce and available at irregular intervals, the SIB plans to
conduct the labor force survey twice a year going forward. The SIB is in the process of developing its new website,
with plans to make metadata on the CPI as well as other statistics available online.
Fiscal accounts: Data on the consolidated operations of the public sector are unavailable. Priorities for the period
ahead include preparing a comprehensive list of institutions that comprise the central government, general
government, and the public sector including extra budgetary units. Also, difficulties persist in the compilation of
capital expenditure as a number of Capital II (government-funded capital and project expenditures) items that
started life as fixed-term project contributions have become permanent funding allocations. Authorities are aware of
this shortcoming and are advising ministries to examine the continuing need and authority for such expenditures. In
addition, the current accounting practices follow neither a cash basis nor an accrual basis of accounting, which
contributes to an inconsistent accounting and reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Finally,
domestic debt data recording needs to be improved.
Monetary and financial statistics: Data on financial soundness indicators of individual banks are available on
quarterly basis. However, there is very limited data on non-bank financial institutions, especially the offshore sector,
while the information on the activities of domestic insurance companies are not publicly available.. There is need to
classify offshore banks as part of Other Financial Corporation’s (OFC) subsector. Also, the Social Security Board (SSB)
is not treated as part of the general government.. Instead, the Central Bank classifies the entity as other non-financial
public corporation, and includes its claims (deposits) on the banking system as part of broad money. Plans are
ongoing to improve the availability of statistics..
Balance of payments: Official grant and loan disbursements and repayments are generally well recorded, but
strengthening inter-agency coordination in information sharing between the MOF and CBB would be warranted. The
authorities have compiled International Investment Position (IIP) statistics for 2009 and 2010, which excludes offshore financial sector, and are in the process of reconciling the discrepancies between the balance of payments flows
and the stock position on “currency and deposits” on the IIP for those years before publication and dissemination.
Upon completion, authorities plan to produce annual and quarterly IIP for 2011-2013 during the second half of this
year. While the current sourcing of FDI data appears adequate, survey responses are very low. Frequency could be
improved.

II. Data Standards and Quality
Participant in the General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS) since September 27, 2006.

No data ROSC is available.

III. Reporting to STA
No fiscal data are being reported for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook or in the IFS.

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Belize
On June 23, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV Consultation1 with Belize.
Real GDP growth plummeted to 0.7 percent in 2013, from 4 percent in 2012, mainly due to
continued declines in oil production and weak agricultural output, especially sugarcane and citrus.
Unemployment stood at 14.2 percent in September 2013 and is on an upward trend since it hit its
lowest level in 2008. Average inflation eased to 0.5 percent from 1.3 percent in 2012, as commodity
price pressures abated. The external current account deficit widened to 4.5 percent of GDP in 2013
up from 1.2 percent in 2012, as exports of oil and agricultural products fell sharply while imports of
fuel and electricity picked up. International reserves improved to 4.7 months of imports at end-March
2014 (up from 3.3 months at end-2012) mainly owing to PetroCaribe financing and private inflows.
The primary surplus for FY2013/14 (fiscal year ends in March) is estimated to have fallen to
1 percent of GDP, from 1.4 percent of GDP in FY2012/13. Revenue is expected to be better-thanbudgeted, as robust tax revenues more than offset the decline in non-tax revenues. However,
substantial increases in wages and salaries, transfers and interest payments drove up current
expenditure. Capital expenditures were higher than budgeted because of the need to rebuild the
infrastructure that was badly damaged by rain. Credit growth and monetary policy continued to be
hampered by weaknesses in the financial system. Private sector credit grew by 3.8 percent (y/y) in
March 2014, while broad money grew by 5.2 percent. The banking system remained highly liquid.
While declining, non-performing loans (NPLs) remained high at 16.7percent of total loans at endMarch 2014. The banking system’s capital adequacy ratio (CAR) improved to 23.4 percent. The
authorities stepped up their efforts to address other weaknesses of the financial system, including the

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every
year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the
country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the
basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

adoption of new anti money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT)
legislation.
The medium-term outlook is worse than envisaged during the 2013 Article IV consultation. Real
GDP growth would be weaker than expected in the near term but hover around 2.5 percent over the
medium term as declining oil production would be partially offset by higher output of other
commodity exports, tourism and construction. Inflation would remain low owing to the exchange rate
peg and subdued inflation in trading partners. The authorities’ policy plans would maintain the
primary surplus around 1 percent of GDP in FY14/15 and in the medium term. Low primary
surpluses together with the assumed recognition of debt related to nationalizations will increase the
public debt-to-GDP ratio. Expansionary fiscal policies, including large wage increases, would fuel
higher domestic consumption and upward pressures on the external current account deficit.
International reserves could decline substantially over the medium term, especially if compensation
for the nationalized companies adds to external outflows.
Executive Board Assessment2
Directors noted that Belize’s macroeconomic performance has weakened on the back of decelerating
growth and increasing fiscal and external imbalances. The outlook is clouded by significant risks,
including contingent compensation payments for nationalized companies and banking sector
vulnerabilities, while adverse global developments could put pressure on international reserves and
greatly increase Belize’s gross financing needs. Directors agreed that a vigorous policy response is
needed to reduce vulnerabilities, rebuild policy buffers, and accelerate reforms that would further
strengthen the financial sector, enhance competitiveness, and boost inclusive growth.
Directors emphasized the need to renew fiscal consolidation efforts to ensure debt sustainability and
create policy buffers in case downside risks materialize. Most Directors agreed that the uncertainty
surrounding contingent liabilities suggests it would be prudent to frontload the necessary
consolidation, but a number of other Directors considered a gradual adjustment more appropriate in
light of cyclical conditions. Directors agreed that strong measures are necessary to moderate goods
and services and wage-related outlays, reform the public employees’ pension system, and broaden the
base for the general sales tax. At the same time, spending on infrastructure, public safety, and
flagship social programs should be protected. Directors concurred that strengthening public financial
management, and procurement in particular, is key to improve spending quality. They supported the

authorities’ efforts to strengthen debt management and looked forward to the design and
implementation of a medium-term debt management strategy.
Directors welcomed progress in financial sector reform. They agreed that, in light of remaining
vulnerabilities, bank asset quality should be reassessed through a comprehensive review. They called
for strengthening central bank supervision, including through hiring of additional examiners and
broadening the stress test methodology to include forward-looking analysis. Directors encouraged the
authorities to finalize the crisis management plan, including the bank restructuring and resolution
framework, making use of technical assistance from the Fund.
Directors commended the authorities for their recent efforts to address remaining gaps in the
AML/CFT framework to comply with international standards. They encouraged the authorities to
fully implement the revised AML/CFT framework, including the laws and regulations recently
approved.
Directors concurred that adequate reforms are needed to address the widening current account deficit
and boost job-creating and inclusive growth. In this regard, a more attractive business environment
would encourage private sector investment, enhance external competitiveness, and help diversify
exports.
