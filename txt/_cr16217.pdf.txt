IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with South Africa
On July 1, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with South Africa.
South Africa has made impressive economic and social progress in the past two decades. Yet,
deep-rooted structural problems—infrastructure bottlenecks, skill mismatches, and harmful
insider-outsider dynamics—are holding back growth and exacerbating unemployment and
inequality.
South Africa’s vulnerabilities are elevated. Despite a large currency depreciation and
notwithstanding some correction, South Africa’s current account deficit remains among the
highest in emerging markets. A combination of rising government debt, albeit at a slower
rate, low growth, financially-weak state-owned enterprises, and spending pressures has
increased vulnerabilities in the real and fiscal sectors. Most private corporations’ balance
sheets remain strong, but financial indicators signal some deterioration ahead. Headline
inflation at 6.1 percent in May 2016 was above the South African Reserve Bank’s (SARB)
3–6 percent band, mostly due to base effects of fuel prices and rising food prices caused by
drought.
Monetary and fiscal policy are on a tightening course. The SARB raised the policy rate by
50bps in 2015 and 75bps in 2016 to 7 percent, citing rising inflation and elevated risks. The
2016 budget envisaged significant deficit reduction for the years 2016 to 2017.
The outlook is sobering with considerable downside risks. Growth is projected to slow to 0.1
percent in 2016, with a weak recovery envisaged from 2017 (1.1 percent), approaching 2–2½
percent in the outer years, as shocks dissipate and new power plants are completed. The
unemployment rate could rise further over the medium term. The current account deficit is
forecast to narrow slightly in 2016, but rise to 4¾ percent of GDP in 2017–18 on weaker

terms of trade. Inflation is projected at 6.7 percent in 2016 before easing to 5.6 percent by
end-2017.
Downside risks dominate and stem mainly from linkages with China, heightened global
financial volatility, and domestic politics and policies that are perceived to harm confidence.
Shocks could be amplified by linkages between capital flows, the sovereign, and the financial
sector, especially if combined with sovereign credit rating downgrades to speculative grade.
On the upside, the recent dialogue between social partners could catalyze reform
implementation and invigorate growth.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors recognized the remarkable progress that South Africa has achieved in
improving living standards, and the country’s strong institutions and policy frameworks that
have delivered macroeconomic stability in the past two decades. Directors welcomed the
recent dialogue among social partners, but underlined the weak growth outlook, and the need
to manage significant downside risks. In this context, Directors noted the likely impact of the
recent U.K. referendum to leave the EU, China’s transitions, tighter global financial
conditions, and the effects of heightened policy uncertainty on growth. Directors also noted
vulnerabilities and risks from linkages among capital flows, sovereign debt, and the financial
sector, which could amplify the impact of shocks. Directors cautioned that unemployment
and inequality remain high, while structural impediments continue to constrain growth and
job creation.
Directors emphasized the need for wide ranging structural reforms as a sustainable way to
boost growth, create jobs, lower inequality and reduce vulnerabilities. They recommended a
comprehensive package of reforms, including greater product market competition, more
labor market inclusiveness, better education and improved governance. Directors saw merits
in an initial, focused set of tangible measures that can help generate reform momentum, and
noted that such reforms could also provide near term benefits by increasing confidence,
reducing uncertainty and signalling policy consistency. They welcomed progress in easing
infrastructure bottlenecks.
Directors considered the 2016 Budget as appropriately ambitious but cautioned that
additional measures might be required to stabilize debt over the medium term. They
recommended measures to boost spending efficiency, including containing the public wage
bill, and increasing private sector participation in state owned enterprises (SOEs). Should
these measures not materialize, and if growth underperforms, Directors recommended

implementing a package of growth-friendly fiscal consolidation measures, while protecting
social spending. Directors also underscored the need to improve SOE performance and
strengthen their governance.
Directors commended the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) for a balanced monetary
policy stance. They suggested that the SARB consider holding interest rates steady unless
core inflation or inflation expectations rise substantially, as the impact of past policy hikes is
still filtering through, and the weak economy should keep inflation contained. Directors
encouraged the SARB to consider ways to enhance its inflation targeting regime to guide
expectations within the target band.
Directors viewed exchange rate flexibility, the favorable currency composition of external
debt, and South Africa’s net external creditor position as strengths. However, external
competitiveness remains a concern, notwithstanding some adjustment in the current account
deficit. Directors encouraged the authorities to seize opportunities to increase reserves.
Directors recognized the soundness of the financial sector, as noted in the SARB’s recent
stress tests. With rising pressures from the weak economy, tightening financial conditions
and regulatory changes, Directors encouraged stepped up monitoring of financial sector risks
and contingency planning.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 15, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context. South Africa has made considerable economic and social strides since 1994, but faces
significant challenges. Deep-rooted structural problems—infrastructure bottlenecks, skill
mismatches, and harmful insider-outsider dynamics—have kept unemployment and inequality
unacceptably high. Also, a confluence of external and domestic shocks, combined with
heightened governance concerns and policy uncertainty, have weighed on confidence and
growth. Though private balance sheets are still strong, vulnerabilities are elevated.
Outlook and risks. 2016 growth is projected at 0.1 percent. Only a muted recovery is envisaged
from 2017, with rising unemployment. Downside risks dominate and stem mainly from China,
heightened global financial volatility, and domestic politics and possible policy missteps. Shocks
could be amplified by extensive macro-financial linkages, especially if combined with sovereign
credit rating downgrades to speculative grade. On the upside, the recent dialogue between
social partners could catalyze reform implementation and invigorate growth.
Structural reforms. Structural reforms are urgent and imperative to facilitate robust and
inclusive private sector-led growth that creates more jobs and reduces inequality and
vulnerabilities. The authorities are making some progress in addressing electricity bottlenecks. A
comprehensive package of structural reforms—greater competition, more inclusive labor
market policies, better training and education, and improved governance—remains the
preferred option. An initial, focused set of tangible measures that lowers policy uncertainty and
boosts confidence could help generate sustained reform momentum.
Fiscal and monetary policy. The 2016 Budget targets are appropriately ambitious, but could
be challenging to achieve if staff’s macro projections materialize. Maintaining debt sustainability
is essential, but further adjustments need to be carefully designed to avoid pressuring an
already-weak economy. Strengthening governance, private participation in SOEs, and greater
spending efficiency are key interventions to improve SOE performance and public service
delivery, protect the poor, and reduce contingent liabilities. After recent rate hikes, monetary
policy may be able to remain on hold, though more tightening may be needed if core inflation
or inflation expectations rise significantly.
Other policies to enhance resilience. The authorities are advancing key financial sector
reforms and their stress tests suggest the financial sector remains resilient. Heightened
monitoring of financial sector risks is warranted given the weak economy, tightening financial
conditions, and regulatory changes. The SARB could seize opportunities to build international
reserves, especially in case of large, lumpy, foreign direct inflows.

Box 1. Spillovers from Global Transitions
This box explores spillovers from the ongoing global transitions—China’s rebalancing, lower commodity prices, and
tighter global financial conditions—on South Africa. The results suggest China’s growth matters more for South
Africa than U.S.’ and Europe’s growth, with commodity prices and financing conditions the main transmission
channels. The impact of commodity prices is amplified by inter-sectoral linkages. Tighter global financial conditions
have a significant impact on South Africa, mainly though bond yields and equity prices.

China (% world imports 2013)

Rising trade linkages and reliance on commodities
have increased spillovers from China. China absorbs
10 percent of South African exports, the most of any
country. More importantly, it plays a key role in
determining global demand for South Africa’s
commodity exports, which account for 34 percent of
total goods exports (51 percent including manufactured
commodities), and commodities imports including oil,
which account for 16 percent of total goods imports.

are small and positive, suggesting the impact of exchange rate depreciation on competitiveness outweighs the fall

The impact of lower commodity prices is amplified by sectoral interlinkages. An analysis of input-output
tables in South Africa suggests linkages between the commodity sector and the rest of the economy are
significant. A sectoral structural VAR identified using multipliers from the input-output table suggests a
10 percentage point decline in export commodity prices would reduce real GDP growth by nearly 0.2 percentage
points (q/q sa annualized) after two quarters, with most of the impact coming from downstream (e.g.,
construction) and upstream (e.g., transport) sectors including manufactured commodities. A Swiston and Bayoumi
decomposition suggests that the main transmission channels are changes in corporate profitability and
employment in the non-mining sector.

A shock to China’s growth worsens South Africa’s external and fiscal balances, but the impact on inflation
is ambiguous. Mineral export growth declined to -7 percent in 2015 from an average of 19 percent in 2011–13 on
lower demand and prices. The lower oil import bill is a partial offset, and the terms of trade are expected to
remain negative over the next few years.3 Fiscal revenues are affected mainly through growth, with corporate
income tax growth down from an average of 10 percent between FY11/12-FY13/14 to an estimated 2.2 percent in
FY15/16. Lower oil prices are fully passed through to retail prices, with petrol prices in early-2015 27 percent
below their 2014 peak. However, this effect has been partly offset by depreciation. Anecdotal evidence points to a
significant deflationary impact from overcapacity in China, which South Africa has partly offset through increasing
tariffs by 10 percent on some steel imports (within the WTO bound rates). The overall impact on inflation in South
Africa is therefore ambiguous.
Spillovers from tighter global financial conditions
High external financing needs and a large share of bond and equities held by foreign investors make South
Africa vulnerable to spillovers from tighter global financial conditions. Almost half of South Africa’s portfolio
liabilities are held by U.S. investors. Estimates in Caceres et al. (2016) suggest a 100bps increase in the U.S. policy
rate would increase South African long-term rates by 73bps after one year, above the EM average, but short-term
rates are not significantly affected.4 South Africa-specific estimates underlying the 2014 Spillover Report suggest a
0.2 percent decline in growth after one year following a 100bps rise in U.S. bond yields, with most of the spillovers
coming from a 79bps increase in long-term bond yields and declining equity prices. Simulations using a broader
set of countries in the 2015 Spillover Report and in Buitron and Vesperoni (2016) suggest that an unexpected
tightening of monetary conditions that pushes up U.S. bond yields by 100 bps would spill over to bond yields in
EMs and non-systemic advanced countries, result in capital outflows, and lower industrial production growth by
3½ percent per annum after one year.5 Most EMs would also experience significant exchange rate depreciation,
though South Africa is relatively shielded from negative balance sheet effects given low corporate leverage and
limited FX mismatches.

Box 2. Outward Spillovers to Sub-Saharan Africa
Outward spillovers from South Africa’s growth to SSA are likely to have increased following South African corporates’
expansion in the region and are significant for its immediate neighbors. Increased regional integration could also expose
South Africa to reverse spillovers from the region.
Past research suggests that, apart from its immediate neighbors, South Africa has limited spillovers to the rest of
Africa, but these are likely to have increased. Several studies have shown that South Africa’s growth has limited
spillovers on SSA, once global growth is controlled for.1 However, SSA’s share in South Africa’s imports has more than
doubled over the last decade. South African companies in retail, banking, and telecommunications have established
large networks in several sub-Saharan African countries. South Africa now represents an important export destination
and source of FDI, especially for neighboring countries.

Other countries of the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) will
be the most affected by South Africa’s slowdown. Besides the growth
impact, SACU countries rely heavily on South Africa in their shared
customs receipts, as South Africa accounts for about 85 percent of total
SACU imports. With imports having declined in 2015 and low growth
expected going forward, combined with the lags built in the SACU
revenue formula, this vital source of revenue will decline markedly.

highest in EMs) remain a significant vulnerability.

Though the rate of increase has slowed, as fiscal stimulus injected in response to the global
financial crisis has been withdrawn, government debt continues to rise and is now above the EM
median. This, coupled with low growth, sizable contingent liabilities from financially-weak stateowned enterprises (SOEs) reliant on government guarantees, and spending pressures, triggered
an increase of vulnerabilities in the real and fiscal sectors. These trends are reflected in pressure

Monetary and fiscal policies are on a tightening course. After averaging 4.6 percent in
2015, headline inflation has started rising mostly due to base effects of fuel prices and food prices
reflecting the drought (Figure 6).5 In April 2016, headline and core inflation were at 6.2 percent and
5.5 percent y/y, respectively, versus the 3–6 percent target band. The South African Reserve Bank
(SARB) raised the policy rate by 50bps in 2015 and 75bps in 2016 to 7 percent, citing rising inflation
and elevated risks. Markets expect additional 80bps in hikes by end-2017. Fiscal consolidation, which
started with the 2013 Budget, has resulted mostly in a contractionary stance, but the fiscal deficit
has remained sticky as growth has underperformed (Figure 7).
7.
Most private institutions’ balance sheets remain strong, but financial indicators signal
some deterioration ahead. Financial and corporate soundness indicators remain healthy, as South
African firms have traditionally been run conservatively and benefit from market concentration
(Figures 8 and 9). But a weaker labor market, higher interest rates and inflation, and a softening
housing market are pressuring highly-indebted households. The corporate sector—historically
highly profitable and with low leverage—is seeing lower profitability, with pockets of stress (e.g.,
mining, construction, steel, and agriculture). Equity prices of financial institutions and some
corporates have declined markedly in the past year. Overall equity market performance has been in
line with EMs due to a high share of foreign earnings and dual-listed firms.

The authorities approved a 34 percent increase in wheat-import duties in April 2016, which resulted from the

Financial markets have weakened and financial conditions have tightened.
In the first part of 2015, yields moved in line with other EMs and the nominal effective exchange
rate was stable benefitting from lower oil prices and low dollar debt (Figure 10). But as China
shocks hit, financial markets sold off markedly and more so after leadership changes at the
Treasury. Portfolio outflows ensued, yields rose, and the rand depreciated 14 percent versus the
dollar between October 2015 and February 2016 with rising volatility. Financial markets
recovered some ground up to mid-June, as credit rating agencies maintained their ratings and
global risk sentiment turned more positive toward EMs.

So far, growth in credit to corporates has remained buoyant, underpinned by activities in
renewable energy and commercial property, investments abroad, and substitution for reduced
bond financing. Credit growth to households is subdued. The financial cycle seems to have
peaked at a relatively low level, and the SARB has determined that there is no need to activate
countercyclical capital buffers for banks as the credit gap remains negative. Banks’ funding costs
are rising (partly due to regulatory changes), lending standards have become stricter, and overall
financial conditions have tightened.

Keenly aware of the challenges, the authorities have devised plans to boost growth
and achieve economic transformation, but implementation has fallen short. The authorities
have articulated the NDP’s 2030 vision in the Medium-Term Strategic Framework, successive
Industrial Policy Action Plans, and more recently the Nine-Point Plan (Annex I). However,
implementation has lagged and progress on past Fund advice in the structural area has been mixed.
On the other hand, infrastructure bottlenecks, especially in electricity, have started easing, and
macroeconomic policies have been broadly in line with previous Fund recommendations.
10.
The 2016 Article IV consultation focuses on the recent shocks, risks, and the policy
response. In particular, the consultation centers on: (i) the spillovers from global transitions and the
macro-financial linkages that could amplify or buffer the impact of shocks; (ii) considerations that
may help calibrate the macroeconomic policy mix to minimize the growth impact; and (iii) measures
that can reduce policy uncertainty, and build confidence and trust.

SOBERING OUTLOOK AND ELEVATED DOWNSIDE RISKS
11.
The near-term outlook is based on a projection of further deterioration before a
muted recovery from 2017. The commodity price shock has yet to fully filter through to
production and employment, the global recovery is fragile, macroeconomic policies and financial
conditions are tightening, and high policy uncertainty persists. Against this backdrop, real GDP
growth is projected to fall to 0.1 percent (-1.6 percent in per capita terms) in 2016. Private
investment is expected to contract, consumption growth to weaken, while net exports are projected
to contribute to growth. Electricity bottlenecks are less of a constraint on growth given the
additional generation capacity and subdued demand in the electricity-intensive mining and
manufacturing sectors. Only a feeble recovery is

on weaker terms of trade before improving in the rest of the projection horizon. Inflation is
projected at 6.7 percent in 2016, before easing to 5.6 percent by end-2017.
12.
Downside risks dominate. External risks, notably further shocks from China, a sharp
increase in global financial volatility, and lower global growth weigh heavily on the outlook
(Annex II). Domestic risks are equally prominent, especially from politics and policies perceived to
harm confidence and from the realization of SOEs’ contingent liabilities. All these risks would
depress growth and asset markets and are amplified by South Africa’s vulnerabilities. They would be

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOUTH AFRICA

particularly damaging if accompanied by downgrades of the sovereign credit rating to speculative
grade. On the upside, the recent dialogue between government, businesses, and labor could
catalyze reform implementation and boost activity.
13.
The linkages between capital flows, the sovereign, and the financial sector could
amplify the impact of shocks.


Banks are intermediating a larger share of capital inflows and their ratings are linked to the
sovereign (Box 3). Also, the country’s financial cycle has become increasingly correlated with the
U.S. financial cycle and appears linked to capital flows. In case of a capital outflow shock, import
compression could follow and depress growth. As foreign investors and domestic non-bank
financial institutions adjust their portfolios, large losses in bond and equity markets are likely, as
is a reduction in wholesale funding for banks. Banks’ funding profile would likely worsen, which
combined with new regulatory requirements, could contribute to a significant rise in term
funding premia. Banks’ buffers are deemed sufficient to withstand a significant increase in
non-performing loans (NPLs) on the households’ unsecured credit and corporate books. A
combined shock—higher funding costs, deteriorating asset quality, and reduced liquidity—could
lower financial sector profitability, lead to a liquidity squeeze, induce banks to curtail lending,
and further reduce growth, with sizeable implications for tax revenues: finance, real estate, and
business services account for about half of personal income tax and one third of corporate
income tax.6



Sovereign downgrades could trigger capital outflows. The market appears to have mostly priced
in a downgrade of the sovereign FX debt rating to speculative grade. The impact on the
sovereign would be mitigated by the low level of government FX debt. However, the effect on
SOEs and banks could be more significant, and countries with large SOEs and limited fiscal space
face a stronger sovereign-corporate nexus. Furthermore, downgrades of South Africa’s local
currency sovereign debt rating to speculative grade could have significant consequences, given
that foreigners hold a third of local currency government bonds and about a fifth of that is
estimated to be rating-sensitive, though still two and three notches away and not in staff’s
baseline. In addition, equity flows have shown a high correlation with bond flows in times of
stress, and foreign equity holdings at about 45 percent of GDP are high, though potential
outflows would be mitigated by the fall in equity prices and depreciation. While large domestic
financial institutions could provide a backstop in terms of availability of government financing,
this could amplify vulnerabilities and linkages between capital flows, the sovereign, and the
financial sector. Moreover, a speculative rating would also weaken the profile of the foreign
investor base, making it more reliant on short-term oriented investors.

A further breakdown is not available, but the financial sector accounts for a large share of this aggregate.

Box 3. Macro-Financial Linkages: Capital Flows, the Sovereign, and the Financial Sector1
Extensive macro-financial linkages could amplify shocks given South Africa’s high reliance on external finance,
high foreign ownership of local securities, and banks’ increasing role in intermediating capital flows. Sovereign
rating downgrades to speculative grade could trigger capital outflows and generate negative feedback loops.
Banks are intermediating a larger share of capital inflows. In recent years, South Africa’s external
financing has shifted from portfolio and FDI to other investment, mainly short-term bank flows, and
unrecorded transactions. These inflows have played a

Impact of a potential downgrade of the LC debt to speculative grade. Non-residents hold 34 percent of
South Africa’s LC government bonds, 12.5 percent of GDP. Due to either index restrictions or investment
mandates, staff estimate that a downgrade to speculative grade could trigger forced sales of about 2½
percent of GDP. Other bond investors might also sell anticipating price declines, and equity flows have
displayed high correlation with bond flows in times of stress. With non-resident portfolio equity holdings at
45 percent of GDP, potential equity outflows could be large, though they would be mitigated by
depreciation and price declines.

Sovereign downgrades to speculative grade could reduce participation of long-term nonresident
investors. Typically, real money investors, such as sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and insurance
companies, are more rating-sensitive. Also, a GFSR (2014) study showed that institutional investors (currently
the majority in South Africa) tend to take longer to return after a downgrade to speculative grade compared
to retail investors. Hence, more short-term oriented investors (e.g., hedge funds and mutual funds) that tend
to trade more could hold an increasing share of South Africa’s bonds, possibly resulting in more volatile
portfolio flows.

Authorities’ views
14.
The authorities broadly agree with the near-term outlook, but are more sanguine
about South Africa’s medium-term prospects than staff. They concur on the expected slowdown
in private consumption and investment in the near term due to lower confidence and weaker
commodity prices. They maintain a more positive medium-term outlook on investment and exports,
expected to benefit from a gradual recovery in confidence and external demand, which will allow
companies to capitalize on improved competitiveness from the exchange rate depreciation. The
authorities believe that government and private sector initiatives aimed at expanding infrastructure,
transforming cities, supporting SME development, and regional integration will boost growth and
employment, although these are not included in the authorities’ baseline forecast for 2016. They are
confident about medium-term prospects in the rest of the African continent and the opportunities
that those present for South African firms. They have identified agro-business and tourism, in
addition to the value chains linked to mining and the auto industry, as sectors that can generate
job-rich growth, and view their Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (B-BBEE) and Black
Industrialists policy as likely to lead to significant progress on social transformation.
15.
The authorities concur with the key risks and vulnerabilities, but emphasize that there
are also upside risks. The concerted effort to raise cooperation between social partners to unblock
growth can help leverage South Africa’s strengths. Conservative export forecasts present further
upside to growth. On the downside, the authorities note that prevailing global uncertainties
complicate policy making and give more prominence to risks stemming from trading partners’ lower
growth, the impact of U.S. monetary policy normalization on financial markets and capital flows, and
China’s new growth model. While recognizing the significant impact of possible credit rating
downgrades, the authorities view the risk of a local currency downgrade to speculative grade as
remote at this stage. Finally, they emphasize the economy’s resilience to capital outflows, the flexible
exchange rate, low levels of FX debt, and deep financial and capital markets.

POLICIES
Boosting growth and job creation, thus reducing extremely high unemployment and inequality, and
promoting social transformation remain South Africa’s key challenges. In addition, the shocks that hit
the economy in 2015 require immediate attention to maintain hard-won macroeconomic stability and
restore confidence. Progress in the structural area is urgent given that global growth and commodity
prices are expected to remain low for long, many of the problems are structural, and macroeconomic
policies have to address vulnerabilities. Macroeconomic policies have to be designed and calibrated
carefully: too little tightening and confidence could wane and debt could continue rising, but too much
tightening could further weaken growth and become self-defeating. Recent country experience
suggests that EMs that took more consistent and decisive action and complemented macroeconomic
adjustment with structural reforms achieved the largest improvement in fundamentals and were more
resilient to subsequent shocks.

A. Fiscal Policy
16.

The 2016 Budget envisages additional consolidation aimed at stabilizing debt.



High revenue buoyancy—partly the result of policy measures—and the withdrawal of a
proposed reduction in social security contributions should yield a 3.9 percent of GDP deficit in
FY15/16. With measures to cut compensation budgets and raise revenue, the authorities
anticipate the deficit to fall to 2.4 percent of GDP by FY18/19 and debt to peak at 51 percent of
GDP in FY17/18 and decline thereafter.



The Budget emphasized slowing public sector hiring, greater spending efficiency, and less waste,
mainly by blocking hiring for non-essential personnel in the central payroll system and more
robust procurement processes. But the 2015 public wage settlement and rising interest rates
mean interest and compensation absorb a rising expenditure share (46 percent).

17.
In the baseline scenario, which includes staff’s macroeconomic assumptions and the
proposed Budget measures, achieving the authorities’ targets will be challenging.


The Budget projects higher growth and GDP inflation than staff. As a result, staff project the
fiscal deficit to decline more slowly than in the Budget to 3.2 percent of GDP by FY2018/19. Debt
would reach 53½ percent of GDP by FY2018/19 and continue rising, albeit slowly.



As acknowledged in the Budget, the fiscal outlook is subject to significant risks: weaker growth
and commodity prices, greater support for SOEs, and higher borrowing costs.7 If contingent
liabilities and permanently lower growth materialize, debt could reach 70–75 percent of GDP by
2021 (see accompanying Debt Sustainability Analysis). The mooted new nuclear power plants
could pose considerable fiscal risks depending on scale and modalities. On the upside, buoyancy
could continue exceeding expectations and the authorities’ efforts to combat Base Erosion and
Profit Shifting could widen the tax base.

18.
Policies to maintain debt sustainability are critical for investor confidence, but need to
be carefully chosen and calibrated to avoid pressuring an already-weak economy.


The 2016 Budget is appropriately ambitious, though if staff’s macroeconomic assumptions
materialize debt may not stabilize at 51 percent of GDP in FY17/18 as envisaged by the

7

Although revenue directly linked to the resources sector is only around 2 percent of total, lower commodity prices
have an impact on other sectors of the economy and also lower the GDP deflator which matters for revenue, while
expenditure is linked to CPI.

authorities.8 The sharp adjustment required in a short period of time to keep debt at that level
could reduce growth as much as -1½ percent. Instead, given that the weak economic outlook is
the main reason behind the buildup of fiscal vulnerabilities and that growth is critical for
confidence, implementation of pro-growth structural reforms (as outlined below) would be the
best sustainable way to ensure an improved fiscal outlook over the medium term. Only if such
reforms are not an option, should fiscal policy be tightened further and this should be done over
a multi-year period to minimize the growth decline (which could render the consolidation selfdefeating) and with a composition that protects the poor.


Specifically, building on strengthened procurement processes and performance budgeting could
reduce waste, freeing up resources to aid the consolidation without compromising service
delivery and hence with minimal impact on growth and the poor. Asset sales could also reduce
borrowing and arrest the debt rise, while contributing to growth, especially if combined with
decisive SOE reforms (see below) and appropriate regulatory frameworks.



Absent structural reforms and measures suggested above, additional spending or revenue
measures to stabilize debt at the authorities’ debt peak projection (51 percent of GDP) should
be calibrated based on conservative estimates of the multiplier to ensure credibility, but phased
over a longer period than the three-year budget horizon to smooth the adjustment. Over the
longer term, reducing debt to 40 percent of GDP as recommended in the 2014 Article IV
Consultation Staff Report would be advisable to leave space for shocks.



Laying the groundwork for targeted expenditure cuts, including to the bloated government
wage bill, while protecting social grants and investment, would avoid the need for across-theboard cuts that would be most damaging to growth and hurt especially the poor. If the need for
fiscal consolidation is sizable or large spending projects (e.g., National Health Insurance)
materialize, further revenue measures, notably raising consumption taxes toward the EM
average, could be needed. Strong commitment to a fiscal anchor, besides the expenditure
ceilings, lengthening the budget horizon, and communication about future fiscal policy could be
instrumental in maintaining credibility, in addition to protecting South Africa’s strong fiscal
institutions.

8

Using the approach in Batini, Nicoletta, Luc Eyraud, Lorenzo Forni, and Anke Weber (2014), “Fiscal Multipliers: Size,
Determinants, and Use in Macroeconomic Projects”, the first-year fiscal multipliers in South Africa are estimated to be
between 0.4–0.9. Achieving the authorities’ debt peak projection of 51 percent of GDP in FY17/18 as envisaged by
the authorities would likely require a further adjustment of ¾ to 1½ percent of GDP in FY16/17, depending on
multipliers.

Improving spending efficiency and composition is critical to maintain confidence, ensure
public support for, and minimize the growth impact of the consolidation.


As noted by the Auditor General, progress in strengthening procurement processes has
contributed to a reduction in “irregular, fruitless, and wasteful and unauthorized expenditure” in
the national and provincial governments by 28 percent in FY14/15 relative to FY13/14.9 However,
“irregular, fruitless, and wasteful and unauthorized expenditure” in municipalities increased by 30
percent during the same period and, despite a much smaller budget, is now similar in magnitude
to that seen in national and provincial governments.10 An eTender portal, central supplier
database, and mandatory use of centrally-negotiated contracts should help increase the efficiency
and effectiveness of government spending and, as the Chief Procurement Officer reported, reduce
“the risk of fraud, corruption, and losses”.11 However, increased performance monitoring and
consequences for poor performance (as recommended by the Auditor General) remain important
to ensure that government receives value for money. At the same time, it is critical that the use of
public procurement as a tool to advance social transformation does not undermine transparency
surrounding procurement decisions.

Concrete steps to reform SOEs are needed to lower fiscal risks, and improve confidence
and growth.


The government’s commitment that support to SOEs be budget neutral, and conditional on sound
business plans and improved governance and operational efficiency, is welcome. However, as the
recent report by the Presidential Review Committee on State-Owned Entities notes, SOEs’
challenges require far-reaching reforms (Box 4).



A strong governance framework, including transparency surrounding board appointments and
remuneration of board members and management, and stronger accountability are essential to
improve efficiency and ensure incentives are aligned with those of the country.



Greater private participation—e.g. allowing private competition in some sectors, partial stock
market listings, or management contracts to run certain parts of SOEs’ operations—and effective
regulators could help improve efficiency and service delivery, and free up resources for SOEs’
investments. Clear mandates for every SOE that quantify the cost and address potential conflicts
between commercial and developmental activities would facilitate benchmarking performance and
contribute to greater accountability.

taken into account, and because government is required to compensate for higher inflation but has historically been
unable to claw back lower-than-anticipated inflation.
13

IMF (forthcoming), “Managing Government Compensation and Employment” suggests potential measures to help
control compensation budgets, including aligning public sector wage negotiations with the budget cycle, increasing
National Treasury’s role in wage negotiations, regular payroll audits to eliminate ghost workers, systematic annual
comparisons between public and private wages, and differentiated pay scales to attract and retain staff in areas with
skill shortages.

Authorities’ views
21.
The authorities affirmed their commitment to and confidence in meeting the budget
targets. The authorities’ core commitments are to expenditure limits, achieving a primary surplus over
the medium term, and ensuring a stable national debt-to-GDP ratio. Even if growth were to develop as
in staff’s projections, they maintain that deficit targets are likely to be met in 2016/17—by which time
the bulk of the consolidation will have been achieved. They point to a history of excellent budget
execution (i.e., spending remaining within the expenditure ceiling), the budget’s conservative tax
buoyancy assumptions (relative to recent years), and savings from procurement reforms ensuring that
the Budget’s targets are met. The bulk of the spending reductions have been targeted at
compensation budgets—an area of expenditure that has been a key driver of deficits over the past
decade.
22.
Underscoring their commitment to the debt sustainability principle, the authorities are
committed to take additional measures, should debt stabilization be seriously at risk. They stress
the dilemma that fiscal policy would face, if growth disappointed substantially: if necessary, they will
consider additional reprioritization of spending and additional revenue options as appropriate to
maintain confidence or stretch out the adjustment to minimize the growth impact. The authorities will
balance these imperatives on the basis of data and analysis of fiscal and economic developments as
they materialize over the medium term, but remain committed to the stabilization of debt.
23.
The authorities are taking measures to improve SOEs’ efficiency and governance. They
monitor fiscal risks associated with SOEs on an on-going basis and associated contingent liabilities are
reported in the Budget. The 2016 Budget outlined four broad areas of reform that will be overseen by
the Deputy President, which include exploring ways to stabilize SOEs’ financial performance, quantify
the cost of developmental activities, improve transparency and governance by benchmarking boards’
and executives’ performance and compensation, and where appropriate, seeking greater private sector
participation.

B. Monetary Policy
24.
Inflation is projected to remain elevated, above the target band, but contained. Headline
inflation is rising mostly due to base effects of fuel prices, higher food prices reflecting the drought,
and currency depreciation. Though headline inflation will likely peak at about 7 percent in 2016Q4 and
exceed the target band for the first half of 2017, core inflation is projected at 6 percent in 2016 and to
ease to 5.6 percent in 2017. Staff expect inflation to remain contained for several reasons. The output
gap is projected to widen (to 2¼ percent in 2017). Imported inflation is expected to remain negative in
dollars. The FX pass-through seems unlikely to jump given a widening output gap and still-solid
retailers’ profits (Box 5). Unit labor costs are rising more moderately and job losses should keep them
in check. Inflation expectations remain well-anchored, though slightly above 6 percent. The impact of
the SARB’s hikes is still filtering through, which takes up to six quarters, and regulatory changes being
phased-in will likely tighten financial conditions further.

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOUTH AFRICA

25.
The SARB faces difficult trade-offs and uncertainty. While cutting interest rates would be
unlikely to boost growth as policy uncertainty and reduced investor confidence will likely constrain
private spending, additional monetary tightening would further depress growth.15 And while inflation
is above the band, it is mainly because of supply shocks, which are expected to subside in 2017. Core
inflation is within the band. Moreover, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding inflation
projections, especially due to the volatile exchange rate. Considering that additional monetary
tightening would hurt an already-weak economy and the 2016 Budget envisages sizable consolidation,
monetary policy could remain on hold for now. Consideration could also be given to whether greater
specificity on the inflation target might help enhance communication and guide inflation expectations
within the band.
Authorities’ views
26.
The SARB is concerned about inflation risks and remains focused on its inflation
mandate. The SARB indicates that increases in food and fuel prices, the large exchange rate
depreciation, real wage growth higher than productivity, and the threat of second round effects pose
elevated inflation risks. Recent Monetary Policy Statements reflect concerns that inflation expectations
are cemented at the upper end of the target band, which does not leave room for shocks. Also, the
fact that inflation is projected to stay outside the band for a protracted period risks unhinging inflation
expectations. The SARB views the impact of its actions on economic activity as limited, and reaffirms
that its utmost contribution to growth is via ensuring price stability, which the existing flexible inflation
targeting regime can deliver. The SARB reiterates that they view the real policy rate to be supportive of
the economy, and that any further adjustments to the monetary policy stance would be informed by
incoming data and the potential impact thereof on the inflation trajectory going forward, in the
context of a flexible inflation targeting framework.

15

Staff analysis suggests that a 100bp hike could lower output by 0.3 percent after one year and 0.5 percent after two
years (cumulative), and could lower the price level by 0.6 percentage points after 3 quarters and 1 percentage point
after 6 quarters (cumulative).

Our estimates suggest that the FX pass-through declined
markedly in the early 2000s, while it declined only slightly in
recent years. We focused on non-oil import prices and core
inflation as there exists an automatic mechanism for complete passthrough of fuel prices. Following Chew et al. (2011)3 and Kabundi
and Mbelu (2016), we estimate the FX pass-through using an error
correction model, focusing on non-oil import prices and core
inflation using quarterly data for 1980─2015.4 Average long-run firststage pass-through from the NEER to non-oil import prices
(controlling for foreign producer prices) is about 80 percent, with
full pass-through occurring in six quarters. Average second-stage
pass-through from import prices to core inflation (controlling for
unit labor costs) is about 30 percent. Rolling 10-year window
estimates show large declines in overall FX pass-through around the
time of the introduction of the inflation targeting regime (2000), but
only small declines in recent years, to 22 percent. The pass-through
is found to be smaller when the output gap is negative. This study
finds little evidence that the FX pass-through is related to the size of
the depreciation or exchange rate volatility.

Estimates of the FX pass-through to headline inflation in South
Africa range from around 20 percent1 to the low 10s.2 The SARB
has maintained its estimate of 20 percent, but some recent crosscountry studies find smaller pass-through estimates. Gruss and
Carriere-Swallow (2016) also finds a large decline in FX pass-through
in recent years.

(percent; Index: 2010 = 100)

1990Q1

The FX pass-through has been moderate despite substantial
depreciation since 2010. Core inflation’s increase from 3.0 percent
in 2011Q1 to 5.5 percent in April 2016 is moderate compared to the
48 percent depreciation of the nominal effective exchange rate
(NEER). The global deflationary environment contributed to the
apparently low pass-through. The substantial decline in oil prices in
2015 reduced headline inflation and helped contain core inflation.
The rising share of imports from China (to about 20 percent of nonoil imports), where PPI has been declining for four years,
contributed to the decline in total foreign PPI in 2014/15. As a result,
despite the sizable depreciation of the rand, non-oil import price
growth declined markedly in 2015.

C. Structural Reforms
27.
The authorities have made some progress on structural reforms, especially in
infrastructure, but some other measures have been counterproductive.


The bringing online of Medupi’s first unit and some independent power producers (IPPs),
maintenance improvements, and lower demand have reduced load-shedding. Private providers
have expanded broadband, contributing to improving South Africa’s ranking in the World
Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index. But some freight transport projects are
postponed, port tariffs remain among the highest in the world for manufactured goods, and the
drought has exposed structural challenges in water supply.



The use of Socio-Economic Impact Assessments is a positive step, though not all policy initiatives
are covered. The Employment Tax Incentive Act has led to 270,000 youths being employed during
its first year. The proposed national minimum wage could help reduce inequality, though
depending on its level and modality, risks causing job losses, especially among the less-skilled,
young, and SME workers. The Competition Commission’s pro-active market inquiries in different
product markets hold the promise of facilitating market entry for smaller businesses. Government,
in collaboration with the private sector, is exploring ways to boost SMEs. Nonetheless, large
businesses and labor unions maintain a stronghold on insider-outsider dynamics that contribute to
above-market-clearing wage settlements that are binding on the entire sector and hinder SMEs’
entry and development, and employment. Besides, complex business regulations are particularly
damaging for SMEs.



However, lack of clarity about pending legislation that would determine modalities for property
expropriation and pricing of strategic minerals, as well as implementation of B-BBEEE codes in the
mining sector are examples of policy uncertainty. In addition, stricter limits on temporary contracts
have reduced employment especially for the low skilled. Stricter visa requirements hurt tourism
and their reversal, though partial, is welcome. Finally, BER surveys report that more than 80 percent
of responding firms in the manufacturing sector point to the general political climate as a
constraint on their business.

28.
A comprehensive package of structural reforms remains the preferred policy to increase
growth, create jobs, and lower income inequality. In addition to closing infrastructure gaps, greater
product market competition, more inclusive labor market policies and industrial relations, and
improved education and training remain critical to promote growth and employment in the private
sector. 16 Job creation, especially in SMEs, which are more labor intensive and hire a relatively high
share of low-skilled workers, is the best way to ensure a sustainable reduction in inequality (lowest 20
percent only hold 2.5 percent of national income). These reforms will lower business costs, increase

efficiency, boost employment and savings, and reduce the external gap, making the economy more
resilient. Advancing these reforms will require building trust among stakeholders, ideally via a social
bargain. Labor and businesses could agree on wage restraint in return for saving jobs and hiring
commitments. Government could improve the functioning of SOEs, and the quality of government
services, especially in education, and represent the interest of outsiders (the unemployed and SMEs).
29.
An alternative option might be implementation of a focused set of tangible measures
that can have some positive effects even in the short term and generate reform momentum.


Focus. The severe effects of high unemployment on poverty, inequality, and social cohesion and
analysis pointing to the critical importance of prior work experience suggest a need for a clear
focus on jobs.17 With fiscal space exhausted, the priority must be to boost private sector
employment, including temporary and informal jobs.



Principles. A centralized evaluation of all policy proposals should be done systematically to ensure
that reforms, at a minimum, “do no harm” to growth and private employment. Reforms that
reduce policy uncertainty and boost confidence and trust should be favored.18



Actions. Improving governance and SOEs are key interventions to build confidence and trust.
Clarifying the regulatory environment in mining would help lower policy uncertainty (Box 6).
Reforms in the authorities’ G20 growth strategy—including reducing business costs (e.g., port
tariffs and spectrum allocation for broadband) and trade liberalization to promote regional
integration—would further promote SMEs, and policies to reduce crime and transport costs could
help the unemployed find jobs.19

17

Anand Rahul, Siddharth Kothari, and Naresh Kumar (2016), “South Africa: Labor Market Dynamics and Inequality”,
forthcoming IMF working paper find that the probability of finding a job doubles with prior work experience,
controlling for education attainment.
18

OECD (2010), “Making Reform Happen, Lessons from OECD Countries”, suggests that trust is a key ingredient to
successful structural reforms.
19

Chichello, Paul, Colin Almeleh, Liberty Ncube, and Morné Ooshuizen. (2011), “Perceived Barriers to Entry into SelfEmployment in Khayelistha, South Africa: Crime, Risk, and Start-up Capital Dominate Profit Concerns” argue that crime
is a key deterrent to micro-entrepreneurship, Ngarachu, Maria, Schimmelpfennig, Axel, and Volker Schöer, (2014), “The
Costly Road To Work? Wages and Transport Costs in South Africa”, forthcoming IMF Working Paper, finds that
transportation costs take up significant share of workers’ wages.

Box 6. The Role of Policy Uncertainty and Structural Bottlenecks.
What’s Holding Back Exports?
This box explores the role of policy uncertainty, using a new measure based on “news chatter”. Our results suggest
that policy uncertainty has a negative impact on South African exports and the responsiveness of exports to the
exchange rate depreciation.
Policy Uncertainty
It is well known that investment and exports are subject to partially irreversible fixed costs that result in a real
option value of delaying investments and hiring which increases with rising uncertainty. Baker et al. (2015), for
example, find that increased policy uncertainty leads to diminished investment, employment, and output across
12 major economies.1 To assess the importance of this channel for exports we follow Baker et al. (ibid) and
construct a “news chatter” measure of economic policy uncertainty which tracks news articles that include words
related to policy, economics, and uncertainty in South Africa.2 The resulting index suggests uncertainty was high
around 2012 when industrial relations in the mining sector reached a nadir, and has picked up in recent months
after leadership changes at the Treasury.

REER points to an improvement in competitiveness since 2010, the new competitiveness measure suggests
competitiveness deteriorated in 2011–12 and in 2014. Both regression results and granger causality tests show
that the new measure outperforms the standard REER in explaining export performance.



Timing. Research shows that reforms that increase wage flexibility are particularly important in
bad times as they offer firms channels other than retrenchments to cut labor costs.20 Therefore, the
introduction of the proposed national minimum wage should be accompanied by reforms that
increase wage flexibility, including exempting SMEs from collective bargaining outcomes, and the
introduction of contracts where workers gradually accumulate benefits and job security. While the
benefits from such reforms typically take time to materialize, they could lift growth in the short run
if they boost confidence and signal policy consistency. Furthermore, these labor market reforms
should be supported by product market reforms, such as lowering fees in telecommunications and
transport, which could have large positive spillover effects to other sectors.



Momentum. The authorities need to sustain reform momentum even as some impediments to
growth are lifted and others become binding. Other countries’ experience highlights the
importance of publicizing successful reforms.21

Authorities’ views
30.
The authorities re-affirm the primacy of the National Development Plan and are
committed to speeding up its implementation. The NDP (2012-2030) is being implemented
through successive 5-year Medium Term Strategic Frameworks, which inform the expenditure
framework on which the Budget is based. Based on short-term circumstances and risks, the authorities
revisit policy priorities each year and monitor and evaluate departments’ performance. The Nine-Point
Plan is one such mechanism and puts forward immediate actions/priorities for government to boost
growth and employment. Recognizing challenges to policy implementation at the sectoral level, the
authorities are implementing the Malaysian style fast results framework, called Project “Phakisa,” to
unblock implementation challenges through work with social partners on sector-specific
interventions.22 To date, this style of intervention has been utilized to explore opportunities in the
oceans economy, reforming education and primary health care, and transforming the mining industry.
31.
The authorities highlight that cooperation with social partners and policy certainty are
imperative for higher inclusive growth and are optimistic that results are forthcoming.
The dialogue with social partners focuses on three key areas: (i) restoring confidence and
reaffirming the country’s investment grade rating; (ii) catalyzing employment growth in key
sectors; and (iii) SOE reforms, including exploring opportunities for private sector participation.
The interactions have already resulted in the creation of an SME venture fund, which includes
not only finance, but also mentoring by seasoned business leaders for start-ups.



To improve industrial relations, the government is finalizing a framework with social partners
to reduce economic disruption caused by large, protracted strikes. Further, the national
minimum wage will be an important tool in addressing income inequality: the modalities are
being discussed, but the government will ensure that due consideration is given to minimizing
possible adverse employment effects.



The authorities point to bright spots of increased FDI in the automotive industry after the
renewal of the support program till 2020 and of the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act till
2025, and higher numbers of tourist arrivals after the partial reversal of visa requirements: they
hail these as examples of policy certainty.
32.
The government is committed to infrastructure investments and is exploring ways to
boost the economy with a range of interventions.



The authorities highlight that energy supply is currently stable. They have stepped up efforts to
partner with the private sector and the renewable energy independent power producer (IPP)
program has begun to diversify South Africa’ energy mix. Building on the success of these IPPs,
the authorities have solicited bids for a coal-fired IPP. A similar process has been instituted for
gas-fired IPPs. The BRICS New Development Bank recently approved a loan for electricity
transmission lines.



InvestSA is a one-stop shop that should facilitate FDI by coordinating and accelerating
government departments’ approvals. A Red Tape Impact Assessment bill dedicated to
reducing red tape is with parliament and the authorities are assessing the ease of doing
business across various municipalities to improve the business environment, especially for
SMEs. Nine of the largest municipalities are undertaking a peer learning process based on a
World Bank survey to roll out good practices. Government and businesses are working closely
via the Presidential Business Working Group to address regulatory and licensing issues, and
the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Investment will oversee progress and alleviate indentified
obstacles.



To enhance competition, the Competition Act amendment (into effect from May 1) classifies
cartel behaviour as a criminal rather than a statutory offence.



The authorities are confident that South Africa will soon ratify the World Trade Organisation
Trade Facilitation Agreement, and that tangible progress is being made for the Tripartite Free
Trade Zone between the East Africa Community (EAC), the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA), and the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) with the
framework agreement completed and the Tripartite Free Trade Area launched in June 2015.
The African Union Heads of State and Government also have commenced negotiations for the
Continental Free Trade Agreement.



The authorities also maintain that the recently-approved Protection of Investment Act will
ensure that South Africa continues to provide protection to foreign investors in a manner

consistent with Constitution and in accordance with international best practice and
international customary law.

D. Other Policies to Manage Vulnerabilities and Strengthen Resilience
33.
Despite the large currency depreciation, South Africa’s external position is moderately
weaker than desirable. The REER has depreciated by 32 percent since December 2010. But the
current account deficit is still 1½–2½ percent of GDP wider than the estimated norm, though the gap
is narrowing (Annex III). A low saving rate—reflecting inter alia low employment—is the root cause.
The envisaged fiscal consolidation will help raise savings, but structural policies that can raise
employment and eventually household savings remain essential for a sustained improvement, as well
as to increase competitiveness (including via reducing business costs) and the responsiveness of the
trade balance to exchange rate depreciation.

for funding FX purchases, and investigate the
nature of unrecorded transactions. Many of the reforms outlined above to improve the business
environment and reduce policy uncertainty, as well as facilitating highly-skilled immigration, would
help attract FDI and boost South Africa’s role as gateway to Africa.
35.

Financial reforms are advancing.



The Financial Sector Regulation Bill is expected to be promulgated in 2016. In line with the 2014
FSSA, it implements the Twin Peaks system, consolidates financial sector supervision at the SARB
(including enhancing group-wide supervision), and creates the new Financial Sector Conduct
Authority to improve consumer protection. A draft bill to introduce a resolution framework in line
with the Financial Stability Board’s Key Attributes of Effective Resolution is expected in 2016Q4 and
will facilitate intervening failing institutions, discourage wholesale funding by clarifying the
hierarchy of claims, and introduce a deposit guarantee scheme. Parliament is expected to consider
the new Insurance Bill that would strengthen prudential regulation in 2016.



The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) requirement has risen to 70 percent from January 2016, and will
rise progressively to 100 per cent (of which up to 40 percent from the SARB’s Committed Liquidity

30

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOUTH AFRICA

Facility) in 2019 vs. the current 84 per cent. Requirements for Domestic Systematically Important
Banks will be fully implemented in 2016 and risk-based capital will be fully implemented in 2019.


Banks have started to reduce short-term wholesale funding and rely more on term funding and
retail deposits in anticipation of the implementation of the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) from
2018. The SARB’s application of national discretion has made the NSFR less challenging.23

36.
Banks’ asset quality and profitability are likely to deteriorate, requiring heightened
monitoring. NPLs are likely to rise moderately with the weaker economy and employment outlook
and tighter financing conditions. While higher interest rates initially boost banks’ profitability, as most
loans are at floating rates and re-price faster than banks’ liabilities, this eventually reverses as credit
costs rise. Banks’ profitability is also pressured by higher funding costs as they source longer-term
funding and increase capital. SARB’s recent stress tests indicate that even in severe adverse scenarios
with a protracted recession or high financial market volatility with significant depreciation, banks’
average common equity tier 1 capital adequacy ratio remains above of the regulatory requirement.24
However, banks’ net open FX position (negative) has recently increased and there could be maturity
mismatches in banks’ FX portfolios. Also, rollover risks and higher hedging costs could rise at times of
lower capital inflows. Given that risks are amplified by extensive macro-financial linkages,
consideration could be given to combining the shocks analyzed in the stress tests with liquidity shocks
associated with capital outflows, and planning measures that could address potential disorderly
market conditions. Also, supervisors could consider examining banks’ capital plans and the expected
path with intensified scrutiny. If weaknesses are identified, additional reserves, higher provisions, or
restrictions on dividends distribution might be needed. A strengthened crisis preparedness plan that
involves both the SARB and the National Treasury would be helpful.
37.
Recent country experience suggests that EMs that took consistent and decisive action
became more resilient. Policy responses to external shocks since the taper tantrum varied, reflecting
different fundamentals, policy space, and political constraints (Box 7). Like South Africa, most EMs
allowed exchange rates to act as shock-absorber, hiked policy rates, and announced fiscal tightening.
However, countries that achieved the most significant improvements in fundamentals and boosted
growth also took structural reform measures, including steps to facilitate FDI, labor and product
market reforms, actions to increase private sector participation in state-controlled sectors, and fuel
subsidy reforms. As a result, these countries were more resilient during subsequent shocks.

Given the existence of exchange controls on residents, the SARB has proposed an available stable funding (ASF)
factor of 35 percent (instead of the standard 0 percent) to funding from financial corporate customers with a residual
maturity of less than six months. On the other hand, the SARB’s proposal of assigning a required stable funding (RSF)
factor of 5 percent to minimum cash reserves (and 0 percent for any excess reserves) is more conservative than the
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which assigns 0 percent to all central bank reserves.

Authorities’ views
38.
The authorities concur that the current account deficit is somewhat high. They project the
current account deficit to remain between 4 and 5 percent of GDP over the medium term. But they
note positive developments in FDI and export prospects in the automotive sector, improving services
balance, and the prospects of improvement in the long-standing income balance deficit as South
African firms’ outward FDI matures. The authorities are less concerned about increased banks’ funding
abroad as it is mainly matched by FX loans for offshore expansion to domestic firms on the strength of
their South African balance sheets. They agree that the net creditor position is a source of strength,
but indicate that it could change easily given high exchange rate volatility. Finally, the authorities note
the difficulties in assessing the level of the REER given the many structural factors affecting South
Africa’s competitiveness.
39.
The authorities remain committed to a flexible exchange rate regime. The floating
exchange rate regime continues to be the key adjustment mechanism to external shocks, including
capital account shocks. Exposure to exchange rate risk in banks’, corporations’, and households’
balance sheets is limited, and SOEs are required to hedge fully their exchange and interest rate risks.
Less than 10 percent of government debt is in FX. They concur with staff that large scale FDI inflows
could present opportunities for reserve accumulation.
40.
The authorities broadly share staff’s assessment of the vulnerabilities, and remain
confident about financial sector health. Since the 2014 FSAP, they have implemented several of the
recommendations to enhance the regulatory architecture and are making good progress toward an
upgraded resolution framework. They have completed their first top down stress test since the 2014
Financial Sector Assessment Program that attests to the soundness of the banking sector in severe
stress scenarios, given large capital buffers and high profitability. The authorities appreciate staff’s
analysis of macro-financial linkages, though they see protracted low growth and the attendant asset
quality deterioration as the most prominent risk rather than liquidity shocks. They also underscore
mitigating factors, especially the depth and liquidity of the financial sector and a strong domestic
investor base.



Most countries hiked policy rates (by 75-625 basis points bps). Once inflationary pressure subsided, some
countries were able to reverse the tightening partially (Indonesia) or fully (India). Mexico eased initially,
and tightened later on. Poland lowered rates since 2013.



Most countries announced fiscal tightening measures, with varying degrees of success. India and Mexico
introduced expenditure rationalization policies. Mexico approved a tax reform in 2013. South Africa
announced further fiscal consolidation. In early 2015, Brazil announced a fiscal adjustment plan, but
revised down its fiscal targets later on in view of weak revenue performance and political difficulties
getting measures approved by Congress. Turkey maintained a neutral fiscal policy stance. Poland
strengthened its fiscal position.



Some countries took structural reform measures. India allowed higher FDI in multiple sectors, including
infrastructure, and insurance. India and Indonesia undertook fuel subsidy reforms. Mexico allowed
greater private sector participation in the energy sector, and undertook labor and product market
reforms. Indonesia launched a series of economic packages, including trade liberalization measures,
easier tourist visa regulations, actions to increase predictability and transparency in the labor market,
actions to ease the process of business, and measures to facilitate private investment in infrastructure.
Poland took actions to increase labor market flexibility, and ease administrative requirements for
business start-ups and construction permits.



Other measures included temporary import restrictions and mobilizing diaspora savings (India), easing of
inflow CFMs (Brazil and Indonesia), and contingent credit lines.

reforms, actions to
increase private sector participation in state-controlled sectors, and fuel subsidy reforms. In general, countries
that undertook decisive reform efforts boosted confidence, were able to maintain robust growth and improve
macro fundamentals, and were relatively less affected during subsequent shocks.

STAFF APPRAISAL
41.
South Africa has achieved remarkable progress in two decades of democracy, but faces
unacceptably high unemployment and inequality. Strong institutions and policy frameworks have
contributed to macroeconomic stability and rising living standards in the democratic era. Yet,
infrastructure bottlenecks, skill mismatches, and harmful insider-outsider dynamics have prevented
many South Africans from benefiting from these improvements. On top of these deep-rooted
impediments, the economy has been adversely affected by external shocks and domestic confidence
shocks that have heightened governance concerns and policy uncertainty.
42.
The outlook is sobering and downside risks prevail. Growth is projected to weaken further
in 2016—the third year in which per capita incomes would fall. The muted recovery expected from
2017 is likely insufficient to address unemployment and inequality. The main risks stem from further
shocks from China, tighter global financial conditions, lower growth, political risks, and SOEs’
contingent liabilities. Vulnerabilities and linkages between capital flows, the sovereign, and the
financial sector could amplify the impact of shocks, especially if combined with sovereign credit rating
downgrades to speculative grade. The recent dialogue between government, businesses, and labor is
welcome and could yield concrete results.
43.
Structural reforms are urgent and imperative. With fiscal and monetary policy having to
address vulnerabilities and given the many structural obstacles, structural reforms are the only
sustainable way to boost growth, create more jobs, and reduce inequality. The authorities have made
welcome progress in infrastructure, but action is urgently needed in other areas. Ensuring that the
proposed national minimum wage is designed so as not to undermine job creation and the goal of
reducing income inequality is important. While some structural reforms take time to yield positive
growth effects, immediate benefits from a carefully-designed reform package can stem from
confidence effects and signalling of policy consistency. A comprehensive package of reforms, ideally
via a social bargain that includes greater product market competition, more inclusive labor market
policies and industrial relations, and improved education/training remains the preferred option. An
initial, focused set of tangible measures could help boost confidence and trust, lower policy
uncertainty, and hence generate sustained reform momentum.
44.
The 2016 Budget is appropriately ambitious, though additional measures might be
needed to stabilize debt over the medium term. The buildup of fiscal vulnerabilities reflects lowerthan-anticipated growth, not a lack of fiscal discipline. Growth-enhancing structural reforms, measures
to boost spending efficiency, including by limiting the public wage bill, and greater private
participation in SOEs are therefore the best sustainable ways to stop debt from rising. Asset sales
could also be considered. But if growth underperforms and the measures above do not materialize, a
package of fiscal measures that maintains medium-term debt sustainability while minimizing the
negative growth impact and protecting the poor may be needed. Concrete progress on reforming
SOEs is essential to improve governance and public services, and would boost private sector growth.
45.
The SARB could consider holding interest rates unless core inflation or inflation
expectations rise substantially. With the impact of past policy rate hikes still filtering through and

34

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOUTH AFRICA

financial conditions still expected to tighten, a widening output gap and sizable fiscal consolidation are
expected to help contain inflation. This suggests that monetary policy might be able to remain on
hold, unless inflation expectations or core inflation increase markedly, or external financing becomes
problematic. The SARB could consider ways to enhance its inflation targeting regime to facilitate
guiding inflation expectations within the band.
46.
Advances in financial sector reforms are welcome and heightened monitoring of
financial sector risks and contingency planning is warranted. Financial sector reforms are
progressing and are in line with FSSA recommendations. The SARB’s recent stress tests find that South
Africa’s financial system is well capitalized and can sustain large shocks. Nevertheless, stepping up the
monitoring of financial sector risks and contingency planning is warranted given the rising pressures
that the weak economy, tightening financial conditions, and regulatory changes are imposing on the
financial system.
47.
Higher reserves and attracting a stronger external financing mix would boost resilience.
South Africa’s strength includes a floating exchange rate, favorable currency and maturity debt
structure, and a net external creditor position. The current account deficit remains higher than the
estimated norm despite the large depreciation, though some adjustment is occurring. International
reserves are below desirable levels, and the SARB should seize opportunities to increase reserves.
48.

It is proposed that South Africa remain on the standard 12-month Article IV cycle.

Annex I. The Authorities’ Development Plans
➢ National Development Plan (NDP), 2012, (National Planning Commission,

http://www.npconline.co.za/pebble.asp?relid=25) is the government’s strategic long-term plan.
The NDP provides 2030 targets for investment, growth, and employment creation. It focuses on
infrastructure, education/skill development, and better public service delivery to reach these goals,
and emphasizes that South Africa requires both a capable and developmental state and “… a
vibrant and thriving private sector able to investment, employ people and penetrate global
markets.” It envisages “…professionalizing the public service, strengthening accountability,
improving coordination, and prosecuting corruption” as means.

➢ Medium Term Strategic Framework (MTSF), 2014, (Department of Planning, Monitoring and

Evaluation, http://www.thepresidency-dpme.gov.za/Pages/default.aspx) is the government's
framework to implement the NDP and the ANC’s 2014 election manifesto over 2014–19.1 In
Minister Radebe’s words, “the aim of the MTSF is to ensure policy coherence, alignment and
coordination across government plans.” It maintains the focus on public infrastructure and calls for
increased dialogue between government and businesses. It aims at promoting SMEs and
strengthening competition.

➢ Industrial Policy Action Plan (IPAP 2016/17–2018/19, 8th annual edition) (Department of

Trade and Industry, http://www.thedti.gov.za/editmedia.jsp?id=3726) focuses on government
interventions and trade policy to stimulate industrial development and diversify exports. It plans to
increase public procurement to promote local production and localized supply chains. Special
focus is devoted to the following sectors: textiles, agro-processing, automobiles, business
processing services, and the ocean economy.

➢ New Growth Path (NGP, 2009) (Economic Development Department,

http://www.economic.gov.za/communications/publications/new-growth-path-series), identifies key
sectors to diversify and grow the economy and create “decent” jobs (five million jobs by 2020). The
NGP starts by identifying where employment creation is possible. The sectors identified are:
infrastructure, the agricultural and mining value chains, the green economy, manufacturing (metal
fabrication, machinery and equipments etc.), tourism, and certain high level services. It combines
macroeconomic and microeconomic interventions.

➢ Nine-Point Plan (2016) (State of the Nation Address, http://www.gov.za/issues/nine-point-plan)
highlights the following areas to achieve faster growth, job creation, and radical economic
transformation: agriculture, increasing value added to minerals, more effective industrial policies,
SMEs, resolving the energy challenge, stabilizing the labor market; scaling up private investment,
and SOEs.

The ANC manifesto (http://www.anc.org.za/2014/anc-manifesto/together-we-move-south-africa-forward/) states that
achieving these goals require “that we build a democratic developmental state capable of mobilizing all sectors and
boldly intervening in the economy in favor of workers and the poor.” Also, the manifesto states that “Within the NDP
vision, critical policy instruments will continue to drive government’s policy agenda,” and these policy instruments
include NGP, National Infrastructure Plan and IPAP.”

1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to
materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding
the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and
“high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as
of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Annex III. External Sector Assessment
South Africa
Foreign asset
and liability
position and
trajectory

Background. South Africa’s net international investment position shifted to 18 percent of GDP as of end-2015 from
-8 percent of GDP at end-2014, driven primarily by currency depreciation. Total gross external liabilities amounted to
139 percent of GDP,1 up from 130 percent of GDP at end-2014. Gross external debt, which rose rapidly from 26 percent
in 2008, stood at 39½ percent of GDP as of end-2015, of which 14½ percent of GDP was short-term (residual maturity).
Assessment. Large gross external liabilities, including large holdings of local-currency denominated bonds by
nonresidents, pose risks. These risks are mitigated by a large external asset position, totaling 157 percent of GDP as of
end-2015 (of which 40 percent are hard-to-liquidate FDI assets), and majority large share of external debt
(50½ percent) being in rand.
Background. The current account (CA) deficit narrowed to 4.3 percent of GDP in 2015 from 5.4 percent in 2014, as a
result of lower oil prices, while the trade deficit widened in volume terms. The deterioration in the trade balance in
volume terms seen in 2015, however, may not be a good indication of underlying trends in the external accounts, as it
was partly due to a rebound in imports from a depressed level in 2014 when protracted strikes reduced demand for
intermediate and consumption imports. The CA deficit is projected to narrow slightly to 4.1 percent of GDP in 2016.
Assessment. The CA regression model estimates a CA norm of -1.4 percent of GDP, and a CA gap of -2½ percent of
GDP for 2015, down from -3½ percent of GDP in 2014. The CA gap is largely explained by the regression residual,
reflecting structural factors that are not captured by the model. Staff assesses the CA to be 1½ to 2½ percentage
points weaker than implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings in 2015.2 Addressing structural
rigidities remains key to accelerate the pace of adjustment.

Real exchange
rate

Background. The CPI- and ULC-based REERs were broadly unchanged on average in 2015, following a depreciation of
about 30 percent since 2010. While the CPI-based REER has already reversed the 2009-10 appreciation, the ULC-based
REER remains about 12 percent more appreciated than at end-2008. As of April 2016, the REER has weakened by about
15 percent relative to the 2015 average
Assessment. Consistent with the assessment of the CA gap, staff assesses a REER overvaluation of 0-10 percent for
2015, down from 5-20 percent in 2014.3 The magnitude of the REER misalignment relies on estimates of the elasticity
of the CA to the REER.4 The REER overvaluation would come down if structural rigidities currently hampering the pace
of external adjustment were addressed.

57

Capital and
financial
accounts:
flows and policy
measures

Background. Net FDI declined to -1.1 percent of GDP in 2015, from -0.5 percent of GDP in 2014. Portfolio, other
investment flows (mainly bank flows), and unrecorded transactions financed the CA deficit. Gross external financing
needs totaled 19 percent of GDP in 2015.
Assessment. High reliance on non-FDI flows and high nonresident holdings of local financial assets pose risks. These
are mitigated by a floating exchange rate, the fact nonresident portfolio holdings are mainly denominated in local
currency, and a large domestic institutional investor base subject to capital controls.

FX intervention
and reserves
level

Background. South Africa has a floating exchange rate regime. Foreign exchange intervention is rare. Reserves cover
96 percent of gross external financing needs and over five months of imports, but are below the IMF’s composite
adequacy metric (at 87 percent of the metric without considering capital flow management measures, and 96 percent
of it considering them).
Assessment. As conditions allow, reserve accumulation is desirable to strengthen the external liquidity buffer, subject
to maintaining the primacy of the inflation objective.

Overall Assessment:
The external position in 2015 was
moderately weaker than implied by
desirable policy settings and medium-term
fundamentals. Lower oil prices contributed
to the external adjustment.
In 2015, the current account deficit gap
declined. However, South Africa remains
highly reliant on non-FDI flows to finance
its still relatively high CA deficit. Despite
the REER depreciation of recent years,
structural constraints result in a slow pace
of CA adjustment. High gross external
liabilities and large gross external financing
requirements pose risks. A reduction in
capital inflows would complicate the
financing of the CA deficit and, if severe,
could lower growth markedly. Subsequent
developments as of May 2016 point to a
broadly unchanged current account
position, and do not alter the assessment
of the external position.
Potential policy responses:
Structural reforms are key to accelerate the
external adjustment and boost domestic
savings. Implementation of the authorities’
National Development Plan, especially
upgrades in infrastructure and
education/skills, would help improve
competitiveness over the medium term
and increase employment and savings, but
reducing policy uncertainty and additional
labor and product market reforms are also
essential.
Fiscal consolidation will help reduce the
current account deficit and alleviate
external vulnerabilities. A build-up of
reserves would strengthen the country’s
ability to deal with FX liquidity shocks.

Overall Assessment

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

1/ Of the 139 percent of GDP in total external liabilities as of end-2015, 47 percent were portfolio investment liabilities, 35 percent were direct investments, and the
remainder 18 percent were financial derivatives and other investments. Total external assets amounted to 157 percent of GDP as of end-2015, of which 40 percent were
direct investments, 36 percent were portfolio investment assets, 11 percent were reserve assets, and the remainder 13 percent were financial derivatives and other
investment assets.
2/ The CA gap presented here results from the CA regression approach and the External Sustainability (ES) approach. The ES approach compares the CA balance
expected to prevail in the medium term with the one that would stabilize South Africa’s stock of net foreign assets at its EM peers’ benchmark (-35 percent of GDP).
According to this approach, to stabilize South Africa’s net IIP at the peers’ level, South Africa’s CA deficit would need to be 2½ percent of GDP, compared to staff’s
projection of a CA deficit of about 3½ percent of GDP over the medium term, thus resulting in a CA gap of about -1½ percent of GDP. The CA regression approach
yields a gap for 2014 of -2½ percent of GDP. Hence, the staff’s gap range for 2015 is centered on -2 percent of GDP.
3/ The EBA REER regressions (which use the CPI-based REER) point to undervaluation for 2015. The EBA REER Index regression gives an undervaluation of 23 percent,
while the REER Level regression estimates an undervaluation of 4 percent for 2015. Gauging the appropriate REER for South Africa is challenging due to its structural
changes since 1994 and high REER volatility. The history of South Africa’s REER divides roughly into two periods and levels: before 2000 the average level was much
higher than the post-2000 average. Moreover, the REER has fallen steeply over the last several years. In this context, REER regression-based models that use CPI-based
REERs are very likely to point to undervaluation, unless they can link the full downward trend of the REER to deteriorating fundamentals. Also, the sensitivity of trade
flows to the exchange rate movements appears lower than implied by long-run elasticities, as structural impediments, including electricity shortages, prolonged strikes,
and concentrated product markets, hamper adjustment. It appears that the level of the REER that is consistent with a given level of the current account has declined
over time, but empirical models are unable to fully explain this shift. Other indicators, including the EBA CA regression model and South Africa’s declining share in
world’s exports, suggest overvaluation.
4/ Using the CA gap range and applying a long-run elasticity estimate would suggest a REER overvaluation of about 5-8 percent. However, considering the uncertainty
regarding the elasticity, possible lags for REER adjustment to have effects on the current account balance, and signs that some volume adjustment is in train, staff
assesses REER overvaluation in the order of 0 to10 percent.

SOUTH AFRICA

South Africa has consented to the quota increase under the 14th General Review of Quotas which
will essentially double the IMF’s quota resources, once effective. South Africa also accepted the
proposed amendment to reform the Executive Board. The quota increases will become effective
once the proposed amendment to reform the Executive Board enter into force, which occurs once
the Fund certifies that three-fifths of the IMF members (i.e., 113 members out of the currently 188)
having 85 percent of the total voting power have accepted the proposed amendment.1 South
Africa’s quota under the 14th General Review will increase to SDR 3,051.2 million (R 38.6 billion).
In September 2010, South Africa also agreed to lend the IMF up to SDR 340 million (R 4.3 billion)
under the New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB). The NAB is a set of credit arrangements the IMF has
with 40 member countries and/or its institutions. Currently 37 of these arrangements are active and
thus can be drawn by the IMF to supplement its quota resources for lending purposes. South Africa
is paid interest on its loans to the IMF under the NAB based on the SDR interest rate. As of end-May,
South Africa had lent SDR 41.2 million (R 570.8 million) to the IMF under the NAB.
In 2012, the South African pledged $2 billion (R16.8 billion) to boost IMF resources, as part of a
global drive to help strengthen global economic and financial stability. Subsequently, a bilateral
borrowing agreement between the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) and the IMF has been
approved by the IMF’s Executive Board.
Exchange rate arrangement
The rand floats against other currencies, and South Africa maintains an exchange system
consistent with obligations under Article VIII of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement. 2 South
Africa’s de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating, and the de facto arrangement is floating.
Its exchange system is free of multiple currency practices and restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions. South Africa has continued to
gradually liberalize the system of capital controls in place since the apartheid regime.
With the abolition of the financial rand in 1995, all exchange controls on nonresidents were
eliminated. Nonresidents are free to purchase shares, bonds, and other assets and to repatriate
dividends, interest receipts, and current and capital profits, as well as the original investment capital.
Foreign companies, African governments, and institutions may list equity and debt instruments on
South Africa’s securities exchanges.
Exchange controls on capital transactions by residents have been gradually relaxed. The
authorities’ main objective has been to move toward a system based on prudential limits and
1

The two additional conditions for the proposed quota increases to become effective have already been met, i.e., the
entry into force of the Voice and Participation Amendment of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement and the consent of
members having not less than 70 percent of the total quotas (as of November 5, 2010) to the increase in their
quotas.

The 2014 Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on December 3, 2014. South

Technical assistance
Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) technical assistance (TA) missions
In April 2013, an FAD TA mission visited Cape Town to support the authorities in the establishment
of a new Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO). An FAD mission visited Pretoria in August 2013 to
discuss options for the National Treasury to strengthen their performance management systems. In
December 2013, the National Treasury and FAD held a joint workshop on fiscal risks. In June 2014,
FAD missions provided advice on expenditure reviews and on options for further strengthening the
PBO, while a mission visited the South African Revenue Service (SARS) to conduct a pilot of the Tax
Administration Diagnostic Assessment Tool (TADAT). As part of the technical support for the Davis
Tax Committee, an FAD mission on VAT gaps took place in August 2014 and January 2015, and
missions on natural resource taxation took place in January and November 2015. An FAD mission
visited Pretoria in March 2015 on public sector balance sheets. In December 2015, an FAD mission
conducted a workshop on wage bill management and PBO analysis. In March 2016, an FAD mission
followed up on the review of mining and petroleum fiscal regimes.
Monetary and Capital Markets Department (MCM) technical assistance (TA) missions
In May 2014, an MCM mission took place to conduct the training on banking sector stress test for
the SARB. In August 2015, an MCM mission conducted seminars on stress testing.
Legal Department (MCM) technical assistance (TA) missions
In January 2015, a LEG mission provided technical assistance on fiscal law of the extractive industries
in conjunction with FAD’s mission on national taxation.

THE JMAP WORLD BANK IMF MATRIX
The IMF South Africa team led by Ms. Laura Papi (mission chief) met with the World Bank South
Africa team led by Mr. Guang Zhe Chen (country director) in April 2016, to discuss macrocritical
structural issues and to coordinate the two teams’ work for April, 2016–May, 2017.
The teams agreed that South Africa’s macroeconomic challenges include promoting job creation
and improving the long-run inclusive growth needed for maintaining social cohesion, and
macroeconomic stability.
The teams have the following requests for information from their counterparts:


The IMF team asks to be kept informed of progress in the macrocritical structural reform areas
under the World Bank’s purview. Timing: when milestones are reached or in the context of
missions (and at least semiannually).



The World Bank team asks to be kept informed of progress in the macrocritical structural reform
areas under the IMF’s purview. Timing: when milestones are reached (and at least semiannually).

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provided to the IMF are adequate for surveillance. South Africa subscribed to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) on August 2, 1996, and is in observance of specifications for
coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of data, although using a flexibility option on the timeliness
and periodicity of unemployment data. A Report on Observance of Standards and Codes—Data
Module, Response by the Authorities, and Detailed Assessments Using the Data Quality Assessment
Framework (DQAF) was published on October 16, 2001.
Real sector statistics
Reporting of real sector data for International Financial Statistics (IFS) is timely. Statistics South
Africa, which has been responsible for compiling GDP data by production, has now also taken over
the compilation of GDP data by expenditure from the SARB. The revised 2010−15 GDP data were
published in May 2016. GDP data are compiled according to SNA2008, with a base year of 2010.
Quarterly labor market statistics are published one month after the end of the previous quarter.
Given the seriousness of the unemployment problem, labor market analysis and policy design would
benefit from better and more frequent labor market data. A new Quarterly Labor Force Survey
(QLFS) was launched in January 2008 based on major revisions to the old Labour Force Survey that
was in existence since 2000. Since 2015, a new Master Sample has been now introduced based on
the 2011 census data. The new Master Sample should improve the level of precision in the estimates
produced compared to the prior Master Sample which was only based on the prior census in 2001.
The consumer price index (CPI) covers all households living in metropolitan and urban areas, which
represent approximately 61 percent of the total number of households based on the 2010/11
Income and Expenditure Survey. The current CPI weights were derived primarily from Stats SA’s
household expenditure survey. Current price indices are compiled with December 2012=100.
Government finance statistics
Data for the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook and IFS are compiled and disseminated
according to the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 framework. Data for social security
funds and central government’s extra budgetary funds have been reported on an accrual basis,
starting in 2000 and 2002, respectively. Starting in 2005, the authorities have included additional
noncash data for other levels of government, consistent with their migration to accrual reporting.
South Africa currently reports data for the consolidated general government for publication in the
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. It also reports monthly data covering the cash operations
of the budgetary central government for publication in IFS.

Monetary statistics
Monetary statistics compiled by the SARB are consistent with the methodology of the Monetary and
Financial Statistics Manual. South Africa reports regular and good quality monetary statistics for
publication in the IFS, although there is room for improving the timeliness of the data on other
financial corporations.
Balance of payments statistics
Balance of payments and international investment position data are broadly consistent with the sixth
edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM6). The authorities have improved the coverage of
trade flows within the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) in 2013. Work is needed to improve
the reliability and accuracy of balance of payments data with the aim of reducing errors and
omissions.
Data on the international reserves position are disseminated in line with the requirements of the
IMF’s template on international reserves and foreign currency liquidity.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV
June 15, 2016

CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By
Anne-Marie Gulde-Wolf
and Vivek Arora

Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2016 Article IV
Consultation with South Africa

The increase in government debt to 50 percent of GDP in FY2015/16 from 27 percent
of GDP in FY2008/09 has raised fiscal risks. Recognizing this fact, the 2015 and 2016
Budgets announced fiscal measures aimed at narrowing the deficit and stabilizing debt.
Notwithstanding these measures, this debt sustainability analysis (DSA) suggests that
the debt ratio may continue to rise over the projection horizon if staff’s
macroeconomic projections materialize, albeit more slowly than in recent years. Also,
further negative shocks represent a significant risk to the debt and financing outlook. In
particular, permanently low growth or a realization of large contingent liabilities from
state-owned enterprises (SOEs) could push debt above the DSA’s 70 percent of GDP
high-risk threshold, and the debt-to-GDP ratio could exceed 65 percent if the economy
were buffeted by a standard combined macro-fiscal shock. In addition, South Africa’s
gross financing needs are projected to remain elevated and exceed the high-risk
15 percent of GDP threshold under several of the shock scenarios considered in the
analysis. Risks to the fiscal outlook have increased since the 2014 Article IV
consultation, and if staff’s macroeconomic assumptions materialize, further measures
will likely be required to ensure South Africa’s debt remains sustainable.

SOUTH AFRICA

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS1
1.
Macroeconomic assumptions. Real GDP growth is projected at 0.1 percent in 2016 but is
expected to increase to 1.1 percent in 2017 and 2 percent in 2018 as a result of some easing of electricity
constraints. Over the medium term, growth is projected at around 2-2½ percent. The GDP deflator is
expected to average close to 6 percent, consistent with CPI inflation close to the upper range of the South
Africa Reserve Bank’s (SARB) 3–6 percent target range.
2.
Fiscal assumptions. The FY2016/17 national government primary fiscal deficit is projected to
improve to 0.4 percent of GDP from a deficit of 1.1 percent of GDP in FY2015/16 as a result of fiscal
measures in the 2015 and 2016 Budgets—the yield from these measures is as assumed in the Budget. The
primary deficit is expected to continue to improve over the medium term as a result of additional fiscal
measures and a gradual improvement in growth. The amount of consolidation is, however, not expected to
be sufficient to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio, which is projected to rise to 54 percent of GDP by 2021.
Consistent with the 2016 Budget, the projections include stock-flow adjustments to capture discounts on
new issuance of existing benchmark bonds as well as valuation effects on inflation-linked dbonds. The
projections do not assume any additional fiscal measures that the 2016 Budget signaled could be taken to
fulfill the government’s medium-term budget deficit targets.
3.
Data coverage. Consistent with the data on government debt reported by the authorities, the
fiscal assumptions in this DSA are based on the national government’s main budget (central government).
While this coverage excludes provincial governments, social security funds, and extra-budgetary
institutions, these entities are not allowed to incur debt. Even though municipalities are allowed to incur
debt, most provincial and municipal expenditure is funded through transfers from the national government
and thus is already captured in the projections. The DSA also excludes SOEs, whose indebtedness has
increased rapidly in recent years. Around 45 percent of SOEs’ borrowing is covered by government
guarantees and the DSA therefore includes an analysis of the fiscal impact of the realization of these
contingent liabilities.
4.
A higher-scrutiny debt sustainability analysis is warranted given South Africa’s elevated
gross financing needs. Gross financing needs (GFN) are estimated at 10.8 percent of GDP in 2015 and
expected to reach 11.2 percent in 2021, above the 10 percent of GDP high-scrutiny trigger based on a
conservative assessment of early-warning results.
5.
Consistent overestimation of real GDP growth over the past 4 years poses risks. Between
2012-15, the median real GDP forecast error was -1.4 percentage points, broadly in line with other
surveillance countries. Although neither the primary balance nor GDP inflation projections were
systematically biased, the persistent overprojection of real GDP growth poses an upside risk to the debt-toGDP forecasts.

Based on the debt sustainability analysis for market access countries. For further details see: “Modernizing the
Framework for Fiscal Policy and Public Debt Sustainability Analysis,” SM/11/211 and “Staff Guidance Note for
Public Debt Sustainability Analysis in Market-Access Countries,” IMF Policy Paper, May 6 2013.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOUTH AFRICA

6.
Cross-country experience suggests the fiscal adjustment assumed in the DSA is feasible. The
maximum three-year adjustment in the cyclically-adjusted primary balance over the projection period
(1.3 percent of GDP) as well as the maximum three-year level of the cyclically-adjusted primary balance (1.8
percent of GDP) is moderate when compared to the experience in market-access countries.
7.
Fiscal consolidation in recent years has reduced the national government deficit though
debt has continued to rise. Substantial fiscal stimulus during the global financial crisis contributed to high
fiscal deficits and a near-doubling of the debt-to-GDP ratio since 2008, to nearly 50 percent of GDP in
2015. Fiscal consolidation, which started with the 2013 Budget, has reduced the national government
deficit from 6.3 percent of GDP in FY2009/10 to 4.2 percent of GDP in FY2015/16. Rising interest costs
means the national government primary deficit has adjusted even more, from 4.1 percent in FY2009/10 to
1.1 percent in FY2015/16. However, largely due to lower-than-anticipated growth this consolidation has not
been sufficient to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio and reduce the GFN, which at 10.8 percent of GDP is
above the EM average despite a favorable maturity and currency structure.
8.
As acknowledged in the 2016 Budget, the fiscal outlook is subject to several downside risks.
Lower-than-anticipated growth or higher borrowing costs would put upward pressure on the fiscal deficit.
Depending on scale and modalities, the government’s plans for nuclear energy and a national health
insurance could also significantly increase spending pressures. At the same time, the weak state of SOEs’
balance sheets could trigger calls for further government support, while higher-than-anticipated fiscal
multipliers could put further downward pressure on growth and render the fiscal consolidation selfdefeating.
9.
The DSA framework suggests South Africa’s government debt-to-GDP ratio is sustainable in
the baseline scenario, but remains vulnerable to shocks.


The framework uses an indicative 70 percent of GDP debt benchmark beyond which a country is
reported as high risk (red in the standardized heat map). The benchmark is based on a crosscountry early-warning exercise of emerging market countries that have experienced episodes of
debt distress.2



Under the baseline, the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase to 54 percent by 2021. This is
28 percentage points higher than in 2008, but below the 70 percent high-risk threshold.



The projected debt level in 2021 increases to around 57 percent of GDP if none of the envisaged
fiscal consolidation materializes and the primary balance remains unchanged, and to near
60 percent of GDP with a one-standard-deviation temporary shock to growth.



A macro-fiscal shock—including standard shocks to growth and interest rates, and a primary
balance shock (a temporary half of a 10-year historical standard deviation deterioration in the

events, or IMF financing.

primary balance) and an exchange rate shock (consistent with the maximum movement over the
past 10 years and an exchange rate pass-through of 0.25 based on cross-country estimates of
pass-through in EMs)—results in a sharp increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio to 66 percent. 3


A customized shock entailing a permanent reduction in growth—growth remains at the 2016
level (0.1 percent) throughout the projection horizon—results in debt increasing to around
73 percent of GDP—above the high risk threshold—by 2021 and continuing to rise.



A contingent liability shock where 75 percent of the government’s guarantee exposure—
estimated at 10 percent of GDP in FY2015/16—is realized would push debt above the high-risk
threshold of 70 percent of GDP by 2021. While extreme, this exercise serves to underscore the
growing risks posed by contingent liabilities from SOEs, both to the fiscal outlook directly and
indirectly through its potential impact on investor confidence.



The DSA also includes fan charts that take into account the impact of the historical volatility of
macro-fiscal variables on the future debt path. Both an asymmetric version that reflects the
predominance of downside risks, and a symmetric version that takes into account the possibility
of more rapid progress on structural reforms that would boost growth and improve the primary
balance, yield similar results to the aforementioned stress tests, with the former suggesting
there is a 10 percent chance that the debt-to-GDP ratio reaching 67½ percent of GDP by 2021.

10.
The heat map suggests that despite its low share of foreign currency and short-term debt,
South Africa faces risks from lower growth, contingent liabilities, and tighter global financial
conditions. A realization of SOE contingent liabilities, permanently low growth, or a combined macro-fiscal
shock could all push South Africa’s GFN above the high risk benchmark, indicating an increased risk of
financing difficulties. Permanently low growth or a shock to contingent liabilities could also push South
Africa’s debt level above the threshold often associated with debt distress in other countries. South Africa’s
local currency bond spread, high external financing requirements, and the relatively large share of debt
held by non-residents also point to emerging risks, though the large domestic institutional investor base
and capital controls on residents are mitigating factors. These findings are consistent with staff’s
assessment that while South Africa’s debt remains sustainable, risks to the fiscal outlook have increased
since the 2014 Article IV consultation, even after taking into account the consolidation measures
announced in the 2015 and 2016 Budgets.

12.
Gross external financing needs (GEFN) are projected to average 18½ percent of GDP in
2016-2021, compared to 14½ percent of GDP in the past five years. The rise would be due to
higher reliance on short-term external debt (comprising primarily bank liabilities, which tend to have
a shorter tenor than public debt). With the current account deficit projected at 3¾ to 5 percent of
GDP range in 2016-21, short-term external debt would account for about 75 percent of the GEFN.
13.
External financing is projected to come primarily from other investment flows during
the projection period. In recent years, South Africa’s external financing mix shifted from foreign
direct investment (FDI) and portfolio flows towards other investment flows (primarily bank loans)
and unrecorded transactions. These averaged 2½ percent and 1½ percent of GDP, respectively, in
2013-15, financing the bulk of the current account deficit. With net FDI projected to remain negative
or very low during the projection period and portfolio flows to moderate as US monetary policy
normalizes, the GEFN is projected to be mostly financed by other investment flows, in line with
recent years.
14.
The external debt is projected to increase to 52½ percent of GDP by 2021. The external
debt is projected to rise sharply to over 50 percent of GDP in 2016 as a result of the effect of the
depreciation of the rand in late 2015 on GDP denominated in US dollars.4 From 2017 onwards, the
rise in the external debt-to-GDP ratio is relatively slow and reflects the non-interest current account
deficit, which is projected to average 1¾ percent of GDP during the forecast period compared to an
estimated debt-stabilizing non-interest current account deficit of 1¼ percent of GDP (Table 1).
15.
Rising external debt and sizable GEFN would keep South Africa’s external vulnerability
elevated. Stress tests indicate that a 30 percent currency depreciation would push the external
debt-to-GDP ratio above 60 percent. Other standard shocks simulated in the external debt
sustainability analysis —such as a widening of the non-interest current account deficit, a
deceleration in real GDP growth, and an increase in the interest rate on public debt—would lead to
relatively moderate increases in external debt. These shocks would be mitigated by the high share of
rand-denominated and fixed interest rate debt.
The depreciation of the rand of late 2015 first reduced the external debt-to-GDP ratio as of end-2015 as randdenominated liabilities declined in US dollar terms. However, as US dollar GDP declines in 2016 as a result of the
depreciation, the external debt-to-GDP ratio will rise.

Statement by the Staff Representative on South Africa
June 27, 2016
This statement contains information that has become available since the staff report was
circulated to the Executive Board. The information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
U.K. referendum
1.
South African financial markets weakened in the immediate aftermath of the U.K.
referendum to leave the E.U. The rand depreciated by 8 percent against the dollar in the early
hours of trading immediately following the referendum results, but recovered nearly 2 percent by
June 27: this was among the largest depreciations in emerging markets. In the same time period,
the benchmark 10-year sovereign bond yield rose 25 basis points, and the stock index fell
6.5 percent. The market decline was orderly, underscoring the depth of South Africa’s financial
markets.
2.
The U.K. referendum has increased downside risks for South Africa, as there are
sizable financial linkages between the two countries and trade linkages with the E.U. as a
whole.

Financial linkages. U.K. banks account for about 70 percent of total external bank
lending to South Africa. The U.K. also accounts for about 10 percent of nonresident bond and
equity investment holdings in South Africa. A number of major South African financial
institutions have linkages with the U.K. In addition, the U.K. is the largest FDI source country,
accounting for 45 percent of the total inward FDI stock (18 percent of GDP), and the third largest
destination of outward South African FDI (3.7 percent of GDP). Finally, revenue from the U.K.
is estimated at about 5 percent of total revenue of listed companies.
Trade linkages. While the U.K. accounts only for 4 percent of South Africa’s goods exports,
exports to the E.U. (excluding the U.K.) account for about 15 percent. Further, about a fifth of
tourists to South Africa come from the U.K. On the other hand, potentially higher gold prices
and lower oil prices could be partial, positive offsets on the current account balance.
Other recent developments
3.
Inflation edged down. Headline inflation eased marginally to 6.1 percent y/y in May
(from 6.2 percent in April), underpinned by lower food inflation (10.8 percent). Core inflation
was unchanged at 5.5 percent.
4.
The South African Reserve Bank’s lending indicator continued to decline. The
indicator dropped 5.5 percent y/y in April to its lowest level since November 2009, dimming the
hope for a robust recovery after the weak Q1 GDP reading.

2

5.
The state electricity company, Eskom, has made progress in enhancing electricity
supply. The fourth and last unit of the Ingula power station, a pumped storage facility, was
synchronized on June 16 (ahead of schedule), a major step for full commercial operation. The
first Ingula unit was declared commercial a week earlier, and the three remaining units are on
track for commercial operation by January 2017. The facility will add 1,332 megawatts
(4 percent of 2015 available capacity) to the national grid. It will also help secure overall grid
stability.

Statement by Fundi Tshazibana, Alternate Executive Director,
Edgar Sishi, and Felicia Dlamini–Kunene, Senior Advisors
to the Executive Director for South Africa
July 1, 2016

The South African authorities thank staff for the constructive engagement during the 2016
Article IV Consultation, and welcome the detailed assessment of the economy and analysis
of relevant policy issues. Staff’s analysis is broadly in line with the authorities’ view of
economic challenges, vulnerabilities and risks. The authorities are also concerned that the
protracted period of low growth has resulted in declining per capita incomes. They agree with
staff that structural reforms are imperative to raise potential growth and that they should
implement tangible measures to boost confidence and enhance resilience.
Much progress has been made since 1994 to reverse the legacy of the past, yet the challenges
remain. During this period of low growth and rising public debt, and as articulated in the
National Development Plan (NDP), the authorities are placing emphasis on rebalancing the
economy through structural reforms. Rebalancing will require difficult trade-offs and stronger
cooperation with social partners. Reducing imbalances, including narrowing the
budget deficit and consolidating the debt ratio, will provide a sound and predictable basis for
achieving structural reforms. In this context, the authorities are focused on three key areas:
restoring confidence and boosting investment, including minimizing regulatory obstacles to
doing business; removing obstacles to faster employment creation; and strengthening stateowned entities (SOEs).
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
GDP growth has decelerated from 1.6 percent in 2014 to 1.3 percent in 2015 due to external
and domestic factors. In addition to lower commodity prices, electricity supply constraints
were more binding in 2015, with adverse effects on mining and manufacturing production. A
severe drought has also resulted in lower crop yields, while business and consumer
confidence remained weak.
Official growth projections are reviewed bi-annually by the authorities. The current growth
projection of 0.9 percent, tabled in February 2016, will be updated in October 2016. The
authorities are aware that their current projections are higher than staff’s projection of
0.1 percent, and that for these growth projections to materialize, GDP would have to grow at
around 3 percent for the remaining quarters of the year. The authorities’ new growth
projections will, like staff, take into account the 1.2 percent GDP contraction in the first

2
quarter of 2016 and second quarter data. Although downside risks prevail over the medium
term, some upside risks are evident, including the resolution of electricity supply constraints,
marginally lower inflation, some recovery in business confidence, and the likely finalization
of mining legislation. The authorities estimate that resolution of energy constraints could add
between 0.8 and 1 percentage points to the country’s growth. For this reason, the authorities
expect growth to recover from 2017.
The South African Rand depreciated sharply against major currencies during 2015. The
weighted exchange rate of the rand depreciated by 19.7 percent in 2015, and the real
effective exchange rate (REER) fell to its lowest level since 2001. While the current
exchange value of the rand is supportive of domestic-export growth, higher input costs and
slower economic growth in South Africa’s main export trading-partner countries may erode
potential gains from the depreciation, in addition to other inflationary and negative balance
sheet effects. Gross gold and other foreign reserves provided import cover of 5.6 months
during the first quarter of 2016. The authorities are committed to take every opportunity to
build more reserves in order to bolster resilience against future shocks.
Inflation remained firmly within the target range of 3-6 percent during the course of 2015,
with headline inflation averaging 4.6 percent for the year. However, due to rising food prices,
which are expected to peak at 12 percent in the final quarter of 2016, and the recent upward
revisions in the international oil price, headline inflation has breached the upper band of the
inflation target range. While core inflation has remained relatively stable at 5.5 percent, recent
data on firm profitability, proxied by gross operating surplus, also indicates a build-up
of inflationary pressures. The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) expects core inflation to
peak in the fourth quarter of 2016 and moderate in late 2017.
Fiscal Policy and Public Debt Management
Given the overall outlook for growth and heightened fiscal risks, the authorities are committed
to pursuing a prudent and sustainable fiscal policy trajectory. In October 2015, the authorities
strengthened the fiscal framework by reaffirming their commitment to a fiscal guideline
that sets the expenditure ceiling in the outer years of every fiscal framework. Over
the long term, the guideline is meant to maintain spending as a stable share of national
income. This is complemented by a capital budgeting framework, which includes new
appraisal tools for capital projects, strengthening of procurement regulations and more
transparency on the full life cycle costs of large capital projects. The authorities also utilize
an on-going process of expenditure reviews, which reconciles budget allocations with
intended program outcomes, to inform decisions on expenditure reprioritization and
improving program efficiency.
The 2016 Budget sets a course for more rapid fiscal consolidation and stabilizing the growth
of public debt while carefully weighing the impact of the consolidation on domestic output.
The authorities have proposed gross tax revenue increases of 1.5 percent of GDP and
expenditure reductions amounting to 0.5 percent of GDP. The budget deficit is thus projected
to close from an estimated 3.2 percent of GDP in 2016/17 to 2.4 percent in 2017/18, with net
debt projected to stabilize at 46.2 percent of GDP in 2018/19. A primary surplus will be

3
achieved in 2016/17. The Tax Review Committee, which was set up in 2014, continues its
work on assessing the optimal tax composition to support growth and the authorities’
developmental objectives. Almost all of the expenditure reductions are being targeted at the
public wage bill, and extracting more value for money in the other recurrent spending items.
The authorities are cognizant of the main risks to their borrowing program and actively
manage these risks. In this regard, the authorities continue to reconcile the outlook with the
debt sustainability targets, and clarified in the budget documents that they would take
additional measures to achieve the above fiscal targets if conditions warrant. The medium
term borrowing program is underpinned by strategic benchmarks for refinancing, interest,
inflation and currency risks. The debt portfolio remains well within prudent limits. In
addition to benchmarking, the borrowing strategy includes measures to manage refinancing
risk by adjusting the composition and maturity of the debt portfolio.
SOEs and other public sector institutions are an important element of the authorities’ strategy
for development and inclusive growth. In this context, the authorities are continuously
monitoring the financial position of SOEs through a formal fiscal risk mechanism, and
contingent liabilities are reported in the annual Budget. The 2016 Budget outlines four areas
of reform that are intended to strengthen the ability of SOEs to support the NDP; namely,
financial and operational stabilization, coordination and collaboration among different
entities, rationalization and consolidation, and the enactment of a new governance framework.
Monetary Policy
Monetary policy in South Africa continues to confront the risks of rising inflation. In
addition to rising food prices, currency weakness and volatility pose a risk to inflation. The
substantial rand depreciation could generate higher inflation over the forecast period, if it
persists. While the pass-through from the exchange rate to inflation has been low in recent
years, there are indications that this may be increasing. The SARB estimates the pass-through
to currently be half its long term average of about 20 percent. However, the authorities note
that with substantial depreciation and falling corporate profits, even low levels of
pass-through still generate meaningful amounts of inflation and there remains a risk that pass
through may return to more normal levels.
Although the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has increased the policy rate by a total of
200 basis points since January 2014 and most recently by 25 basis points at the March 2016,
the policy rate was kept on hold in the May 2016. The authorities indicated that monetary
policy remains focused on its price stability mandate while sensitive to the state of the
economy, within a flexible inflation targeting framework. Future monetary policy actions
will be subject to data outcomes.
The authorities indicate that despite recent interest rate increases, monetary policy remains
accommodative as the policy rate is low from a historical perspective and is near or below
policy rates in peer countries. Therefore, with growth continuing to undershoot potential,
monetary policy is still providing stimulus to help absorb surplus capacity. The pace of

4
tightening has also been gradual relative to previous hiking cycles. The authorities are of the
view that modest tightening of policy should keep inflation expectations in check.
Financial Sector Policy
The South African financial sector is well regulated and continues to attract global
investment flows. The SARB actively monitors the compliance of the banking sector with the
country’s regulatory framework and also monitors the fundamental capacity of financial
institutions to deal with economic headwinds and regulatory changes. The banking system
remains resilient, with the authorities’ stress tests indicating that even under severe adverse
scenarios, capital adequacy for the participating banks remains above the regulatory
requirements. Total banking assets exceeded 120 percent of GDP in 2015, with a combined
total capital adequacy ratio of 14.19 percent. The level of NPLs is low, at around 3 percent of
gross loans and advances at the end of 2015, and level of impaired advances to total loans and
advances was 3.12 percent at the end of 2015. Therefore, the authorities view the risk
management frameworks of the banks as being robust.
Since the completion of the 2014 FSAP, the authorities have initiated significant financial
regulatory architectural reforms. The Financial Sector Regulation Bill, the enabling legislation
for shifting to a Twin Peaks model of financial sector regulation, is expected to be
enacted towards the end of 2016. Under the Twin Peaks model, two regulators will be
established, a Prudential Authority within the SARB and a Financial Sector Conduct
Authority. The Prudential Authority will focus on institutional soundness (including prudence
and solvency), while the Financial Sector Conduct Authority will focus on business
conduct or consumer protection. A “shadow” Prudential Authority structure was established in
the SARB at the end of May 2016. The Bill will also address two areas of concern raised
in the FSAP, namely conglomerate supervision and strengthening oversight of over-thecounter derivatives.
Progress is being made on a comprehensive resolution framework for banks based on lessons
learnt from the successful resolution of African Bank. The ultimate objective of these
reforms is to significantly reduce the state’s contingent liability relating to the financial
sector. In August 2015 the authorities published a Resolution Framework Policy Paper. This
policy paper outlines an approach that is closely aligned to the FSB’s Key Attributes for
Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions. Its main features are the introduction
of a depositor guarantee scheme, a bail-in framework, and a creditor hierarchy in line with the
key attributes. Legislation to give effect to this policy is expected to be introduced to
parliament during the fourth quarter on 2016.
Macro-Financial Linkages
The authorities welcome the assessment of macro-financial linkages in staff documents. They
reiterate that South Africa’s reliance on foreign flows must be viewed within the context of
the depth and liquidity of domestic financial markets, and the flexible exchange rate. In line
with trends in other emerging markets, net out-flows from equities continued during the first
few months of 2016, with year-to-date net sales by non-residents amounting to R48.5 billion.

5
However, there have been net purchases of domestic bonds by offshore investors amounting
to R13.4 billion as of May 31, 2016.
The authorities’ welcome staff’s detailed assessment of global and regional spillovers, in
particular the growing importance of China’s growth for South Africa through the
commodity trade channels. The authorities are also carefully monitoring spillovers. Overall,
the SARB assesses financial stress as emanating from five sources; namely: a possible
sovereign rating downgrade to non-investment grade (especially local currency), spillovers
from excessive volatility and risk aversion in global financial markets, protracted period of
slow economic growth in the Euro region and lengthy rebalancing of growth, low domestic
economic growth and fragility of global banks.
The authorities agree that a combination of commodity-price driven macro-fiscal shocks and
declining growth rates in Sub-Saharan economies will negatively affect firms’ profitability
and South Africa’s economy. They are also cognizant that while the largest outward spillover
of lower growth to the rest of Africa maybe limited, for countries in the Southern African
Customs Union the slowdown in the South Africa economy has a significant impact.
Structural Reforms
Economic inclusion remains a key challenge for South Africa. The authorities are committed
to raising growth and creating jobs over the medium and long term. In this regard, they
recognize the urgent need to build partnerships between the state, the private sector, the labor
movement and civil society in order to realize the goals of the NDP. The Cabinet has
approved a Nine-Point Plan, which is an implementation program for the NDP to prioritize
sectors with high potential to boost employment and growth. The authorities have proposed
measures to support small businesses, manufacturing, tourism and revitalization of the
agricultural value chain.
The authorities believe that government and private sector initiatives aimed at expanding
infrastructure, transforming cities, supporting SME development and regional integration
will boost growth and employment. The authorities are working with business to identify
measures that will restore confidence, boost private sector investment, remove obstacles to
employment creation in key sectors and identify regulatory hurdles to doing business. In
partnership with the private sector, the authorities have established a Small-Business
Innovation Fund, with over R1 billion already committed, to support the development of
small enterprises. Work is also ongoing to put in place measures to minimize protracted
strikes and review the employment effects of compensation agreements and the introduction
of a national minimum wage.
Interventions already in the 2016 Budget include the implementation of a public
infrastructure investment program for which R865.4 billion has been allocated; as well as
greater support for the country’s eight metropolitan areas to transform the urban landscape
and incentives to the automotive industry. The Presidential Infrastructure Coordination
Commission continues to coordinate public infrastructure project plans across spheres of
government and identify skills gaps and mechanisms to speed up project delivery.

6

The Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer program is a major initiative by the
authorities to increase the country’s energy supply capacity, but also significantly boosting
private investment in the sector, while also facilitating further upstream investments. To date,
92 projects amounting to over $13 billion have been approved. The authorities intend to use
the program to boost electricity capacity by 17 000 MW by 2022 and will expand it to include
other technologies.
Conclusion
The authorities recognize that South Africa faces exceptionally difficult global and domestic
economic conditions over the near and medium term and difficult choices and tradeoff are
necessary. As recognized in the staff report, appropriate policy choices have been made in
managing fiscal, monetary and financial sector policy.
The authorities do, however, realize that monetary and fiscal policy are not sufficient to
respond to the negative outlook for growth, and the need to raise potential output and
aggregate demand in the near to medium-term. The authorities are focusing on building on
the strengths of some positive fundamentals that characterize the South African economy and
are placing urgency on effective implementation of existing plans.
Finally, the authorities look forward to the Executive Board’s conclusion of the 2016 Article
IV Consultation and appreciate the engagements with the Fund on the critical goal of
achieving inclusive growth for the South African economy.
