EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
New Zealand rode out the crisis better than most advanced economies and a gradual
economic recovery is underway. The outlook, however, is subject to a number of downside
risks mainly related to the pace of the global recovery. The authorities are more optimistic than
staff concerning the near-term outlook, given the economy’s growing links to Asia and
Australia. Two key macro-financial vulnerabilities persist—high household debt and high
external debt. The impairment of credit markets created some difficulties in rolling over shortterm external debt during the crisis.
The strong fiscal position prior to the global crisis enabled the authorities to deliver a
sizable fiscal easing that helped cushion the impact of the crisis. However, the mediumterm fiscal outlook has worsened because income tax cuts and many of the spending initiatives
were permanent and revenue projections have been revised down.
Staff welcomed the government’s commitment to limit the increase in public debt, but
advised faster consolidation. A shift in the macroeconomic policy mix toward faster fiscal
consolidation would relieve pressure on monetary policy and thereby the exchange rate, and
limit the increase in the current account deficit. Faster consolidation would also create fiscal
space to deal with future shocks, and reduce the likelihood of an increase in the risk premium
related to New Zealand’s high external debt. The authorities had considered the merits of faster
fiscal consolidation, but decided that their planned pace of consolidation was appropriate.
Staff noted that the current accommodative monetary stance is appropriate and the
RBNZ should gradually return to a neutral stance once the recovery is well established.
The inflation-targeting framework served New Zealand well during the global crisis and there
are no clear net benefits to increasing the inflation target.
Banks remain sound, but staff advised continued vigilance as banks are exposed to
households and house prices appear overvalued. Staff welcomed closer collaboration with
Australian authorities on crisis management and stress tests, and recommended that banks’
capital and provisioning be strengthened if these tests suggest the need for additional buffers.
While uncertain, staff estimates suggest that the exchange rate is overvalued by 10–
25 percent. If this overvaluation proves to be temporary, it may limit the expected widening of
the current account deficit. But even if the current account returns to the estimated norm of
almost 5 percent of GDP, net foreign liabilities would remain high at 90 percent of GDP.
Staff supported prudential and structural reforms that would help reduce external
vulnerability. The introduction of the prudential liquidity policy, including a core funding
ratio, should reduce banks’ reliance on short-term external funding. The core funding ratio
could be raised further than planned if needed to help reduce short-term external debt.
Structural reforms to raise productivity and labor force participation, including tax and benefit
reforms, would lift potential growth and export capacity.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
New Zealand experienced a relatively shallow recession during 2008–09. The
end of a housing boom in response to tight monetary policy slowed domestic demand,
which combined with a drought pushed the economy into a recession in early 2008, ahead of
many other countries. Subsequently, the downturn was exacerbated by the global financial
crisis. Real GDP contracted by about 1½ percent in 2009, compared to an average
contraction of 3 percent for other advanced economies.
2.
The global crisis has not hit New Zealand as hard as many other advanced
countries. This was because of demand from fast-growing Asian markets and the robust
Australian economy, a flexible exchange rate, and the absence of a banking crisis (Figure 1).
In addition, a sound macroeconomic framework and a strong pre-crisis fiscal position
allowed significant monetary and fiscal policy easing that cushioned the blow from the
global crisis. Nevertheless, the crisis highlighted long-standing vulnerabilities due to high
household and high external debt.
II. ON THE ROAD TO RECOVERY
3.
The economy emerged from the recession in mid-2009. Domestic demand is
driving the recovery, supported by fiscal stimulus, low mortgage rates, and improved world
commodity prices (Table 1). The unemployment rate (7.3 percent at end-2009) has not risen
as sharply as elsewhere, which has helped underpin confidence.
4.
Financial markets have regained some lost ground, as global sentiment
improved and credit strains eased. Money market spreads and bank CDS spreads have
declined sharply from crisis highs, but the stock market is still about 25 percent below the
2007 peak (Figure 2). Sovereign bond spreads remain about 70–80 basis points above the
average of the past 15 years.
5.
The exchange rate depreciated sharply at the onset of the crisis, but has
appreciated since early 2009. In the year to February 2009, the nominal effective exchange
rate depreciated by 30 percent, as the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) eased
monetary policy and the global crisis hit commodity prices and heightened risk aversion.
Since then, the nominal effective exchange rate has appreciated by about 20 percent,
reflecting a recovery in commodity prices and global risk appetite, and a widening of
interest rate differentials.
6.
Rising unemployment and a widening output gap contained growth in labor
costs and eased inflationary pressures (Figure 3). Headline and nontradables CPI inflation
fell to about 2 percent y/y in March 2010, consistent with the inflation target of 1–3 percent
and well below the peaks of 4–5 percent in 2008.

7.
As the economic outlook weakened, the RBNZ cut its policy rate by 575 basis
points from mid-2008 to early 2009 and then kept it at a historical low of 2½ percent
(Figure 4). Unlike some other advanced economies, the transmission of monetary policy
remained effective, and the aggressive cuts in the policy rate were largely, but not fully,
reflected in lower lending rates, which supported domestic demand.
8.
A sizable easing of fiscal policy also helped support activity. The fiscal position
was strong before the crisis hit, with a string of surpluses reducing net public debt to
6 percent of GDP by mid-2008 (Table 2). This enabled the authotities to deliver a large
fiscal stimulus, equivalent to almost 6 percent of GDP spread over the two years to June
2010 (Figure 5).
9.
Banks remain sound but faced some funding difficulties during the crisis. Four
large Australian-owned banks dominate the financial sector and suffered an increase in
nonperforming loans to 1½ percent of total loans, though still low by advanced country
standards (Figure 6). They increased provisioning and raised additional capital from their
parents and through retained earnings. New Zealand subsidiaries faced more difficulties
rolling over their sizable short-term funding than their Australian parents when international
wholesale markets were severely impaired after the collapse of Lehmann Brothers. In
response, the government introduced a wholesale funding guarantee that helped banks
obtain term funding of about $NZ 10 billion until they were able to access the market
directly late last year.
10.
The current account deficit narrowed sharply in 2009 to 3 percent of GDP, as
both trade and income balances improved (Figure 7, Table 3). While imports dropped
sharply due to the recession, primary exports benefited from fast growing Asia markets and
manufacturing and service receipts were helped by robust Australian demand and a
depreciation of the $NZ/$A rate. In addition, lower interest and profit payments reduced the
income deficit.
III. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
11.
In the near-term, a gradual economic recovery is expected. Accommodative
fiscal and monetary policies continue to support domestic demand and real GDP is projected
to expand by about 3 percent in 2010 and 2011. The unemployment rate is forecast to lag
the recovery and peak at 7½ percent in 2010.
12.
Over the medium term, growth is projected to fall back to staff’s estimate of
potential of 2⅓ percent (Table 4). High household debt and an expected increase in the cost
of capital as a result of the global crisis are likely to weigh on the growth of private
consumption and investment. Under the baseline assumption of a constant real effective
exchange rate (REER), the contribution of net exports to growth will remain muted. The
income deficit is expected to worsen as interest rates and profits rise, leading to a widening
of the current account deficit.

On the external front, risks are tilted to the downside as global activity remains
dependent on highly accommodative macroeconomic policies. The global recovery could
stall and Chinese demand drop sharply, with negative spillovers for commodity prices. In
addition, risk premiums could rise further for countries with high external debt, such as New
Zealand, thereby constraining growth. However, an increase in global risk appetite is also
possible, which may lead to a further appreciation of the exchange rate, making it difficult
to rebalance growth toward the tradables sector.
14.
On the domestic front, a stronger-than-expected recovery may force an earlier
tightening in monetary policy, putting upward pressure on the exchange rate. However,
faster-than-expected deleveraging by households and businesses may slow the recovery.
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
15.
Discussions focused on the macroeconomic policy mix needed to rebalance the
economy toward the tradable sector and increase saving to address the vulnerabilities
associated with high household and external debt.
A. Exit from Fiscal Stimulus
16.
The sizable fiscal easing in the past two years helped cushion the impact of the
crisis, but worsened the medium-term fiscal outlook. Income tax cuts and many of the
spending initiatives, taken before the crisis hit, were permanent and revenue projections
have been revised down. As a result, budget deficits of about 2–4 percent of GDP on an
accrual basis (operating balance before gains and losses) and 3–6 percent of GDP on a cash
basis are projected over the next 4–5 years.1
17.
Staff supported the fiscal stimulus through June 2010 and the government’s
long-term net public debt target of 20 percent of GDP. The large stimulus helped buffer
the economy from the impact of the crisis while the commitment to contain the long-term
increase in debt should ensure fiscal sustainability.
18.
The government plans to reduce budget deficits gradually through expenditure
restraint and fiscal drag, with a return to balance by 2016. A fiscal impulse of more
than 2 percent of GDP is being implemented for 2009/10, with a further small impulse of
½ percent of GDP planned for 2010/11 (Figure 8). On this basis, the authorities expect that
net core crown debt would peak at 30 percent of GDP by 2016 and fall below 20 percent of
GDP by 2024. While the stimulus was larger than in most advanced economies, the increase
in public debt is expected to be smaller than average, as New Zealand had budget surpluses
prior to the crisis (Figure 9).
1

Cash deficits are larger partly because of a planned increase in capital spending, that is greater than
depreciation included in the accrual measure of the deficit.

Nevertheless, staff advised further spending restraint to return to surpluses
earlier than planned. Faster consolidation over the next 3–4 years would take pressure off
monetary policy and the exchange rate, thereby helping rebalance the economy toward the
tradables sector and contain the current account deficit. The mission recommended returning
the budget to surplus by 2014, unless the downside risks to growth materialize, based on the
following:


Upfront adjustment would create fiscal space as insurance against future shocks that
may arise in coming years. A key lesson from the global financial crises is the
desirability of fiscal space to run larger deficits when needed without raising market
concerns about fiscal sustainability.



Although public debt is projected to remain low by advanced country standards,
New Zealand’s large gross external debt (130 percent of GDP) calls for greater fiscal
prudence. If global interest rates rise because of large sovereign and bank borrowing
in advanced countries, low public debt would help contain the rise in New Zealand’s
cost of capital (see forthcoming working paper).



Staff analysis with the Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal (GIMF) model shows
that faster fiscal consolidation would lead to a depreciation of the exchange rate, a
smaller sovereign risk premium, and a lower current account deficit (see selected
issues paper).



While the probability is extremely low, the government may need to take on more
external debt should the banks once again have difficulties in global markets. This limits
the extent to which public debt can be increased without hurting investor confidence.



Finally, reaching a lower level of debt earlier than planned would put the budget in a
stronger position to deal with the fiscal costs of ageing.

20.
Staff recommended that concrete measures to control spending be introduced
and that any positive revenue surprises
Public Investment/GDP 2004-2008
be saved. Expenditure is projected to
remain high at 33 percent of GDP by
2015 compared with 31 percent of GDP
in 2008, mainly because of higher social
spending. The staff noted scope to better
target transfers to households, improve
the efficiency of public service provision,
and rationalize capital spending, which is
high by advanced economy standards.
The introduction of spending caps may
also provide useful discipline.

Tax reforms could help raise potential growth. Shifting the tax burden from
income to consumption––as suggested by the Tax Working Group established by
government––would raise incentives to work and invest. In addition, reducing tax incentives
to invest in rental properties may help improve the allocation of capital. Staff analysis,
suggests that a 1 percent of GDP shift of taxes from capital and labor to the goods and
services tax could raise the level of real GDP by almost 1 percent after 5–6 years.
22.
To address longer-term pressures on the budget, the mission advised early steps
to contain growth in health care and pensions costs. Measures could include improving
the efficiency of health care spending, raising the pension eligibility age, and linking it to
life expectancy.
B. Exit from Monetary Stimulus
23.
The RBNZ announced last year that it would keep the policy rate on hold until
mid-2010 and thereafter gradually return to a neutral rate. Markets have priced in rate
hikes of 150 basis points over the coming year. The authorities have started to unwind
crisis-related measures by scaling back extraordinary liquidity support (Figure 10, Table 5).
24.
Staff supported the current accommodative monetary policy stance and the
RBNZ’s intention to gradually return to neutral rates once the recovery is well
established. Over the next few years, inflation is likely to stay within the RBNZ’s 1–
3 percent target, albeit toward the upper end of that range. Staff estimates that the output gap
will not close before 2013. Inflation is also being limited by a tightening in monetary
conditions over the past year with the appreciation of the currency, higher medium-term
interest rates, and an increase in funding costs of banks, as they compete for retail deposits.
25.
The rising wedge between the policy rate and bank funding costs suggests that
the neutral policy rate is likely to be lower than in the past. Moreover, when the RBNZ
begins to tighten, the transmission of the policy rate to mortgage rates should be relatively
fast, as many households have refinanced mortgages at variable rates.

In a downside scenario, monetary policy still has room to be loosened. Weakerthan-expected global growth and higher risk premia on New Zealand assets would spill over
to the domestic economy through weaker commodity prices, growth, and inflation. In this
scenario, the policy interest rate could be cut and any consequent weakening of the currency
would ease financial conditions and cushion the impact on New Zealand.
27.
The inflation-targeting framework served New Zealand well during the global
financial crisis. The official cash rate (OCR) was high before the crisis, at 8¼ percent,
because of monetary tightening in response to inflationary pressures in 2007/08 stemming
from the housing boom. While the RBNZ does not directly target house prices, it takes
account of the impact of changes in house prices on consumer spending. The framework
was flexible enough to allow a substantial cut in the OCR to 2½ percent by early 2009.
Importantly, the inflation target effectively anchored medium-term inflation expectations
and was helpful in reducing the likelihood of deflation in the midst of the recession.
28.
Staff noted that the inflation target of “1–3 percent on average over the medium
term” is appropriate and consistent with international best practice. The government is not
planning a revision to the target but there has been some debate in New Zealand recently on
whether to raise the inflation target. In the staff's view, increasing the inflation target would
provide no clear benefits and may entail a number of costs, including greater inflation uncertainty
and reduced credibility of the authorities’ commitment to price stability. In turn, this could lead to
a higher cost of capital and lower potential growth given New Zealand’s reliance on international
capital markets to fund current account deficits and rollover sizable external debt.
C. Maintaining Financial Sector Stability
29.
The key domestic vulnerability is banks’ exposure to household debt of just
over 150 percent of disposable income (Figure 11). However, this exposure proved to be
relatively low risk in the recent recession. Factors mitigating the mortgage risks include the
fall in mortgage rates, the absence of a sharp rise in unemployment, and only a 4 percent fall
in house prices from the peak in 2007. Moreover, household debt has fallen from a peak of
about 160 percent of disposable income in 2008. Nonetheless, risks remain. House prices
are high relative to historical price-to-income ratios and debt-service burdens will rise with a
return to neutral policy rates. In a downside scenario, a sharp decline in house prices and a
jump in unemployment could lead to further deleveraging by households and an increase in
banks’ impaired assets. However, the risk to banks is mitigated by their limited exposure to
high risk mortgages.2 Other vulnerabilities include banks’ substantial exposure to dairy
farming (where world market prices are volatile), commercial property, and small and
medium-sized enterprises.
2

Less than 5 percent of owner-occupied mortgages had loan-to-value rates greater than 80 percent and debt
service ratios greater than 30 percent. Moreover, previous staff analysis (WP/09/224) suggests that bank capital
would be resilient to a sharp increase in mortgage defaults.

A conservative approach to bank regulation and supervision helped banks
weather the crisis. As a result, banks had relatively low leverage and high capital
adequacy, with Tier 1 ratios of 7–8 percent before the crisis hit. In implementing the

with agricultural loans.
31.
Staff supported closer collaboration with Australian authorities on regular
stress tests and crisis management. The tests use more extreme scenarios than in past
exercises and staff advised that capital and provisioning be strengthened if these tests
suggest the need for additional buffers. Staff welcomed the crisis management toolkit,
developed with the Australian authorities, and the intention to undertake a Trans-Tasman
crisis management exercise in 2011.
32.
The authorities intend to investigate the costs and benefits of potential macroprudential policy tools, particularly some of the proposals coming out of the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision. The authorities are researching the merits of time
varying capital overlays under Pillar 2 and time varying liquidity requirements. Staff noted
that macro-prudential measures may be useful to manage risks arising from excessive bank
credit growth during upswings.
33.
Staff welcomed the announced closure of the wholesale government guarantee
scheme by end-April 2010, given that funding conditions have improved. The
authorities are considering the costs and benefits of introducing a permanent retail deposit
insurance scheme when the current government guarantee expires at end 2011. The RBNZ
is also strengthening the nonbank prudential regulatory regime, including mandatory credit
ratings from March 2010 and capital requirements.
D. Addressing External Vulnerability and Increasing Saving
34.
The free-floating exchange rate regime remains appropriate, as it enables an
independent monetary policy and provides a useful buffer against shocks. Prior to the
crisis, the RBNZ was able to increase the policy rate to contain inflationary pressures fuelled

22
by the housing boom. Moreover, the flexible exchange rate has moved with world
commodity prices and thereby reduced the volatility of farm incomes in New Zealand.
35.
While there is uncertainty, staff estimates suggest the currency is overvalued by
10–25 percent (Box 1). The overvaluation

Assuming the exchange rate remains at present levels, staff projects the current
account deficit to widen to over 8 percent of GDP by 2015. The deficit may not widen as
much if the present overvaluation of the real effective exchange rate proves to be temporary.
But even at staff’s estimated saving100

external and household debt.
Low household saving is a fundamental factor behind large current account
deficits and rising external debt in recent years (Box 2). Household saving fell to
negative 10 percent of disposable income in 2008, although the actual rate may be higher
than that given statistical problems. The current government is considering shifting the tax
burden away from income to consumption to encourage saving. Staff simulations with the
Fund’s GIMF model illustrate that a 1 percent of GDP revenue-neutral shift to consumption
taxation would permanently raise national saving to GDP ratio by about 0.3 percentage
points.

BOX 1. NEW ZEALAND: EQUILIBRIUM REAL EFFECTIVE EXCHANGE RATE
Staff estimates suggest that the
New Zealand dollar is overvalued
by 10–25 percent. These estimates
are based on the macroeconomic
balance (MB), the equilibrium real
exchange rate (ERER), and the
external sustainability approach
(ES).

The MB estimates the current

The ERER estimates suggest a smaller overvaluation. This approach explains the REER with
terms-of-trade, relative productivity, and relative government consumption. It suggests an
overvaluation of almost 10 percent, assuming some strengthening of the terms of trade over the
medium-term.
The ES approach implies a larger overvaluation. To stabilize foreign liabilities (NFL) at their end2009 level of 90 percent of GDP, the REER would need to depreciate by 20 percent. However, to
reduce NFL to a more sustainable level of 75 percent of GDP over fifteen years, the REER would
need to depreciate by 25 percent.
The estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty, as shown by the wide range of the
confidence intervals.

that should reduce banks’
reliance on short-term external funding (Box 3). Planned increases in the core funding
ratio over the next two years will further reduce this vulnerability and could, if needed, be
increased more than planned to reduce short-term external debt.
40.
Vulnerabilities related to external debt would also be reduced by structural
reforms to raise productivity and labor force participation, thereby lifting export
capacity. The government is considering a number of reforms with this aim, including tax
and benefit reforms, streamlining regulation, and establishing a Productivity Commission.
E. Authorities’ Views on Staff Advice3
41.
The authorities were more upbeat than staff on the near-term economic
outlook. They project real GDP growth to pick up slightly quicker in the near term and
reach almost 3½ percent in March year 2012, about ¼ percent stronger than staff
projections. While they acknowledged the risks raised by staff, they were more optimistic
about the near-term upside risks, given the economy’s growing links to Asia and Australia.

25
BOX 2: NEW ZEALAND: SAVING AND INVESTMENT
A fundamental factor behind high current account deficits in New Zealand is low national saving. Gross
national saving was about 4 percent of GDP lower that the average for Australia, Canada and the U.S.
for 2004–08, while gross investment was only ½ percent of GDP higher. Private saving, especially
household saving, appears low by advanced country standards. Experimental data published by Statistics
New Zealand suggest that household saving fell from negative 5 percent of disposable income in
2000/01 to negative 10 percent of disposable income in 2008, although this is likely to be an
underestimate due to deficiencies in sector statistics.
Previous staff analysis has shown that the long-term behavior of households’ saving in New Zealand is
explained by wealth, the pension and income support from government, the fiscal balance, and ease of
access to credit (IMF Country Report No. 03/122 (Chapter 2)). With lower house prices, tighter credit
conditions and fiscal deficits, household saving is expected to rise, relative to 2008 levels.
To raise household saving, the previous government introduced in 2007 an opt-out savings scheme
(KiwiSaver). Incentives to participate include a $NZ 1,000 kick start payment from the government and
tax incentives. By September 2009, more than half of the labor force had joined the scheme. Despite
KiwiSaver’s success in terms of participation, it remains to be seen whether it will have a lasting impact
on aggregate household saving.
While gross investment was comparable with other countries, public investment was high, and private
non-residential investment was low. From 2004–08 public investment was 1½ percent of GDP higher
than in Australia, Canada, and the U.S. However, there is uncertainty about whether public investment is
materially higher in New Zealand, given the use of public-private partnerships in other countries.

BOX 3. NEW ZEALAND: NEW LIQUIDITY POLICY
The global financial crisis highlighted the need for banks to have adequate liquidity to safeguard
financial stability. Given New Zealand banks’ significant use of short-term offshore funding, the
RBNZ moved ahead of other countries to implement a new liquidity policy for banks.
The new quantitative requirements (which are broadly consistent with the Basel Committee’s
proposals in December 2009) have two components––one aimed at short-term funding horizons, and
one for the longer-term funding profile.
 Liquidity mismatch ratios set minimum ‘zero’ requirements for one-week and one-month each
business day. The mismatch ratios
80
80
compare a bank’s likely cash inflows
New Zealand Bank Funding
(In percent of total funding)
70
70
with its likely cash outflows.


A minimum core funding ratio (CFR)
aims to ensure that banks hold sufficient
retail and longer-dated wholesale
funding. The minimum CFR has been
set at 65 percent from April 2010,
increasing to 70 percent from July 2011
and to 75 percent from July 2012.

Since 2008, banks have almost doubled
their holdings of liquid assets and increased
retail and long-term wholesale funding. The
new policy implies that banks may have to
shift more than 10 percent of GDP of
funding from short-term funding to longerterm maturities or to retail deposits, over
the next two years. In turn, this should help
reduce short-term external debt.
The new policy may also constrain the
ability of banks to increase lending during
cyclical upturns, when banks tend to resort
to short-term offshore markets for
additional funding.

The authorities had considered the merits of faster fiscal consolidation, but
decided that the current planned consolidation was appropriate. They share many of the
considerations outlined by the staff, particularly the conclusion that a low level of net public
debt is essential to keep the cost of capital low in the face of high external private debt. This
assessment is reflected in their target for net public debt of 20 percent of GDP and the
expectation to return the budget to balance in 2016, only two years after the staff’s proposal.
Current settings also allow for positive revenue surprises to be used to reduce the fiscal
deficit. They consider that this path will restore New Zealand’s ability to withstand potential
future shocks and allows more time to develop sustained improvements in the quality of
public spending. Their judgment is that while fiscal consolidation may help at the margin to
rebalance the economy towards higher exports and savings, the impact on the current
account deficit and growth is likely to be small and subject to a high degree of uncertainty.
43.
The authorities agree that the exchange rate will need to be significantly lower
for an extended period to get the net foreign liability position back to where it was five
years ago. They expect a depreciation over the next few years as the world economy
recovers and interest rate differentials normalize, but not to a level sufficient to prevent a
projected widening of the current account deficit to 7½ percent of GDP by 2014 and an
increase in net foreign liabilities.
44.
The authorities are following the international discussion of macro-prudential
measures closely. However, they were cautious about the effectiveness of a number of the
measures being discussed internationally and emphasized the scope for financial markets to
work around some measures.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
45.
A gradual economic recovery is expected to continue, helped by timely and
significant macroeconomic stimulus. But the outlook is subject to a number of downside
risks mainly related to the pace of the global recovery. Moreover, two key macro-financial
vulnerabilities persist—high household debt and high external debt.
46.
Reflecting a strong fiscal position prior to the crisis a sizable fiscal easing was
already under way that helped cushion the impact of the crisis. However, the mediumterm fiscal outlook has worsened because income tax cuts and many of the spending
initiatives were permanent and revenue projections have been revised down. As a result,
cash budget deficits of about 3–6 percent of GDP are projected over the next 4–5 years.
47.
The fiscal stimulus through June 2010 is appropriate, but meeting the
government’s commitment to limit the increase in public debt will be key to ensuring
fiscal sustainability. The authorities’ plans imply that net core Crown debt would peak at
30 percent of GDP in 2016 and fall below 20 percent of GDP by 2024.

29
48.
A shift in the macroeconomic policy mix toward faster fiscal consolidation
would reduce the risk of a recurrence of external funding problems. Faster
consolidation would relieve pressure on monetary policy and thereby the exchange rate, and
limit the increase in the current account deficit. Faster consolidation would also create fiscal
space to deal with future shocks, and reduce the likelihood of an increase in the risk
premium related to New Zealand’s high external debt.
49.
Consolidation should focus on spending restraint to return to budget surpluses
earlier than planned, unless the downside risks to growth materialize. There is scope to
better target transfers to households and improve the efficiency of public service provision
and capital spending. In addition, long-term pressures on the budget from rising health and
pension costs should be addressed early. Any positive revenue surprises should be saved and
the introduction of spending caps may provide useful discipline.
50.
The current accommodative monetary stance is appropriate and the RBNZ
should gradually return to neutral once the recovery is well established. Inflation is
likely to stay within the 1–3 percent target over the next few years, as the output gap is not
expected to close before 2013. In a downside scenario, monetary policy has room to be
loosened. The inflation-targeting framework served New Zealand well during the global
crisis and there are no clear net benefits to increasing the inflation target.
51.
Banks remain sound, but the authorities should continue to be vigilant as banks
are exposed to households and house prices appear overvalued. Closer collaboration
with Australian authorities on crisis management and stress tests is welcome, and banks’
capital and provisioning should be strengthened if these tests suggest the need for additional
buffers.
52.
The exchange rate is overvalued by 10–25 percent from a medium-term
perspective. If this proves to be temporary, it may limit the increase in the current account
deficit. But even if the current account returns to the estimated norm of almost 5 percent of
GDP, net foreign liabilities would remain high at 90 percent of GDP.
53.
Prudential and structural reforms would help reduce external vulnerability.
The introduction of the prudential liquidity policy, including a core funding ratio, should
reduce banks’ reliance on short-term external funding. The core funding ratio could be
raised further than planned if needed to help reduce short-term external debt. Further
structural reforms to raise productivity and labor force participation, including tax and
benefit reforms, would lift potential growth and export capacity.
54.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12month cycle.

Table 5. New Zealand: Unwinding Crisis-Related Monetary Policy Measures
Monetary policy rate

Liquidity support

Measures Taken
The Official Cash Rate was reduced by
575 basis points since July 2008 to
2.50 percent in April 2009.
In 2007–09, the Reserve Bank expanded
eligible collateral for domestic Reserve
Bank’s liquidity operations to include a
broad range of government and private
sector securities, including mortgagebacked, asset-backed, and corporate
securities.

Status of Unwinding
The Reserve Bank indicated its
intention to begin removing
policy stimulus around the
middle of 2010.
The Reserve Bank plans to
rationalize the range of eligible
securities by the third quarter of
2010.

In May 2008, the overnight reverse repo
facility was extended from 1 day to a
maximum of 30 days.

From November 2009 the
maximum term was shortened
to 1 day.

In November 2008, the Reserve Bank
introduced two new facilities to support
bank liquidity: a term auction facility and
weekly Reserve Bank bill tenders.

From November 2009 the two
facilities were removed.

Foreign exchange
swap arrangement

In October 2008, the Reserve Bank
established a US$15 billion swap line
with the U.S. Fed, initially through April
2009 and later extended several times.

The swap line expired on
February 1, 2010 and was never
used.

Funding guarantees

In October 2008, the Treasury introduced
a retail deposit guarantee scheme (on an
opt-in basis with a $NZ 1 million cap on
the coverage per depositor per
institution) for two years. Participating
institutions are charged fees, based on
the guaranteed amount and their credit
rating.

In August 2009, the Treasury
announced an extended retail
deposit guarantee scheme from
October 2010 to end-2011, with
higher fees and a lower
coverage limit of
$NZ 0.5 million per depositor
per bank and $NZ 0.25 million
per nonbank.

In November 2008, a guarantee was
offered on banks’ wholesale funding, on
an opt-in basis (by institution and by
instrument) for a fee differentiated by the
risk of the issuer and the maturity of the
security—e.g., 70–180 basis points per
annum for foreign currency issues
depending on issuers’ credit rating.

The government will close the
wholesale funding guarantee on
April 30, 2010. About
$NZ 10 billion of debt (about
6 percent of GDP) was issued
under this scheme by end-2009.

Appendix I. New Zealand: Main Recommendations of the 2009 Article IV Consultation
(Consultation Discussions Ended on March 23, 2009)
Fund Recommendations

Policy Actions

Fiscal policy: Staff advised that, to preserve
investor confidence, concrete measures should
be laid out in the May 2009 budget to stabilize
gross public debt in the medium term and
bring it back to around current levels (20–
25 percent of GDP) in the longer term. The
bulk of measures aimed at medium-term
consolidation should have an impact in
2010/11 and beyond, when growth is
projected to recover. The focus of fiscal
consolidation should be on the expenditure
side, although revenue measures are likely to
be needed to close the gap.

The 2009/10 budget planed to reduce the
deficits gradually through expenditure
restraint and fiscal drag, with a return to
surpluses projected by 2017. Net public debt
is projected by the authorities to peak at
30 percent of GDP in 2015 and gradually
decline to below 20 percent of GDP by
2024. Gross public debt is projected to fall
to just over 20 percent of GDP by 2024.
However, the adjustment is backloaded and
concrete measures to reach the medium
targets remain to be defined.

Monetary policy: Staff recommended that,
given the weak outlook for growth and
inflation, the RBNZ continue to reduce the
official cash rate.

The official cash rate was cut further to
2.5 percent at end-April 2009 (the lowest
since its introduction in 1999) and then kept
unchanged as the economy emerged from
recession in mid-2009.

Staff suggested that the authorities consider
alternative instruments, such as quantitative
easing, in the unlikely event that such
measures are needed.

The economic situation improved, starting
in mid-2009, so no further actions were
taken in addition to the measures taken by
early 2009, which broadened eligible
collateral for the RBNZ’s liquidity
operations and introduced two new facilities
to support bank liquidity.

Financial sector policy: Staff recommended
that, given the downside risks to the outlook,
banks be required to undertake extreme stress
tests and increase their capital if needed, and
supported the RBNZ’s plan to press ahead
with its proposed prudential liquidity rules to
strengthen the liquidity of the banking system.

A joint stress-testing exercise with
Australian supervisors is underway, and the
banking sector has remained well
capitalized. The RBNZ introduced two
liquidity mismatch ratios and a core funding
ratio (which came into force in April 2010)
to increase banks’ liquidity buffers and
reduce reliance on short-term offshore
funding.

ANNEX II. NEW ZEALAND: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is adequate for surveillance. The authorities are continuing to enhance data
quality and expand the range of data available, including a project led by the Reserve Bank
of New Zealand to publish data consistent with the Monetary and Financial Statistics
Manual 2000 (MFSM 2000). Given New Zealand’s high level of external indebtedness, the
publication of up to date institutional sector and flow of funds accounts would be an
important addition to the current suite of statistics.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 26, 2010

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
New Zealand
On May 12, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with New Zealand.1
Background
New Zealand rode out the global crisis better than most advanced economies, thanks to strong
demand from fast-growing Asian markets and the robust Australian economy, a flexible
exchange rate, the absence of a banking crisis, and significant and effective policy easing.
Nevertheless, the crisis highlighted long-standing vulnerabilities due to high household and
external debt.
Led by domestic demand, the economy emerged from the recession in mid-2009. A large output
gap contained growth in labor costs and eased inflationary pressures, with the annual CPI
inflation falling from the peaks of 4–5 percent in 2008 to about 2 percent in early 2009. After
cutting the official cash rate (OCR) by 575 basis points from mid-2008 to early 2009, the
Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) has kept it at a historical low of 2½ percent. The strong
pre-crisis fiscal position also enabled the delivery of a large fiscal easing that was in train prior
to the crisis, equivalent to almost 6 percent of GDP spread over the two years to June 2010.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
The current account deficit narrowed sharply in 2009 to 3 percent of GDP, as both trade and
income balances improved. Private capital inflows continued to finance the deficit, and net
foreign liabilities increased marginally to 90 percent of GDP. The exchange rate depreciated
sharply at the onset of the crisis, but has appreciated by over 20 percent since early 2009,
reflecting a recovery in commodity prices and global risk appetite, and a widening of interest
rate differentials.
Banks remain sound but faced some funding difficulties during the crisis. In response, the
government introduced a temporary wholesale funding guarantee that helped banks obtain term
funding of about $NZ 10 billion until they were able to access the market directly in late 2009.
Banks remain exposed to highly-indebted households and house prices appear overvalued.
A gradual recovery is expected to continue, with growth projected at 3 percent in 2010–11. The
outlook is subject to downside risks related to the pace of global recovery and borrowing costs
for countries with high external debt, such as New Zealand.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their decisive policy response, which helped
cushion the impact of the global crisis on the New Zealand economy and is supporting a
gradual economic recovery. Directors noted that the fiscal and monetary policy frameworks,
including the flexible exchange rate regime, have served New Zealand well during the crisis.
Key policy challenges are to lift sustainable economic growth and reduce the vulnerabilities
associated with a deteriorated fiscal position and high private external debt.
Directors concurred that New Zealand’s strong fiscal position has appropriately enabled a
sizeable stimulus to cushion the impact of the crisis. At the same time, they noted that the fiscal
easing, which was already underway prior to the crisis, has worsened New Zealand’s mediumterm fiscal outlook. Directors therefore welcomed the government’s commitment to limit the
increase in public debt, including the plan to use any revenue over-performance to reduce debt.
Many Directors felt that, unless downside risks to growth materialize, shifting the
macroeconomic policy mix towards faster fiscal consolidation, focused on spending reforms,
would merit consideration. It would relieve pressure on monetary policy and the exchange rate,
limit the increase in the current account deficit, create fiscal space to deal with future shocks,
and reduce the risk of a recurrence of external funding problems.
Directors considered the current accommodative monetary stance as appropriate. They
supported a measured withdrawal of the stimulus once the recovery is well established, given
that spare capacity is expected to persist over the next few years, helping to keep inflation
within the 1–3 percent target range. If downside risks to inflation materialized, there could be
room to loosen monetary policy. Directors observed that the inflation-targeting framework

3
performed well during the global crisis and saw no clear net benefits to increasing the inflation
target.
Directors noted that the exchange rate is overvalued from a medium-term perspective, while
recognizing the uncertainty surrounding the estimates. The exchange rate would need to be
significantly lower for an extended period of time for New Zealand’s external liabilities position to
be materially reduced.
Directors noted that New Zealand’s financial sector has remained resilient through the global
crisis. Banks are well capitalized and nonperforming loans, although increasing, are low.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to be vigilant to risks arising from banks’
exposure to short-term external and household debt and the possible impact of a correction in
house prices. They welcomed the closer collaboration with the Australian authorities on crisis
management and stress tests, and recommended that banks’ capital and provisioning be
strengthened if these tests suggest the need for additional buffers.
Directors noted that prudential and structural reforms would help reduce external vulnerabilities.
They welcomed the introduction of a prudential liquidity policy, including a core funding ratio,
which should reduce banks’ reliance on short-term external funding. Directors also underscored
the importance of structural reforms to raise productivity and labor force participation, including
tax and benefit reform, to help lift potential growth and export capacity, and support economic
rebalancing, thereby reducing vulnerabilities related to external debt.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
Reader to view this pdf file) for the 2010 Article IV Consultation with New Zealand is also available.
