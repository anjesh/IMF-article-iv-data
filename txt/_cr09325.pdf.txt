Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
with Cambodia
Approved by Kalpana Kochhar and Dominique Desruelle
October 30, 2009
 Discussions: Held in Phnom Penh September 9–23 with Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of Economy and Finance Keat Chhon, Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister-in-Charge of the Office of the Council of Ministers Sok An, National Bank of
Cambodia Governor Chea Chanto, Senior Minister of Commerce Cham Prasidh, and other
ministers and senior officials, as well as donor and private sector representatives.
 Team: Mr. Cowen (Head), Mr. Yoshida, Ms. Baker, Ms. Duma (all APD), Mr. Shin
(FAD), and Ms. Kim (SPR), assisted by Mr. Nelmes (Resident Representative).
Mr. Gil Sander (World Bank) worked with the team on the debt sustainability analysis, in
collaboration with Mr. Chang (AsDB). Ms. Vongpradhip and Mr. Nget (OED) participated
in discussions.
 Context of past surveillance: Broad agreement on the direction of policies has been
tempered by the need for more comprehensive reforms in critical areas, notably on public
financial management and banking supervision. In support of the government’s reform
agenda, extensive technical assistance has been provided in fiscal, money and banking, and
statistical areas through long-term advisors, peripatetic experts, and staff visits. A follow
up safeguards assessment mission was held in July 2009 and a joint IMF-World Bank
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) mission is scheduled for March 2010.
 Exchange arrangement: Cambodia has accepted the obligations under Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making
of payments and transfers for current international transactions (Annex I). The exchange
regime is classified as floating.
 Data: Some progress has been made in improving economic statistics, but weaknesses
remain, in particular in the compilation of the balance of payments, external debt and
disbursements, and national income accounts. Core economic data are adequate for
surveillance purposes, although regular provision of bank soundness data is needed to
ensure timely monitoring of macro-financial risks (Annex IV).

Executive Summary
Background: Following a decade of high economic growth and significant poverty
reduction, Cambodia’s economy has been buffeted by the global recession. Three of the four
main drivers of growth have registered sharp contractions since late 2008, and the property
bubble has burst under the weight of weaker economic activity and foreign currency inflows.
As a result, the economy is expected to contract in 2009, with only a modest yet still
uncertain pickup in 2010. Under these conditions, banks’ balance sheets have weakened
considerably. At the same time, inflation has come down rapidly, and foreign reserves have
remained broadly stable, as plunging imports offset sharply declining exports and foreign
direct investment.
Key policy issues: Discussions focused on policies aimed at mitigating the impact of the
global crisis while preserving macroeconomic stability, and on critical actions required to
reinforce the banking system. Efforts to strengthen policy effectiveness, reduce
vulnerabilities, and improve competitiveness also figured prominently in the discussions.
Staff’s views: Given Cambodia’s highly dollarized economy, fiscal policy should continue to
anchor macroeconomic stability, remaining appropriately supportive while avoiding
weakening the external position. A sizable domestic financing requirement resulting from the
projected sharp widening of the fiscal deficit this year and next could exert pressure on
inflation, the exchange rate, and foreign reserves, and should be eliminated through a
combination of revenue and expenditure measures. In view of the recession, spending should
be targeted at high-impact social and infrastructure outlays. The monetary stance is broadly
appropriate, but allowing greater exchange rate flexibility would help facilitate adjustment
and protect international reserves, especially in view of the accommodative fiscal stance. In
light of the deterioration in banks’ balance sheets and rising credit risks, the authorities
should strictly enforce corrective actions plans and urge banks to bring forward compliance
with new minimum capital requirements ahead of the end-2010 deadline.
Authorities’ views: The authorities reiterated their commitment to returning to a more
prudent fiscal stance, sharing similar concerns related to recent fiscal loosening. Selected
revenue measures are under consideration, efforts to strengthen tax administration are
ongoing, and expenditures—especially ballooning functional allowances—are being
reviewed. On monetary policy, they agreed that the large liquidity overhang warranted
increased vigilance as the recovery takes hold. However, in their view, staff’s call for
limiting foreign exchange intervention underplays seasonal demand and supply factors, as
well as the important role of exchange rate stability in anchoring inflation expectations.
Moreover, while the authorities agreed on the need to deal firmly with problem banks, they
preferred a more gradual approach. Notwithstanding differences of views in some areas, they
greatly appreciated past and present IMF technical assistance and the presence of the resident
office, which have supported their continued efforts to strengthen capacity and improve
policy effectiveness.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Cambodia’s economy has been buffeted by the global recession, following a
decade of high economic growth with significant poverty reduction.


Growth averaged 8 percent over the period 2000–09, underpinned by favorable global
conditions resulting in new productive opportunities and by generally prudent policies
supporting macroeconomic stability. The poverty level fell to 30 percent of
households in 2007 compared to about 50 percent in the mid-1990s, but with
indications of rising inequality.1 Measurable progress was made in strengthening
public administration and undertaking growth-enhancing structural reforms, in
collaboration with development partners.



In the wake of the global recession, growth in Cambodia in 2009 has turned negative,
as export receipts plunged, the tourism industry suffered, and construction activity
contracted. By World Bank estimates, the crisis could lead to some reversal in
poverty indicators.2 Growth conditions are only expected to improve modestly in
2010, given uncertain global prospects. The sharp slowdown and now deflated
property prices have led to heightened financial risk and weakened banks’ balance
sheets. Lower foreign currency inflows and a significant loosening of the fiscal stance
are also putting pressure on the external position.

2.
Against this backdrop, discussions focused on policies aimed at mitigating the
impact of the crisis, while preserving macroeconomic stability. Key issues included
balancing well-targeted support against avoiding excessive fiscal expansion, as well as
strengthening monetary management, allowing greater exchange rate flexibility, and
resolving banking sector weaknesses. The structural reform agenda was also revisited in view
of the need to diversify growth and improve competitiveness.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
3.
The global crisis is affecting large segments of Cambodia’s economy and
clouding prospects, with growth in 2009 now projected at negative 2¾ percent. This

Progress toward achieving the Millennium Development Goals (Table 7) remains on track in the areas of
expanding primary education, reducing the incidence of communicable diseases, and promoting gender
equality, but more efforts are needed to eradicate extreme poverty and reduce maternal mortality
(http://www.mdgmonitor.org).
2

The World Bank’s East Asia Update (forthcoming in November 2009) reports that the current crisis could add
1‒4 percentage points to the poverty headcount between 2007–10. The crisis’s impact on Cambodia is
compounded by high household indebtedness and the lingering wealth effect of soaring food prices in 2007–08.
In contrast, strong growth in earlier years is estimated to have contributed to a decline in the poverty headcount
by more than 1 percentage point per year during 2004–07.

compares with the government’s preliminary estimate of positive 6¾ percent in 2008 and
double-digit growth earlier in the decade (Figure 1 and Table 1). While signs of a bottoming
out began emerging in mid-2009, three of the four main drivers of growth—garments,
tourism, and construction—have registered significant contractions so far this year. Private
investment has also been hit, with project implementation slowing, new project approvals

down significantly, and some foreign-funded construction activity on hold. In addition, retail
trade is faltering, reflecting especially steep declines in automobile and motorcycle imports.
Notwithstanding the moderate impact from Typhoon Ketsana, good harvests are expected
this year, although rural incomes have been depressed by lower agricultural prices.

recovery in tourism, especially high-end arrivals, is likely to be muted, based on low forward
bookings and threats from H1N1, while a pickup in construction depends on resumption of
bank lending and foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows. On the upside, rising productivity
in agriculture could lead growth higher.
5.
Inflation has declined sharply, mainly due to lower food and fuel prices. Headline
inflation is expected be around 5 percent (y/y) by end-2009 (compared to negative
2¼ percent in September 2009), mainly as base effects from sharp declines in commodity
prices fall out of the consumer price index (CPI). It should remain in the mid-single digits in
2010, although upside risk remains possibly stemming from a more expansionary fiscal
stance, a sharper depreciation of the U.S. dollar vis-à-vis other major currencies, and/or
higher oil prices than currently envisaged.
6.
The current account deficit (including transfers) is expected to narrow in 2009 to
around 5½ percent of GDP (Figure 2 and Table 2) as lower import demand and fuel prices
more than offset sharply smaller export and tourism receipts (garments account for
65 percent of merchandise exports). As the recovery starts to kick in, the deficit is projected
to widen to more than 11 percent of GDP in 2010, owing principally to sluggish exports
trailing rising imports and oil prices. Gross official reserves are expected to stay broadly
stable, at around US$2.2 billion (3.5 months of next year’s imports) at end-2009 (including
the recent SDR allocation).3 However, a modest decline is projected for 2010, to around
US$2.1 billion by year end, as the widening current account deficit more than offsets an

expected pickup in FDI and banking inflows. In the event of an even looser fiscal stance,
further pressure could be placed on reserves if the exchange rate is not allowed to adjust.
7.
Cambodia’s slowing economy has also weakened banks’ balance sheets and
stalled new lending. While banks reported no direct exposure to toxic assets abroad,

8
liquidity conditions tightened significantly at the onset of the global financial crisis. In
addition to heightened liquidity risks, banks began facing greater credit risks, exacerbated by
sharply lower property prices, which also called into question the adequacy of real estate as
collateral.4 Liquidity conditions began improving in early 2009, following policy action by
the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) and banks’ own drive to build liquid balances
(discussed below). As a result, banks’ foreign currency deposits (FCDs) rose by 21 percent in
the first eight months of 2009, in part due to high deposit interest rates as some banks sought
to reduce loan-to-deposit ratios and others to maintain market share. However, credit growth
has fallen sharply, from 55 percent (y/y) in 2008 to 4 percent in August, with banks
increasingly risk averse.
8.
Moderate growth is expected over the medium term, but the external position
would remain relatively weak. In the context of a more subdued global outlook (compared
to pre-crisis conditions), growth would stabilize at 6–6½ percent per year over the medium
term (Table 3), driven by more supportive services activities, including tourism; a pickup in
investment demand—notably in power sector infrastructure; and improved agricultural
yields. Garment exports are expected to be muted by the productivity gap with other regional
producers, high nonwage costs, and structural changes in the global market (Box 1). Other
export sectors—namely in agribusiness and light manufacturing—face similar challenges. On
the other hand, capital imports are expected to pick up as FDI resumes and new power
generation and transmission projects are developed. Underpinning the medium-term outlook
is moderate fiscal adjustment starting in 2010, as needed to ensure stable macroeconomic
conditions. Improving growth prospects, reducing inequality, and strengthening the external
position will also require a more diverse productive base, strengthened competitiveness, and
sounder economic governance. To this end, the pace of implementation of the structural
reform agenda will need to be stepped up, especially for those reforms aimed at improving
basic infrastructure, enhancing labor skills, and strengthening the business climate.
III. REPORT ON DISCUSSIONS
9.

Discussions focused mainly on the following:



Fiscal: Ensuring the current fiscal stance, as the main anchor to macroeconomic
stability, is appropriately supportive, but does not exert undue external pressures, in
light of heightened vulnerabilities;

No reliable index of property prices exists in Cambodia. However, property prices in Phnom Penh are
reportedly down by 50 percent from their mid-2008 peak. Most loans are backed by real estate, while propertyrelated loans account for 20–30 percent of total credit outstanding.

9

Box 1. Cambodia: Garments Sector—Impact of the Global Slowdown and Prospects
The severe impact of the global slowdown on Cambodia’s garment industry is a major driver of the recent
contraction in economic activity.


In 2008, the garment sector accounted for about 15 percent of GDP and 65 percent of exports (nearly three-quarters
of which were destined for the U.S. market), with total employment of about 350,000—the bulk of the
manufacturing workforce. Volume growth averaged 11 percent per year over 2005–08.



In contrast, over the first nine months of 2009, export volumes are down about 16 percent compared to the same
period in 2008. According to industry representatives, forward orders also are very weak.



According to the Garment Manufacturers Association of Cambodia (GMAC), around 40 factories (net) have closed
so far this year, with another 25 or so remaining open, but operating under a suspension of activity. Small factories
previously carrying out subcontracting of overflow orders have been most affected. Most large factories are
operating at 60–70 percent capacity (130 percent previously), with less than 5 percent of factories on a 24-hour shift
cycle. As of June, some 40,000 jobs had been lost, with retained workers earning about 20 percent less than in 2008
as a result of reduced overtime.

In contrast to garment exporters in other Asian
lower-income economies, Cambodia has not
gained U.S. market share, as a sizable fraction of
its orders is overflow of large ones received by key
buyers. Cambodian garment exports to the United
States are down some 23 percent in value terms, in
line with trends observed in more mature Asian
economies where garments account for a far smaller
share of exports. Large garment orders received by
producers in major hubs such as Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region or Taiwan Province
of China (POC) are allocated to factories
throughout the region starting with the most cost
efficient. Declining orders have left fewer allocated
to garment manufactures with relatively high unit
costs and compress profit margins for all.

Competitiveness in Cambodia is hampered by several factors, mainly lower productivity, unreliable supply and high
cost of electricity (about 15 percent of total cost), high transport costs and protracted time to market, and lack of vertical
integration—factors that are increasingly important given weak demand. According to the GMAC, total manufacturing
cost is about 20 percent higher than in neighboring Vietnam, despite lower hourly wages, with major factors being lower
productivity, higher electricity costs (22 cents per kwh versus 7 cents in Vietnam), and less developed infrastructure such
as ports and roads (getting a container to port reportedly costs about five times that of Vietnam).
The outlook for Cambodian garment exports is clouded by structural changes in the market, in addition to lagging
competitiveness. The global recovery is not expected to be consumer-led, dimming prospects for 2010. Looking ahead,
the long-anticipated consolidation of the garment industry as a result of the expiry of quotas and safeguards under China’s
WTO accession agreement appears to be in train, while free trade agreements between other low-income country (LIC)
producers and the United States are increasingly putting Cambodia at a disadvantage. The United States has granted
quota-free, duty-free access through various trade agreements to 30 of 49 non-Asian LICs. In contrast, Cambodia is
subject to an average 16 percent tariff on garment imports.
While new bilateral trade agreements could play a key role in expanding markets, negotiations will likely be
protracted, whereas conclusion of the Doha Round would permanently reduce tariffs. An ASEAN-USA or
ASEAN-EU free trade agreement would benefit Cambodia as Rules of Origin would only require sourcing inputs from
ASEAN, while passage of the U.S. Trade Act of 2009 would eliminate tariffs on garments and textiles from 14 LICs,
including Cambodia. However, all are currently stalled due to political considerations. Sourcing by Japan has seen a shift
away from Chinese garment imports and could reduce Cambodia’s dependence on the U.S. market, but at a mere 1
percent of exports, scope is low.



Monetary: Strengthening the monetary policy framework, in the context of helping
banks better manage liquidity and eventually facilitating greater use of riels, as a
precursor to a more independent policy;



Exchange rate: Allowing greater exchange rate flexibility, as necessary, in view of
the accommodative fiscal stance and to help facilitate external adjustment; and



Banking sector: Reducing risks facing the banking sector to contain potential fiscal
costs and improve conditions for banks to resume normal lending activities, in
support of economic recovery.
A. Preserving Macroeconomic Stability in the Wake of the Global Crisis

Fiscal policy
10.
Moderate fiscal easing was broadly appropriate in 2009 given weak aggregate
demand, but in staff’s view the current stance is overly expansionary, which could
undermine stability. The 2009 budget deficit is projected to widen to 6¾ percent of GDP
(Figure 3 and Table 4), against an original target of 4¼ percent (and up from 2¾ percent in
2008). Unlike recent budgets, this year’s will likely require domestic financing (i.e., a
drawdown in government deposits)—now projected at around 1¼ percent of GDP. Staff
observed that revenue targets appear on track owing to strong administrative efforts,
notwithstanding automatic stabilizers and selected tax relief (mainly customs exemptions
on imported inputs for agriculture and small enterprises). However, expenditure levels
have risen sharply, with large increases in wage and defense outlays and locally-financed
capital spending.5 Staff cautioned that any large injection of riel liquidity into the economy
could put pressure on inflation, the exchange rate, and foreign reserves, absent effective
monetary controls. With only a few months left in the current fiscal year, efforts should
focus on maintaining strong revenue collection and reducing nonpriority spending, in order
to ensure adequate space for high-impact social and infrastructure outlays and limit
domestic financing.
11.
The staff strongly recommended that the 2010 budget target a reduction in the
overall deficit and reallocate spending toward priority sectors. Based on preliminary
revenue and expenditure plans for 2010, staff noted the budget deficit could rise to
7½ percent of GDP, resulting in a domestic financing requirement of more than 1½ percent

5

On the other hand, externally-financed capital spending was at a slower pace than expected (through
August 2009) due to reported delays in project-related procurements, as well as continued problems in the
timely recording of donor disbursements.

of GDP.6 Pressure was seen as emerging from the large carry-over of spending on wages
together with unspecified increases in nonwage current expenditure. Staff urged the budget
deficit be limited to around 5¾ percent of GDP—still appropriately accommodative in
providing adequate space for development objectives, but eliminating the domestic financing
requirement and setting the stage for medium-term fiscal consolidation.
12.
The authorities noted staff’s concern, indicating that with budget discussions
ongoing, scope existed to adopt a more prudent fiscal stance.


6

On the revenue side, the authorities indicated specific revenue measures are being
considered, such as raising excises on truck sales and imposing a value-added tax

The drawdown in government deposits over 2009 and 2010 would amount to nearly 3 percentage points of
GDP, almost half of the accumulated buildup over the preceding years.

16

12
(VAT) on electricity imports.7 They also remain committed to further strengthening
tax administration, including customs valuation procedures, anti-smuggling efforts,
and tax arrears collection. Staff urged more upfront action be considered in light of
fiscal risks, including such measures as increasing the reference price for taxing
petroleum products and raising other selected excises (e.g., cigarettes, spirits, and
diesel). In addition, staff recommended ad hoc import tariff reductions in 2009, tax
holidays, and exemptions, and minimum presumptive taxes be reconsidered.8


In expenditure areas, the authorities suggested functional allowances would be
reviewed, especially new ones for the military and security forces. Staff noted that
containing wage bill growth would be key to ensuring sound fiscal management,
urging tighter limits on increases in basic wages and allowances and possible freezes
on new hires (focused on nonpriority sectors). These measures would need to be
accompanied by comprehensive civil service reform, as part of broader efforts to
strengthen public financial management and accountability. The authorities indicated
in this context that remedies would be devised to control wage costs, recognizing
political constraints but consistent with maintaining budget discipline. Staff also urged
tighter limits on nonwage recurrent spending growth, apart from that in priority sectors
and operations and maintenance, as well as a phasing out of remaining subsidies to
Electricité du Cambodge, facilitated by allowing full cost recovery tariffs.

13.
There was broad agreement that sound fiscal management would continue to be
underpinned by public financial management (PFM) reforms. Aided by substantial
technical assistance from the IMF, World Bank, and other development partners, staff noted
the measured progress made under the PFM reform program, but urged in light of current
circumstances that efforts be accelerated under the second phase (Box 2). Priorities include
improving budget integration, especially as pertains to donor-financed capital spending; fully
implementing GFS-consistent budget classification and a new chart of accounts; increasing
transparency of governmental transactions (with Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative
participation encouraged to promote sound development of the country’s potential oil and
mineral wealth); and establishing a Treasury single account. To increase government
accountability and transparency, staff also urged publication of more timely and
comprehensive information on budget formulation and outturns. The authorities noted
challenges in implementing PFM reforms, including adhering to more stringent procurement
procedures, strengthening internal coordination in the context of weak capacity, and
undertaking politically sensitive measures aimed at enforcing greater budget discipline.
7

The authorities’ plan to impose a VAT on electricity consumption starting in mid-2009 has been placed on
hold, given risks to revenue collection posed by possibly large rebates to private energy producers and political
challenges associated with already high end-use prices of electricity.
8

The tax holiday to the garment sector has been extended by two years to 2011, with the rate on profit taxes
capped at 9 percent until then. In addition, monthly prepayments of the tax have been suspended until 2012.

13

Box 2. Cambodia: Update on Public Financial Management Reform
Cambodia’s Public Financial Management Reform Program (PFMRP) was launched nearly five years
ago, with the main objective of bringing the PFM system in line with international standards by 2015.
Under a donor-supported framework, the PFMRP adopted a “stage-by-stage” approach, with second stage
of implementation beginning in 2009. Four platforms were established in order to prioritize the sequence
of reforms.
Under Stage 1, the main focus was on building budget credibility, with recognizable achievements in a
number of areas. Key objectives were to make the budget comprehensive, strengthen macro-fiscal
forecasting, and streamline spending processes, along with some start-up work on later platforms (namely the
government accounting system and medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF)). Major achievements were
(i) introducing a new budget calendar (with an earlier start to the annual budget process); facilitating more
inputs from line ministries; (ii) adopting Budget Strategic Plans and developing a strategy for introducing an
MTEF; (iii) improving cash management—eliminating payment arrears and thus allowing smoother budget
implementation; and (iv) extending the use of the banking system for government transactions.
However, in some areas, progress under Stage 1 was slow due to capacity constraints and coordination
problems within the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) and other lead agencies. Initial steps have
been made to establish a Treasury single account. However, it has yet to become fully operational, with
National Treasury automation lagging. Implementation of a new chart of accounts (COA) and budget
classification has also been limited. As a result, timely and accurate monitoring of the budget remains a
challenge. In particular, the current system of monthly fiscal reporting (TOFE) suffers from occasional delays,
incompleteness, and inconsistencies. Finally, the public procurement process remains complicated.
In Stage 2, the focus has shifted to achieving better financial transparency and accountability. Main
objectives are to improve the accountability of budget decision makers; implement new budget classification
dimensions, bringing the COA in line with the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics and UN’s Classification
of the Functions of Government standards; introduce an IT-based Financial Management Information System
(FMIS); and further strengthen internal and external audit functions and decentralize service delivery.
While the progress to date is commendable, there is a need to:


Strengthen budget integration, especially in donor-financed capital spending. Relevant departments
in the MEF, the Ministry of Planning, and the Council for the Development of Cambodia are urged to
have regular, frequent, and closer coordination in the areas of budget formulation, execution, and
recording. Ultimately, a unified control and monitoring system closely linked to the budget is needed.



Improve fiscal monitoring and reporting. Integrating the financial information produced by several
agencies using different software systems and accounting codes within a standard framework is a top
priority. To accelerate system computerization, strong leadership in preparation for full implementation
of the FMIS is needed.



Reinforce controls over payroll and procurement. In light of a rapid increase in the wage bill, a more
systemic management of payrolls should be set up to guard against the risk of “ghost workers” and
prevent the wage bill from crowding out other priority spending. Streamlining the overlapping
procurement procedures, including approval processes, and strengthening monitoring through a better
regulatory framework are also necessary.

Monetary and exchange rate policy
14.
The monetary stance is broadly appropriate, but staff cautioned relatively loose
conditions would require closer watch as economic recovery takes hold. There was
agreement that a further easing—specifically a reduction in the reserve requirement—was

14
neither warranted based on monetary conditions nor desirable from a prudential perspective.9
Under these conditions and given the anticipated recovery, credit growth is expected to
rebound in 2010 to 17 percent (y/y), compared to a projected 3½ percent in 2009 (Figure 4
and Table 5). Staff cautioned that as banks’ excess reserve holdings at the NBC mounted
(more than one-third of banks’ total FCDs at end-August), the sizable liquidity overhang
could pose macro-financial risks on a couple of fronts. First, a rapid reversal in the deposit
buildup (including speculative inflows) could result in a spike in liquidity risk, and second,
some banks could attempt to lend their way out of their problems, heightening credit risks.
Staff also noted the need to maintain adequate vault cash at the NBC, including at local
branches, as a safeguard against liquidity shocks in view of still-elevated risks.
15.
Progress continues to be made in improving liquidity management, but a
number of actions are needed for an operational monetary framework. The conduct of
monetary policy is hampered by the lack of market-based instruments, weak interbank
activity, and high level of dollarization, which limits the establishment of operating and
intermediate targets. 10 With Fund technical assistance, the NBC is undertaking higher
frequency liquidity monitoring, with weekly indicators now being compiled. Staff welcomed
progress toward issuing negotiable U.S. dollar-denominated instruments that could be traded
among institutions, as this would help strengthen banks’ liquidity management and deepen
interbank activity. To this end, the NBC seeks to finalize regulations on issuing securitized
instruments and on a repo master agreement by end-2009. Given the absence of monetary
instruments to control riel liquidity, the authorities also expressed interest in issuing rielbased securities. Staff noted that with few banks holding large riel balances, the effectiveness
of such instruments might be limited for some time. However, issuance of new dollar-based
instruments could provide collateral for more riel transactions between banks and ultimately
pave the way for trading local currency securities.
16.
Staff noted that maintaining a relatively fixed exchange rate could undermine
efforts to strengthen monetary management and heighten vulnerability to shocks. In
light of the government’s riel injection and seasonal factors, the NBC took steps to stem
downward pressure on the riel at mid year, becoming a net seller of foreign exchange to the
market in three consecutive months (July–September) for the first time since mid-2005. Staff
noted such intervention was potentially costly in terms of delaying adjustment and reducing
reserve coverage—both as a share of imports and deposits. The authorities indicated their
action was necessary to address possible overshooting and avoid an inflation spiral, but that
9

In response to tightening liquidity conditions in late 2008, the NBC reduced the reserve requirement on FCDs
in February 2009 from 16 percent to 12 percent and introduced a new reserve requirement system helping banks
conserve liquid balances. An emergency overdraft facility was also put in place.
10

Currently, net domestic assets of the NBC serves as a de facto operating target, in view of the impact of
changes in net claims on government by the central bank on riel liquidity and the exchange rate.

as market conditions had now stabilized, they did not anticipate further intervention. Staff
continued to urge limiting intervention to smoothing volatility to help protect international
reserves, deepen the foreign exchange market, and allow the exchange rate a greater role in
facilitating external adjustment. In this context, both the staff and the authorities agreed the new
SDR allocation should be retained to build up foreign reserves, given current vulnerabilities.

16
17.
The real effective exchange rate appears to be somewhat overvalued relative to
its equilibrium level. However, this assessment is subject to considerable uncertainty.11
Much of the increase in the current account deficit over the near to medium term is accounted
for by imports associated with large FDI and donor-related projects, which are fully financed.
Nevertheless, a continued strengthening of the exchange rate could weaken export prospects
and increase external pressures.
B. Strengthening the Financial Sector
18.
While banks’ liquidity has improved, staff noted that bank balance sheets have
further weakened and credit risks have risen sharply over the past year. Contributing
factors center on weak risk management, earlier supervisory lapses, and excessive credit
growth, the effects of which have been exacerbated by the growth slowdown and property
price collapse. Nonperforming loans (NPLs) are rising, but the figures officially reported by
banks likely fail to capture the true extent of the problem. Sensitivity analysis informed by
other countries experiencing similar property cycles to Cambodia points to potentially larger
loan losses and capital deficiencies, raising the risk of bank insolvencies (Box 3). Negative
interest carry and low demand for credit appears to be squeezing profits, making it difficult
for banks to grow out of these problems. Given current circumstances, staff cautioned that
sustained competition for deposits as a cushion against liquidity shocks could further
undercut banks’ profitability and hamper their ability to write off NPLs. Under such a
scenario, banks could face difficulty resuming normal lending activities, with a potential for
adverse feedback between weak growth and further credit losses.
19.
So far, the NBC has taken measured steps to deal with problem banks, with
much more forceful action needed to reduce systemic risks. Since early 2009, the NBC
has conducted a set of prioritized onsite inspections (with assistance from the IMF and
AsDB), resulting in the issuance of supervisory letters to noncompliant banks and
development of corrective action plans to address a range of operational and financial
deficiencies. Banks are also being urged to advance compliance with new minimum capital
requirements ahead of the end-2010 deadline. In addition, their related party activities are
being more closely scrutinized and internal governance is being strengthened, including
through the introduction of credit committees and use of more independent directors. Staff
urged strict enforcement of newly-introduced loan classification and provisioning standards
and recognition of loan losses, with recapitalization where needed, to ensure banks’ solvency
and minimize fiscal risks. To these ends, the authorities were urged to develop a
11

Results of the exchange rate assessment are mixed. The macroeconomic balance approach indicates an
overvaluation of around 25 percent, while the equilibrium real exchange rate approach points to an
undervaluation of about 2 percent. Neither is statistically significant. Extreme caution is warranted when
assessing the equilibrium exchange rate for Cambodia, given structural changes and weaknesses in
macroeconomic data.

17

Box 3. Cambodia: Banking Sector Vulnerabilities
Cambodia’s banking sector continues to face heightened risks, despite the slowdown in credit growth
and easing of liquidity pressures observed so far in 2009.
Most notably, credit quality has deteriorated significantly, although official reports may belie the true
extent of the problem. Banks reported that NPLs rose to 5¼ percent at June 2009 from 3¾ percent in
December 2008 (Table 6). However, the actual level of NPLs is likely much higher. In particular, a number of
banks continue to report few or no NPLs, suggesting incomplete adherence with the new loan classification
and provisioning regulation. Moreover, the evergreening of loans and capitalization of interest still take place
to avoid loan loss recognition and

purchases during the recent property boom.
Sensitivity analysis of the banking system,
using a range of NPL ratios that have
materialized in other countries
experiencing similar property price busts,
suggests a potentially large capital
deficiency. Using a top-down approach, if
average system-wide NPLs were to rise to
around 15 percent (Scenario 1) and require
full provisioning, the risk-weighted capital to
asset (RWKA) ratio would decline to 20
percent. At this level, NPLs would amount to
around 37 percent of the banking system’s
capital at end-June 2009.

3/ Based on end-September 2009 data (baseline). Liquid assets
include vault cash, excess reserves at the NBC, and deposits held abroad.

Even as liquidity pressures ease, risks
remain in the current environment. To
protect themselves, some banks are self-insuring and reducing loan-deposit ratios by raising new deposits, but
at considerable cost, which may eventually undermine stability. Interest rates on six-month term deposits in
U.S. dollars averaged over 5 percent throughout 2009, leading to a significant increase in bank deposits.
Along with slower lending growth, the loan-deposit ratio declined from over 100 percent in late-2008 to
around 80 percent. Banks have placed most new deposits at the NBC as excess reserves, where they are
remunerated at most at one-half of SIBOR (close to zero percent), generating a negative interest spread and
driving down banking sector profits, with return on equity and return on assets both declining. The profit
squeeze has adversely affected banks’ ability to absorb loan losses and resume lending growth. Proper
provisioning against NPLs would further reduce profits.
In the event recent deposit inflows were to reverse, banks could come under heightened pressures,
requiring close monitoring. Moreover, excessive use of overdrafts represents contingent calls on liquidity
(i.e., if customers draw overdrafts down quickly). Staff sensitivity analysis suggests that a 15 percent deposit
reduction (Scenario 1 in the text table) would reduce the ratio of liquid assets to deposits (LAD) to around 28
percent, well below the level prevailing during the period of liquidity stress in late 2008. A 20 percent deposit
reduction would result in a system-wide LAD ratio of 24 percent, which is very low for a highly dollarized
financial system lacking a functioning interbank market and central bank facilities.
The results of these sensitivity analyses are preliminary. The upcoming Financial Sector Assessment
Program (FSAP), scheduled for 2010, will examine the soundness of the banking sector in greater depth,
including through comprehensive stress tests using both a top-down and bottom-up approach and assess
banks’ vulnerabilities to a range of tail risk shocks.

18
comprehensive bank resolution framework, including procedures to assume administrative
control of intervened banks, resolve failed institutions, and provide public financial
assistance as necessary under a transparent regime. Going forward, the authorities agreed on
the need to deal more firmly with troubled banks, as staff cautioned a gradual approach could
potentially entail even greater risks for the banking sector and become more costly.
20.
Staff noted further capacity building was needed to safeguard the financial
system and limit regulatory arbitrage, given growth and diversification of the sector.
The NBC’s supervisory and oversight capacity is already stretched by rapid growth in the
number of banks and could be further burdened by bank restructurings. The development of a
stock market and impending consolidated supervision of securities firms will place additional
strains on resources. The recently established Financial Intelligence Unit is still in the process
of sourcing much-needed technical resources for processing a large quantity of cash
transaction reports. The authorities were urged to increase qualified staff in banking
supervision—notably for onsite inspection teams, continuing to concentrate their activities on
the larger banks. A temporary moratorium on the granting of new bank licenses was also
urged until supervisory capacity could be appropriately expanded. Here, however, the
authorities noted the important role that new entrants could play, notably those from abroad,
in raising operating standards and reducing risk concentration in the banking system.12
Finally, there was agreement on the need for closer collaboration between the NBC and
Securities and Exchange Commission of Cambodia (SECC) to avoid opportunities for
regulatory arbitrage, with guidelines for establishing securities firms and broker operations
now issued in anticipation of a new stock exchange to be rolled out next year. 13
C. Reducing Vulnerabilities and Fostering Competitiveness
21.
The resumption of sustained high growth requires more concerted actions aimed
at strengthening competitiveness and improving the business climate. The authorities
noted that efforts toward full WTO compliance and lowering the cost of doing business were
ongoing. However, the number of required laws, amendments, and regulations is extensive,
and great care must be taken to address wide-ranging inconsistencies among laws and
regulations under various ministries. Given the limited number of staff and capacity, priority
has been given to those areas that will most benefit business. At present, focus is on the
finalization of the Commercial Contract Law, including the chapter on Commercial Agency,
and establishment of the National Arbitration Council, which should be in place by year-end.
Moreover, implementation of post-clearance audits and simplified valuation and cargo
processing procedures have reduced time required for customs clearance.

12

Over the past year, an additional 5 bank licenses have been issued, bringing the total number of banks to 32.

13

In all, some 30 regulations are under preparation by the SECC.

19
22.
Cambodia is assessed to be at a moderate risk of debt distress, and rising
contingent liabilities warrant increased vigilance. At end-2008, total public debt was
equivalent to around 25 percent of GDP, with nearly all external. The joint IMF-World Bank
Debt Sustainability Analysis highlights Cambodia’s dependence on nondebt creating flows
from abroad and risks posed by higher fiscal deficits (Appendix I). A failure to significantly
rein in the deficit or the realization of possible contingent liabilities resulting from
dislocations in the banking system, government guarantees on build-operate-transfer
schemes, and/or large hydropower-related investments could negatively affect debt
sustainability and jeopardize poverty reduction efforts. The staff urged the authorities to
thoroughly review existing contracts for potential liabilities, and exercise caution when
evaluating new investment projects that carry an explicit or implicit government guarantee.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
23.
Over the past decade Cambodia has made considerable strides, achieving
sustained growth and poverty reduction, aided in part by the global upcycle. Generally
prudent policies have supported macroeconomic stability and enhanced credibility, while
collaboration with development partners has helped address capacity constraints, which at
times has held back reform efforts.
24.
However, over the past year, the economy has been buffeted by the global
recession, with contracting activity further weakening the banking sector. As the main
anchor to stability, a cautious fiscal policy response is required, since excessive spending,
larger deficits, and domestic financing could place downward pressure on the exchange rate,
raise inflation concerns, and weaken the external position in the context of high dollarization.
Given uncertain global prospects, policies should aim to protect vulnerable groups while
preserving macroeconomic stability and address the urgent need to strengthen the
banking sector.
25.
The current fiscal easing appears overly expansionary and insufficiently
targeted. Large increases in the wage bill will be difficult to roll back to make space for
needed expenditure in priority social sectors as well as operations and maintenance. The
domestic financing requirement should be eliminated in 2010 through a combination of
revenue and expenditure measures, spending should be re-prioritized, and the deficit placed
on a clear consolidation path over the medium term to safeguard debt sustainability in light
of potentially rising contingent liabilities. In the absence of policy tightening, the exchange
rate would need to be allowed to depreciate to protect international reserves. Continued gains
in PFM would improve policy effectiveness, while publication of comprehensive budget data
would increase accountability and transparency.
26.
The monetary stance is broadly appropriate, but conditions bear close watch in
view of the liquidity overhang and recovery prospects. Banks’ excess reserves, fueled by
rapid deposit growth but also reflecting weak credit demand, could reverse quickly and/or

20
invite weakened credit standards—each potentially elevating risks. Under current conditions,
a reduction in the reserve requirement is neither warranted nor desirable on monetary or
prudential grounds in light of relatively loose liquidity conditions and banks’ weak balance
sheets. Further efforts to strengthen liquidity monitoring and introduce new tradable
instruments should help deepen interbank activity and improve banks’ liquidity management.
However, effective monetary controls will require greater confidence in and use of the riel, as
well as a more flexible exchange rate arrangement. To this end, exchange market
intervention should be limited to smoothing volatility, which would help protect foreign
reserves, deepen the foreign exchange market, and facilitate external adjustment.
27.
The economic downturn and bursting of the property bubble have weakened
banks’ balance sheets and increased credit risks. While the NBC has taken commendable
actions, conducting prioritized onsite inspections and issuing supervisory letters to
noncompliant banks, NPLs continue to mount and profitability is being squeezed by the
combination of high funding costs and few lending opportunities. Strict enforcement of the
new asset classification regime, implementation of corrective action plans, and development
of a comprehensive bank restructuring framework are critical to strengthening banking
system solvency. Supervision capacity, including staffing, should be increased,
complemented by a temporary moratorium on new bank licensing, while care should be
taken to ensure new securities regulations are consistent with those governing other segments
of the financial system.
28.
A return to a path of high growth will require strong efforts to diversify the
production base, strengthen competitiveness, and improve the business climate,
especially in light of the more subdued global outlook and challenges from low-cost
regional producers. Reforms should aim at improving basic infrastructure and enhancing
labor skills, as well as expanding market access through trade commitments and reducing
the cost of doing business, including through streamlining investment approvals and
customs procedures.
29.
In view of the uncertain external environment, macroeconomic imbalances, and
systemic financial risks, staff will continue to monitor developments closely. Given the
lack of progress in resolving outstanding arrears to the Russian Federation and the United
States remains a major hurdle to formal program engagement, staff urge all parties to
demonstrate flexibility. Under any circumstances, the authorities should further carry out
their reform efforts, which the IMF will continue to support through intensive technical
assistance and policy dialogue.
30.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis 20091
Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and

Approved by Kalpana Kochhar and Dominique Desruelle (IMF)

October 30, 2009
This document presents the joint IMF-World Bank debt sustainability analysis (DSA) for
Cambodia using the Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF) for Low-Income Countries
(LICs).2 It shows that external debt burden indicators do not breach the relevant
policy-dependent indicative thresholds under the baseline scenario. However, the debt level
is sensitive to a number of standard bound tests.3 There are considerable downside risks to
the baseline scenario, given a continued building of external pressures in the face of weak
export performance and an expansionary fiscal stance, with possible reserve losses over the
medium term. An assessment of the impact of a continued expansionary fiscal stance on
external debt sustainability underscores the importance of fiscal adjustment over the near to
medium term. The results show Cambodia faces a moderate risk of debt distress.

The low-income country debt sustainability framework (LIC DSF) recognizes that better policies and
institutions allow countries to manage higher levels of debt, and thus the threshold levels for debt indicators are
policy dependent. Cambodia’s policies and institutions, as measured by the World Bank’s Country Policy and
Institutional Assessment (CPIA), averaged 3.22 over the past three years, placing it as a “weak performer.” The
relevant indicative thresholds for this category are: 30 percent for the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio, 100 percent
for the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio, 200 percent for the NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio, 15 percent for the debt
service-to-exports ratio, and 25 percent for the debt service-to-revenue ratio. These thresholds are applicable to
public and publicly-guaranteed external debt.

2
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Cambodia’s DSA indicates that the risk of debt distress remains moderate.
Under the baseline scenario, external debt burden indicators do not breach the relevant
indicative thresholds. However, in alternative scenarios and stress tests, the debt indicators
breach several indicative thresholds.
2.
Staffs have analyzed an additional scenario of a delay in fiscal adjustment in a
partial equilibrium setting. In the face of weak export performance and uncertain growth
prospects, the government could possibly maintain an accommodative fiscal stance.
However, given limits to domestic financing and to avoid pressure on reserves, this could
result in a large external financing requirement. In the event, external debt burden indicators
would breach several indicative thresholds.
II. BACKGROUND AND ASSUMPTIONS
3.
Cambodia’s external public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt stock was
around 25 percent of GDP in nominal terms and 20 percent in net present value (NPV)
terms at end-2008.4 Until last year, strong economic growth and favorable external
conditions contributed to a decline in debt ratios. With an expected contraction in
Cambodia’s economy and increased assistance from donors in the face of global recession in
2009, the stock of external PPG is projected to rise to 29 percent of GDP by year end.
Cambodia’s debt stock and debt service indicators are below the policy-based indicative
thresholds. The nominal debt stock in PV terms as a share of exports of goods and nonfactor
services and of government revenues is projected at 49 percent and 197 percent in 2009,
respectively.

Development Association (20 percent). China is currently the largest bilateral creditor,
accounting for about 63 percent of total bilateral disbursement in 2009. As new creditors
emerge and increase their presence in Cambodia, the government should ensure appropriate
concessionality from these lenders, given Cambodia’s development needs and its capacity to
service new debt. This further underscores the need for the authorities to strengthen the
capacity in debt management and ensure that new debt is contracted on a sustainable basis.

5.
The size of domestic public debt is currently small and negative on a net basis
due to government deposits. At end-2008, the stock of recorded domestic public debt was
equivalent to slightly less than 1 percent of GDP, while government deposits amounted to
about 6 percent of GDP. The relatively large fiscal deficit projected in 2009 is expected to be
financed, in part, by a significant drawdown in government deposits. Over the medium term,
assuming a return to a path of fiscal consolidation, government’s net domestic financing
requirement would be eliminated. The baseline scenario assumes that the authorities take
adjustment measures to reduce the deficit starting in 2010, which would lead to a
stabilization of the debt stock in the medium and long term.
6.
Cambodia remains in arrears to the Russian Federation and the United States.
Following a Paris Club agreement in 1995, Cambodia concluded agreements with France,
Germany, Italy, and Japan. Negotiations of outstanding debt obligations with the Russian
Federation and the United States are ongoing, with their status unchanged since the last DSA.
Currently, Cambodia is not servicing its debt with either of these creditors, and efforts to
conclude agreements with each under the framework of the Paris Club are required. Since
prospects for resolution are unclear, the current DSA assumes no restructuring in its baseline,
with arrears continuing to build up throughout the projection period. In measuring debt
levels, the DSA incorporates the negotiated debt stock for the Russian Federation
(US$457 million) and the agreed amount of total principal due for the United States
(US$162 million).5

5

For this DSA, staffs continue to apply the standard 70 percent discount to the nominal value of debt owed to
the Russian Federation.

7.
The main underlying macroeconomic assumptions are presented in Box 1. They
reflect the impact of the global recession and weakened economy, marked in Cambodia by
Box 1: Main Assumptions for the Baseline Scenario (2009–29)


Real GDP growth is projected at minus 2.7 percent in 2009, reflecting the impact of global recession,
with a sharp contraction in garment exports, construction activities, and tourism. Given uncertain prospects
for a global recovery and heavy export concentration in garments (nearly two-thirds of which go to the
United States), growth is expected to rebound modestly to 4.3 percent in 2010—far below the 9 percent
annual average during 2006–09. Growth is projected to rise to around 7 percent in 2011 as global and
domestic conditions improve, before stabilizing at 6–7 percent over the medium and longer term. Important
drivers of future growth will be new export opportunities in light manufactures and agribusiness, as well as
more expansive tourism activity. This in turn will depend on an improved investment climate as well as a
recovery in foreign direct investment (FDI) starting in 2010, following a sharp projected reduction in 2009
by nearly 30 percent from the previous year’s level owing to global financial conditions. Over the longer
term, FDI is expected to be sustained at around 5–6 percent of GDP a year, leading to stronger export
growth and supported by stable macroeconomic conditions.



The external current account deficit (including official transfers) is projected to improve in 2009 to
5½ percent of GDP, compared to 10½ percent in 2008, as sharp declines in garment exports and tourism
receipts are more than offset by falling import demand and lower oil prices. The trade deficit is expected
to widen in 2010 and 2011 as garment export demand remains sluggish initially, but with constructionand consumer-related imports rising sharply and higher oil prices also affecting import levels. The
macroeconomic framework incorporates recent projects in the power sector (some of which are already
underway), which increases imports and FDI in the near term. Over the longer term, the current account
deficit is expected to settle in the range of 5–6 percent of GDP a year. Official assistance (grants and
loans) would decline gradually as a share of GDP, while FDI and other private inflows would rise
gradually. The baseline scenario also assumes that an increasing but moderate level of external borrowing
would be on less concessional terms, including from some bilateral creditors (the average grant element
is assumed to be some 20 percentage points lower starting in the medium term than in the previous DSA,
mostly reflecting a lower discount rate). Gross official reserves, which are expected to be around US$2.2
billion (3.5 months of next year’s imports) at end-2009, would decline slowly through 2012 to US$1.9
billion (2.4 months of imports) before gradually increasing with more stable import demand to
the equivalent of around three months over the longer term.



Macroeconomic stability is underpinned by resumption of a more prudent fiscal stance from 2010
onward While fiscal easing was an appropriate policy response to the slowdown in 2009, very large
increases in wage and allowances are expected to contribute to a widening of the overall fiscal deficit
(excluding grants) to around 6.7 percent of GDP in 2009, compared to 2.8 percent in 2008. Thereafter, the
deficit is projected to decline gradually to around 3.4 percent by 2014. Revenue would rise to around 14½
percent of GDP by 2014 from a broadening of the tax base, further administrative improvements, and
buoyancy from the projected recovery, with more moderate increases thereafter. Grants are projected to
decline as a share of GDP from around 3 percent in recent years to 2 percent by 2020. Expenditure would
decline to slightly below 18 percent by 2014, from nearly 19 percent in 2009, with some slowing in the
growth of recurrent spending and a return of capital spending to the range of 6‒6½ percent of GDP under
more normal growth conditions.

5
a significant reduction in garment export, construction, and tourism activities in 2009.
Prospects for a rapid recovery are uncertain, with only a modest growth rebound expected
over the near term. Inflation is expected to remain moderately low, predicated on relatively
stable commodity prices. The development of extractive industries is not factored into the
baseline, given uncertainties about the timing and impact of new oil, gas, and mineral
production. Additional resources from the IMF’s new SDR allocations made in 2009 are
presumed to remain locked in, reflecting the need for Cambodia to build its reserve position
and protect against vulnerabilities arising from the global financial crisis.
8.
Large contingent liabilities exist in several areas that bear close watch, given the
potential burden on external and public debt. Cambodia has signed several build-operatetransfer (BOT) projects—mainly related to new projects in the power sector. Possible
contingent liabilities arising from these types of contracts are not incorporated in this DSA
due to lack of detailed information on the scope and terms of these agreements. While
assurances have been given that no explicit government guarantees have been provided,
greater transparency is needed in this area to facilitate the monitoring of these potential
quasi-fiscal liabilities and mitigation of any associated fiscal risks. In view of Cambodia’s
need for major infrastructure investment and given limited debt service capacity, the
authorities should monitor these types of commitments closely and transparently, including
developing and maintaining an inventory of all concessions granted and building and
improving capacity to analyze the impact of contingent liabilities on debt sustainability,
should they arise. Other contingent liabilities could arise if the mitigation of risks in the
banking sector necessitated government guarantees.
III. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
9.
All external debt indicators remain below the policy-dependent debt burden
thresholds under the baseline scenario, but thresholds are breached under some of the
standard bound tests.6 The main results of the external DSA are as follows:


6

Under the baseline scenario, which assumes a return to a path of fiscal consolidation
in 2010, the NPV of external debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to remain below the
30 percent indicative threshold through 2029 (Table 1a) under the baseline scenario.
However, in two bound tests, the indicative thresholds are breached for five years or
more before declining for the rest of the projection period, specifically for (i) net
nondebt creating flows at the historical average minus one standard deviation in

Historical averages are generally inadequate as a basis for generating stress tests and alternative scenarios for
Cambodia because the post-conflict period between 1995 and 2005 was characterized by rapid catch-up growth
from a very low base. Therefore, staffs have adjusted the historical averages to exclude data prior to 2000 but to
include those in 2009, which results in a set of more severe but realistic stress tests.

6
2010‒11, and (ii) a one-time 30 percent nominal depreciation of the Cambodian riel
vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar relative to the baseline in 2010 (Table 1b and Figure 1).


The NPV of external debt-to-revenue ratio remains below the threshold for all years
in the baseline scenario, declining from 197 percent in 2009 to 164 percent by 2014,
and further decreasing over the long term. However, thresholds are breached in five
out of six standard bound tests. Under the two above-mentioned bound tests, the NPV
of debt-to-revenue ratio exceeds the 200 percent threshold for more than five years.
The thresholds are also breached for five years or longer under the combination of
bound tests using one-half standard deviation shocks.



The debt service-to-exports and debt service-to-revenue ratios stay well below the
indicative threshold throughout the entire projection period, as existing debts are
highly concessional.

10.
However, the assumed fiscal consolidation is far from assured, with failure to
undertake adjustment posing significant risks to macroeconomic stability. In recent
years, Cambodia has maintained a prudent fiscal stance, characterized by relatively low fiscal
deficits financed largely through external resources. Under these conditions, the exchange
rate has remained stable vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. Starting in 2009 and in response to effects
of the global recession, the government adopted a more accommodative fiscal stance, which
is in part expected to be financed domestically, mainly through a drawdown in government
deposits. Such a sizable injection of riel liquidity could put pressure on both domestic prices
and the exchange rate, which could lead to possible reserve losses, increasing Cambodia’s
vulnerability. The baseline assumes a return to a more prudent fiscal stance by 2010,
characterized by a moderate reduction in the overall fiscal deficit and no net domestic
financing requirement.
11.
As an additional alternative scenario, this DSA considers the impact on debt
sustainability of a delay in fiscal adjustment in a partial equilibrium setting. Under this
scenario, the level of primary balance is assumed to remain at the projected level in 2009
(minus 4 percent of GDP) for the period 2010–12 (i.e., no fiscal adjustment), and then
gradually return to the baseline level by 2017. Owing to a limited amount of government
deposits and lack of capacity to issue domestic debt, the government would be expected to
rely largely on additional external financing. In the event, the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio
would exceed the indicative threshold for five years, and the debt-to-revenue ratio would
breach the threshold for six years (see Table 1b).
12.
In staffs’ view, Cambodia faces a moderate risk of debt distress. This assessment
is based not only on the bound tests and an additional scenario of delayed fiscal
consolidation, but also on the uncertainty related to implicit contingent liabilities. Moreover,
the impact of delaying policy adjustment could be much more severe if possible exchange
rate and inflationary pressures resulting from higher government spending and larger fiscal

7
deficits are fully taken into account. Under these circumstances, the potential loss in
competitiveness would point to the need for greater exchange rate flexibility.
IV. PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
13.
Given that most public debt is external, the dynamics of public debt behave
similarly to those of external debt in the DSF. The nominal stock of public debt,
equivalent to 26 percent of GDP at end-2008, is expected to rise to 30 percent by end-2009
(Table 2a and Figure 2), reflecting the accommodative fiscal stance. Under the baseline, it
would begin to decline as a share of GDP in 2011, as the DSA is based on current policies,
which at present do not anticipate issuance of domestic debt.


The NPV of public sector debt-to-GDP ratio―21 percent at end-2008―would rise to
around 25 percent by 2009 and further in 2010, before gradually declining to
14 percent by 2029 (Table 2b).



The NPV of public debt-to-revenue ratio (inclusive of grants), which is estimated to
be 138 percent in 2008, would decline to 74 percent by 2029.



The debt service-to-revenue ratio remains low in most scenarios for the entire
projection period under the baseline.

14.
Public debt ratios are sensitive to continued accommodative fiscal stance and a
permanent growth shock. Under two of the alternative scenarios—the primary balance
unchanged from 2009 and the GDP growth permanently lower by one percentage point—the
level of public debt (as a share of GDP) continues to rise over the projection period, reaching
54 percent and 39 percent, by 2029. Under the latter scenario, the debt service-to-revenue
ratio would reach nearly 30 percent by 2029. Bound tests also reveal sensitivity of public
debt ratios to permanently lower growth, a one-time 30 percent real depreciation, and a 10
percent increase in other debt creating flows. The last is particularly relevant given the
potential risks posed by implicit contingent liabilities.
V. CONCLUSION
15.
Staffs conclude that Cambodia faces a moderate risk of debt distress. While no
thresholds are breached under the baseline scenario, some are breached under the standard
stress tests and alternative scenarios. Moreover, an additional scenario reflecting delayed
fiscal adjustment indicates that external debt indicators could exceed indicative thresholds.
This outlook could be further weakened in the event actual liabilities arise from contingent
obligations, mainly those related to infrastructure development, which further underscores
the rationale for the current classification of risk.
16.
Given the uncertainty about near-to medium-term prospects, staffs urge the
Royal Government of Cambodia to continue pursuing a sound strategy for public debt

8
management. Careful consideration is needed in advance of possibly contracting less
concessional loans and providing direct and indirect government guarantees, as they could
impair sustainability, in particular if the revenue base remains low and institutions weak.
Stronger capacity in debt management is an essential prerequisite for less concessional
borrowing. To this end, a full accounting of all commitments, including from newly
emerging creditors, and better monitoring of contingent liabilities will be necessary to ensure
debt sustainability. Moreover, given the high dollarization of economy and lack of domestic
debt instruments, the DSA points to the need for an exchange rate policy that is consistent
with the fiscal stance. Staffs also encourage the authorities to continue seeking agreements to
resolve outstanding arrears.

1/ The most extreme stress test is the test that yields the highest ratio in 2011. In figures b to e, it
corresponds to net non-debt creating flows at historical average minus one standard deviation in
2010–11; in figure f, a one time 30 percent nominal depreciation relative to baseline in 2010.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections, also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), noninterest current account in percent of GDP, and nondebt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline, while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative:

As part of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), the IMF Executive Board on January 5,
2006 approved relief on 100 percent of debt incurred by Cambodia to the IMF before January 1,
2005. This resulted in the forgiving of all of Cambodia’s outstanding debt to the IMF, a total of
SDR 56.8 million (about US$82 million). The authorities intend to spend the resources over a
number of years, initially on rural irrigation projects. The National Bank of Cambodia (NBC)
transferred the full MDRI proceeds to the Ministry of Economy and Finance effective March 2006.

3
VIII.

Safeguards Assessment:

Under the IMF’s safeguards assessment policy, the NBC was subject to a full safeguards
assessment with respect to a possible successor PRGF arrangement. The assessment was
completed in March 2004; it identified certain weaknesses, mostly in the area of internal audit
and control and made appropriate recommendations. A 2009 voluntary update assessment is
in progress.
IX.

Exchange Rate Arrangement and Payments System:

Cambodia’s exchange regime is classified as floating. The official exchange rate, which is
expressed in riels per U.S. dollar, applies to all official external transactions conducted by the
central government and state enterprises and is used for accounting purposes by the NBC. It is
determined by the foreign exchange market, with the official rate adjusted to be within 1 percent
of the market rate on a daily basis.
Cambodia accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 on January 1, 2002.
Cambodia maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments
and transfers for current international transactions.
X.

Article IV Consultation:

Cambodia is subject to the provisions on consultation cycles approved on July 15, 2002. The
last Article IV consultation discussions were held in Phnom Penh during October 23–
November 7, 2008. The Executive Board discussed the staff report (CR/09/47) and concluded
the consultation on January 16, 2009.
XI.

Technical Assistance:

Technical assistance is currently focused on bank supervision, monetary operations, public
financial management, customs administration, and macro-financial statistics. Delivery is through
a resident advisor at the NBC, peripatetic experts, and short-term visits from headquarters.
XI.

Resident Representative:

The resident representative office was closed in October 1997 and re-opened in October 1999.
Mr. John Nelmes, the current Resident Representative, assumed the post in November 2005.

ANNEX II. CAMBODIA: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP1
(As of October 2009)
I. OVERVIEW
The World Bank Group’s 2005–08 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) stresses the need to
improve governance in order to maximize the impact of development efforts. The CAS
activities are intended to contribute to six objectives, which are clustered under two
over-arching pillars. In May 2008, the CAS period was extended until 2011 so that the World
Bank and other development partners could better align their support around the next
National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP). The approach and objectives of the original
CAS will be maintained throughout the extended CAS period.
Activities under Pillar 1 are intended to help implement improvements in governance that
are needed if Cambodia is to meet the Cambodia Millennium Development Goals (CMDGs).
To this end, the CAS establishes four objectives: (i) promote private sector development for
poverty reduction; (ii) improve natural resources management; (iii) improve service delivery
and public financial management; and (iv) support decentralization and promote citizens’
partnerships for better governance. These four objectives were chosen because of their
importance for growth and poverty reduction and the strong ownership and leadership from
the Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC). The selection was also informed by lessons
from successes and failures in past strategies, and by the comparative advantage of
development partners.
Pillar 2 of the CAS allocates World Bank resources to supporting the strategy development
and investments needed to attain the CMDGs. To these ends, the CAS has two other
objectives. First, the Bank Group will encourage the emergence of poverty-focused
approaches in the formulation and implementation of public policy by supporting the NSDP
2006–10. Second, where there are clear gaps in critical infrastructure and human
development sub-sectors, the Bank Group will support the emergence of a nationally-owned
vision and strategy through the provision of analytical and investment services.
II. PILLAR 1: REMOVING THE GOVERNANCE CONSTRAINTS TO ATTAINING THE CMDGS
A. Private Sector Development (PSD)
Country Progress: Progress in this area has been mixed. On the trade facilitation front, there
has been steady movement toward a customs automation program (ASYCUDA), with adoption
of the Single Administrative Document (SAD) import/export declaration format and a pilot test

1

Prepared by World Bank staff.

5
of the automated customs procedures, which commenced in Sihanoukville in May 2008 (with
nationwide roll-out scheduled in 2009). The Law on Customs, which is instrumental to customs
reforms and to the implementation of ASYCUDA, was passed by the National Assembly in
2007. A risk management strategy has been adopted and is being implemented. Some progress
has also been made on developing Special Economic Zones. With respect to improving the
legal framework for investment and PSD, the Law on Commercial Arbitration and the Law on
Concessions were passed by the National Assembly in March 2006 and September 2007,
respectively, but implementation of these laws has lagged.
Role of the World Bank Group: The focus of the Bank Group’s PSD program in Cambodia is
on supporting investment climate development through trade facilitation and improving the
legal framework for investment. Policy reforms in both of these areas have been supported
through the first in the series of Poverty Reduction and Growth Operations (PRGO)
approved in July 2007. The 2005 Trade Facilitation and Competitiveness Project is helping
improve Cambodia’s competitiveness by streamlining import/export formalities and reducing
the costs of trade-related activities. The IFC’s Mekong PSD Facility (MPDF) prepared the
Cambodian Provincial Business Environment Scorecards in 10 provinces, and the Bank
Group has recently started a new Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) to monitor results
since the 2004 ICA, identify new issues, and design future support. The Bank Group has also
led the Technical Working Group (TWG) on PSD, supported the Government/Private Sector
Forum, and participated actively in the dialogue on private sector issues among the RGC,
donors, and private sector.
B. Natural Resources Management (NRM)
Country Progress: Progress in this area has been satisfactory, but a number of concerns
remain. Subdecrees on State Land Management and on Economic Land Concessions (ELCs)
have been adopted, including provisions for reviewing and canceling nonperforming
economic land concessions and assigning the land for use as social land concessions for the
poor. The RGC has distributed more than 800,000 titles and has also started a dialogue on
titling of communally-owned land by indigenous people. Actions were also taken to
strengthen systems for forestry management, including community-based forest activities,
with the RGC recently issuing a new Protected Areas Law to provide greater clarity on
institutional roles, responsibilities, and obligations. However, transparency in the issuance of
ELCs still needs to be improved, and the social land concessions program needs to be
accelerated. Implementation of the laws governing access and title to natural resources has
also been slow, and governance weaknesses in the forestry sector are still a major concern to
all stakeholders.
Role of the World Bank Group: To better integrate its efforts across land, forestry, and
biodiversity conservation, the World Bank has developed an NRM framework that seeks to
summarize the main challenges and required actions to move the overall agenda forward.

6
This framework has been used in the Bank’s engagement with the TWGs on land,
agriculture, poverty, environment, and water. Policy reforms in NRM are being supported
through additional analytical and advisory activities (AAA) (including an agrarian structures
study and an environment monitor), the PRGOs, and a range of investment and technical
support operations. A Japan Social Development Fund Grant has been mobilized to foster
NGO, local community, and RGC capacity to expand community forestry activities. Finally,
in 2008, the Land Allocation for Social and Economic Development project was adopted to
support the implementation of the RGC’s Social Land Concession strategy.
C. Public Financial Management (PFM)
Country Progress: Progress in this area has been satisfactory. Good progress has been made
in implementing improved arrangements for budget formulation, budget classification, cash
and bank account management, financial control, and transaction management. Procurement
responsibility has been increasingly deconcentrated to line agencies, and an improved
procurement subdecree and the supporting implementing rules and regulations have been
adopted, incorporating numerous measures for increasing competition, transparency, and
accountability in the procurement process. This has contributed to a strengthening of the
overall PFM system, with the latest indicators showing aggregate actual expenditures to be
within 5 percent of the budget, revenues continuing to grow (from 10 percent in FY2009 to
an estimated 12 percent of GDP in FY2008), and arrears being largely eliminated. An
innovative merit-based pay initiative (MBPI) was implemented in the Ministry of Economy
and Finance to tackle the issues of civil service incentives, performance, and capacity. This
system is now being extended progressively to all development partner-financed strategic
reforms with a view to eliminating current distortionary salary supplement schemes,
harmonizing RGC and partner approaches to incentives, and beginning to address the
broader needs for civil service reform.
Role of World Bank Group: The World Bank has worked closely with the RGC and helped
coordinate the 13 development partners in the TWG on PFM in the design and implementation
of the RGC’s PFM Reform Program (PFMRP). The Bank has also supported the program
through the PRGO as well as the PFM Accountability Project. The PFMRP is the first
operation to support a sector-wide approach in Cambodia and has been recognized as a model
of aid effectiveness globally. The Bank has also initiated a dialogue on oil revenue
management, engaged civil society in the dialogue on PFM, and assisted the RGC in adopting
and extending the MBPI. Additional analytical and advisory activities on public expenditure
tracking surveys (PETS) in education and health sectors as well as civil service reform for
teachers have been completed, and grants from trust funds are supporting strengthened
National Assembly oversight of the budget.

7
D. Decentralization and Accountability
Country Progress: Progress in this area has been considerable. In line with the goal of
decentralizing resources to local government units, average funds to communes/sangkats are
projected to double by 2010. A second round of commune/sangkat council elections in 2007
has strengthened the foundation for enhanced accountability at the local level. The Ministry
of Interior has successfully piloted “One Window Service” and a District Ombudsman’s
office to enhance local governance. After some delay, the National Assembly adopted the
Organic Laws on Decentralization and Deconcentration in April 2008. However, progress on
improving access to information, including drafting of an access to information law, has been
delayed, and civil society involvement in policy-making processes is developing slowly, as
there is still insufficient constructive engagement with the RGC.
Role of the World Bank Group: The Bank has provided substantial support for
decentralization through the Rural Investment and Local Governance Project. The Bank has
also conducted a series of studies on justice for the poor, as well as a village level and
dispute resolution study. In addition, it has provided advice through the TWG on the RGC’s
Decentralization Policy and Strategy and mobilized grant finance to support governmentcivil society consultations on the decentralization strategy as well as to build the capacity of
civil society on social accountability.
III. PILLAR 2: SUPPORTING STRATEGY AND INVESTMENTS TO ATTAIN THE CMDGS
A. Formulation and Implementation of the NSDP, 2006–10
Country Progress: Progress toward this objective has been impressive. The RGC adopted the
NSDP in 2006, replacing previous donor-driven plans with a single national development
strategy. The TWG for Planning and Poverty Reduction provides a forum for regular
dialogue between the RGC, development partners, and civil society on the implementation of
the NSDP. Over the last two years, the Ministry of Planning (MoP) has developed (with
support from the TWG) a strategic plan to refocus the ministry and help build its capacity to
coordinate the implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of the NSDP. The TWG has also
provided the forum for shifting external support toward a Ministry-wide, program-based
approach, by which development partners supporting the MoP will coordinate their
assistance behind the NSDP. On gender equality, there have also been improvements,
including an increase in female representation in Commune Councils from 8 percent to
15 percent following the 2007 elections.
Role of the World Bank Group: The Bank, together with other development partners, has
provided technical and financial support to the MoP for the formulation and implementation of
the NSDP, with the Bank and UNDP serving as development partner co-facilitators of the
TWG. In addition to direct support to RGC institutions and processes related to the NSDP, the
Bank has helped to improve the knowledge base for policymakers and other stakeholders

8
through the 2006 Poverty Assessment and the 2007 Sharing Growth: Equity and Development
Report. The Bank has also provided support to the Ministry of Women’s and Veterans’ Affairs
through an Institutional Development Fund grant, which funded a Gender Budgeting Project,
as well as a number of smaller stand-alone grants for various outreach, training, and advocacy
activities, including study tours for women in leadership, a regional workshop on
mainstreaming gender in aid effectiveness, and local level dissemination activities.
B. Analytical and Investment Support for Achieving the CMDGs–Human
Development and Infrastructure
Country Progress: Progress toward CAS outcomes has been impressive. In both the social and
infrastructure sectors, significant progress has been made toward government-owned strategies
around which donors can coordinate their financial and technical support. Improvements have
also been made in most human development outcomes such as infant mortality rate, fertility
rate, HIV prevalence rates, and school enrollment rates. There has been greater access to and
utilization of health, education, and infrastructure services, and better targeting of health and
education subsidies. More resources have been allocated to interventions in priority sectors,
such as to reducing child and maternal mortality. Access to education and health, including by
disadvantaged/vulnerable communities, has expanded, and the perception of service delivery in
health and education among users of these services has improved. Nevertheless, other
indicators such as maternal mortality or drop-out rates are lagging.
Role of the World Bank Group: The World Bank has continued to provide support for the
development and implementation of effective strategies in the social sectors through the
ongoing Health Sector Support and Education Sector Support Projects, as well as through
participation in the TWGs. In the health sector, a major step toward a sector-wide approach
was taken in 2008 to support the new RGC health sector strategy in partnership with AusAid,
DFID, France, UNFPA, and UNICEF. In the education sector, support from the Education
For All Fast Track Initiative Catalytic Fund was approved in 2008. As mentioned previously,
the Bank has also undertaken PETS in health and education to promote PFM reforms in these
sectors, and has supported additional analytical work in education.
In infrastructure, the Bank has helped in the development of sub-sector strategies through a
range of AAA (Energy Sector Strategy Review, Transport Sector Update, Implementation
Strategy for Urban Water Supply Policy, and briefing notes on oil and gas sector policy issues)
as well as through participation in the TWG. The Bank has also engaged in a number of
investment projects that have had a high development impact for the intended beneficiaries.

9
IV. LENDING OPERATIONS AND NON-LENDING INSTRUMENTS
Proactive portfolio management continues to be a very high priority for the Bank Group.
Following the 2004–05 Fiduciary Review (carried out in partnership with the RGC), the
World Bank's Institutional Integrity Department (INT) undertook separate investigations in
2005–06. The INT investigations substantiated allegations of corruption, collusion, and
fraudulent practices on several contracts under seven projects for which “misprocurement”
was declared in June 2006. As a result, the Bank temporarily suspended disbursements under
three projects and established action plans for the concerned government agencies to execute
in order to lift the suspensions.2 These action plans were completed in January 2007, and the
Bank lifted the suspensions on all three projects in February 2007.
The RGC and the Bank have established a number of preventive and oversight measures to
mitigate fiduciary risks in Bank-financed projects. One important measure has been the use
of anti-corruption action plans knowing Good Governance Frameworks (GGFs). The
GGFs—adopted for all ongoing and future Bank-financed projects—include measures to
strengthen procurement procedures, financial management processes, staff conduct,
complaint mechanisms, disclosure, and internal controls. Early implementation reviews of
the GGFs indicate an increasing level of implementation during this initial period. Another
important measure is the use of an International Procurement Agent (IPA) since December
2007 for all Bank-financed projects. Finally, the Bank is also providing technical support to
the RGC to reinforce its own ability to identify and remedy fraud and corruption problems.
The disbursement ratio in FY09—at 16.1 percent—was low mainly due to procurement
delays as a result of the IPA.
Nonlending instruments and operations (credits and grants) are described in Tables 1 and 2.

2

Suspension is a remedial measure available under all World Bank legal agreements. It can be exercised by the
Bank in a number of situations, including when the Borrower is not fulfilling its obligations under the legal
agreement. Suspension entails a temporary freeze on the Bank’s financing of implementation, but does not mean
that the Bank withdraws from the project. Rather, the Bank steps up its supervision, dialogue, and other
activities to help the government in its efforts to meet the conditions for lifting the suspension.

ANNEX III. CAMBODIA: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of September 2009)
From 1992 through September 30, 2009, the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) approved
$1,145.8 million including 45 loan projects of $1,007.7 million with low interest, and
11 Asian Development Fund (ADF) grants of $138.1 million ($42 million in 2005;
$7.8 million in 2006; $37 million in 2007; $30 million in 2008; and $21 million in 2009) to
Cambodia for structural reform programs. To date, 31 loan projects for a total of
$711.3 million have been completed.
The sector composition and loan/grant amounts of the remaining active portfolio as of
September 30, 2009 are: (i) agriculture and natural resources $72.7 million; (ii) education
$52.1 million; (iii) energy $64.3 million; (iv) health, nutrition, and social protection
$29.0 million; (v) industry and trade $15.6 million; (vi) law, economic management, and
public policy $20.6 million; (vii) multi-sector $20.0 million; (viii) transport and
communication $121.3 million; and (ix) water supply, sanitation, and waste management
$39.0 million.
The AsDB’s overarching goal in Cambodia is sustainable poverty reduction. The AsDB’s
Country Strategy and Program (CSP 2005–09) mid-term review (MTR), finalized in
August 2007, concluded that the strategic thrust of the AsDB in Cambodia remains
appropriately targeted on poverty reduction through broad-based private sector-led growth,
inclusive social development, and stronger governance for sustainable development. The
AsDB’s proposed Country Operations Business Plan 2008–10 (COBP) strongly focuses on
the priority areas of agricultural and rural development, private sector development,
governance and capacity development, and the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS).
Interventions in agricultural and rural development focus around the Tonle Sap basin area
and are geared to improving livelihoods of the poor through management of water resources
and irrigation assets, as well as agriculture extension services and crop diversification;
expanding the connectivity internally between rural roads and the provincial and national
network, and externally with emerging subregional transport corridors; fostering the
development of smallholder agricultural producers; and widening access for the poorest to
rural water supply and sanitation while strengthening local community management capacity.
In the area of private sector development, the AsDB supports improvements in
competitiveness by helping reduce border-related costs and distortions; enhancing domestic
and external trade facilitation, including through promoting compliance with sanitary and
phytosanitary standards; and fostering improved and cheaper access to information and
communication technology (ICT). Later interventions would be more focused on improving
the trade facilitation and logistics links to the subregion as systems and procedures become
more developed and integrated. Supporting financial sector interventions are aimed at

13
improving financial intermediation, including the outreach of microfinance institutions
(MFIs) and reducing the cost of finance in rural areas; enhancing the resilience of the
financial sector; promoting good governance; and improving financial sector efficiency.
Education-related interventions are aimed at enhancing technical and vocational education
training to achieve a closer match between the skills of a rapidly growing and young rural
labor force and emerging employment opportunities. There is also a gradual increase in
private sector operations, beginning with interventions to expand trade and access to rural
finance, including proposed nonrecourse interventions by the AsDB’s Private Sector
Department to guarantee trade financing, equity investment in one or more private funds to
help finance them with committed capital, and extended MFI reach in rural areas. Other
infrastructure loans or investment opportunities are being sought, including in the areas of
power transmission.
With respect to governance and capacity building, the COBP includes a long-term
programmatic approach to public financial management (PFM) reform with interventions to
underpin the rolling out of PFM to rural development line ministries (support to financial
management and reporting and development of internal audit capacities in these ministries)
and to strengthen of the audit capacity of the National Audit Authority. At the same time, the
AsDB will also promote good governance through support to the government-led
decentralization and deconcentration reform, namely through support to functional
assignments linked to fiscal needs, capacity development for decentralized institutions, and a
provision for decentralized infrastructure services deliveries. AsDB interventions in PFM for
rural development and AsDB sector interventions will reinforce decentralization and
deconcentration reform particularly in functional assignments and
expenditures responsibilities.

ANNEX IV. CAMBODIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of October 26, 2009
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. Extensive technical assistance (TA) has been provided by the
IMF, UNDP, Asian Development Bank, and World Bank, as well as from bilateral partners (namely Japan and Sweden),
leading to substantial capacity improvements in compiling and reporting macroeconomic statistics. However, various
shortcomings in macroeconomic data still hamper timely and comprehensive analysis.
National Accounts: The National Institute of Statistics is leading efforts to improve the consistency of national accounts
statistics with the United Nations’ System of National Accounts 1993, to expand the range of annual national account
aggregates, and to produce a quarterly national accounts series since June 2005, with IMF TA. However, the quality of GDP
estimates remains hampered by the lack of comprehensive and reliable source data on a production and expenditure basis, in
part stemming from the need to address resource constraints and improve data collection techniques.
Price statistics: A new consumer price index (CPI) series was introduced starting in January 2009. However, geographical
coverage of the series is limited to Phnom Penh. Statistics Sweden is currently providing TA on price statistics, including on
compiling a production price index (PPI).
Government finance statistics: The Ministry of Finance and Economy began implementing reforms to the government
accounting system and budgetary nomenclature in 2007 based on the Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2001,
with IMF TA. In addition, several STA missions have assisted with GFS compilation procedures within the GSFM 2001
framework. IMF TA in April 2008 assisted with establishing a bridge between the government’s new chart of accounts (COA)
and the GSFM 2001 classifications so that accounting records can be used as source data in compiling GFS. However, use and
coverage of the COA has been limited and not fully integrated to activities such as the disbursement of external loans and
grants, the government’s budget reserve fund, and capital expenditures.
Monetary and financial statistics: The National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) compiles the sectoral balance sheet and survey
for the central bank and other depository institutions in accordance with the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual.
Since August 2005, the NBC has reported monthly monetary and financial statistics to STA using the Standardized Report
Forms. The NBC compiles monthly financial soundness indicators, but data are published irregularly.
External sector statistics: Despite recent improvements, more work is needed to improve balance of payments statistics.
Customs data have substantial coverage and valuation problems arising from the use of reference prices and limited recording
of nondutiable imports, underreporting of re-exports, and weaknesses in customs controls. Enterprise transactions, such as
payment for imported services, income payments, and portfolio investment abroad are excluded or underreported. Foreign
direct investment, which is believed to be large, relies excessively on approvals. Gaps exist in external debt statistics, in
particular on the stock of public and publicly-guaranteed debt by maturity, on bilateral donor disbursements, and on external
debt service.

II. Data Standards and Quality
Cambodia participates in the IMF’s General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS).

No data ROSC are available.

III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
Cambodia sends regular data reports to STA for publication.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
November 18, 2009
1.
This statement provides information on macroeconomic and policy developments
that has become available since the staff report was circulated to the Executive Board on
November 2, 2009. This information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
Macroeconomic developments
2.
Inflation performance is in line with staff’s outlook, with the headline rate at
6 percent (year-to-date) in October. Food prices—a main driver—declined slightly last
month due to seasonal factors.
3.
Gross foreign reserves rose slightly in October to around US$2.2 billion at endmonth (3.6 months of next year’s imports), due mainly to gold valuation effects. Reversing
the recent trend, the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) was a small net purchaser of foreign
exchange in October (latest available data), with the riel-U.S. dollar exchange rate stable.
4.
Fiscal performance through September 2009 suggests the primary and current
balances could be slightly less favorable than anticipated for the year as a whole. On
revenue, value-added tax collections show signs of lagging, although seasonal demand
toward year-end could provide a lift. On expenditure, externally-financed capital spending
also is running below expectations, but much of this is likely due to reporting lags.
5.
Monetary conditions remain lax, but the pace of credit expansion continues to
slow, as expected. Broad money growth reached about 19 percent (y/y) in September, driven
by a nearly US$100 million increase that month in foreign currency deposits. Credit growth
was 3½ percent (y/y) in September, with banks continuing to accumulate excess reserves at
the NBC—now equivalent to one-third of the deposit base.
2010 budget
6.
A draft 2010 budget was approved on October 28 by the Council of Ministers,
with an overall deficit target equivalent to 5.3 percent of GDP. Final approval is expected
by the National Assembly in December. Under the draft budget, the domestic financing
requirement is around 0.7 percent of GDP—larger than recommended (see table below).
While few budget details have been published with regard to new revenue and expenditure
measures, summary highlights are as follows:


Total revenue is targeted at 12.3 percent of GDP, below staff’s baseline outlook
and compared to an expected outturn of 12.0 percent in 2009. Leading the way are
increases in direct taxes, with budgeted collections about 0.3 percent of GDP higher
than this year’s expected outcome. Indirect taxes are unchanged (as a share of GDP),

2
despite recent administrative improvements to customs procedures and collections
and staff’s projected recovery in import demand.


Total expenditure stands at 17.6 percent of GDP, significantly lower than staff’s
baseline, and compared to 18.8 percent projected for 2009. Externally-financed
capital spending is about one percentage point of GDP lower than the expected
outturn in 2009. However, the budget outlook may not fully reflect new donor
commitments, including recently announced plans by China and Korea to increase
project loans. Current spending is about 0.2 percentage points of GDP lower; the
reduction is concentrated on wages and allowances, including limits on hiring,
promotions, and pay incentive schemes.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation
with Cambodia
On November 18, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Cambodia. 1
Background
Following a decade of high economic growth (8 percent per year on average) and significant
poverty reduction, Cambodia’s economy has been hard hit by the global crisis. Real GDP is
contracting as key sectors falter—export and tourism receipts have fallen off sharply, reflecting
a narrow production base, high concentration of exports, and softening external demand, while
lower foreign inflows have contributed to a contraction in construction activity. Falling
agricultural commodity prices have depressed rural incomes. On the other hand, plunging
imports have led to a narrowing of the current account deficit, and inflation has declined sharply.
Despite banks having no direct exposure to toxic assets abroad, the slowdown has taken a toll
on Cambodia’s banking sector. Contracting economic activity and declining property prices
have exacerbated strains caused by weak risk management, earlier supervisory lapses, and
excessive credit growth. As in other countries, credit risks and nonperforming loans at banks
are rising, while profits are being compressed by a lack of lending opportunities.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm."

2
In response to the slowdown, policies have been eased significantly. Based on performance to
date, the overall fiscal deficit is on path to widen sharply to around 6¾ percent of GDP in 2009,
against an official target of 4¼ percent and an estimated outturn of 2¾ percent in 2008, despite
revenues remaining on target. On the monetary front, a reduction in the reserve requirement
early in the year and strong deposit growth has eased liquidity pressures. However, higher fiscal
spending and reduced foreign currency inflows in the context of high dollarization has resulted
in downward pressure on the riel.
Despite these measures, growth in 2009 is expected to be negative 2¾ percent, with only a
modest bounce back in 2010 to positive 4¼ percent as garment exports, tourism, and
construction stage an modest rebound. Notwithstanding a moderate impact from Typhoon
Ketsana, good harvests are expected this year. Inflation is expected to rise to around 5 percent
(year-on-year) by end-2009 as base effects dissipate, ticking up to about 6 percent by end2010, due to a mix of higher oil prices and relatively accommodative policies.
The current account deficit is expected to narrow in 2009 to around 5½ percent of GDP as lower
import demand and fuel prices more than offset sharply smaller export (led by garments) and
tourism receipts. As the recovery starts to kick in, these trends would reverse, raising the deficit
to around 11 percent of GDP in 2010 as a recovery in export lags. Gross official reserves
(inclusive of the IMF’s allocations of special drawing rights of SDR 68.5 million—about US$109
million) are expected to stay broadly stable in 2009 (around US$2.1 billion, 3.5 months of
imports), falling modestly in 2010, as loose fiscal policy and the widening current account deficit
more than offset an expected pickup in official and foreign direct investment inflows.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that the global recession has contributed to a sizable contraction in
economic activity, after nearly a decade of strong growth and poverty reduction. Together with
the sharp decline in property prices, the recession has further weakened bank balance sheets.
As the economy recovers, immediate priorities include safeguarding macroeconomic stability
and reinforcing the banking system.
Directors noted that, owing to high dollarization, fiscal policy should continue to anchor
macroeconomic stability, backed by appropriately supportive monetary conditions. Tightening
fiscal policy will be necessary to avoid exerting undue pressure on inflation and the exchange
rate. Most directors noted that greater exchange rate flexibility would help facilitate external
adjustment and safeguard international reserves. A few Directors noted that, under current
conditions, the existing exchange rate arrangements were appropriate for anchoring inflation
expectations.
Directors emphasized the need to reduce the domestic financing component of the fiscal deficit,
while reprioritizing expenditure to protect vulnerable groups. They praised ongoing efforts to
improve revenue performance, and noted that expenditure restraint would also be needed,
especially in wage and defense outlays. Directors welcomed the direction of the draft 2010
budget, which should be underpinned by well-identified revenue and expenditure measures.

3
Noting the progress in improving public financial management, they encouraged the authorities
to continue their efforts, especially in the areas of budget integration and transparency, as well
as the establishment of a Treasury single account.
Directors praised progress in improving liquidity management and noted that monetary
conditions remain broadly appropriate. They encouraged the National Bank of Cambodia to
monitor closely the large buildup of banks’ excess reserves and be prepared to tighten policy as
conditions improve. Directors saw room to strengthen the effectiveness of monetary policy,
focusing on developing indirect instruments and fostering an interbank market, which could also
contribute to reducing dollarization.
Directors expressed concern over the deterioration in the health of the banking sector and the
continued rise of nonperforming loans. They commended the authorities for responding with
prioritized onsite inspections and supervisory noncompliance letters, and encouraged them to
continue strengthening banking supervision. Immediate priorities should include strict
enforcement of the new asset classification regime, prompt implementation of corrective action
plans, development of a comprehensive bank restructuring framework, and increased
supervision capacity.
Directors noted that a diversified production base and improved competitiveness are key to
sustained high growth, with particular focus on improving basic infrastructure, labor skills, and
the business climate, as well as expanding market access through trade commitments.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue engaging external creditors to find a solution to
the arrears problem.

Statement by Adrian Chua, Alternate Executive Director for Cambodia, and Pijeivibol
Phan, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
November 18, 2009
1.
On behalf of the Cambodian authorities, we would like to thank the IMF staff team for
the fruitful policy dialogue and thoughtful recommendations during the Article IV consultations.
The exchange of views during the mission was candid. The authorities are in broad agreement
with the general thrusts of staff’s assessment and policy recommendations. They will give these
recommendations due consideration.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
2.
After many years of strong economic growth, the global economic crisis has hit
Cambodia hard in light of its high level of openness and highly concentrated growth base.
Garments, construction and tourism, which had been main economic driving forces, have been
adversely affected by the global crisis. Agriculture remains supportive of economic growth in
2009. We expect, however, that the economic contraction has bottomed out in mid 2009 and
growth will bounce back in 2010. The authorities project that economic growth will be positive
at around 2 percent in 2009, taking into account of growth in agriculture of 4.3 percent and
growth in services of 3.2 percent. Despite contraction in tourism, services sector has maintained
its growth momentum. The garment and construction industries, however, are expected to
contract by 3.9 percent and 2.6 percent, respectively.
3.
Inflation has declined sharply from 12.5 percent at end-2008, and is expected to stay
under 5 percent per annum in 2009. Prices of food and beverage, property, water, gas and
electricity, transportation, and entertainment and culture have contributed to the downward trend.
The riel has depreciated slightly against the US dollar during the first eight months of 2009.
However, a relatively large fluctuation occurred in August due to both seasonal and external
factors. The lower demand for the riel after the harvest season and for tax payments, continued
injection of the riel into the market and the slowdown of foreign inflow have contributed to the
depreciation of the riel. The current account deficit has shrunk since the imports decelerated
faster than exports in the first half of 2009. The level of international reserves has been
somewhat stable in light of challenging external situation.
4.
Going forward, economic prospects remain positive on the back of entrenched peace and
stability, appropriate macroeconomic management, and the authorities’ strong commitments to
reforms to shore up investments and attract international investors. For 2010, economic growth is
expected to expand modestly about 4.3 percent given the positive signs of recovery in the
country’s main economic drivers.
Fiscal policy
5.
As also stated by staff, the authorities demonstrated strong commitment in adopting a
prudent fiscal position to maintain macroeconomic stability and sustainability. Following high

2
oil and food prices in 2008 and the global economic downturn in 2009, the loosening of the fiscal
stance was appropriate and warranted to sustain economic growth and protect the most
vulnerable groups to maintain social stability. The authorities expect overall fiscal deficits to
increase to 6.08 percent of GDP in 2009 and about 5.3 percent in 2010. Domestic financing of
the 2009’s deficits will increase to 2.88 percent of GDP (47.52 percent higher compared to 2008)
and external financing will decrease to 4.18 percent (2.2 percent lower compared to last year). A
modest fiscal stimulus initiated since 2008 has had some positive effects, particularly in the area
of capital spending including on infrastructure. The authorities have made efforts to compress the
wage bill going forward to safeguard its fiscal position so as to underpin macroeconomic
stability.
6.
On the revenue side, collection could meet the overall target despite the challenging
external environment. Customs and excises taxes will be slightly higher than the target. Revenue
mobilization remains crucial. The authorities are stepping up efforts to strengthen tax
administration and collection, and broaden the tax base.
7.
Expenditures have increased in 2009 due to the authorities efforts to mitigate the impact
of the global economic downturn as well as of high oil and food prices. Considering fiscal
stability and sustainability, the authorities are making efforts to compress and prioritize
expenditures. The authorities are committed to pulling back the intervention where there is room
for the private sector to operate. They are also committed to mobilize development partners’
financial assistance. The authorities have worked to strengthen public financial management. In
particular, they have worked to implement the Public Finance Management Reform Program
(PFMRP), as part of a step-by-step approach. Progress has been made in tax administration and
mobilization as well as in budget formulation, execution and reporting.
Monetary and exchange rate policies
8.
The National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) continues to pursue prudent monetary policy.
The authorities concurred with the staff’s recommendation to maintain the current level of
reserve requirement given the large excess of reserves in the banking system and efforts to
safeguard the soundness of the banking system. In light of inflationary pressures and high credit
risk in the second half of 2008, the authorities implemented policies to curb rapid credit growth.
Credit growth has declined sharply in 2009 to 5.0 percent from 55.0 percent in 2008 and 76.0
percent in 2007. The authorities put in place the overdraft facility to address the risk of liquidity
shortage. Broad money as of September 2009 was 30.6 percent of GDP, slightly higher than that
of the same period in 2008. The authorities are keeping a close watch on liquidity situation and
stand ready to mitigate liquidity risk.
9.
The authorities concurred with staff that improvement in liquidity management is crucial
in preparing the ground for a well functioning inter-bank and money market. Efforts have been
taken to implement an operational liquidity monitoring framework aimed at mitigating the risks
associated with a reversal of the currently large liquidity overhang. The authorities are working
on securitization of fixed deposits. A draft of Repo Master Agreement has been finalized and

3
communicated with the public for consultation. These are steps of diversifying arrays of financial
products that could also be used as collateral in the banking sector in particular for the money
market operations. Fund technical assistance on liquidity monitoring has been essential for the
NBC in terms of operational assistance and capacity building.
10.
While committing to maintaining exchange rate stability which serves Cambodia well as
a nominal anchor, the authority agreeably noted staff’s view that “allowing greater exchange rate
flexibility would help facilitate adjustment and protect international reserves, especially in view
of the accommodative fiscal stance”. Gross international reserves, as of October 2009, have
remained somewhat stable at around USD 2.2 billion. The authorities are committed to
safeguarding adequacy of international reserves given the high level of dollarization in the
economy.
Financial and banking issues
11.
The authorities thank the staff for the banking sector vulnerabilities analysis in Box 3 of
the staff report. The authorities would like to stress, however, that the results of the sensitivity
analyses are not forecasts of the likely outcome. In fact, the results are based on staff’s
assumptions to give the authorities a picture of possible scenarios. Notably, the stress tests did
not give any consideration to collateral value and do not consider the impact of retained earnings
as of August 2009. We wish to highlight that the authorities have taken steps to ensure that the
outcomes of the analyses will be precluded. The authorities welcome the FSAP scheduled for
early 2010 which will examine the soundness of the banking sector in greater depth.
12.
Financial and banking sectors have seen unprecedented expansion in the country. Bright
prospects of the Cambodian economy have attracted foreign investors to enter the banking
system. While welcoming the expansion of the banking sector, the authorities maintain a close
watch on financial stability. The authorities have strengthened their regulatory and supervisory
framework and enforcement. They have implemented the following measures to strengthen the
banking system; first, maintaining the current level of reserve requirement ratio of 12 percent;
second, continuing to play its role as lender of last resort to provide overdraft facilities to banks;
third, classifying banks’ assets and loans into different sectors and maintaining appropriate
provisions; fourth, continuing to encourage banks to increase their minimum capital and to
comply with prudential measures; fifth, strengthening bank supervision capacity; and sixth,
monitoring liquidity condition of the banking system.
13.
The authorities concurred with staff of the need to move swiftly to strengthen regulatory
enforcement, particularly in the areas of corrective actions and banks’ compliance with the new
capital requirements. As part of its onsite inspections, the NBC is focusing on prompt corrective
actions, for many cases, on appropriate provisioning, loan appraisal and disbursement, and good
governance. The NBC is encouraging banks to adhere strictly to the regulation on new loan
classification and provisioning. Progress has been made on the draft of MOU between NBC and
the Ministry of Economy and Finance as part of bank resolution plan.

4
14.
Maintaining financial stability remains a key objective of the NBC. In light of growth and
diversification of the financial sector, NBC is strengthening its supervision and oversight
capacity, and working on improving operating standards and reducing risk concentration in the
banking system. The NBC and Securities and Exchange Commission of Cambodia (SECC) are
closely collaborating to prepare appropriate legal and regulatory frameworks for a new stock
exchange to avoid opportunities for regulatory arbitrage.
Structural Reforms
15.
The authorities are of the view that the economy’s resiliency to exogenous shocks needs
to be addressed. The authorities continue to develop agricultural sector and they are well aware
of the need to diversify production, especially in increasing agricultural productivity and value
added, promoting agro-industry and SME development, strengthening microfinance activities,
and developing rural physical infrastructure. The authorities have made continued progress to
improve private sector led businesses and to shore up investors’ confidence. Improving the
business climate and private sector development remains a priority for the authorities. They are
improving and finalizing regulatory and institutional frameworks related to the WTO’s
requirements in order to promote further integration into the regional and the world economy.
Conclusion
16.
Although significant progress has been made following decades of political instability,
institutional and infrastructural frameworks remain challenging for the authorities to implement
effectively. As such, peace and political stability remain essential for the country to strive toward
more in-depth reforms. High food and fuel prices and unfolding global economic downturn have
required adjustments to the pace of reform. Having said that, the authorities would like to
underscore their commitment to reforms supported by technical assistance from all development
partners.
