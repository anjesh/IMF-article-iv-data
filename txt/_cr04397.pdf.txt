ST. LUCIA
Staff Report for the 2003 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2003 Consultation
with St. Lucia
Approved by Markus Rodlauer and Matthew Fisher
April 13, 2004
• Discussions: A staff team comprising E. Verreydt (Head), C. Visconti, and T. Rasmussen (all
WHD), and P. Karam (INS) held discussions in Castries during November 3–19, 2003. Staff from the
Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) and Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) participated in
the discussions. R. Sahay (WHD) and F. Vermaeten (OED) joined the team for final discussions. The
staff met with the Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, the Minister of Tourism, the Financial
Secretary, other senior government officials, and representatives of the private sector, trade unions,
and employers.
• Economic background: St. Lucia, with a population of 158,000 and per capita GDP of
US$4,200, is one of the eight island states of the Organization of the Eastern Caribbean States
(OECS). It is a member of the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU), which has a common
central bank (ECCB) and a common currency, the Eastern Caribbean (EC) dollar. The EC dollar has
been pegged to the U.S. dollar at EC$2.70=US$1 since 1976. St. Lucia’s GDP accounts for about
25 percent of the combined OECS GDP. St Lucia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3 and 4. Relations with the Fund are summarized in Appendix I.
• Political situation: St. Lucia is a Westminster-style democracy with a bicameral parliament
consisting of the Senate (11 seats) and the House of Assembly (17 seats). Prime Minister Kenny
Anthony of the St. Lucia Labor Party has been in office since May 1997. He was re-elected in
December 2001 when his party won 14 of the seats in the House of Assembly. The next elections are
due by December 2006.
• 2002 Article IV consultation: At its conclusion on January 27, 2003, Directors expressed
concern about the steady fiscal deterioration since FY 2000/01 and urged strong adjustment measures
to curtail the growth of public debt. They emphasized the importance of expenditure restraint, tax
reform, and reduction in tax concessions. Directors encouraged the authorities to promote the
diversification of St. Lucia’s economy, enhance competitiveness, and strengthen financial sector
regulation and supervision.
• Exchange restriction: St. Lucia maintains an exchange restriction arising from the requirement
that arrangements for the clearance of any tax arrears be made before profit remittances above a
threshold of EC$250,000 can be made.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

St. Lucia has experienced a marked decline in economic growth during the 1990s
and early 2000s. This reflected mainly structural problems, including high labor and
utilities costs, and more recently the negative impact of the September 11, 2001
events on tourism and of unfavorable weather on agriculture. The current economic
situation remains difficult and unemployment is high, as an ongoing recovery in
tourism has not spilled over to the whole economy.

•

Since 2000, expansionary fiscal policies were pursued in an attempt to revive
growth and reduce unemployment, resulting in a steady rise in public debt. The
rising debt-to-GDP ratio (65 percent of GDP at end-2003), with a large increase in
external borrowing from commercial banks, raises concerns about vulnerability and
fiscal sustainability. Banking sector prudential indicators are generally weaker than
the ECCU average, owing to large non-performing loans, which represents another
source of vulnerability.

•

Priority should be given to carrying out a strong upfront fiscal adjustment. The
reduction in public debt needed to reduce vulnerabilities requires a large swing in the
primary balance over the next few years. To achieve this, staff recommended a
comprehensive tax reform, including revenue measures, following FAD
recommendations, and expenditures cuts. The authorities saw room for cutting capital
expenditure and resisting labor unions’ demands for wage increases, but remained
noncommittal with regard to other specific measures.

•

The authorities should plan fiscal contingency measures to reduce unanticipated
financing needs. Given its importance in the region, St. Lucia should lead the way in
demonstrating fiscal restraint and supporting macroeconomic stability under the
currency board arrangement. Collective prudence is required, as adverse
developments in another ECCU country could spill over to the rest of the region.

•

As recommended by the recent regional FSAP mission, the high level of
nonperforming loans in the domestic banking sector needs to be reduced. The
authorities should continue to work closely with the ECCB by putting in place the
necessary supervisory mechanisms, including more frequent on-site inspections, to
ensure compliance with the Basle Core Principles and adequate supervision of the
off-shore sector.

•

Structural reforms recommended by staff to invigorate private sector-led
growth would yield long-term benefits. Costly tax incentives to attract investment
should be reduced, preferably in a regional context. Efforts at lowering input costs
and raising labor productivity would yield large long-term benefits, in particular in
the tourism industry. Given the currency board arrangement, continued wage restraint
and a flexible labor market are key to enhancing competitiveness.

I. BACKGROUND: MEDIUM-TERM PERSPECTIVE
1.
St. Lucia has experienced a marked decline in economic growth during the 1990s
and early 2000s. Average real GDP growth declined from 6½ percent per year in the 1980s
to 2½ percent in the 1990s and -½ percent during

On the demand side, lower growth was associated with a shift from private to
public sector activity. Private consumption and investment fell relative to GDP from the
1980s to the 1990s; at the same time, public investment rose sharply. While the improvement
in the trade balance led to some narrowing

Persistent high unemployment points to rigidities in the labor market and in
wage setting mechanisms. Although only 16 percent of the labor force is unionized (Annex
I), the unions’ influence in wage-setting is deemed to be important as labor in nonunionized
firms reportedly align themselves with labor unions on wages negotiated in unionized firms.
Although there are indications of a marginal feedback from the unemployment rate on wage
settlements, available data indicates that the

average real wage per worker in the private

banana sector, which highlights the social dimension of the retrenchment associated with the
change in output structure.
5.
Expansionary fiscal policies were pursued after 1999 in an attempt to revive
growth and reduce unemployment, resulting in a steady rise in public debt. The
consolidated public sector deficit widened from 0.7 percent of GDP on average during 1990–
99 to 4.6 percent during 2000–03. This reflected a rise in the central government deficit, with
the rest of the nonfinancial public sector remaining broadly in balance.3 While revenue
remained relatively stable on average, the fiscal deterioration stemmed mainly from
increased current expenditure, leading to a deepening structural deficit. As a result of the
worsening fiscal position and weakening GDP growth, public debt rose steeply, from
39 percent of GDP in 1999 to an estimated 65 percent in 2003. Most of the increase in debt
was to foreign commercial banks, as the government undertook long-term borrowing to take
advantage of lower interest rates abroad. Consequently, public external debt nearly doubled,
from 25 percent of GDP in 1999 to 48 percent of GDP in 2003.

1/ The first column refers to the 1991-99 average while the second column refers to the 2000-2003 average. Debt accumulation
is percentage points of GDP per year.

Although St. Lucia’s fiscal deterioration in recent years was more pronounced than in other
ECCU countries its public debt is still well below that of its ECCU partners, reflecting a
more favorable starting point.
6.
With high nonperforming loans, banking sector prudential indicators are
generally weaker than the ECCU average. Although many nonperforming loans are
secured, the process of realization of collateral through the legal system is cumbersome and
protracted. As of September 2003, the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans in
commercial banks was 15 percent (the average in the ECCU was about 12 percent). The
liquid asset ratio at 22 percent was the lowest in the region (ECCU average was 29 percent).

-9-

7.
Prime Minister Kenny Anthony of the St. Lucia Labor Party, in office since
May 1997, was comfortably re-elected in December 2001. However, the rising public debt
has become increasingly an issue of public debate. A court ruled in early December 2003 that
a loan guarantee extended by the government in connection with the construction of a hotel
was illegal, and the guarantee has been criticized by the opposition. Although the
government intends to appeal the court’s decision, it had to borrow to pay the guarantee.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
A. Economic Situation
8.
The economic situation remains difficult, as
an ongoing recovery in the tourism sector has not
spilled over to the whole economy. Following a large
contraction in 2001 (-4.3 percent) associated with a
severe drought and a drop in tourism, real GDP is
recovering gradually, with an estimated growth of
2.3 percent in 2003. Growth is driven primarily by an
expansion in tourism, wholesale and retail trade
activities. The recovery in the tourism industry
appears to have been strengthened by a depreciation of
the real exchange rate vis-à-vis European currencies
since early 2002.4 Led by strong growth in tourist
arrivals from Europe and some increase in the number
of visitors from the U.S.A., total stay-over arrivals
were up by close to 10 percent during JanuarySeptember 2003. Moreover, hotels have reportedly
started reversing some of the discounts offered since
late 2001, which should help improve the economic
situation of the sector. However, most other sectors
remained depressed, as an increase in domestic
demand fueled mainly by private investment was
largely met through higher imports (see below). The
average inflation rate was slightly negative in 2002
(-0.2 percent), and is estimated at around 1 percent in
2003, broadly in line with inflation in partner
countries.

An indicator of the real exchange rate measured vis-à-vis the currencies of the countries
that represent the main tourism competitors shows a marked appreciation in 2003 (see
Figure 1), mostly due to the sharp depreciation of the Dominican Republic peso. This might
negatively affect St. Lucia’s market share in the Caribbean (data is not yet available to
ascertain this).

Breakdown of Demand Growth

9.
The current account deficit in 2003 was
exceptionally large, owing mainly to substantial
one-off private investments in
telecommunications. The current account deficit
widened by 6 percent of GDP in 2003, to about
19 percent, as imports surged (by 20 percent) on
account of higher expenditure on
telecommunications equipment, food and fuel.5
Notwithstanding a sharp fall in banana exports,
overall exports increased by about 12 percent,
mostly due to a rise in other merchandise exports
and in tourism receipts. Nearly 80 percent of the
external current account deficit was financed by
foreign direct investment (telecoms and hotels),
and the remainder mainly by public sector
borrowing.

With a decline in economic activity and a rise in the unemployment rate since
2001, both public and private sector wages appear to be moderating. In the civil service
wages have been almost flat since 2001. Private sector wages seem to have leveled off in
2002, following a 10 percent real increase in 2000–01. According to the Labor Department,
the current moderation went hand-in-hand with an increased ability of employers and unions
to arrive at wage settlements without the Department’s mediation.
11.
The slowdown in economic activity was also reflected in lower credit flows. Bank
credit to the private sector, mainly to distributive trades and households, declined by
3½ percent in 2003. However, reflecting rising private sector deposits, M2 increased by
3.2 percent in 2002 and is estimated to grow by 4.8 percent in 2003. The ratio of loans to
deposits reached a historically low level in September 2003. Faced with excess liquidity,
banks reduced lending rates on mortgages and bought assets abroad: foreign assets rose by
24 percent in the year ending September 30, 2003. On the liabilities side, interest rates on
time deposits fell below the legally mandated minimum savings deposit rate of 3 percent, and
there was a shift from time deposits to more liquid forms of deposit. Commercial banks’
profitability has declined owing to higher provisioning of non-performing loans and reduced
interest income.

Following the liberalization of telecommunications in 2002, two new entrants in the market
for mobile telephony have invested aggressively in establishing a presence in St. Lucia. Total
investment in this area was about 6½ percent of GDP in 2003, up from less than 2 percent in
2002.

- 11 -

B. Public Sector Policy
12.
The fiscal deficit has widened further. The
central government overall deficit is estimated to reach
5.8 percent of GDP in FY 2003/04 from 4.9 percent in
FY 2002/3. Current revenues are estimated to have
increased as a result of the net effect of tax measures
and the positive cyclical impact of the ongoing
economic recovery.6 However, rising primary
expenditures largely offset those gains, reflecting mainly
higher spending on goods and services associated with
past capital expenditure. The wage bill and capital
expenditure remained broadly unchanged.7

However, much-needed private sector involvement in the Water and Sewerage Company
(WASCO) was delayed, which threatens to worsen a nascent water supply constraint. No
decision has yet been taken to introduce a VAT, as recommended by the OECS Tax Reform
and Administration Commission to streamline and harmonize the indirect tax system.
C. Financial Vulnerabilities
14.
The rise in public debt accelerated in 2003, with a large increase in external
borrowing from commercial banks. In late 2002 and early 2003 the authorities undertook
two large borrowing arrangements with banks in Trinidad and Tobago totaling
EC$232 million. About half of this amount was used to refinance short- and medium-term
debt to take advantage of low international interest rates. Consequently, the average interest
rate on public debt remained relatively low (about 6½ percent) despite the declining reliance
on low-interest financing from official creditors. With borrowing in excess of the deficit, the
government built up deposits at foreign commercial banks (close to 3 percent of GDP at end2003). Public debt relative to GDP at-end 2003 exceeded for the first time the benchmark
agreed by the ECCB Monetary Council (60 percent) on central government debt.

9

The main objectives of the Revenue Authority will be to rationalize the operations of the
Customs and Inland Revenue Departments and increase the effectiveness of technical
activities resulting from the synergy of the merged agencies, such as audit and collection.

Given St. Lucia’s vulnerability to exogenous shocks, fiscal and financial
indicators point to significant risks. St. Lucia is highly vulnerable to global economic and
security conditions, as experienced after September 2001, and weather (drought in 2001,
tropical storm in 2002) adds to the volatility of output. In this context, the steadily rising
public debt and the associated debt service increase the risk of financing difficulties.

- 14 -

However, some progress was made in 2003 in strengthening the banking sector. While the
exposure of banks to the public sector remained limited (around 9.4 percent of assets), high
nonperforming loans prompted banks to increase provisioning for loan losses in line with
ECCB prudential regulations.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Overview
16.
Over the past several years, the Fund’s policy advice to St. Lucia has centered on
the need to strengthen public finances by curtailing budgetary expenditures and raising
revenue. In the 2002 Article IV consultation, Directors urged strong adjustment measures to
curtail the growth of public debt. They emphasized the importance of expenditure restraint,
especially on wages, and recommended steps to broaden the tax base, such as a reduction in
tax concessions. While agreeing with the thrust of the recommendations, the authorities
stressed the need to implement policies in a manner that minimizes the adverse consequences
for growth, employment, and social cohesion. They noted that the present government was
re-elected in 2001 with a mandate to upgrade social infrastructure and services. With high
unemployment and few alternative employment opportunities for displaced workers in the
banana sector, there is strong demand by the population for an active role of the government
in restoring growth and creating employment opportunities with increases in current
spending and investments in social infrastructure.
17.
The staff took the view that in order to achieve sustained rapid growth,
St. Lucia’s principal challenges were to invigorate private sector growth, reduce public
debt, and preserve macroeconomic stability. To enhance private sector growth, the
mission recommended policies to provide a conducive business environment and avoid adhoc financial incentives. Staff emphasized that the high and rising public debt called for a
strong upfront fiscal adjustment: reducing debt to below 60 percent of GDP by FY 2008/09,

- 15 -

consistent with the benchmarks agreed by the ECCB Monetary Council, will require a swing
of 7 percentage points of GDP in the primary balance in the next five years. Staff pointed to
the importance of fiscal prudence to preserve macroeconomic stability and the currency
board arrangement. It also warned that in the current difficult environment, adverse
developments in another ECCU country could spill over to the rest of the region through
pressures on the banking system or disruptions to access of capital markets.
18.
While the authorities agreed with staff on the need for fiscal consolidation, they
were concerned that a significant fiscal retrenchment at this juncture could undermine
the economic recovery. They stressed that expansionary fiscal policies were justified given
the severity of the external shocks that have hit St. Lucia in the past few years, in particular
the erosion of preferential market access to the EU for agricultural products. The authorities
also felt that large tax incentives were necessary to meet the competition from neighboring
countries and attract investment. Nonetheless, faced with the increase in public debt and
recurrent costs stemming from past capital outlays, they recognized the need to contain the
accumulation of debt through fiscal adjustment. They saw room for cutting capital
expenditure and resisting labor unions’ demands for wage increases, but remained
noncommittal with regard to other specific measures.
B. Growth and Competitiveness
19.
Given the currency board arrangement, labor market flexibility and input costs
reductions are key to enhancing competitiveness. The staff noted that weak growth
performance after the 1980s could be explained only partially by negative exogenous shocks,
and stressed that in the key tourism sector competitor-based measures of the real exchange
rate indicated a loss of competitiveness vis-à-vis non-ECCU Caribbean destinations. It
recognized that there is a strong political commitment to the currency board in the ECCU. In
this context, staff stressed that labor market rigidities and high input costs should be
addressed. These factors put an excessive burden on fiscal policy in sustaining employment,
as reflected in particular in the large tax concessions granted to investors.
20.
St. Lucia’s economic growth hinges on wage restraint in the public and private
sector, structural reforms, and productivity increases. Staff emphasized the importance of
pursuing labor market reforms and structural policies aimed at reducing production costs,
raising skills, and enhancing labor market flexibility, in particular in the context of the Labor
Code currently under review. The authorities agreed on the importance of containing costs
and pointed to their efforts to lead the way toward moderation in wage increases.
21.
The mission recommended fostering a business environment conducive to
private sector-led growth. It recommended a number of measures, including: (a) limiting
tax exemptions, which should be phased out, have an expiration date, and be subject to a cost
and benefit analysis of their impact on employment, growth, and fiscal balances;
(b) streamlining administrative obstacles affecting new investors, by way of setting up a
“one-stop-shop”; (c) increasing regulatory transparency; (d) reducing stamp duties;

- 16 -

(e) privatizing the Marketing Board;10 and (f) assisting private businesses in training
employees. The authorities concurred that the private sector had a large role to play in
fostering growth. They pointed to ongoing efforts at supporting private businesses by the
Office of Private Sector Relations (OPSR), in particular through the Business Upgrading
Program, which focuses on technical assistance to businesses in marketing and human
resources development. Noting the authorities’ concern about the high costs of tax incentives,
staff strongly supported the authorities’ intention to carry out a statistical breakdown of the
various tax incentives, with a view to better streamlining and phasing them out.
Box 1: Growth Prospects
The declining trend of economic growth and persistent high unemployment observed over the past
decade suggests that structural impediments are holding back growth. For the last several years,
St. Lucia’s economy has registered a lower rate of economic growth compared to other ECCU countries.
Exogenous shocks, in particular the reduction in preferential market access for banana exports and the
drop in tourist arrivals following September 11, 2001, have contributed to the slowdown. Growth has
also decelerated in neighboring countries facing similar circumstances. Nevertheless, these factors
explain only part of the reduction in average annual GDP growth since the 1980s. The country’s
comparative advantage appears to lie in exploiting its natural beauty and its proximity to major tourist
markets, and it would be crucial to remove obstacles to the expansion of this sector and strengthen its
links with the rest of the economy.
Other factors that are likely to be holding back growth include:

• Labor Market. Labor market data are sketchy, but productivity is reportedly low, and wages in the
private sector have until recently continued to increase despite economic stagnation and high
unemployment. These factors suggest a need for improving skills and enhancing labor market flexibility.
• Agriculture. The difficulties of the banana industry need to be addressed by facilitating movement
into more productive sectors with better growth prospects. Banana output is unlikely to increase much
from its current level, and public funds used to encourage production have had low rates of return.
Nonbanana agriculture shows more promise, especially produce for hotels and restaurants, but supply
and marketing arrangements function poorly.
• Tourism. Hotels claim that operating costs are high and productivity of local workers is low.
Electricity is especially expensive, and the water and sewerage infrastructure is often inadequate.
•

Business Environment. The private sector reports that cumbersome administrative procedures and
high stamp duties are excessively onerous and stifle new investment. Stopping the policy of “picking
winners” through discretionary tax concessions and phasing out large tax incentives would create a more
level business environment, stimulate competition, and reduce inefficiencies.

•

Regional Integration. Trade with neighboring countries remains limited, with high transportation
costs, cumbersome customs procedures, limited use of joint training facilities, and differing tax systems.
More regional integration would allow for greater specialization and increased economies of scale.

10

The Marketing Board is a government agency involved in the importation and trade of
certain goods, mostly basic staples deemed to be essential. It does not have a monopoly in
these activities.

- 17 -

22.
Tourism has played a pivotal role in the expansion of St. Lucia’s economy, and is
likely to remain the main source of future growth. Staff presented specific
recommendations to enhance the efficiency and cost competitiveness of the tourism industry.
This included: (a) reviewing the regulatory framework governing the electricity sector to
reduce costs; (b) restructuring WASCO to allow needed investments in water and sewerage
infrastructure; (c) maintaining the quality of hotels and tourism facilities, and improving air
travel access; (d) conducting a cost-benefit analysis of tax incentives in the tourism industry;
and (e) increasing the local value added from cruise ship tourism. On the issue of costs, the
authorities doubted that the wage level was threatening the competitiveness of the tourism
industry, on the ground that tourism services targeted the higher end of the market which was
less subject to price competition. However, they recognized that smaller hotels were
suffering from competition from cheaper destinations, and agreed with the mission on the
need to improve the performance of utilities, by restructuring the water company, possibly
with World Bank technical assistance, and bringing down electricity costs.
23.
Developing the linkages between the tourism and agricultural sectors would
lower operating costs in the tourism sector and provide a stable source of income to
farmers. Although the share of the banana sector in GDP is less than 3 percent, it still
accounts for a significant share of employment (about 10 percent in recent years), and
therefore is important from a social and political point of view. The sector will face increased
competitive pressures following the replacement of the current quota by a tariff for accessing
the EU market expected by 2006, which casts a large uncertainty on its future.11 However, as
the climatic and soil conditions are favorable to farming, there appears to be scope for
diversifying agricultural production. The authorities noted that greater diversification
depended on better access of the farmers’ products to international markets and strengthened
linkages with domestic industries. The mission encouraged the authorities to improve
marketing arrangements and supported the formation of farmers’ cooperatives in order to
secure a reliable supply of farm products to hotels.
24.
While recognizing the benefits of regional integration, the authorities favored a
gradual approach preserving the country’s autonomy. The mission expressed the view
that regional integration (through the OECS, CARICOM, and the FTAA) has potential
benefits mainly by bringing a more efficient allocation of resources, economies of scale, and
higher productivity. It therefore recommended that member countries step up their efforts
towards reaching common targets in trade, financial and fiscal policies and achieving free
movement of goods and services and labor.12 The mission pointed, among others, to the
11

Banana production is projected by staff to grow by 15 percent in 2004 from the exceptional
low level in 2003, and remain flat after 2004. This would leave output at about half the level
of the late 1990s.

12

In the gradual process toward regional integration, St. Lucia has implemented legislation
facilitating the free movement of persons within OECS and CARICOM. St. Lucia has also,
along with the other OECS countries, introduced a new system for alien landholding licenses
(continued)

- 18 -

benefits associated with lowering transport costs and establishing joint education centers and
coordinated tax and customs procedures. The authorities broadly supported greater regional
integration, while noting the need to avoid uniformity, as countries should retain the
possibility to adopt measures geared to their own specific circumstances. They further
cautioned that regional integration required well thought-out preparations.
C. Ensuring Fiscal Sustainability
25.
To address the high and rising debt levels, the mission recommended a strong
upfront fiscal adjustment followed by further consolidation in the medium-term.
According to staff projections, public debt would reach close to 90 percent of GDP by
FY 2008/09 under current trends, and interest costs would reach nearly 5 percent of GDP
(assuming no rise in interest rates). This would likely undermine domestic and external
investors confidence and reduce growth (Box 2, bottom figure). Bringing debt back to less
than 60 percent by FY 2008/9 would require a strong upfront fiscal adjustment, as a delayed
effort would entail a very high primary balance adjustment to reach the ECCB debt guideline
in the latter years. Staff projections indicate that the primary balance needs to improve by
about 5 percent of GDP in the next two years, and by an additional 2 percent over the
subsequent three years, to bring debt below 60 percent of GDP by 2008 and set it on a
declining trajectory. In combination with an accelerated pace of structural reforms, boosting
investor confidence and improving the business climate, this scenario projects annual GDP
growth rising above 3 percent over the medium term (Box 2, top figure).
26.
The authorities favored a much more gradual adjustment. They agreed with the
staff on the need to address the issue of rising debt, which they said was also a cause for
concern at the ECCB. However, they underscored that the expansionary fiscal stance was an
appropriate response to weak growth, which would over time give way to fiscal consolidation
as the recovery became firmly established. To illustrate the effects of a more gradual
adjustment path, the staff developed a medium-term scenario that would stabilize debt at
around 70 percent of GDP. While this would still require a substantial swing in the primary
balance of about 5 percent of GDP in the next 5 years, it would nevertheless pose risks if
faced with unanticipated new shocks. The staff therefore strongly recommended policies to
set the debt-to-GDP ratio on a firmly declining path, as embodied in the more ambitious
scenario. It pointed out that, with imports representing more than 40 percent of St. Lucia’s
aggregate demand, even in the short-run the fiscal adjustment would unlikely lead to a large
contraction of GDP and employment.

to allow citizens of one country to buy land in another. The authorities reported no
outstanding issues regarding compliance with the end-2003 target date for the free movement
of goods and services within the OECS.

- 19 -

Box 2. Medium-Term Outlook Under Alternative Fiscal Scenarios
Fiscal projections to FY 2008/09 were prepared by the staff. A strong adjustment scenario assumes the
adoption of upfront fiscal measures and structural reforms starting in FY 2004/05; and a baseline scenario is
based on unchanged policies.

The strong adjustment scenario targets a reduction in

2008/09. Revenue measures would include reducing
tax exemptions; widening the tax base; increasing the
progressivity of the income tax; raising the property tax; streamlining tax administration, and adjusting
domestic fuel prices. A VAT would be introduced in the context of a regional tax reform. Reflecting an
improved business climate, private investment would

increase, and output growth reach around 3½ percent

a year.

Under the baseline scenario, no adjustment of
policies is assumed. Primary deficits are assumed to
remain at 2½ percent of GDP, which would raise
public debt to about 90 percent of GDP by FY
2008/09. The uncertain outlook associated with the
large debt overhang would constrain growth to
1 percent a year in this scenario.

point to the potentially negative impact of various
shocks of an average magnitude (Tables 9–12). They
show that exogenous shocks could substantially raise the debt level (above 100 percent under current policies).
While gross financing needs appear manageable in the strong adjustment scenario, financing the deficit
associated with a continuation of current policies could become difficult. Under current policy, gross financing
needs could reach 20 percent of GDP in 2008, and markedly more in the event of an adverse shock.

27.
The necessary fiscal adjustment will require both revenue and expenditure
measures. The staff welcomed the authorities’ plans for holding public discussions about a
comprehensive medium-term tax reform, and urged that such a reform be implemented as
soon as possible (see below). A recent FAD report recommended a range of near- and
medium term revenue measures (Box 3). The mission underlined that, in addition to
adopting these revenue measures, the authorities should implement expenditures cuts to
achieve the necessary adjustment. The wage bill as a share of GDP should be gradually
reduced, and public sector wage increases should be based on performance, as recommended
in the government’s blueprint for civil service reform. Spending on goods, services, and
transfers should be contained to reduce the cost of providing public goods. Actual capital
outlays should be scaled down with immediate effect, to contain the growth of associated
recurrent expenditures and borrowing. Moreover, public investment should be prioritized and
directed to support private sector-led growth.

- 20 -

Box 3. St. Lucia : Tax Reform
FAD/CARTAC missions visited the ECCU member countries during the period October–December
2002, and made region-wide and country-specific recommendations for tax reform with the objective of
creating a tax system that is efficient, equitable, and administrable and provides adequate and stable
revenues. The OECS Tax Reform and Administration Commission made recommendations along similar
lines. During the 2003 Article IV consultation mission, staff discussed these recommendations with the
St. Lucia authorities, and identified policy measures to enhance revenue collection in the near- and
medium term. Key recommendations included:
•

Replace existing domestic consumption taxes with a value-added tax (VAT), supplemented by a
modern system of excises. This reform, which should be carried-out at a regional level, would allow
the reduction of import duties and facilitate reduction of tax incentives as well as indirect tax
concessions;

•

Award tax concessions only with the strict interpretation of existing legislation, and seek to repeal
acts authorizing tax incentives. Do not renew income tax holidays and cease granting new ones;

•

Reform the taxation of petroleum and its price adjustment mechanism, by removing price controls
from petroleum products and converting the current consumption tax on petroleum to an excise at a
specific rate;

•

Strengthen property taxation by basing tax valuation on the market value of property and updating
valuations on a regular basis;

•

Create a unified Revenue Authority to coordinate the operations of the tax and customs
administrations;

•

Widen the tax base and increase the progressivity of the personal income tax.

The authorities concurred with the staff that expenditures should be
rationalized, the implementation of capital projects slowed down, and revenue
collection strengthened. They remained, however, noncommittal on specific measures and a
timetable of implementation. The authorities stressed current efforts in the area of tax
administration, in particular the creation of the Revenue Authority, and indicated their
intention to review the taxation of petroleum products. They expressed satisfaction with the

- 21 -

technical assistance provided by CARTAC to strengthen economic institutions and improve
statistics. They also pointed to the importance of the newly-created debt and investment unit
as a mechanism to enhance debt management. With regard to tax reform, the Cabinet
endorsed the conclusions of the OECS Tax Reform and Administration Commission report,
and intends to make the report available to the public for consensus building as to whether to
introduce a VAT. The authorities agreed with the report’s recommendation that ECCU
countries should implement the new tax system in a concerted way. However, they argued
that introducing the VAT was not a national priority, given St. Lucia’s comprehensive tax
system, which includes a personal income tax (unlike in Antigua and Barbuda and St. Kitts
and Nevis). The staff urged the authorities to take a regional approach and accelerate the
move to a VAT, noting the long lead-time typically needed to implement such reforms.
29.
Staff stressed the need to develop a contingency plan in case access to financing
is suddenly diminished or if a natural disaster creates large additional financing needs.
Data provided to the mission indicate that projected financing needs through end-2004 (about
US$62 million) are largely secured (including from official creditors). However, staff
pointed out that unanticipated financing constraints could emerge if the central government
deficit was not reduced as recommended, or if adverse developments in another country
spilled over to the rest of the region. Staff recommended identifying public expenditures that
could be postponed or cut and other potential sources of financing.

D. Financial Sector Vulnerabilities
30.
The authorities concurred with the staff that measures were required to reduce
vulnerability in the financial sector and improve the health of the banking sector. In line with
the recommendations of the recent regional FSAP mission, the staff underscored that
reducing further the high level of nonperforming loans in the domestic banking sector should
be a priority.13 The authorities should continue to work closely with the ECCB in putting in
place the necessary supervisory mechanisms, including more frequent on-site inspections,
and ensuring compliance with the Basle Core Principles. The staff welcomed the authorities’
intention to proceed with the divestiture of government shares in the Bank of St. Lucia. It
recommended that the supervision of St. Lucia’s offshore sector should be further
strengthened, including by tightening and stepping up enforcement of AML/CFT regulations.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
The economy has started to recover, but prospects for sustained growth and
unemployment reduction remain uncertain. The factors that accounted for the slow
growth and high unemployment in the 1990s still exist, and there are few indications of
vibrant private investment prospects. In this context, high and persistent unemployment
poses a major social and political challenge, stemming in particular from the difficulty of
absorbing retrenched banana farmers in other activities.
32.
The pursuit of expansionary fiscal policy in a period of low growth has sharply
raised public debt levels. Faced with a downturn after 1999, the authorities increased public
spending, although the impact of countercyclical fiscal policies is limited by the openness of
St. Lucia’s economy. The wider fiscal deficits have sharply raised public debt, to over
65 percent of GDP at end-2003.
33.
Structural reforms to invigorate private sector-led growth would yield long-term
benefits. The authorities should step up their efforts at removing cumbersome administrative
procedures and providing a conducive business environment. Costly tax incentives to attract
investment should be closely monitored, and reduced, preferably in a regional context.
Efforts at lowering input costs and raising labor productivity would yield large long-term
benefits, in particular in the tourism industry, St. Lucia’s area of natural comparative
advantage. Given the currency board arrangement, reaping these benefits will require
continued wage restraint in the public and private sector and a flexible labor market. In this
context, the staff encourages the authorities to restructure the water company, seek a
reduction in electricity costs, and support agricultural diversification to feed the tourism

13

surveillance in the ECCU.

industry. Regional integration would also contribute to enhanced efficiency through
economies of scale.
34.
Priority should be given to carrying out a strong upfront fiscal adjustment and
continued moderation in expenditures in the medium term. The rising debt-to-GDP ratio
raises concern about fiscal sustainability. The staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to
slow debt accumulation through spending restraint, including a reduction in capital outlays,
and supports their strategy of wage moderation in the civil service. However, the needed
reduction in public debt to mitigate the country’s vulnerability and meet the ECCB
benchmark requires a large improvement in the primary balance over the next few years. To
ensure this, the staff urges additional steps to contain current expenditures, accelerated tax
reform, and stepped-up establishment of the Revenue Authority. In this context, the staff
welcomes the authorities’ intention to broaden public support to tax reform by circulating the
report by the OECS Tax Reform and Administration Commission for public discussion.
35.
Given its importance in the regional economy, St. Lucia should lead the way in
demonstrating fiscal restraint and supporting macroeconomic stability under the
currency board arrangement. Although ECCB fiscal guidelines are not binding in ECCU
member states, collective prudence is required, as adverse developments in another ECCU
country could spill over to the rest of the region. In this context, it is also important that the
authorities plan fiscal contingency measures to reduce unanticipated financing needs.
36.
Commercial banks’ focus on reducing nonperforming loan portfolios is
appropriate under current circumstances. Faced with the highest level of nonperforming
loans in the ECCU, St. Lucia banks are appropriately increasing their provisioning for loan
losses in line with ECCB prudential regulations, and exercising caution in new lending. The
staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to continue to work closely with the ECCB to
address the issue. It also encourages the authorities to complete divestiture from the Bank of
St. Lucia, and ensure adequate supervision of the offshore sector.
37.
Strengthening statistical collection, analysis, and reporting is essential. While
some progress is being made to strengthen economic institutions with CARTAC assistance,
the consistency and timeliness of fiscal, external, real sector, labor market and debt data need
improvement. The authorities are encouraged to enhance reporting under the GDDS, and
seek technical assistance through CARTAC and other donors.
38.
St. Lucia maintains an exchange restriction, arising from the requirement that
arrangements for the clearance of any tax arrears be made before profit remittances above a
threshold can be made. A timetable has been set for removing this restriction. Fund approval
for its retention until July 31, 2004 is proposed.
39.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be conducted within the next
12 months.

ANNEX I

Trade Unions and Collective Bargaining in St. Lucia1
Presently labor laws are found in separate acts or pieces of legislation. However,
recently, the Government of St. Lucia decided to consolidate, update and amend all labor
legislation, with the participation of all social partners.
There is no national legal minimum wage. However, the wages regulations order of 1985
stipulates minimum wages for certain categories of workers. Labor Department statistics
indicate that workers in several categories receive wages double that of the legal minimum
wage, while those in the rural areas tend to be much closer to the legal minimum.
According to the authorities, trade unions have a significant part to play in the
determination of wages and a much lesser role in determining the level of employment.
The wages and other conditions of employment in respect of public sector are carried out
through a collective bargaining process. It is generally not compulsory for individuals to get
representation in order to obtain employment. There is a tendency for an increase in union
representation given the introduction of the Registration Status and Recognition of
Employees and Employer Organizations Act No. 42 of 1999, which guarantees compulsory
union recognition. Union membership accounts for about 16 percent of total employment,
broken down as follows:2

ANNEX I

Recognized trade unions in the public and private sector enter into negotiations with
employers on behalf of employees. In the event of difficulties in reaching settlements, the
Labor Department has usually been successful in assisting employers/unions arrive at
mutually acceptable settlements. Otherwise, the matter is referred to the Minister of Labor
who makes a further attempt at bringing about a resolution. While a number of wage disputes
have been settled in this way in recent years, more realistic wage demands in the current
economic downturn seem to have allowed employers and unions to arrive at wage
settlements internally more easily, typically for a period of 2–3 years.
The majority of wage negotiations are decentralized at the firm level. Public sector
negotiations, however, are conducted by an ad hoc “umbrella” group, which comprises
National Workers Union, St. Lucia teachers Union, Civil Service Association and Vieux Fort
Dock Workers Union.
Employers have some flexibility in adjusting hours worked to the firm’s level of
activity. It is customary in St. Lucia for an employer to lay off an employee for up to twelve
consecutive weeks in the event of an economic downturn and/or reorganization of business.
The period of lay-off does not interrupt the continuity of employment, and employees may be
recalled at any point during the twelve-week period. If however, the employer is unable to
re-instate the employee after the twelve-week period, the employee would be considered
dismissed and can submit a claim for redundancy pay.

1/ Fiscal years. NFPS excluding the National Insurance Corporation (NIC).
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt;
and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes price and exchange rate changes
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Standard deviation based on 5-year historical average.
7/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain
at their levels of the last projection year.

Sources: St. Lucian authorities; and Fund staff estimates and projections.

Union, which has a common central bank (the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank) and
currency (the Eastern Caribbean dollar). Since July 1976, the Eastern Caribbean dollar
has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar. St. Lucia has
accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. St. Lucia maintains an
exchange restriction arising from the requirement imposed on individuals or corporations
who request the approval of a single outward remittance above EC$250,000 and who
have outstanding tax liabilities, to make arrangements for the eventual clearance of such
tax arrears before the remittance is approved by the ministry of finance.
VIII. Article IV Consultation: St. Lucia is currently on the 12-month cycle. The 2002 Article

APPENDIX II

St. Lucia: Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of January 4, 2004)
The World Bank’s Management presented to its Board the Eastern Caribbean Sub-Region
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), on June 28, 2001. The CAS, which covers FY 2002–06,
proposes new commitments of US$107 million for five borrowing member states of the
Organization of the Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), including St. Lucia. The main goals of
the strategy are to reduce income insecurity and vulnerability at the national and household
levels, and build human and institutional capacity to meet the challenging economic and social
environment facing these small states. Most new projects are being provided under a subregional umbrella mechanism using horizontal Adaptable Program Loans (APLs), and in close
collaboration with sub-regional organizations and external partners.
V. PROJECTS
There are six active World Bank projects in St. Lucia for a net commitment of approximately
US$31.1 million.
The St. Lucia Disaster Management Project, approved in December 1998, is part of a
regional program for the five OECS borrowing countries to fortify, reconstruct, and/or
rehabilitate key economic and social infrastructure and facilities, in order to minimize damage
or disruption caused by future natural and man-made disasters, and to speed emergency
recovery following such disasters. Additionally, the project is expected to strengthen the
countries’ institutional capacity to prepare for and respond to disaster emergencies efficiently
and effectively. The total program size is US$46 million, and the St. Lucia component is
US$6 million.
The World Bank on March 8, 2002, approved $20.9 million in loans and credits to support
Emergency Recovery Projects in Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St.
Vincent and the Grenadines. The projects support efforts aimed at fostering recovery from the
fallout of the events of September 11, 2001. The projects support: (i) efforts to safeguard the
productive capacity of the tourism sector by securing energy imports; (ii) investments to
enhance security at airports and ports; and (iii) the development of institutional capacity to
develop security programs as mandated by international civil aviation and maritime transport
agencies. The Bank’s support to St. Lucia under this project is for US$6.3 million.
The St. Lucia Water Sector Reform Technical Assistance was approved in December 2001
for $2.6 million. It supports the Government of St. Lucia’s goal of improving the water and
sewerage service provision through the private sector participation (PSP) in the operation of
WASCO, the water supply and sewerage utility. The project finances the development of a
regulatory, the preparatory work for PSP transaction as well a dissemination and consensus
building campaigns.

- 44 -

APPENDIX II

The St. Lucia Poverty Reduction Fund, approved in July 1999 for US$3 million, aims to
develop the institutional and operational framework for a social fund, and pilot its ability to
provide quality basic social and economic infrastructure and services to St. Lucia's vulnerable
poor. The project will thus contribute to a sustainable infrastructure, fostering community-led
development.
The OECS Education Reform Project is a follow-up to the Basic Education project. It was
approved in June 2002 for US$12.0 million, and was signed in September 2002. It is expected
to become effective by the end of this calendar year. This is one of several subprojects included
in a regional horizontal APL. The overall objective of this project is to build human capital in
the OECS which, in turn, will contribute to the diversification of their economy and more
sustainable growth. This objective will be achieved by: (i) increasing equitable access to
secondary education; (ii) improving the quality of the teaching and learning process, with more
direct interventions at the school level and a focus on student-centered learning, and (iii)
strengthening management of the sector and governance of schools.
The OECS Telecommunications Reform Program, approved in June 1998 for US$6 million,
aims to introduce pro-competition reforms in the telecommunications sector and increase the
supply of informatics-related skills in the five OECS borrowing countries—Dominica, Grenada,
St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The project has assisted the
OECS countries negotiate with the subregional telecom monopoly for less one-side contracts
and lower long distance and regional telephone rates. The St. Lucia component is
US$1.2 million.
VI. ECONOMIC AND SECTOR WORK
The Bank is and has recently been engaged in three categories of analytical work of direct
relevance to St. Lucia. The first builds on the Bank-wide program on small states. Earlier pieces
focused, among others, on the issues of vulnerability in the Caribbean (including
macroeconomic volatility and income security), research on catastrophic insurance, reviews of
natural hazard risk mitigation strategies, and institutional arrangements for environmental
management in the OECS. Several of these were discussed by the Caribbean Group for
Cooperation in Economic Development in June 2002.
The second body of work addresses long-term development in the OECS and includes the
recently completed Institutional and Organizational Capacity Review of the OECS, a
Procurement Assessment Review, and a Financial Accountability Assessment. A fiscal issues
report, which includes a review of public expenditures in St. Lucia, is ongoing, as is work on an
Energy Sector Management Assistance Program for the OECS as a whole. The Bank is also
about to embark on a study of growth and competitiveness in the OECS, scheduled for
completion during the first half of 2004.
Third, the Bank will continue to work together with the IMF and ECCB to fully review the
financial sector through an ongoing Financial Sector Assessment Program.

APPENDIX III

St. Lucia: Relations with the Caribbean Development Bank
(As of August 31, 2003)
CDB’s operations in St. Lucia have been designed to support the economic and social
development efforts of the government by financing priority capital projects, providing
technical assistance and engaging in policy dialogue on key development issues. Guided by its
mandate and the development objectives of the government, the CDB has collaborated with
St. Lucia in such areas as: (i) the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic, social,
and sectoral policies geared towards providing a framework for growth; (ii) infrastructure
development to facilitate private sector investment; (iii) human resource development to
facilitate economic growth and diversification and the reduction of poverty; (iv) direct and
indirect lending to agriculture, tourism, and manufacturing; (v) environmental protection to
promote sustainable development; and (vi) poverty reduction.
St. Lucia is the second largest user of CDB resources, accounting for $230.8 million
(10.7 percent) of net cumulative loans, contingent loans, equity, and grants approved since
1970. Of this amount, $110.6 million were provided from the Ordinary Capital Resources while
the remainder was from “soft” resources. Total net loans, contingent loans, equity and grants
approved during 2002 and during the first half of 2003 amounted to$8.8 million and $8.7
million respectively. At the end of December 2002 St. Lucia had a total outstanding balance of
$85.6 million compared to $76.4 million at the end of 2001. At the end of June 2003, the total
outstanding balance stood at $91.0 million on some 46 loans with 15 projects under implementation. Disbursement of loans, contingent loans, equity and grants during 2002 reached
$17.5 million, while that disbursed during the first half of 2003 amounted to $7.0 million.

APPENDIX IV

St. Lucia: Statistical Issues
St. Lucia’s statistical database is inadequate for meeting the authorities’ needs and for Fund
surveillance. There are weaknesses in coverage, frequency, quality, and timeliness that
continue to frustrate effective economic analysis and policy formulation. The weakest areas
are the national accounts, the fiscal accounts, and balance of payments. Also, comprehensive
and regular labor statistics are not available. The ministry of finance publishes annually an
economic and social review, which includes statistics covering developments in all
macroeconomic sectors. The Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB) publishes a quarterly
economic and financial review and an annual balance of payments for each member country.
St. Lucia is a participant in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). Its metadata,
which include detailed plans for statistical development in the main macroeconomic areas
over the short and medium term, have been posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards
Bulletin Board (http://dsbb.imf.org) since September 21, 2000.
Real sector
The authorities are developing a new methodology for the computation of the GDP, aimed
mainly at obtaining better sectoral estimates. However, the process is being stymied by data
collection problems. Attempts are being made to compile quarterly GDP estimates with
funding from the OAS. Given the increasing importance of tourism activities, a new
comprehensive survey of the sector seems necessary to establish key data, such as average
length of stay in different types of accommodations and average daily expenditure by type of
tourist arrivals. This information should then be cross checked with other related activities,
i.e., restaurants and transportation, to ensure consistency. A recent mission from the
Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance Center helped the authorities to develop export and
import price indices and undertook initial work on measuring price developments in tourism.
Another area in need of improvement is the reporting of labor statistics, in particular, private
and public employment and wages.
Public sector finance
Reporting of the central government data has improved substantially over the last few years,
but some major deficiencies remain in the rest of the public sector. The authorities are now
reporting monthly data on the central government ’s current revenue and expenditure using a
Fund-compatible economic classification, and with lags of one to two months. However, the
frequent large revisions to the figures after they are first reported suggest that further
improvements in their quality are needed. With regard to the rest of the public sector, the
periodicity and timeliness of data reporting should be improved; annual statements and
projections are currently obtained directly from each entity during Fund missions and
consolidated public sector accounts are compiled by the Fund staff. Data on domestic debt of
the public sector are not available on a regular basis. No fiscal data are reported to STA for
publication in the GFS Yearbook or in IFS.

- 48 -

APPENDIX IV

Money and banking
The ECCB compiles monthly data on commercial banks with a lag of about six weeks. The
information is reliable and is reported on a regular basis. Data for a group of nonbank
financial intermediaries are compiled by the Ministry of Finance with a lag of about three
months and are reported on an irregular basis.
Balance of payments
Balance of payments data are compiled by the ECCB on an annual basis. Although recent
data provide a more detailed breakdown of goods than in the past, in other areas they do not
provide sufficient detail to enable publication of the full detailed classification used in the
fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). Data for 2001 and revised data for
earlier years were published in the March 2003 issue of IFS. In general, enhanced data
sources and better compilation procedures are needed to improve the accuracy of balance of
payments statistics. Efforts should also be made to compile quarterly balance of payments
statistics.
External debt
The Ministry of Finance has a comprehensive database for public and publicly guaranteed
external loans that provides detailed and reasonably up-to-date breakdowns of disbursements
and debt service. Information on bonds placed abroad is compiled annually and monthly data
are provided only at the staff's request. Recently, the quality of information on these bonds
has weakened as the disaggregation between resident and nonresident holders was
discontinued. It would be useful to restore this level of detail.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
May 5, 2004
This statement contains information that has become available since the staff report was
circulated to the Executive Board. It does not affect the thrust of the staff appraisal.
•

The pick-up in economic activity has been stronger than expected but remains quite
narrowly based on the rebound in tourism. Preliminary data indicate that real GDP
grew by 3.7 percent in 2003 driven by 17 percent growth in the hotels and restaurants
sector. This led to a narrower than expected external current account deficit of about
15½ percent of GDP. Despite these positive developments, the unemployment rate is
reported to have increased from 20.4 percent in 2002 to 22.2 percent in 2003.

•

Preliminary fiscal data for FY2003/04 suggest that the overall balance was in line
with projections, as additional revenues were offset by higher expenditure. Current
revenue of the central government increased by almost 10 percent, reflecting the growth
in economic activity as well as a number of one-off revenue measures, including higher
collection of tax arrears. Excluding payments associated with a government guarantee,1
current expenditure rose by almost 8 percent with substantial increases in most areas.
Notably, outlays for wages and salaries increased by about 11 percent, reflecting an endyear bonus of EC$850 per person and a retroactive 3 percent increase in wages. The
current account showed a surplus of 0.5 percent of GDP, compared to the estimate in the
staff report of approximate balance.

•

In its first venture on the regional government securities market, in January 2004
the Government of St. Lucia issued EC$27 million in one-year treasury bills. The
issue was fully subscribed and yielded an interest rate of 5.5 percent.

•

Reducing the overall fiscal deficit in FY 2004/05 would depend critically on
containing capital expenditure. The recently announced budget for FY 2004/05 is
largely neutral on the revenue side. Current expenditure is budgeted to increase by over
7 percent. This implies a worsening of the current balance of almost 1 percent of GDP
compared to the previous fiscal year, against staff’s recommendation of an improvement
of about the same magnitude. The allocation for capital spending has been sharply cut
relative to last year’s budget, but is higher than realized spending in FY 2003/04.
Assessment of the fiscal stance embodied in the budget for FY 2004/05 depends on the
outcome for capital expenditure. A 50 percent execution rate, in line with the experience
during the past few years, would imply a reduction in capital expenditure of about
2 percent of GDP, as recommended by staff.

IMF Concludes 2003 Article IV Consultation with St. Lucia
On May 5, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with St. Lucia.1
Background
After a contraction in GDP of over 4 percent in 2001 and only a marginal expansion in 2002,
the pace of economic growth accelerated in 2003 to 3.7 percent, driven by a rebound in
tourism of close to 17 percent. While growth has been stronger than expected in 2003,
St. Lucia has experienced a marked decline in average economic growth during the last
decade, reflecting mainly increased competition from lower priced tourist destinations, a
maturing tourism product targeting the high-end of the market, and high labor and utility costs.
During this period, as the structure of the economy moved away from agriculture to services,
persistent high unemployment pointed to rigidities in the labor market. Expansionary fiscal
policies were pursued after 1999 in an attempt to revive growth and reduce unemployment,
resulting in a steady rise in public debt. Although, at 64 percent of GDP, St. Lucia’s public debt
at end-2003 was high, it remained well below that of its Eastern Carribean Currency Union
partners. However, banking sector prudential indicators are generally weaker than the ECCU
average.
Despite the pick-up in growth, the overall economic situation remained difficult in 2003, as an
ongoing recovery in the tourism sector has not spilled over to the whole economy.
Unemployment remained high (16–18 percent), and bank credit to the private sector is
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.

-2declining (3½ percent decrease estimated in 2003). As countercyclical policies were
maintained, the fiscal stance was further relaxed through FY 2003/04. The central government
overall deficit is estimated to reach 5.5 percent of GDP in FY 2003/04, up by about ½ percent
of GDP (excluding a 2.6 percent of GDP one-off outlay in FY 2002/03). Current revenues are
estimated to have increased as a result of the net effect of tax measures and the positive
cyclical impact of the ongoing economic recovery. However, rising primary expenditures
(excluding the one-off outlay) largely offset those gains, on account of higher payments on
current expenditures, including wages. The rise in public debt accelerated in 2003, with a large
increase in external borrowing from commercial banks. However, the authorities were
successful in reducing interest costs and lengthening maturities through refinancing
operations.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors welcomed the ongoing economic recovery, led by a strong rebound in the tourism
sector. However, they noted that the recovery is narrowly based, and that prospects for
sustained growth remain uncertain, with high and persistent unemployment—stemming in
particular from the decline of the banana sector—posing a major social and political challenge.
Directors stressed that a sustained recovery will depend on fiscal discipline and perseverance
with structural reforms to foster private sector-led growth and diversification and enhance
competitiveness.
Directors noted that the attempt to revive growth through the pursuit of expansionary fiscal
policy has sharply increased public debt. While recognizing that, owing to a longer history of
prudent macroeconomic policies, St. Lucia’s public debt is well below that of its Eastern
Caribbean Currency Union partners, Directors expressed concern about the vulnerabilities
associated with the steep increase in debt in recent years. They emphasized the importance of
a strong upfront fiscal adjustment and continued moderation in expenditures to mitigate the
country’s vulnerability to exogenous shocks.
Against this background, Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to reduce capital outlays
in FY 2004/05, but also stressed the need for additional steps to contain current expenditures.
Directors urged the authorities to lay out a concrete timetable toward gradual fiscal
consolidation, identifying specific measures to rationalize expenditure and strengthen revenue
collection. Some Directors noted that the overall wage bill was large, and suggested that a
fundamental reform of the public sector would help to reduce it more durably. Directors also
recommended accelerated tax reform along the lines proposed by the Tax Reform and
Administration Commission of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean Countries, and the
prompt establishment of a Revenue Authority. They welcomed the authorities’ decision to
broaden public support for tax reform by circulating the OECS Tax Reform report for public
discussion.
Directors emphasized the need to accelerate structural reforms to enhance long-term
economic growth. In this context, they encouraged the authorities to step up their efforts to
foster a conducive business environment, while reducing costly tax incentives to investment.

-3They stressed that, in the context of the currency board arrangement, labor market flexibility
was required to facilitate adjustment to shocks and preserve competitiveness, and they called
for continued wage moderation in the public and private sector, and increased labor
productivity. Directors also encouraged the authorities to restructure the water company,
increase efficiency in electricity generation, and foster agricultural diversification to support the
tourism industry.
Directors expressed concern about the high level of nonperforming bank loans. While noting
that St. Lucia banks are appropriately increasing their provisioning for loan losses and
exercising caution in new lending, Directors urged the authorities to continue to work closely
with the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank to address the issue. They encouraged the
authorities to complete divestiture from the Bank of St. Lucia, and ensure adequate
supervision of the offshore sector, including by developing and enforcing AML/CFT
regulations.
Directors noted that, while some progress was being made to strengthen economic institutions
with the assistance of the Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance Center (CARTAC), the
consistency and timeliness of economic statistics needed improvement. The authorities were
encouraged to enhance reporting under the GDDS, and seek technical assistance through
CARTAC and other donors.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Ian Bennett, Executive Director for St. Lucia
May 5, 2004

Key Points
•

After a contraction of over 4 percent in 2001 and only marginal expansion in 2002,
the pace of economic growth in St. Lucia accelerated in 2003 to 3.7 percent. This
impressive turnaround can be attributed, in large part, to the improvement in tourism
– despite competition from regional destinations, stay-over arrivals hit an all time
high.

•

The authorities recognize that they will need to control the size of the deficit. While
there is no need to panic, with interest payments of around 3.5 percent of GDP, fiscal
retrenchment will play a more prominent role as the economic recovery takes hold.

•

The government is actively supporting the economy by:
o upgrading social infrastructure and services; and
o undertaking the necessary reforms to prepare for the Caribbean Single Market
and Economy by January 2005, which will bring unparalleled competition in
goods, services, manufacturing and trade to the region.

While my authorities welcomed the FSAP, and are in general agreement with the
recommendation of the FSSA, they share the concerns of the ECCB in relation to the tone
and interpretation in sections of the Executive Summary.
On behalf of the authorities of St. Lucia, I would like to express gratitude to the staff
for the very helpful Article IV consultation. The exchange of information with the mission
leader, and the rest of the Fund team, was extremely productive and valuable for the
authorities. The staff report very effectively puts St. Lucia’s current challenges in a medium
term context.
Growth is picking up...
After a contraction of 4 percent in 2001 and only marginal expansion in 2002, the
pace of economic growth in St. Lucia accelerated in 2003 to 3.7 percent, significantly higher
than the 2.3 percent projected growth at the time of the Article IV mission. This turnaround
marks a significant achievement, given the difficult period of slow growth in major industrial
countries and the fallout from the war on terrorism.
The main impetus for growth emanated from expansions in the tourism sector by 16.6
percent, growth in wholesale and retail trade by 7.8 percent, communications by 4.5 percent
and transportation by 2.6 percent. However, the overall positive performance was tempered
by reductions in value added recorded for agriculture by 10.8 percent. (Adverse weather
conditions and the outbreak of leaf spot disease, particularly in the last quarter of the year,
contributed to a 29.5 percent reduction in banana output.)

-2-

...due to a revival in tourism
As international concerns and expectations regarding the conclusion of activities in
the war in Iraq subsided, the level of international travel increased during 2003.
Consequently, St. Lucia registered a 4.1 percent increase in total visitor arrivals. Despite
competition from regional destinations, the island recorded a 9.3 percent increase in stayover arrivals to an all time high of over nearly 277,000 as additional visitors came from the
main source markets. The increase in European travel to St. Lucia increased a massive 17.6
percent. In the cruise sector, St. Lucia was affected by the repositioning of itineraries away
from the low eastern Caribbean to the northern territories in the aftermath of the war in Iraq
and the growing concerns regarding personal safety. Accordingly, cruise arrivals increased
only by 1.6 percent.
My authorities believe that the performance of the tourism sector – the engine of
growth for the economy – is evidence that the government’s investment in the tourism sector
along with its marketing and promotions, are paying dividends. Despite the most challenging
environments for investments and for operations, the tourism sector grew by 16.6 percent,
and stands as its most significant improvement in nine years.
The fiscal situation has become challenging
St. Lucia has a solid record of prudent economic management, traditionally running
only small overall fiscal deficits, and in some years, even overall surpluses. However, as the
staff correctly point out, the fiscal situation has deteriorated in the last few years, particularly
most recently as the economy was hit by a series of large external shocks. The authorities
recognize that – regardless of the cause of the deterioration – they will need to control the
size of the deficit, and take note of the thoughtful alternative fiscal scenarios set out in the
staff report. While there is no need to panic, with interest payments of around 3.5 percent of
GDP, fiscal retrenchment will play a more prominent role as the recovery takes hold.
For fiscal year 2003-04, central government revenues have increased by almost 10
percent, due to the upturn in economic activity, one-off tax measures and higher collection of
tax arrears. Moreover, the government recently introduced some additional revenue
enhancing measures. Initiatives include an increase in the departure tax for Caribbean
Community nationals by approximately 50 percent; a tripling of the marriage fees; as well as
a significant increase in commercial bank license fees. The authorities have also made public
their intention to increase fuel prices if the price of oil does not recede. They also remain
supportive of the on-going work on determining the feasibility of a regional, VAT-type tax.
On the spending side, some progress has also been made. Capital expenditures –
consistent with the staff’s very useful advice on this front – have been significantly cut back.
Salary negotiations with civil servants were difficult, and at times, bitter. However, the
outcome was quite favourable, and resulted in only a modest structural pay increase that
should leave the government well placed to control future civil service wage increases. A
one-time end-year bonus of EC $850 per person has been paid, which was largely

-3responsible for an increase of 11 percent in the aggregate outlays for wages and salaries.
It should also be noted that the government has undertaken a series of measures to
improve their debt management. Good progress has been made at lengthening the maturity
and reducing interest rates on government debt. Very encouragingly, a sizeable amount of
treasury bills were very recently issued on the regional securities market (at a 5 ½ percent
interest rate). This process of improvement should continue, especially as expert personnel
have been hired to run the new debt management unit.
Structural reforms continue
St. Lucians firmly believe that an active, and when necessary, interventionist
government is vital to their small-island economy – and that this approach has served them
well, giving St. Lucia some of the highest social indicators in the region. In this context, the
government was re-elected in 2001 with a mandate to upgrade social infrastructure and
services. Accordingly, they have been active on this front by:
- establishing a youth apprenticeship program – in collaboration with private sector
agencies – to stimulate youth participation in the economy;
- creating an agricultural diversification agency, to broaden the agricultural base and
help deal with the advent of the new banana trading regime;
- undertaking health care reforms, to support universal health care;
- making select investments – such as the establishment of a forensic unit – to enhance
internal security; and
- preparing a comprehensive incentive package to significantly increase hotel room
capacity should St. Lucia be chosen to hold the ICC Cricket World Cup in 2007.
While St. Lucians support an active government, they recognize that the island’s
ongoing success will, to a large extent, be determined by a healthy and efficient private
sector. In this regard, the island is undertaking the necessary reforms to prepare for the
Caribbean Single Market and Economy (CSME) by January 2005. When the CSME is
established, it will be one of the most significant developments in Caribbean regional
integration in recent years, as it will have a major impact on regional economies and regional
economic development. Not only will it spur economic growth, but it will also bring
unparalleled competition in goods, services, manufacturing and trade. A Task Force on the
CSME has been established to guide the process of St. Lucia’s participation that will include:
reforms to remove the requirement for work permits for a broad range of vocations;
procedures to recognize degrees and certificates; implementing social security agreements to
allow for the transfer of social security benefits; reforms to ensure non-discrimination of
taxation on CARICOM goods; and appealing and amending forty pieces of discriminatory
legislation.

-4Monetary and Financial Issues
The authorities continue to view the common monetary and exchange arrangement
with the ECCB as indispensable to maintaining low inflation, fostering prudent economic
policies and maintaining economic stability. They are working closely with the ECCB to put
in place the necessary supervisory mechanisms to ensure compliance with Basel Core
Principles, and to develop and enforce AML/CFT regulations. In this regard, the recentlyundertaken regional FSAP was seen as an important process in identifying gaps which
needed to be filled to bring the system up to the highest international standards. While my
authorities welcomed the FSAP, and are in general agreement with the recommendation of
the FSSA, they share the concerns of the ECCB in relation to the tone and interpretation in
sections of the Executive Summary. These concerns are more fully elaborated in our
statement on ECCU surveillance.
