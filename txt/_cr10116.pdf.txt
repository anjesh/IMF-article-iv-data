REPUBLIC OF PALAU
Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2010 Consultation
with the Republic of Palau
Approved by Kenneth Kang and Aasim Husain
April 12, 2010

Discussions were held in Koror and the capital city, February 11–23, 2010. The
mission comprised Mr. Lueth (head), Mr. Tokuoka (both APD), Mr. Gill (AsDB),
Ms. Alonso, and Ms. Berarpour (both WB) and was joined by Mr. Lee and Ms. Tira
(OED). The team met with President Toribiong, Vice President and Minister of
Finance Mariur, other senior officials, members of Congress, and representatives of the
banking, business and donor community.
Past surveillance: In concluding the last consultation in April 2008, Executive
Directors encouraged the authorities to build a strong consensus for ambitious fiscal
consolidation and to improve the business environment. They also called for adequate
resources to ensure reliable and timely economic statistics.
Exchange regime: Palau accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and
4 in December 1997, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on
payments and transfers for current and capital transactions. The U.S. dollar is the legal
tender.
Statistical issues: The quality of economic reporting remains weak and constrains
effective policy evaluation.
Technical assistance: Since 2005, the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre
(PFTAC) has provided assistance in national accounts, bank supervision, tax
administration and policy reform, and public financial management. A Monetary and
Capital Markets Department (MCM) expert assists with bank examinations and
supervision.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background: Palau’s economy has been hit by several external and domestic shocks, which
led to a record contraction among Pacific island countries. The global financial crisis
followed on the heels of a massive terms-of-trade shock, leading to a sharp curtailment of
foreign direct investment (FDI) and private credit. Tourism—the island’s main export—
tumbled following an airline bankruptcy, and construction activity fell as major infrastructure
projects reached completion. Over the near term, high oil prices and the decline in
infrastructure spending weigh on the growth outlook.
Key policy challenges: The single most important issue in Palau remains fiscal policy,
including its effect on medium-term growth as fiscal consolidation proceeds. Although the
United States (U.S.) has extended Compact grant assistance for another 15 years, the current
deficit would still need to shrink by 1½ percent of GDP per year over the next 10 years, to
avoid a sharp drop in spending when Compact grants end. The budget for FY2010 falls short
of this target. Weaknesses in the budget process have also led to the accumulation of sizeable
arrears and the drawdown of the government’s cash position. To sustain the economy in the
face of the required fiscal adjustment, Palau needs to identify new sources of growth and
revenue. In this context, the new administration is pursuing a liberalization of the FDI regime
as well as oil and gas exploration.
Staff recommendations: For FY2010, staff has called for the adoption of all revenue
measures currently before Congress (½ percent of GDP) and a reduction in spending by
1 percent of GDP, particularly on goods and services. Staff welcomed recent steps to
improve budget preparation, but still recommended—as a contingency—basing budget
execution strictly on cash availability. To achieve fiscal sustainability over the medium term,
staff reiterated earlier recommendations for comprehensive tax and civil service reform. Staff
supported recent efforts to generate new sources of growth and revenue, particularly, efforts
to liberalize the FDI regime. However, staff also pointed to the challenges of managing oil
revenues and cautioned against establishing corporate and ship registries. Staff observed a
further deterioration in data quality and availability owing to understaffing.
Authorities’ views: The government warned that Congress might reject some of the
proposed revenue measures for FY2010 and felt that spending cuts would be politically
difficult. The authorities remarked that cash-based budget execution is challenging as long as
incoming cash was needed to clear outstanding arrears and ensure service delivery. In their
view, some front-loading of U.S. Compact grants or debt financing were key for clearing
arrears and regularizing budget execution. The authorities concurred with the need for fiscal
consolidation over the medium term and are exploring ways to expand the tax base, including
to foreigners. In this context, the authorities were unconvinced that corporate and ship
registries would undermine anti-money laundering efforts, pointing to other Pacific islands as
examples.

4
I. BACKGROUND
1.
Although blessed with natural beauty and a favorable geographic location, the
young island nation still remains highly dependent on foreign assistance. Situated just
800 km east of the Philippines and among the top diving destinations in the world, tourism is
a main driver of the economy—both in the form of exports and inward FDI. The other
drivers are foreign grants, which currently amount to some 20 percent of GDP and finance
about half of government spending. With a population of 20,000, a third of which are foreign
workers, and a per capita income of $10,500, Palau is one of the smallest and wealthiest
Pacific island countries.
2.
Self-sufficiency remains a high priority for the new administration, which came
into office in January 2009. Successive governments have called for reduced reliance on
grants, with the medium-term goal of funding current fiscal spending out of domestic
revenues. Palau is also building up a trust fund to sustain current spending when grant
assistance expires (Box 1). While U.S. Compact grant assistance has been secured for
another 15 years, the new administration is looking for innovative ways to spur growth and
generate additional revenues—most prominently through the liberalization of the FDI regime
and the offshore exploration of oil and gas.
II. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
3.
The global financial crisis, compounded by some Palau-specific shocks, has
taken a heavy toll on the island nation (Figure 1). The economy contracted by close to
5 percent in FY2008 and, based on very preliminary indicators, 2 percent in FY2009.1 This is
the largest cumulative contraction among Pacific island countries over this period.


FDI contracted as many foreign firms lost access to financing. Uncertainty about
Palau’s FDI regime and the outcome of the Compact negotiations with the U.S. may
have further dampened foreign investment.



Tourism, accounting for almost half of GDP—the highest among Pacific island
countries—fell by a cumulative 17 percent over the last two years (in volume terms).



Foreign capital grants and public investment contracted as major infrastructure
projects, like the construction of the Compact road and its feeder roads, were
completed.

The fiscal year (FY) ends on September 30. Staff uses GDP estimates prepared by the Office of Planning and
Statistics in collaboration with PFTAC.

5
Box 1. Palau: The Compact of Free Association
The Compact of Free Association (the “Compact”) is a 50-year strategic treaty, under
which the U.S. retains control of defense and security matters in Palau. In exchange, the U.S.
committed to set up a trust fund and provide Palau with pre-specified grants in the first fifteen
years of the Compact. The Compact entered into force on October 1, 1994, as Palau became
a sovereign nation.
U.S. Compact assistance amounted to about 20 percent of Palau’s GDP on average over
FY1995–FY2009. Of this, 13 percent of GDP came in the form of budget support and
7 percent of GDP was for federal services—roads, weather, postal, and aviation. In addition,
the U.S. provided $70 million in seed money for the Compact trust fund (about 50 percent of
FY1997 GDP). The U.S. also provided non-Compact assistance over FY1995–FY2009,
averaging some 10½ percent of GDP per year.
The performance of the trust fund fell short of expectations. The purpose of the fund was
to provide a steady stream of income that would replace Compact grants after 2009. In
addition, Palau was allowed annual withdrawals from the fund amounting to $5 million during
FY2000–FY2009, and $15 million, thereafter (actual withdrawals started only in FY2002).
The fund returned 7½ percent per year through FY2009. This is above the benchmark, but
falls short of the 12½ percent anticipated during the Compact negotiations. By end-FY2009,
the Compact trust fund had accumulated $140 million, compared to $260 million expected at
the outset.
The Compact mandates that the U.S. and Palau governments formally review the terms
of the Compact on the 15th, 30th, and 40th anniversaries of the Compact and mutually
agree to any alterations. The first 15 years formally ended on September 30, 2009. After
initial delays, the two countries reached agreement on grant assistance for the next 15 years.
Under the agreement, which still needs to pass the U.S. Congress, the U.S. would continue
assistance at about current levels, including $13–14 million annual budget support and a total
of $28 million for infrastructure maintenance. Some of the budget support may be frontloaded, so that Palau can clear its government arrears, and annual withdrawals from the trust
fund would again be restricted to $5 million.

4.
Inflation has come down since late-2008, but prices are on the rise again. In
September 2008, inflation reached 16.8 percent year-on-year on the back of high oil prices,
severely cutting into disposable incomes and consumption. Inflation came down to
1.7 percent by mid-2009 (the latest data available), or broadly in line with other Pacific
islands, but anecdotal evidence points to renewed price pressures.
5.
Monetary conditions have tightened in the wake of the global downturn. Foreign
bank branches, which account for about 95 percent of banking sector assets, are flush with
liquidity as evidenced by a liquidity ratio of 77 percent (liquid assets to deposits and shortterm liabilities). However, foreign bank branches have tightened credit standards, reflecting

6
a reassessment of risks at headquarters and Palau-specific concerns about household debt. As
a result, private credit contracted by 20 percent in FY2009.
6.
Palau’s external position deteriorated as oil prices spiked and overseas
investments sustained major valuation losses (Figure 2). In FY2008, the current account
(including grants) deteriorated by about 10 percentage points of GDP to -18 percent of GDP.
While it has recovered somewhat since then, external debt continued to increase and reached
a record 38 percent of GDP in FY2009. Palau’s power company played a large part in the
recent buildup of external debt, all of which is on nonconcessional terms. Palau’s external
assets, namely pension funds and the Compact trust fund lost about 15 percent of their value
since the financial crisis. Taken together, Palau’s international investment position (foreign
assets minus foreign liabilities) fell from 4 percent of GDP in FY2007 to -33 percent of GDP
in FY2009.
7.
Fiscal policy continues to be too loose and the liquidity situation is becoming
serious (Figure 3). Domestic revenue fell and current spending rose over FY2008–FY2009,
leading to a further deterioration in the current balance (domestic revenue minus current
expenditure) of about 0.8 percent of GDP to -17 percent of GDP in FY2009. The current
balance has been worsening since FY2005, despite the medium-term policy goal of a zero
current balance. In addition, revenues and grants have not been sufficient to finance
expenditures, as evidenced by a steady drawdown of government deposits to $5 million at
end-FY2009 (from over $10 million in FY2007). While the latter has been a long-standing
issue, government liquidity is becoming a concern as government deposits are approaching
zero (and allowable withdrawals from the Compact trust fund are capped at $5 million).
Outlook and risks
8.
The short-term outlook remains clouded, with growth projected to turn only
slightly positive in FY2010. Tourist arrivals and FDI should pick up in FY2010 along with
the recovery in global growth and financial conditions. However, little stimulus is expected
from public infrastructure projects and oil prices are projected to rise by 35 percent between
FY2009 and FY2010. The latter would shave off some $10 million or 5 percent of GDP, of
disposable incomes and sustain inflation at around 6 percent. Downside risks include higher
than expected oil prices, fewer grants as donor countries struggle with tighter finances, and a
double dip in global growth, which would affect tourism. High household indebtedness poses
a further downside risk to growth. On the upside, an expansion of flight schedules could lead
to an increase in tourism.

7
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Fiscal Policy
Near term
9.
The authorities have made important fiscal efforts in the FY2010 initial budget,
but the supplementary budget will further undermine the government’s cash position.
The initial budget featured a 10 percent expenditure cut across-the-board relative to the
FY2009 budget. However, a supplemental budget of $4.9 million is likely to pass Congress
and would lead to an increase in current spending over the FY2009 outturn. This would still
reduce the current deficit by ¼ percentage point of GDP to 16½ percent in FY2010, but
would further worsen the government’s cash position by about $2 million relative to endFY2009 (without additional revenue measures). Staff also notes that tax revenue projections
in the budget may be on an optimistic side.
10.
Staff recommended cutting the FY2010 current balance by 1½ percentage points
of GDP to -15½ percent of GDP, in line with the needed medium-term adjustment (see
below).2 On the revenue side, this would require the passage of measures submitted with the
supplemental budget, including the elimination of food import duty exemptions and a hike of
the wage and salary tax for top earners (yielding ½ percent of GDP net of some fee declines).
In addition, the adjustment would require spending cuts of 1 percent of GDP, including for
goods and services, which rose by 1¼ percent of GDP in FY2009. Specifically, outlays for
utility bills, miscellaneous office supplies, and cars and buses—all part of the supplemental
budget—could be considered for spending cuts, while protecting social-related expenditures.
The proposed adjustment would lead to the accumulation of $1 million in cash, which could
be used to rebuild an appropriate liquidity buffer (ideally 2 months of government spending
or about $10 million) and/or reduce the $11 million stock of government arrears.3 The
authorities hoped that the revenue measures would pass Congress, given a high share of
nondiscretionary spending items, particularly wages. They also pointed out that the
government had reduced the number of schools on the largest island from 10 to 4, as part of
their expenditure consolidation.
11.
Tackling weaknesses in the budget process is key to achieving fiscal
sustainability and avoiding a further build-up in government arrears. In the past, the
approved budget tended to be too optimistic, as Congress over-estimated revenues, grant co2

These numbers are based on GDP estimates prepared by the Office of Planning and Statistics in collaboration
with PFTAC and have not yet been adopted as official estimates. If current official GDP numbers were used,
the needed annual adjustment would increase to 2 percentage points of GDP.

The government arrears consist largely of payment arrears to domestic suppliers. The stock of arrears has been
relatively stable at around $11 million since 2004.

8
payments were not always factored in, and previously grant-financed employees ended up on
the government’s payroll. Budget execution then proceeded on the basis of an unrealistic
budget, rather than cash availability, leading to a drawdown in cash reserves or the
accumulation of government arrears. The authorities pointed to significant improvements in
revenue projections under the current administration, as evidenced by a mere 1 percent
revenue shortfall in the first quarter of FY2010. They also noted that the President has issued
an executive order to create a foreign grant clearing house, which would help keep track of
implicit government obligations previously not reflected in the budget.
12.
Staff supported the current administration’s efforts to fix the budget process. As
a backup to the above measures, staff recommended to base quarterly budget allocations to
line ministries on the most accurate projections of resource availability for the quarter.
Moreover, the creation of a cash management committee, where line ministry and Ministry
of Finance officials meet on a monthly basis, would ensure a transparent allocation of scarce
cash resources. Finally staff noted that unless the budget process is fixed, the government
should abstain from foreign borrowing. While sympathetic to the idea of making budget
execution contingent on cash availability, the authorities pointed to the inherited stock of
arrears as a major obstacle. To ensure continued service delivery, incoming cash is used to
pay down arrears, leading to the reemergence of arrears at year-end. Hence, the clearance of
arrears, possibly through debt financing, was key in the authorities’ view.
Medium to long term
13.
Despite the renewal of U.S. Compact grants assistance, fiscal policy remains
unsustainable, implying a sharp drop in spending once Compact grant assistance ends.
Staff estimates that, to ensure fiscal sustainability over the medium-term, the current balance
would need to improve by 1½ percentage points of GDP per year over the next 10 years (see
Appendix).
14.
Comprehensive reforms are needed to sustain fiscal consolidation over the
medium term. On the revenue side, staff reiterated earlier FAD recommendations to
eliminate import duty exemptions, move to cost, insurance and freight (CIF) evaluation, and
eventually replace the distortionary gross revenue tax with a corporate income tax. The first
two measures could produce savings of 2 percent of GDP between FY2010–FY2015. On the
expenditure side, the reduction in the FY2009 wage bill is welcome, but further cuts are
recommended, given that Palau’s wage bill exceeds the Pacific island average by at least
1 percentage point of GDP. Other spending would also need to be reduced. In particular,
curtailing subsidies on water and sewage services (1 percent of GDP) by improving
efficiency of these operations would be key to achieve the recommended adjustment in
current spending of 5½ percent of GDP between FY2010–FY2015. The authorities
acknowledged the need for fiscal consolidation, particularly through raising tax revenue.
Given strong Congressional resistance to higher taxes, the government is exploring ways to
expand the tax base, including to foreigners.

9
15.
A discovery of oil and gas reserves (Box 2) could substantially change Palau’s
economic fortunes, but fiscal policy should continue to be guided by conservative
assumptions. Under the World Bank’s middle-case scenario for oil and gas reserves, the
required fiscal adjustment would decline to ½ percentage point of GDP per year over ten
years from 1½ percentage points under current circumstances. However, fiscal policy should
be guided by the latter number until actual production is firmly on track. There are significant
risks that extractible reserves turn out lower or that extraction is delayed. Also, maintaining
macroeconomic stability and fiscal sustainability in the face of volatile and exhaustible oil
and gas revenues will be a daunting task, given weaknesses in the annual budget process and
the absence of a medium-term fiscal framework. The authorities agreed that it was too early
to factor in potential oil revenues when deriving medium-term adjustment needs. At the same
time, they felt it was crucial to have a strong fiscal and legal framework in place once
exploration starts and appreciated technical assistance (TA) by the World Bank in this area.
Box 2. Palau: A Framework for Managing Oil and Gas Revenues
Palau is making new efforts towards oil and gas exploration (hence forth only “oil”). The
President has recently signed a contract with a Houston based company, which gives the latter
the rights to explore oil for 10 years, provided drilling starts before May 2010. Estimates
obtained by the World Bank show a wide range of possible oil reserves, with the revenue from
such reserves (in net present value) varying between ¾ of GDP to 8 times GDP, and a base
case of 2¼ times GDP. For the oil wealth to be translated into a broad-based and sustainable
increase in living standards, an effective fiscal framework for managing oil revenues is key.
A medium-term fiscal framework, supported by an oil fund, would ensure sustainability
and stability of public spending in the face of exhaustible and volatile oil revenues. Fiscal
policy guidelines or rules could be considered to impose some discipline on policymakers. The
more successful fiscal guidelines or rules (Norway, Chile, Botswana) relate to the entire
budget, instead of merely oil revenues, and are appropriately flexible. The oil fund would be a
government account to which oil revenues (above the line in the budget) are credited and from
which debits can be made to finance the budget (below the line). Oil fund assets should be
invested abroad to isolate the economy from oil price volatility.
National governments are in a better position to manage exhaustible and volatile oil
revenues than local governments. This is likely to remain a contentious issue, as the
constitution gives local governments the ownership of, and right to tax natural resources, if not
exclusively. With the spatial concentration of oil reserves, the assignment to local governments
would lead to great welfare disparities across regions. A fiscal policy that is consistent with
fiscal sustainability and macro stability also requires overview over various revenue sources
(taxes, grants, trust fund, oil) and access to a trust fund, both of which is impossible in a
decentralized setting. The distribution of revenues to local governments should be governed by
a formula-based intergovernmental transfer system that takes into account environmental
damages and infrastructure needs in oil drilling localities.

10
B. Financial Sector
16.
Palau’s financial sector has weathered the global financial crisis relatively well.
Three of the four foreign bank branches, or about 95 percent of deposits, are Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insured and non-performing loans in all foreign bank branches
amount to less than 1 percent. Bank of Hawaii, which accounts for about 65 percent of
banking system assets, remains a sound U.S. bank. There are three local banks with
significant financial and operating weaknesses and nonperforming loans ranging from 12 to
50 percent. However, the banks account for little over 1 percent of banking system deposits.
17.
Staff welcomed the continued improvements in financial sector oversight and
regulation. Staffing and funding of the Financial Institutions Commission is appropriate,
according to the Executive Commissioner, and the introduction of bank charges in FY2009,
as opposed to budget funding, has further boosted supervisory independence. After an initial
delay, banks started to report comprehensive financial data in the third quarter of 2009,
which has been fed into a database for offsite supervision.
18.
Efforts against anti-money laundering and in combating the financing of
terrorism (AML/CFT) are laudable and proposals to establish a corporate or ship
registry in Palau should be resisted. The AMF/CFT legal framework was upgraded with
the help of the Pacific Anti-Money Laundering Program and three Congressmen have agreed
to sponsor the legislation. The creation of two staff positions at the Financial Intelligence
Unit (FIU), which has been moved to the Attorney General’s office, is welcome. However,
according to donors, the investigation and prosecution of money laundering and related
offences will likely remain constrained in the absence of a financial crimes police unit, which
is difficult to staff and the lack of relevant AML/CFT expertise of prosecutors. Given Palau’s
limited policing capacity, staff cautioned against the establishment of a corporate or ship
registry. The authorities felt capacity constraints could be overcome and pointed to other
Pacific island countries, such as Marshall Islands, that were raising revenue through
corporate and ship registries.
C. External Sector
19.
It is appropriate for Palau to use the U.S. dollar as its legal tender. Given Palau’s
size and administrative capacity the costs of maintaining a central bank and managing its
own currency seem prohibitive. Moreover, close to half of Palau’s imports and 80 percent of
its grants come from the United States.
20.
Despite an elevated real effective exchange rate, Palau seems to have maintained
its external competitiveness. Despite inflation coming off its 2008 peak, the real effective
exchange rate remains 6 percent above its long-term average. However, the current account
(excluding grants) continues to improve from -45 percent of GDP in FY2002 to an estimated
-25 percent of GDP in FY2009. The sharp drop in tourist numbers was due to the bankruptcy
of a Taiwanese airline, since non-Taiwanese tourist numbers continued to increase

11
throughout the global downturn, albeit at a slower pace. The authorities agreed that Palau had
outperformed its main rivals with tourist numbers falling by 20 percent in Guam and Saipan
in the wake of the global financial crisis. In the authorities’ view, the resilience of Palau’s
main export can be explained by the island’s unique setting and sea life and the fact that it
caters to high-end tourists that are not particularly price- and income-sensitive.
21.
Going forward, the current account is projected to improve, but Palau’s external
position remains vulnerable. The current account should improve in line with fiscal
consolidation, but the external position remains vulnerable to terms-of-trade shocks and
valuation losses on Palau’s overseas investments. The narrow export base—90 percent of
exports are in tourism—is also a source of vulnerability. Staff pointed to the need to contain
the debt of public utilities and to allow for greater pass-through of global oil prices to raise
profitability. The authorities agreed that there was scope to increase the power company’s
profitability and noted that management had been changed recently to this end. Various
efforts were under way to extend the export base beyond tourism, including oil and gas
exploration and the formation of a tuna cartel.

D. Structural Reforms
22.
The liberalization of Palau’s FDI regime should give a welcome boost to private
sector growth as fiscal consolidation proceeds. There are several bills before the
legislature, all of which intend to replace the case-by-case vetting of foreign investors under
the existing regime by a rules based approach that is much less arbitrary and cumbersome.
Lower minimum investment requirements and open-ended investment certificates are also
important improvements over the current legislation. However, the list of business activities

12
that remain reserved for companies with Palauan strategic partners continues to limit job
creation and knowledge transfer and keeps in place incentives for front businesses (foreign
companies with a Palauan as front). The same is true for provisions largely left unchanged in
the new bills that require foreign companies to pay higher foreign worker fees and wages
than local companies.
23.
According to the Asian Development Bank (AsDB), land and labor issues remain
key to private sector development and important progress has been made. Staff
welcomed a 2008 referendum that approved the extension of land lease agreements for
foreigners from 49 to 99 years (together with the introduction of resident visa). On land, next
steps should include the introduction of land use and zoning laws to prevent unsightly and
unsafe uses of land and the development of standardized lease agreements to reduce
negotiation time and legal uncertainty. On labor, the president introduced a 6,000 quota for
foreign workers to limit adverse socio-economic impacts on Palau’s small population. The
authorities agreed that adjusting the foreign labor fee was a more efficient tool to steer
immigration, but explained that volatile Palauan emigration required a more flexible and
exact tool. They also concurred that unifying the minimum wage for immigrant and Palauan
workers would help reduce Palauan unemployment, but cited interest groups that favored
cheap foreign labor.
E. Statistical Issues
24.
Staff encouraged the authorities to revise Palau’s official GDP numbers. The
Office of Planning and Statistics has improved the GDP compilation methodology in close
cooperation with the PFTAC. This yielded GDP numbers—used throughout the staff
report—which corroborate earlier work by a consultant from the United Nations
Development Program and are 30–40 percent higher than official estimates. Real growth
rates also differ from those officially reported. The authorities explained that they need to
carefully examine the numbers before adopting them.
25.
Increasing staff levels at the Bureau of Budget and Planning is an urgent
priority. The capacity to compile economic and government statistics is deteriorating owing
to the loss of personnel with institutional memory and severe understaffing. Essential
statistics, for example on price levels, have not been compiled since mid-2009 and without
regular PFTAC missions national accounts and balance of payments statistics could not be
sustained. The lack of staff and data, if not addressed, would impede national policy
formulation. Recognizing the problem, the authorities have started recruiting new staff into
the Bureau of Budget and Planning.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
The global financial crisis, compounded by some Palau specific shocks, has taken
a heavy toll on the Palauan economy. Since the last Article IV consultation in 2008, the
economy contracted by a cumulative 7 percent. FDI fell as foreign firms lost access to

13
financing, credit contracted as global banks tightened credit standards, and Palau’s external
position tumbled as foreign investments sustained heavy valuation losses. Tourism was little
affected by the crisis, but took a hit in the wake of an airline bankruptcy, and foreign grants
contracted as major infrastructure projects were completed.
27.
Near-term growth prospects remain clouded with growth projected to turn only
slightly positive in 2010. While tourism and FDI should improve with the recovery in global
growth and financial conditions, higher oil prices and the lack of major investment projects
weigh on the outlook. Downside risks include lower grant financing as donor governments
struggle with tighter finances and higher than expected oil prices. On the upside, tourism
could get a boost from an expansion of flight schedules.
28.
New revenue measures and expenditure restraint are needed, not least to protect
the government’s cash position. Since the last Article IV consultation, the current balance
deteriorated further and the FY2010 supplemental budget implies insufficient adjustment
effort. Staff support the adoption of all revenue measures currently before Congress and
additional expenditure restraint of about 1 percent of GDP. The resulting adjustment of about
1½ percent of GDP would not only be an important step towards Palau’s goal of selfreliance, but also protect the government’s cash position.
29.
Staff commends the new administration for its determination to fix the budget
process as a precondition for fiscal discipline. The administration is also in the process of
establishing a grant clearing house, which would keep track of implicit government
obligations previously not reflected in the budget. In addition, staff recommends basing
budget execution strictly on cash availability and letting a cash management committee help
assign scarce cash to line ministries.
30.
Despite an extension of U.S. Compact grants assistance for another 15 years,
fiscal policy remains unsustainable. To avoid a sharp drop in spending when U.S. Compact
grants end, Palau needs to reduce its current deficit by 1½ percent of GDP per year over the
next 10 years. This would require comprehensive tax reform; including the elimination of
generous import duty exemptions and the move to CIF evaluation of imports, as well as civil
service reform, given Palau’s high wage bill. The discovery of oil and gas could reduce the
required adjustment effort, provided strong fiscal and legal frameworks are in place.
Government efforts in this regard, which are supported by the World Bank, are welcome.
31.
Staff welcomes the continued improvements in financial sector oversight, but the
planned set-up of a corporate or ship registry could pose new challenges. With
95 percent of deposits FDIC insured, the financial system poses little systemic risk.
Shortcomings in the anti-money laundering framework identified by the Financial Action
Task Force are being addressed, but plans to launch a corporate or ship registry could set
back recent efforts.

14
32.
Palau maintained its external competitiveness, but its external position remains
vulnerable to terms of trade shocks and valuation losses on overseas investments. The
real effective exchange rate remains above its long-term average, but the current account
continues to improve and tourist numbers have held up comparatively well. Going forward,
the current account should continue to improve along with fiscal consolidation, barring
commodity price shocks and major dislocations in financial markets. Palau’s exchange rate
arrangement—the country uses the U.S. dollar as legal tender—remains appropriate given its
size and limited administrative capacity.
33.
Efforts to liberalize the FDI regime and improve land and labor regulation
should give a welcome boost to the private sector growth as fiscal consolidation
proceeds. The FDI bills currently before Congress, if adopted, would mark an important
improvement, in that they replace the discretionary vetting of foreign investors by a rulesbased approach. The adoption of the 99-year lease and the introduction of resident visa are
also welcome developments. Remaining obstacles to FDI and greater employment
opportunities for Palauans are higher foreign labor fees for foreign employers and higher
minimum wages for Palauan employees compared to their foreign counterparts.
34.
The provision of high-quality data remains essential for national policy
formulation and surveillance. Severe understaffing and the loss of personnel with
institutional memory led to a deterioration in data quality and availability, which needs to be
addressed urgently. Staff also recommends officially adopting the GDP numbers compiled
jointly by the Office and Planning and Statistics and PFTAC. They are compiled using
internationally best practice and extend beyond the official estimates, which end in FY2007.
35.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on a 24month cycle.

APPENDIX I. PALAU: UPDATE ON FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY
Drawing on work done during the previous Article IV (in 2008), this appendix updates
needed fiscal adjustments for the government to satisfy the intertemporal budget constraint.
The following three scenarios are considered: i) a baseline scenario; ii) a scenario with a
middle case of oil related revenues; and iii) a scenario with a broader coverage of public
liabilities. The results confirm that current fiscal policy is unsustainable, highlighting that a
significant fiscal adjustment is required even under the scenario with new oil-related
revenues.
A. Framework, Assumptions, and Data
Framework
Closely following the selected issues paper (SIP) for the 2008 Palau Article IV
consultation, this appendix judges fiscal sustainability by examining whether
government fiscal operations satisfy the intertemporal budget constraint. Specifically,
the following equation is adopted as a condition for fiscal sustainability.
W + T + R = C + K,
where W is the government’s net worth, and T, R, C, and K are the net presented values
(NPV) of grants, domestic revenues, current spending, and capital spending, respectively.
The commonly assumed rate of return on the Compact Trust Fund works as the discount
factor to calculate NPVs. Under this framework, and in correspondence with the authority’s
own policy goals, the current balance (R-C) is chosen as the policy variable. It is set to
satisfy the above equation, assuming certain levels of grants and capital spending (see fiscal
assumptions below).
Assumptions and data
Medium-term macroeconomic and fiscal assumptions are based on historical data.


Macroeconomic assumption:4
 Real GDP growth rate: 3 percent
 Inflation: 2 percent5

4

These macroeconomic assumptions are the same as those in the SIP for the 2008 Palau Article IV
consultation.
5
Over the medium term, inflation is projected to moderate to 2 percent in line with the historical average before
the period of rising oil prices.

22
 Real rate of return on the Compact Trust Fund or, more accurately, net financial
assets: 6 percent.


Fiscal assumption:
 U.S. Compact grants: US$ 250 mil during FY2010–FY2024 (based on latest available
information)
 U.S. non Compact grants (on budget): about 7 percent of GDP
 Grants from other countries (on budget): about 4 percent of GDP
 Capital spending (on budget): 9½ percent of GDP.

A key exogenous variable is the government’s net worth (W). The government’s net
worth consists of the outstanding of Compact Trust Fund, government deposits, government
external debt, and government expenditure arrears. As of end-FY2009, the government net
worth stood at 55 percent of GDP, with the Compact Trust Fund, deposits, external debt, and
arrears, representing 67, 3, 10, and 5 percent of GDP, respectively.

than the corresponding
adjustment under the Compact renewal scenario considered in the 2008 SIP (10
points). This is mainly because the assumption about the U.S. Compact grants under
the current scenario based on the updated information is less favorable than under the
FY2009



23
Compact renewal scenario in the 2008 SIP. The government’s net worth stabilizes at
120 percent of GDP—a level about twice as high as the current level.


Gradual adjustment. Assuming that adjustments are made gradually through FY2019
starting in FY2010 (over ten years), the fiscal adjustment needed to achieve fiscal
sustainability would be 1.35 percentage points of GDP pear year. The cumulative size
of adjustment between FY2010–FY2019 is 1½ percentage points larger than the
immediate adjustment. The government’s net worth broadly stays at the current level
(in percent of GDP).



Sensitivity analyses. The results are fairly robust to varying parameter assumptions.
The tables below report the required adjustments per year under the gradual
adjustment assumption with various combinations of parameter values. The results
confirm that a lower rate of return requires a larger adjustment, but also show that
reasonable variations in the parameter values have a relatively minor impact on the
needed adjustment.

Scenario with a middle case of oil related revenues
The key additional assumption relative to the baseline is the inclusion of oil related revenues
of US$598 mil in NPV terms, from the World Bank’s middle case estimate.


Immediate adjustment. In FY2010, the current (non-oil) deficit would still need to
improve to -13 percent of GDP (from -17 percent of GDP in FY2009), although the
size of adjustment is much smaller than that in the baseline. This result highlights that
current fiscal policy is unsustainable even with substantially more favorable revenue
projections than in the baseline. The government’s net worth climbs to 400 percent of
GDP over the medium term.



Gradual adjustment. To achieve fiscal sustainability by FY2019, the fiscal adjustment
of 0.5 percentage points of GDP pear year would be enough. The government’s net

24
worth rises to 380 percent of GDP, moderately lower than that under the immediate
adjustment case.
Scenario with a broader coverage of public debt
The following additional assumptions are included relative to the baseline. US$46 mil of
public enterprise debt and US$50 mil of maintenance backlog are subtracted from the
government’s net worth. As a result, the net worth would be only 10 percent of GDP as of
end-FY2009.

ANNEX II. PALAU: RELATIONS WITH THE PACIFIC FINANCIAL
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTRE (PFTAC)1
The Centre’s assistance since 2000 has included 35 advisory missions, the participation of
officials in seminars (32) and secondments mostly in the tax administration area (10).
Public Financial Management
Palau did not request explicit technical assistance (TA) in this area from 2003 to 2006, but
joined the newly-organized Pacific Financial Managers’ Association (PIFMA) in 2006 and
hosted the Third PIFMA meeting at Koror in March 2008. PFTAC provided assistance in
revenue estimation and in developing the Financial Instructions (FIs) in 2007. This was
followed by training on the newly developed FIs in early 2008. Assistance was also provided
in November 2009 on setting up a cash planning system in all line ministries. Discussions are
underway now to assist the government in taking forward the medium-term budgeting project
being discussed with the Asian Development Bank (AsDB).
Tax Administration and Policy
In response to a request received in July 2003, PFTAC reviewed and provided extensive
comments on the draft “Registration Corporation Act” and the draft “Reinvestment Incentive
Act”. In early 2004, a customs administration mission visited Palau to design a strategy and
an action plan to modernize the Customs Division. In mid-2005, a tax administration mission
visited Palau to review the organizational structure of the Division of Revenue and Taxation,
and its operations. In mid-2006, a tax administration mission visited Palau to review the
organizational structure of the Division of Revenue and Taxation, and its operations. In 2007,
a tax reform and administration mission visited Palau. In respect of short-term revenue
shortfalls, arising from the 2008 budget, advice was given on improving the effectiveness of
the tax administration in tackling the high levels of non compliance, policy advice on
19 different short-term revenue raising options and longer-term reform. In September 2008,
the Minister of Finance requested the mission focusing on improving domestic revenues. In
November 2008, a risk management compliance plan was developed and staff were to
understand the concepts and processes to implement the plan. A follow-up mission is planned
for 2010.
Financial Sector Regulation and Supervision
PFTAC’s advisor was involved in two follow-up missions for implementing the Financial
Institutions Act (passed in June 2001). Subsequently, assistance was provided primarily

The PFTAC in Suva, Fiji, is a regional technical assistance institution operated by the IMF with financial
support of the AsDB, Australia, Japan, Korea and New Zealand. The Centre’s aim is to build skills and
institutional capacity for effective economic and financial management that can be sustained at the national and
regional level. Member countries are Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall
Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, and
Vanuatu.

6
through the use of peripatetic advisors, although three missions were undertaken during 2006
and 2007 by the PFTAC advisor to provide guidance and recommendations on receivership
matters relating to the failure of Pacific Savings Bank. As a result of recommendations by the
peripatetic advisors, and likely in response to the recent failure of Pacific Savings Bank,
needed amendments to the Financial Institutions Act were approved in February 2008.
During 2008 and 2009, the PFTAC advisor was involved in three missions to Palau. These
missions involved providing assistance in finalizing regulations for implementing the revised
banking law (which have subsequently been issued), drafting and implementing
comprehensive prudential reporting requirements for banks and providing training and
assistance in the conduct of an on-site bank examination. Additional missions are planned by
the PFTAC advisor to provide assistance and training in off-site monitoring and to further the
capacity of the staff in bank supervision and on-site bank examination skills.
Economic and Financial Statistics
PFTAC has provided significant statistics technical assistance to the Office of Planning and
Statistics (OPS) in Palau since 2003, partly due to the high turnover of statistics staff. Several
missions have been undertaken and PFTAC has sponsored statistical staff for secondments
and to attend regional training courses. The PFTAC statistics advisor undertook missions to
Koror in December 2003 and in April 2004 to assist the authorities in documenting and
improving the system of national accounts statistics (NAS) and with finalization of the
GDDS metadata.
In October 2005, the PFTAC statistics advisor assisted the authorities in revising NAS for
2001–05. Follow-up national accounts missions were undertaken as follow: June 2006 to
provide further NAS training for OPS staff; May 2007 to help finalize GDP estimates up to
2006; September 2008 to update NAS to 2007 and to produce experimental estimates of
national income and disposable income; and October 2009 to implement further
improvements in the NAS methodology, as well as to update the estimates to 2008. New
saving and net lending/borrowing estimates were also produced during that mission.
Counterparts were involved in the NAS development work and updating of estimates, and
were provided on-the-job and seminar-based training during each NAS mission. One NAS
statistician participated in a PFTAC half-funded secondment on data editing at Statistics New
Zealand in April 2007, while another NAS statistician participated in the NAS Training
Seminar conducted by PFTAC in Nadi in July 2009.
The PFTAC statistics advisor also provided assistance to OPS counterparts in improving data
sources and compilation methods for balance of payments (BOP) statistics during his
September 2008 and October 2009 missions. In addition, the BOP compiler participated in a
one-month PFTAC funded secondment on BOP statistics at Statistics New Zealand in May
2009 and a short-term expert mission to assist with improving BOP statistics was undertaken
in June 2009. A follow-up BOP mission is planned for later in 2010.

7
ANNEX III. PALAU: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP2
Palau became a World Bank Group member in December 1997. Since then, the Bank has
provided technical assistance in a number of areas, such as oil and gas, natural resource
management, and in the health sector.
The Pacific Regional Strategy directs the Bank’s work in Palau. It focuses on creating an
environment conducive to generating sustainable economic growth and employment, while
recognizing that small populations and the marked remoteness of the Pacific island countries
pose significant development challenges to the region. The country strategy includes
technical assistance to the government to prepare primary and secondary legislation for
petroleum exploration, development, and production activities, following on from earlier
work to aid Palau in developing its oil and gas sector policy. The World Bank is also
providing assistance in designing Palau’s revenue and distribution policy with the aim of
supporting the development of the relevant regulatory instruments. To this end, the Bank
prepared a report on the macroeconomic implications and related policy options and tools for
the management of petroleum revenues to facilitate consensus building across levels of
government.
As part of a broader effort to deepen engagement with Palau and other World Bank Group
members in the North Pacific, the World Bank has recently assigned a Senior Economist
based in Washington, D.C. to work with the government and outline a substantive program
of technical assistance. Under this initiative, the World Bank has begun to develop a broad
development agenda in the North Pacific, including in the areas of growth and development
strategies, institutional strengthening, expenditure policy, and public finance management.
The World Bank has also been asked to support the development of the National
Development Plan alongside the AsDB.
The Doing Business 2010, is the seventh in a series of annual reports investigating the
regulations that enhance business activity and those that constrain it. Doing Business ranks
Palau based on 10 indicators of business regulation that record the time and cost to meet
government requirements in starting and operating a business, trading across borders, paying
taxes, and closing a business. Palau was ranked 97 overall out of the 183 economies surveyed
for the 2010 report, which covered the period from June 2008 through May 2009.
Palau is an International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)-eligible country.

ANNEX IV. PALAU: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK3
Palau joined the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) on December 29, 2003, as its sixty-third
member. While admitted as a regional country, its country classification was to be
determined. AsDB prepared a Country Economic Report for Palau and the Development
Status and Country Classification of the Republic of Palau, which served as the basis for a
determination of Palau’s development status. On December 16, 2005, Palau was re-classified
as a Pacific developing member country. A more recent report prepared by AsDB in 2007,
Republic of Palau: Achieving Sustainable Development, provided a more detailed overview
on Palau’s economy.
Palau and the AsDB entered into a new 5-year Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2009–13.
The strategy aligns AsDB 's program with that of Palau's Medium-Term Development
Strategy.
The Outcomes or the CPS are: (i) improve public sector effectiveness to achieve the mediumterm fiscal strategy; (ii) facilitate private sector development; (iii) deliver safe water and
sanitation services to Palauans; and (iv) manage the threat of Climate Change.
Bilateral and regional technical assistance grants scheduled during the strategy are in the
attached tables.

ANNEX V. PALAU—STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of March 11, 2010
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data currently available have some shortcomings, but are broadly adequate for
surveillance. Recently, historical data in a few areas have shown significant improvements.
However, the authorities’ capacity to compile statistics on national accounts, prices,
government finance, and balance of payments is deteriorating due to the substantial reduction
in the number of staff in the Bureau of Budget and Planning. Going forward, the lack of staff,
if not addressed, would impede effective surveillance. The authorities have started
recruitment of new staff.
National Accounts: With PFTAC’s assistance, production-based GDP estimates through
FY2009 have been significantly improved. Expenditure-based GDP data have been estimated
at the same time. These estimates are about 30–40 percent higher in levels than the
authorities’ official figures, as under-estimation has been corrected across sectors. The
authorities have not yet adopted the new estimates as their official GDP numbers. Despite the
improvements in historical data, the authorities’ capacity to produce consistent estimates of
the national accounts will likely remain weak, unless the under-staffing problem is resolved.
Price statistics: A consumer price index has been compiled since 2000 on a quarterly basis,
but reported irregularly. The index has not been complied since mid-2009.
Government finance statistics: General government fiscal data are compiled as part of the
annual budgetary process. The authorities provide fiscal data to the Fund in a standard Fundformat usable for analysis, but data quality and timeliness is are deteriorating due to the loss
of institutional memory and under-staffing.
Monetary statistics: Monetary statistics have significantly improved. Previously, balance
sheet data were not regularly provided by banks to the authorities because they were not
legally required to do so, and hence the banks only filed quarterly tax forms to the Ministry
of Finance. Since Q3 2009, banks have been required to submit detailed financial statements
every quarter, including balance sheets and profit and loss statements, to the Financial
Institutions Commission.
Balance of payments: Together with national accounts statistics, balance of payments
estimates have been upgraded through FY2008 with the help of PFTAC. The authorities’
compilation capacity is weak, and will likely remain so without additional staff.
II. Data Standards and Quality

Dissemination System (GDDS).

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation
with Palau
On April 28, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Republic of Palau.1
Background
The global financial crisis, compounded by some Palau-specific shocks, has taken a heavy toll
on the island nation. Foreign direct investment (FDI) contracted as many foreign firms lost
access to financing. Tourism accounting for almost half of GDP fell by a cumulative 17 percent
over the last two years owing in large parts to the bankruptcy of a Taiwanese airline. And,
foreign capital grants and public investment contracted as major infrastructure projects, like the
construction of the Compact road and its feeder roads, were completed.
Monetary conditions have tightened in the wake of the global downturn. Foreign bank branches,
which account for about 95 percent of banking sector assets, are flush with liquidity. However,
foreign bank branches have tightened credit standards, reflecting a reassessment of risks at
headquarters and Palau-specific concerns about household debt. As a result, private credit
contracted by 20 percent in FY2009 (October-September).

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares
a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this
summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can
be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2

Palau’s external position deteriorated as oil prices spiked and overseas investments sustained
major valuation losses. In FY2008, the current account (including grants) deteriorated by about
10 percentage points of GDP to -18 percent of GDP. While it has recovered somewhat since
then, external debt continued to increase and reached a record 38 percent of GDP in FY2009.
Palau’s external assets, namely pension funds and the Compact trust fund lost about
15 percent of their value since the financial crisis. Taken together, Palau’s international
investment position (foreign assets minus foreign liabilities) fell from 4 percent of GDP in
FY2007 to -33 percent of GDP in FY2009.
Fiscal policy continues to be loose and the liquidity situation is becoming serious. Domestic
revenue fell and current spending rose over FY2008–FY2009, leading to a further deterioration
in the current balance (domestic revenue minus current expenditure). The current balance has
been worsening since FY2005, despite the medium-term policy goal of a zero current balance.
In addition, revenues and grants have not been sufficient to finance expenditures, as evidenced
by a steady drawdown of government deposits.
The short-term outlook remains clouded, with growth projected to turn only slightly positive in
FY2010. Tourist arrivals and FDI should pick up in FY2010 along with the recovery in global
growth and financial conditions. However, little stimulus is expected from public infrastructure
projects and oil prices are projected to rise by 35 percent between FY2009 and FY2010.
Downside risks include higher than expected oil prices, fewer grants as donor countries struggle
with tighter finances, and a double dip in global growth, which would affect tourism. On the
upside, an expansion of flight schedules could lead to an increase in tourism.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that, in the wake of the global crisis, the Palauan economy had been
hit by sizable domestic and external shocks, which contributed to a large contraction. Directors
commended the authorities for steering Palau through these turbulent times. While near-term
prospects have improved, many challenges remain however to be tackled to consolidate the
recovery and sustain growth.
Directors observed that ensuring a sustainable fiscal position remains the most important
challenge confronting Palau. They welcomed recent steps to strengthen fiscal policy such as
the tax measures currently before Congress, and encouraged further efforts to protect the
government’s cash position and advance toward the authorities’ goal of self sufficiency.
Directors underscored that gradual fiscal adjustment will be necessary over the medium term to
prevent a sharp correction once U.S. Compact grant assistance ends in 2024. This would be
achieved through the passage of all the revenue measures currently before Congress and

3

additional spending restraint. They welcomed recent efforts to improve the budget process as a
precondition for fiscal discipline. Looking forward, the adjustment would require a
comprehensive tax reform as well as civil service reform. Directors recommended a
conservative approach to possible future oil and gas revenues in the formulation of fiscal policy.
They welcomed the authorities’ work on strengthening the fiscal and legal frameworks for
managing such revenues, and encouraged them to continue drawing on technical assistance
from the World Bank.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to streamline the FDI regime, including the FDI bills
currently before Congress, to generate new sources of revenues and growth as fiscal
consolidation proceeds. They noted that higher labor fees for foreign investors and lower
minimum wages for foreign workers continue to impede FDI and employment generation for
Palauans.
Directors supported the continued use of the U.S. dollar as legal tender, given Palau’s small
size and administrative capacity. They observed that Palau has maintained its external
competitiveness, but remains vulnerable to terms of trade shocks. Greater pass-through of
global oil prices to contain debt accumulation in public utilities would therefore be desirable.
Directors welcomed continued improvements in financial sector oversight, but urged caution in
proceeding with the plans to launch a corporate and ship registry, which could pose new
challenges in fighting money laundering given Palau’s current oversight capacity.
Directors noted that high-quality data are essential for policy formulation and surveillance. They
looked forward to the adoption of the GDP numbers compiled with the help of the Pacific
Financial Technical Assistance Center and to the increase in staffing levels at the Bureau of
Budget and Planning.

Statement by Hi-Su Lee, Executive Director and Teea Tira, Advisor to the
Executive Director
April 28, 2010
Background
Our Palauan authorities thank the staff for their frank assessment of the developments in
the economy and the constructive exchange of views during the Article IV consultation.
The dialogue was greatly enhanced by the joint presence of the World Bank and ADB.
A decline in domestic activity following on the heels of the global crisis hit Palau’s
economy hard, resulting in a cumulative economic contraction of 7 percent since 2008. A
drop in foreign direct investment (FDI), completion of major infrastructure projects such as
the compact road and a fall in tourism all contributed to the decline in economic growth.
Sustainable growth in the medium and long-term will hinge on prudent fiscal policy,
liberalization of the FDI regime as well as oil and gas exploration.
Compact Fund Agreement
The authorities appreciate the continued support from the international community, in
particular from the U.S. Since the last Article IV consultation, negotiation of the compact
grant funding has been the authorities’ topmost priority and they look forward to the
finalization of the negotiation in the upcoming weeks. Conclusion of a favorable compact
fund agreement will give them breathing space to concentrate further on the necessary
fiscal adjustments.
Fiscal Policy
The current administration came into power in January 2009 facing a very weak economy,
uncertainty surrounding compact grant funding, and major losses in the compact trust fund
(CTF). It was a significant turning point for the authorities, strengthening their
determination to avoid repetition of the situation they faced in FY 2008/2009 of
contemplating too large an adjustment within a very short-time period. The authorities
maintain the long standing desire, shared by most Palauans, to lessen their dependency on
external assistance notably the compact grant fund and to pursue their underlying objective
of self-sufficiency.
The authorities see merit in staff recommendation of a gradual fiscal adjustment, though
they feel that the key issue in this context is the timing and implementation of the
adjustment. As such, the authorities believe that a clear and credible medium-term strategy
would be beneficial and are open to further technical assistance in this area.

2
Short-term measures
In the short-term, the authorities do not agree that an immediate reduction of 1 percent of
GDP in expenditure is warranted, given the current weak economic environment.
However, the authorities do see scope for a more measured mix of revenue and
expenditure adjustments measures, weighted towards increasing tax revenues. As such, the
authorities have submitted for Congressional approval measures to eliminate food import
duty exemptions and a hike of the wage and salary tax for top earners. These measures are
politically difficult, especially at a time when most Palauans are feeling the effects of
higher commodity prices. Though inflation has been contained compared with previous
years, the price of essential goods remains high compared to prior the global economic
crisis. As a step towards reducing expenditure, the authorities have started with reducing
the number of schools seeing the rationale to streamline government provided education
services.
Medium to Long-term measures
In recognition that an adjustment will need to occur to close the gap between projected
expenditure and revenue, the authorities will continue to explore ways and means of
increasing revenue and containing expenditure. On the revenue side, they are working
towards further expanding the tax base through refinement of the existing FDI regime and
increasing tax measures on visitors/foreigners. Part of the tax measures have already been
implemented through increasing departure tax on visitors and further consideration of
environment-related taxes. In respect of the oil and gas exploration, the authorities concur
with staff that, while it is too early to rely on potential oil revenues when deriving mediumterm adjustment needs, these will need to be taken into consideration as the project
progresses.
On the expenditure side, the authorities consider proper reallocation of resources across the
public sector as a means of exercising greater restraint on current expenditure as well as
addressing the issue of under-staffing in key areas. The authorities see value in expenditure
rationalization as a means of reducing and enhancing further the quality of government
expenditure. However, their limited capacity in respect of the required skills needed to
carry out such an exercise without necessarily disrupting government key services is a
constraining factor. They are open to assistance in this area.
Budget and Liquidity Issue
The authorities acknowledge that the liquidity issue is of critical importance in light of the
fact that stocks of arrears brought forward from previous years are competing for the same
pool of financing resources as government operations. Such arrears are due to domestic
suppliers and are currently being settled from domestic revenue collected within the
current period. The authorities have made efforts to ensure that the level of arrears remains
stable, and agree with staff that it highlights the importance of further enhancing budget
management processes. The authorities would like to clear the arrears through either:


possibly frontloading of the compact grant or,

3


restructuring the arrears – though this is relatively difficult given the arrears are
from domestic suppliers who require immediate repayment in order to maintain
their business activities or,



securing external assistance in the form of a loan to clear the arrears and allow for a
more long-term and structured repayment schedule. The authorities are
contemplating ADB assistance in this respect.

In all three options, the authorities will require a credible plan of action that supports
domestic economic activity whilst at the same time preventing further accumulation of
arrears. In this context the authorities view further enhancement of the budget management
processes as critical with the potential assistance from the ADB to include revenue and
spending plans that ensure sufficient room to make repayments on the restructured debt.
Structural Policy and Growth
Efforts have been made by the authorities in addressing the long standing issue of land
tenure, an impediment to private sector growth common across most of the Pacific islands.
A 2008 referendum approved the extension of land lease agreements for foreign investors
to 99 years from the previous 49 along with the introduction of resident visa aimed at
increasing certainty to foreign investment.
There is still a lot of work to be done in improving the business environment not just for
foreign investors but also for the local investors. In respect of FDI, the legislature is
expected to review several bills, all of which intend to streamline the existing regime
replacing it with a rules based approach that is much less arbitrary and cumbersome. The
authorities agree that further refinement of the FDI regime will be necessary and will take
into consideration staff recommendation. Clarification of land issues such as ownership,
zoning laws and land use will also need to progress along with labor and immigration
issues.
In working on improving the business environment, the authorities see value in
strengthening select productive sectors such as agriculture, tourism and fishing.
The tourism industry remains a lynchpin of economic growth but was impacted to a certain
extent by the global economic crisis with various developments funded by foreign
investors put on hold and tourism numbers declining. The authorities feel that, as the
global economy picks up, such projects would resume as well as expansion of flight
services and market sources will assist in boosting this sector. Nevertheless, the authorities
will continue to market Palau towards a specific niche market particularly high-end
tourism as a means of maintaining the balance between increasing growth in this sector
and preserving their pristine environment.
Development of the fishing and agricultural sector form part of the authorities’ long-term
objectives. In respect of the fishing sector, they aim to build on the outcomes of the
regional collaboration, Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA), on managing the regional
fish-stock as a means to capture a higher share of fishing profits. In respect of the

agriculture sector, the authorities see value in cultivating and putting to good use idle land.
They have noted what is happening in neighboring countries where local produce are
substituting imported items and would like to explore further such options.
Exploration of Oil and Gas
The authorities concur with staff that a fiscal and legal framework is key to ensuring
maximum returns to the nation as a whole from the potential oil and gas revenues. As such
the authorities have a taskforce in place overseeing the oil and gas project. Membership is
drawn from relevant stakeholders including the government (chair), the legislature and
private sector. With relatively broad representation, the authorities feel that the proposed
fiscal and legal framework will gain wide support and express appreciation for the
technical assistance (TA) by the World Bank in this area.
Data and Staffing
The authorities acknowledge the need to strengthen the statistics, budget and planning
office and advised that they are currently consulting with an overseas firm that will provide
long-term TA for the statistics office. They see merit for a locally based consultant set up
at key offices such as Statistics to not only build up the quality of the existing data but to
also build up staff capacity so that in future years there is a readily available domestic pool
of the required skills. They also request that they be given more time to review the GDP
numbers before formally adopting them.
Anti-money Laundering
The AML/CFT legal framework was upgraded with the help of the Pacific Anti-Money
Laundering Program. In addition, further resources have been put into the Financial
Intelligence Unit with a strategic move to the Attorney General’s office as a means of
maximizing use of limited resources. The authorities note staff concern but do not agree
that setting up a ship and corporate registry would undermine the efforts underway on
strengthening the anti-money laundering framework. They are currently reviewing what
other countries within the region have accomplished in this respect and will build on their
experiences in setting up a proper framework for a ship and corporate registry. They
consider that revenue earned from such a venture can be utilized to build the required
capacity and add to their efforts to strengthen oversight in all sectors.
Conclusion
Our Palauan authorities appreciate the recent Article IV consultation and interim staff
visits. Bearing in mind the challenges that they face, they remain committed to undertaking
the required policy and reform efforts necessary for long-term sustainable growth. They
also intend to work closely with the Fund through its technical assistance programs.
