IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with St. Lucia
On February 5, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
2015 Article IV consultation with St. Lucia.1
Background
On the back of strong tourism inflows and lower oil prices, the St. Lucian economy has
returned to growth after experiencing a recession in 2012 and close-to-zero growth in 2013.
GDP growth reached 0.5 percent in 2014, with transportation and hotels mostly contributing
to the economic recovery. The current account deficit is estimated to have narrowed from
11.2 to 6.7 percent of GDP in 2014. Inflation increased to 3.5 percent, mainly owing to
higher food prices. For the first time since FY2008/092, the primary balance switched to a
small surplus of 0.1 percent of GDP in FY2014/15, reflecting somewhat higher revenues,
including from policy measures, restraint on current spending, and cuts to capital
expenditures. Nevertheless, debt continued to rise to almost 80 percent of GDP reflecting
non-concessional interest rates and low growth.
Despite moderate economic recovery, unemployment rose to 24.4 percent in 2014. Youth
unemployment, in particular, reached 41.8 percent. Despite some reduction in nonperforming
loans, credit to private sector continued to decline. Compounded by robust deposit growth,
the fall in credit continued to add onto liquidity accumulation in the banking system, raising
excess reserves to an all-time high. The February 2015 decision by the Eastern Caribbean
Currency Union Monetary Council to lower the minimum saving deposit interest rate from 3
to 2 percent (effective May 2015) alleviated pressures on bank profitability and allowed
some easing of monetary conditions while the exchange rate, which is pegged to the U.S.
dollar, appreciated by 3 percent as of September 2015 in real effective terms from a year ago.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment3
Executive Directors welcomed the recent uptick in economic activity and the positive
short-term outlook on the back of stronger tourist arrivals and lower oil prices, but noted that
unaddressed vulnerabilities are holding back the pace of the recovery. Accordingly, Directors
encouraged the authorities to persevere with their efforts to improve the fiscal position,
revive bank intermediation, and push ahead with the reform agenda. Actions on all these
fronts hold the key to reducing unemployment, boosting competitiveness, and strengthening
St. Lucia’s growth prospects over the medium term.
Directors welcomed progress in tackling financial sector weaknesses, but observed that
non-performing loans remain high and bank credit to the private sector continues to decline.
They agreed that cleaning up banks’ balance sheets and facilitating a resumption of lending
should be top policy priorities. While some efforts require regional coordination, key steps
for the St. Lucian authorities to consider include a reform of the foreclosure and insolvency
legislation and the ratification of all the elements of the regional strategy for bank resolution,
particularly the law on the Eastern Caribbean Asset Management Corporation. Directors
welcomed the progress so far on complying with the international standards against money
laundering and the financing of terrorism.
Directors noted recent improvements in the fiscal balance, but concurred that St. Lucia’s high
public indebtedness limits the room for policy maneuver and poses risks. They encouraged
the authorities to formulate without delay a strong medium-term plan to achieve the regional
debt target and secure the sustainability of public finances. Directors generally agreed that
the fiscal adjustment should be based for the most part on current expenditure reductions and
aim at preserving priority capital spending and creating buffers against natural disasters.
Directors took note of the newly launched Citizenship by Investment Program. They
welcomed the emphasis on transparency in the governing legislation, noting that the highest
integrity standards could help prevent abuses of the program. Directors underscored the
importance of a prudent deployment of the associated revenues which may be volatile, for
example to finance key infrastructure projects or retire public debt.
Directors underscored the importance of ambitious structural reforms to reduce
unemployment, improve the business environment, and foster higher and more inclusive
growth. They shared the view that continued efforts are needed to diversify energy sources,
reduce the costs of doing business, and improve efficiency, including in port operations and
customs. Furthermore, education reform would help address skills mismatches in the labor
market

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 12, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context. A moderate economic recovery is taking hold in St. Lucia. Favorable
international conditions have contributed to improved demand for tourism, St. Lucia’s
main economic sector, and the external current account deficit has narrowed
significantly. The authorities have made some progress in addressing a weak fiscal
position. However, the financial sector continues to be impaired by nonperforming
loans, public debt keeps rising, and unemployment remains very high, while external
sector competitiveness continues to be weakened by an overvalued exchange rate,
economies of scale disadvantages, and structural bottlenecks.
Strengthening the financial sector. The authorities have implemented some of the key
elements of the regional strategy to strengthen the indigenous banks in the Eastern
Caribbean Currency Union, of which St. Lucia is a member. Prompt implementation of
the remaining elements of the strategy is a priority. Strengthening foreclosure and
insolvency frameworks would remove a major impediment to resuming bank lending.
Fiscal policies for macroeconomic stability. The fiscal position has improved, owing
partly to the authorities’ efforts, but also to capital expenditure cuts from lack of
financing. A sound multi-year adjustment plan, which internalizes the potential costs of
frequent natural disasters, would have benefits on confidence, the quality of
expenditures, and debt composition. Prudent management of the new Citizenship by
Investment Program, consistent with the fiscal consolidation strategy, is essential.
Reducing unemployment and boosting sustainable growth. The authorities have
made progress on their reform agenda, but continued efforts are needed to address
long-standing structural weaknesses and key bottlenecks, including low productivity and
price competitiveness. In particular, a more effective and focused education system
would help alleviate the skills mismatches weighing on labor market outcomes.

BACKGROUND AND FOCUS OF THE CONSULTATION
1.
St. Lucia faces significant challenges in its attempts to attain higher sustainable
growth. A member of the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU), St. Lucia is a small island
developing state with a population of about 170,000, upper-middle income levels, strong
performance on social indicators, and the highest stay-over arrivals in the ECCU. These
achievements are all the more notable in light of key challenges that have arisen, including a need
to diversify economic activities following the collapse of European trade preferences that supported
the traditional banana crop, limited skills and production bases, dependence on fossil fuel imports,
and relatively frequent natural disasters (Figure 1).
2.
The Global Financial Crisis had severe repercussions on St. Lucia. Visitor arrivals were hit
by the crisis in the two main source markets (the United States and United Kingdom) and the
cancellation of cruise ship visits in an environment of rising fuel prices. The strains in the tourism
industry spilled over into other sectors of the economy, including FDI-backed construction and labor
markets. Large exposures to tourism-related projects drove nonperforming loans (NPLs) in domestic
banks to a peak of 29 percent of total loans. The government attempted to support activity during
the crisis with an expansionary fiscal stance, including through construction stimulus and large-scale
active labor market programs, but in recent years market access has become more difficult, deposit
buffers have been drawn down, and capital expenditures had to be cut.
3.
Conditions have become more favorable recently. External conditions, including visitor
markets’ economies and fuel prices, are now favorable. Tourism activity has increased and is slowly
spreading into other sectors. The government has strengthened the fiscal position by enacting
revenue measures and negotiating a wage freeze with labor unions.1 The authorities hope to
strengthen their finances further, including by introducing a Citizenship by Investment Program (CIP;
Box 1), which is scheduled to commence in January 2016. The financial sector continues to throttle
the economy, however, as slow progress on balance sheet cleanup has constrained banks’ ability to
support the recovery.
4.
Discussions focused on strengthening the financial sector, securing debt sustainability,
and progressing with structural reforms. The authorities have implemented some elements of
prior Fund advice (Annex I). Going forward, further progress towards promoting macroeconomic
stability could include forward-looking plans for fiscal adjustment, prudent CIP management, and
actions to strengthen the financial sector. With respect to raising potential growth, staff advised
further progress on the structural agenda to allow the private sector to overcome potential capacity
constraints.

1

At the time of the 2014 Article IV consultation, the government and unions were negotiating a wage agreement for
the 2014-16 triennium. In view of the generous agreements approved in previous years, the government had
proposed a nominal wage cut. Ultimately, the parties agreed to a freeze.

Box 1. The Citizenship by Investment Program
St. Lucia is the fifth ECCU country offering a citizenship-by-investment program. These programs, which
confer citizenship on individuals meeting due diligence requirements in exchange for an investment or a cash
donation to the government, have enabled other ECCU countries to mitigate vulnerabilities from high debt or low
tax revenues. In return, applicants to these programs may benefit from easier visa requirements, protection against
political and security concerns, or lower taxation. In recent years, partly reflecting higher international economic
linkages and rising geopolitical risks, interest in these programs has increased dramatically, causing surging flows
to countries with long-established programs, and prompting other countries to offer similar programs.
St. Lucia’s program, which starts in 2016, contains both standard and unique characteristics. In St. Lucia’s
case, the program maintains a cap of 500 successful applicants per year and a net-worth requirement of at least
US$3 million per applicant. There are four types of qualifying investments, some of which are similar to those of
other countries:



St. Lucia’s National Economic Fund: This option entails a contribution of at least US$200,000 to fund
government-sponsored projects.



Approved real-estate project: Applicants may invest at least US$300,000 in a real estate project approved by
the government, either in high-end branded hotels and resorts or high-end boutique properties. The
investment may be sold or transferred after a period of five years.



Approved enterprise projects: This option contains single-investor and joint-investor options. For singleinvestor projects, the investment must amount to US$3½ million, and create at least 3 permanent jobs. For
joint-investment projects, the value of the enterprise must amount to US$6 million, each investor must
contribute US$1 million, and the project must generate at least 6 permanent jobs. The government has
selected seven sectors in which applicants may invest: specialty restaurants; cruise ports and marinas; agroprocessing plants; pharmaceutical products; ports, bridges, roads, and highways; research institutions and
facilities; and offshore universities.



Purchase of government securities: Applicants may purchase US$500,000 of interest-free government bonds
with a 5-year tenor and hold them until maturity.

These programs may help to reduce fiscal and financial-sector pressures, but also carry risks. In particular,
the real estate and enterprise options may help catalyze new investment flows and overcome a lack of financing
from traditional intermediaries such as commercial banks, which may be reluctant to extend credit to large
projects, particularly in the tourism industry. Similarly, the direct contribution or government securities options
may help ease government funding pressures arising from tight financing conditions in regional markets.
However, care is needed to prevent fiscal policies from becoming dependent on these flows, particularly in light of
the cancellation of similar programs in other countries. Similarly, these programs entail important reputational and
financial integrity risks, which necessitate strict adherence to standards for due diligence, governance, and
transparency. The cap on applicants and additional transparency regulations passed by the authorities may help
contain these risks. Among these transparency provisions, the CIP Unit will have to report annually to Parliament
on the activities of the program including on the number of applications, approvals, rejections, as well as detailed
information on the successful applicants.

Note: 1/ Tourism related industries include Hotels & Restaurants, and Transport, Storage & Communication sector.

6.
External sector performance improved markedly. The current account deficit is estimated
to have narrowed from 11.2 to 6.7 percent of GDP in 2014, largely due to a robust pick-up in tourist
arrivals and favorable food and commodity prices. About ¾ of the current account deficit were
financed through FDI inflows, which at 5 percent of GDP continued to remain well below the peak of
23 percent of GDP in 2007. Labor market deficiencies, high energy and transportation costs, and
economies of scale disadvantages, combined with an overvalued real effective exchange rate
continued to impair competitiveness (Annex II).
7.
Unemployment, however, continued to rise and bank credit to the private sector
declined (Figure 2). Unemployment reached 24.4 percent in 2014 as demand was insufficient to
fully absorb the growth of the labor force. Youth unemployment, in particular, rose to an alarming
41.8 percent. Despite some reduction in nonperforming loans, credit to private sector continued to
decline, reaching -6.7 percent growth y/y by December 2014. Falling credit, compounded by robust
deposit growth, continued to add onto liquidity accumulation in the banking system, raising excess
reserves to an all-time high. The February 2015 decision by the ECCU Monetary Council to lower the
minimum saving deposit interest rate from 3 to 2 percent (effective May 2015) alleviated pressures
on bank profitability and allowed some easing of monetary conditions while the exchange rate,
which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, appreciated by 3 percent as of September 2015 in real effective
terms from a year ago.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
The short-term outlook is favorable
8.
Growth is expected to gain strength in the short term. GDP growth is expected to
accelerate to 1.6 percent in 2015 and spread to other sectors. Continued strong tourist arrivals
should support activity in transportation and hotel sectors while real estate, construction, other
services, and agriculture should also benefit. Inflation is declining rapidly and is projected to drop by
0.4 percent in 2015, reflecting lower fuel prices, electricity rates, and insurance premiums. The
unemployment rates remained high in the first two quarters of 2015.

The fiscal position will strengthen moderately. The primary fiscal surplus is expected to
rise to about 0.3 percent of GDP in FY 2015/16, reflecting higher economic activity and a number of
new revenue-enhancing measures — including higher motor vehicle licensing fees, customs service
charges, and fuel surcharges — along with continued under-execution of budgeted capital
expenditures and the launch of the Citizenship by Investment Program (CIP). Public debt, however,
will continue to rise to around 82 percent of GDP.

Consolidating the economic recovery, however, will be challenging
10.
The credit crunch will continue to
constrain growth. Despite the early signs of
economic recovery, credit to the private sector has
continued to decline, reaching -9.5 percent y/y in
September 2015, reflecting tighter underwriting
standards and still subdued domestic demand.
While personal loans grew at a slow but steady
pace, banks continued to deleverage in the
corporate sector, particularly in tourism, trade, and
professional services. The deposit base continued
to show steady growth throughout the year. With

slow progress on balance sheet cleaning, banks are unlikely to revive credit to the private sector and
will continue holding their liquid assets at the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB).
11.
Significant vulnerabilities cloud the medium-term outlook. Growth is projected to
converge towards 2 percent in the medium-term, reflecting the continuation of ongoing
construction projects, additional FDI-financed high-end resorts and public infrastructure projects,
such as upgrading Hewanorra International Airport. Moreover, this projection reflects
implementation of structural reforms, energy initiatives, and diversification in agriculture. In this
scenario, inflation is expected to stabilize at around 2½ percent. Over the medium run, the primary
fiscal surplus is expected to increase further, reflecting full-year impacts of already announced
revenue policies, including the CIP, which would more than offset higher expenditures on rental and
central government transfers to support the operations of new hospitals.2 Debt, however, will
continue to rise, reaching 86 percent of GDP by FY2020/21 and almost 90 percent of GDP by
FY2030/31, the date at which the authorities have committed to achieve the ECCU 60 percent of
GDP debt target. The current account balance is expected to widen as higher imports accompany e
economic recovery (Table 3). Credit conditions should eventually normalize and moderate credit
growth resume (Table 4).

Risks are broadly balanced (Box 2). Upside risks could emanate from improvements in
external conditions including strengthening consumer confidence and labor-market conditions in
key advanced economies, which could boost growth and tourist arrivals beyond expectations.
Persistently low energy prices could exert an impact both directly through consumption and
indirectly through tourism. Fiscal outturns may be better than expected if inflows related to the CIP
exceed expectations and are directed at reducing debt. Downside risks remain significant, however.
In particular, the likely path of U.S. monetary policy could adversely impact St. Lucia through higher

borrowing costs and real exchange rate appreciation, if the U.S. dollar (to which the EC dollar is
pegged) continues to strengthen. Global financial institutions de-risking activities could impart
economic disruptions if financial institutions lose correspondent banking relations. Other ECCU and
St. Lucia-specific risks include financial instability from the weak regional banking sector, lower
tourism inflows if the U.S.-Cuba normalization diverts visitors, natural disasters, and the fiscal
position, particularly if policy implementation weakens in advance of the upcoming elections.

POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS
Achieving strong and sustainable growth requires a comprehensive effort to address
vulnerabilities and remove long-standing impediments. Key actions include strengthening
the financial sector, ensuring public debt sustainability, and reinvigorating the structural
reform agenda.

Strengthening the Financial Sector
Commercial banks’ limited progress in cleaning their balance sheets continues to
constrain bank lending. Non-bank institutions have provided some offset, but overall
tight lending conditions are a drag on the economy. The authorities have made some
progress in financial sector reform, including under the ECCU regional initiative to
strengthen banks. However, additional steps are necessary to implement the regional
initiative and enhancing the foreclosure and insolvency frameworks is key to address high
nonperforming loans. Global de-risking trends represent a risk for both bank and nonbank institutions.

Difficulties in resolving nonperforming assets constrain the ability of
banks to support the recovery. At 19 percent,
nonperforming loans continue to weigh on
banks’ willingness to provide credit to the private
sector. While some progress has been achieved
in resolving non-performing loans, further
reductions are hampered by the legal foreclosure
framework. Banks’ efforts to work directly with
customers to resolve impaired loans also
encounter difficulties. 3 At the same time, efforts

Some banks are offering programs where the holders of delinquent loans can sign the property over to the bank
and banks assume all the risks connected with the property sale by either (i) forgiving the outstanding amount if
negative equity results; or (ii) returning the difference to the customer in case of positive equity. However, the
protection provided by the lengthy foreclosure process weakens the incentive for customers to take up the offer.

to increase provisioning and speed up write-offs are curbed by low profitability, which banks
counter by raising fees. Against this backdrop, the heavy NPL burden continues to weigh on loan
underwriting decisions. Tighter credit conditions have intensified banks’ competition for wellestablished clients, while demand from smaller entities remains unsatisfied. Stronger competition,
along with the lower savings deposit floor, prompted a decline in prime lending interest rates, while
average lending rates remain largely unchanged. Banks report capital adequacy ratios above the
regulatory minimum and slightly improved profitability in the third quarter of 2015.

15.
Important efforts have been made to improve the regulatory and supervisory
frameworks, but more remains to be done. The new Banking Act, based on the ECCU model, has
strengthened the regulatory and supervisory frameworks, including by introducing higher minimum
capital requirements, a more effective resolution of failed banks, and a stronger depositor
protection. A prompt implementation of the remaining elements of the regional strategy for bank
resolution is however needed. In particular, the legislation on the Eastern Caribbean Asset
Management Corporation would allow banks to dispose of delinquent loans and return to normal
operations more quickly. This step should be complemented by the swift finalization of new
foreclosure and insolvency regulation and the adoption of the regionally harmonized credit union
legislation. Further steps are the development of a new insurance framework to improve regulation
and mitigate risks in the insurance sector and continued efforts to implement risk-based supervision
and Basel II regulation for banks and non-banking financial institutions. Lastly, the removal of the
savings deposit floor by the ECCU Monetary Council would help improve banking sector health.
Authorities’ views
16.
The authorities broadly concurred with the staff’s assessment of the health of the
financial sector and expressed their concern regarding the scarcity of private sector financing.
The authorities agreed that reviving bank credit is key to sustaining the economic recovery and
reducing bank non-performing loans may be necessary to achieve that. They also noted that, while
foreclosure regulation does play a role, other factors may contribute, including bank lending policies
and the absence of a credit bureau. Moreover, the authorities expressed concern for the limited
availability of funding to strategically important sectors like agriculture, construction, and tourism.

Global de-risking warrants close monitoring
17.
The global de-risking trend is a hazard to both bank and non-bank institutions. No
operational disruptions have materialized yet, but there are increasing concerns about the potential
loss of correspondent banking relationships, particularly among indigenous commercial banks. The
12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. LUCIA

Caribbean region is perceived as high risk by global banks, sometimes without proper differentiation
by country in the authorities’ view. Indigenous banks have responded by improving their reporting
standards, keeping close relationships with existing correspondent banks, and looking for additional
relationships. In addition, the establishment of new offshore banks is held back due to their inability
to initiate correspondent relationships.
18.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ efforts to maintain high financial integrity norms,
noting that they could help reduce vulnerability to de-risking. St. Lucia has made significant
reforms to close gaps with international norms on Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the
Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT). In recognition of the progress on the AML/CFT framework,
St. Lucia has been removed from the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force International
Cooperation Review Group process and has now entered biennial updating. Going forward, focus
should be on implementing the 2012 Financial Action Task Force standard. With respect to the CIP,
the Citizenship by Investment Act and its associated regulations contain a number of welcome
aspects with respect to governance, but close vigilance will be necessary, particularly on the
implementation of integrity safeguards.

Towards Fiscal Sustainability
Public finances have improved. However, a large part of the adjustment consists of
unplanned capital expenditure reductions induced by tight financing conditions. Greater
reliance on short-term instruments, which remain attractive to investors, adds to risks. In
staff’s view, a detailed multi-year plan to achieve the ECCU-wide debt target is needed to
strengthen confidence, preserve an envelope for high-impact expenditures, and build
buffers against potential natural disasters. Prudent administration of the new CIP,
consistent with the fiscal consolidation plan, is key.

Continued progress on fiscal adjustment is needed
19.
The authorities have made welcome efforts to strengthen the fiscal position. Since
peaking at 5.8 percent of GDP in FY2012/13, the primary deficit has narrowed in each subsequent
year to reach a small surplus, which is expected to continue into the medium-run. The improvement
partly reflects higher revenues, including recent measures as well as prior efforts to improve tax
compliance and raise VAT revenues. The nominal wage freeze and capital expenditure reductions
have also contributed to the improved outturns. Nonetheless, with spending pressures rising from
upcoming wage negotiations in the public sector and demands in advance of 2016 elections, more
efforts are needed to arrest the upward debt dynamics projected under staff’s baseline scenario.
20.
Staff advised that fiscal policies would need to consider enhanced resilience to natural
disasters. As other Caribbean islands, St. Lucia is susceptible to tropical storms and hurricanes. In
addition to the immediate threat from these storms, ensuing flooding entails additional disaster
mitigation expenses. As for other Caribbean small states, staff is of the view that advance planning

should incorporate potential future expenses associated with natural disaster recovery. Annual
damages associated with natural disaster recovery have averaged about 1.3 percent of GDP since
1990. The public sector’s share has been estimated at about three-quarters, or some 1 percent of
GDP. For the purposes of illustration, staff has assumed that a large-scale storm would occur in the
forecast horizon at 5-year intervals, entailing cumulative losses of 5 percent of GDP spread over
3 years.6 In addition to calibrating the fiscal adjustment in anticipation of future natural disasters,
there is scope to build further resilience to future weather events by an appropriate selection and
design of key infrastructure projects.
21.
The authorities are committed to the ECCU-debt target of 60 percent of GDP by 2030,
but have not yet adopted a medium-term fiscal framework consistent with that objective. In
the absence of such framework, the authorities would find it difficult to execute planned capital
projects owing to lack of long-term funding.


Under this financing-constrained scenario, which staff prepared with the authorities to illustrate
its implications, capital expenditures would decrease in line with expected market conditions,
but no other measures would be taken.7



Reflecting the severity of financing constraints, the primary balance would improve each year,
rising to about 3¾ percent of GDP by FY2030/31. Over the projection horizon, debt would begin
to trend down.

6

In the two years that elapse before the next storm in the scenario, losses are zero, assuring that over the 5-year
cycle, average annual losses match the estimated 1 percent of GDP observed historically.

7
Through the FY2020/21, bilateral and multilateral loan disbursements would be constrained only to the remaining
amounts on existing projects; in the long run, new loans are assumed at 1.1 percent of GDP per year. Long-term
bond issuance to fund capital expenditure would be limited to EC$68.2 million each year, reflecting expected CIP
bond placements and long-term issuance in markets. Additional amounts are expected to be funded through T-bills,
assumed to be issued at legal limits through FY2020/21, before tapering off from waning investor appetite.

14

However, in the presence of potential natural-disaster related expenses, debt levels would reach
69 percent of GDP by FY2030/31. The benefits from reduced public sector indebtedness would
be blunted from higher liquidity risks, as the share of short-term instruments would grow.

22.

In contrast, staff recommended a multi-year fiscal adjustment plan that takes into
account the occurrence of natural disasters.



Under staff’s projections, a front-loaded cumulative adjustment effort of 3⅓ percent of GDP
would be needed over the next four years to achieve the ECCU debt target of 60 percent of GDP
by FY2030/31. In this scenario, if there are no natural disasters during this period, the debt target
would be reached by 2025/26.



Staff recommended the adjustment rely more on current expenditures, which have lower
multipliers.8 In particular, the scenario envisages only a modest effort in the next fiscal year of
⅓ percent of GDP—in light of the elections—by improving cost recovery associated with public
events. In each of the next three years, the adjustment would be 1 percent of GDP.



In its proposed package of measures, staff saw room for important savings from anchoring
growth in the wage bill solely to inflation and by reducing public employment through attrition.
Additional measures could include freezes of central government grants to organizations and of
the envelope for government employee transportation allowances, higher healthcare fees, and
the elimination of non-targeted food and LPG subsidies.

8

In particular, in light of the substantial openness of the ECCU economies, fiscal multipliers are estimated to be zero
for current expenditures and revenues, and 0.3 for capital expenditures. For more information, see Gonzalez-Garcia, J.
A. Lemus, and M. Mrkaic, 2013, “Fiscal Multipliers” in The Eastern Caribbean Economic and Currency Union:



The financing-constrained adjustment would allow capital projects to be implemented
opportunistically when financing materializes, but it lacks transparency and transfers fiscal
control from policymakers to markets. The
quality of spending would suffer because
high-impact projects in new infrastructure
and disaster preparedness would likely be
sacrificed in favor of more rigid expenditure
commitments in the capital budget. In light
of the already limited share that high-impact
projects have in capital expenditures,
additional reductions would further weigh on
potential growth and add to vulnerabilities.



Instead, under staff’s recommended
adjustment, a credible commitment to sustainable policies would buttress investor confidence
and give the authorities greater control over fiscal operations. It would preserve a larger capital

budget envelope, which could be reprogrammed towards higher-impact projects to mitigate key
bottlenecks and raise potential growth, including in the context of a strengthened public
investment management framework. Lastly, even under the occurrence of natural disasters, debt
would remain sustainably on a downward trajectory to the ECCU-wide debt target.

Authorities’ views. The authorities acknowledged that adjustment would be necessary,
without committing to any specific course of action. They also saw merit in considering natural
disaster related expenses in their fiscal planning. They expressed interest in staff’s recommended
adjustment scenario and noted their intention to review it carefully. In discussions on the specific
adjustment measures, the authorities agreed on the need to maintain control over employment
levels and costs, and to consider streamlining non-targeted subsidies as a component of a broader
initiative to strengthen means-testing and social safety net programs. With regard to the proposed
reduction of tax exemptions, they were concerned by the possible impact on St. Lucia’s ability to
attract FDIs in light of the strong tax competition at the regional level.

Continuing fiscal structural reforms would support the adjustment effort
25.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ efforts on fiscal structural reforms, and encouraged
further steps to improve efficiency and sustain the adjustment effort. Over the past year, the
authorities have approved revised procurement legislation, strengthened cash management
procedures, and restructured the operations of Inland Revenue Department, which could help raise
tax compliance. With respect to cash management procedures, enhanced daily sweep arrangements
have already begun to yield sizable savings, further aiding the fiscal adjustment effort. Along with
these welcome improvements, staff saw scope to continue implementing public financial
management (PFM) reforms. In particular, technical arrangements for the adoption of a modernized
chart of accounts have been completed, but final approval is still pending. Full implementation
would also advance other PFM areas, including financial reporting. Other priorities include resolving
the backlog of public financial statements and strengthening the timeliness of income tax refunds.
26.
The new CIP warrants a prudent approach. In addition to the financial integrity risks
associated with the CIP, vulnerabilities arise from potential fiscal dependence on these revenues,
which can be volatile and subject to sudden stops. The annual cap on approved citizenship
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

ST. LUCIA

applications would be a strong device for containing these risks, and adjustments to this cap should
be made carefully. Further, receipts received under the contributions to the St. Lucia National
Economic Fund should be used either to reduce debt or for well-designed infrastructure investment
aiming to boost potential growth and reduce natural disaster vulnerability. Similarly, the government
securities option of the program should be administered in a manner that neither circumvents the
attainment of the ECCU debt target, to which the authorities have committed, nor adds to the
government’s debt rollover risks. Staff noted that one option to reduce these risks would be to roll
over maturing short-term debt instruments, which have grown substantially in recent years, into
these longer-term securities. Additional regulations or legislation to contain the use of these
revenues along these lines may be beneficial, and could be taken up in the context of fiscal
responsibility legislation.

Securing Higher and More Inclusive Growth
Low productivity, high costs, and supply constraints limit potential growth, which is lower
than in many comparable countries, including small states. Sustainably boosting growth
requires resolving key bottlenecks that constrain private sector development. Similarly,
reducing the high unemployment rate calls for policies to address skills mismatches and
boost educational attainment.

Removing obstacles to growth and reducing high unemployment
27.
Higher sustainable growth requires continued efforts to ease bottlenecks and reduce
costs. Before the global crisis, weak cost
competitiveness and severe structural
constraints were already evidenced by
slow growth and high unemployment.
These challenges had been exacerbated by
the collapse of the traditional banana
industry following the loss of preferential
access to European markets. Tourism has
expanded since, making St. Lucia the
largest destination in the ECCU, but weak
linkages with other domestic industries
and key bottlenecks have prevented the
development of a diversified economy.
28.
The authorities have made progress on their structural reform agenda. The new
commercial court will help strengthen contract enforcement, which is traditionally a key concern.
Steps have been taken to address St. Lucia’s dependence on imported fossil fuels and high
electricity costs (Annex IV). New renewable energy initiatives have been launched and regulatory
reforms have continued, including legislation to enable establishment of an independent utilities
regulatory commission. The modernization of port operations and customs, which is necessary to

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. LUCIA

address high costs, has continued and progress has been made in the dialogue with unions on a more
flexible work schedule that would contain high overtime expenditures and help reduce shipping fees.
The National Competitiveness and Productivity Council, established in 2013 to identify key issues
related to competitiveness and productivity, has issued its first report.9

subjects remain low, dropout rates are

with tertiary education is exacerbated by brain drain (Annex V).
30.
The authorities have undertaken a number of programs to boost employment, but
their focus on training could be strengthened. NICE, which aims to create sustainable
employment opportunities, was launched in 2012. Two major programs under NICE are JOBS for
direct job intervention, and CPIP, which targets small contractors to provide employment
opportunities on community infrastructural projects. Other main social and employment programs
started in the late 2000s including YAEP, HOPE, KSL, YEP, and SMILES. STEP was first launched in
1997. Of the total expenditure on these programs, which is equivalent to more than 1 percent of
GDP, only less than 10 percent includes a training component, and about 37 percent supports
apprenticeship.10
31.


Staff recommended focusing on four key areas:
Reforming the energy sector. Prompt implementation of the renewable energy initiatives is key
to diversifying sources and reducing costs. In addition, there is ample scope for improving
energy efficiency. Lastly, it is necessary to complete regulatory reforms, including revisiting the
allowable rate of return to the electricity supplier.

9

In particular, the report recommends a closer link between wages and productivity and strengthening labor market
information systems.



Addressing costs at the ports and customs. While many of St. Lucia’s structural competitiveness
weaknesses are typical of the region, costs associated with clearing imports and exports
through the ports are unusually large. Continued modernization of port operations and
customs remains crucial. Priorities include fully automating the registration system and
finalizing negotiations for a more flexible work schedule for port operations.



Improving other aspects of the business environment. High costs of doing business—especially
difficulties in obtaining credit and registering property—are also key impediments to growth.
The authorities have started addressing these issues, but reforms of the foreclosure legislation,
bankruptcy procedures, and property registration are urgently needed.



Reducing the skills mismatch. There is scope to improve the effectiveness and enhance the focus
of the educational system and the employment programs. Reforms should focus on (i)
reinforcing efforts to develop an effective technical and vocational education system; (ii)
expanding the training component of employment programs; (iii) increasing provisions for
tertiary and continuing education for youth and adults; (iv) improving performance
measurement in the education system to enhance quality and cost-effectiveness; and (v)
monitoring labor market needs on a more regular basis to ensure matching between supply and
demand.

32.
Authorities’ views. The authorities reiterated their commitment to improve the business
environment and enhance competitiveness while noting their past achievements. They broadly
agreed with staff priorities and recommendations. They concurred on the need to address
challenges in the labor market and the education system, but noted that the options to expand
training in employment programs are limited owing to the lack of incentives for beneficiaries, the
social welfare implications of a less generous system, and the challenges in setting up a targeted
system due to capacity constraints.

STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
The economic recovery and a strengthening fiscal position have contributed to
reducing short-term risks. Favorable external conditions have set the St. Lucian economy back on
a growth path after a recession in 2012 and close-to-zero growth in 2013. Improved economic
conditions have contributed to reducing external and fiscal vulnerabilities. The external current
account deficit has narrowed significantly while additional revenues from stronger economic activity
and fiscal measures, and the under-execution of the capital budget have led to a small primary fiscal
surplus in fiscal year 2014/15.
34.
The short-term growth outlook is positive, but many impediments remain to
consolidating the recovery. Persistent weaknesses constrain the ability of banks to support the
private sector and lack of long-term funding is affecting the implementation of public investment
projects. While under-execution of capital spending is helping to strengthen the fiscal position,
delaying key infrastructure investment has a negative impact on medium-term growth prospects.

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. LUCIA

Lack of skilled workers continue to limit the expansion of firms in all sectors while unemployment
remains very high, particularly among the youth, and mostly of structural nature. Supply bottlenecks,
low productivity, and high costs limit medium-term growth prospects well below what is necessary
to reduce unemployment on a durable basis.
35.
High public debt remains a key vulnerability. At about 80 percent of GDP and rising,
public debt is far above the ECCU’s target ceiling of 60 percent of GDP by 2030, high by
international standards, and ever-increasing interest payments limit the budget resources available
for other uses, including high-impact social and infrastructure spending. Primary fiscal surpluses are
expected to continue, reflecting, among other things, inflows from the new Citizenship by
Investment Program. The size of these surpluses, however, is not likely to be sufficient to prevent the
debt ratio from rising further, unless further adjustment measures are taken.
36.
Addressing weak bank balance sheets is a priority. Some progress has been achieved in
resolving non-performing loans, but further reductions are hampered by the lengthy foreclosure
process. Despite increased lending activity from credit unions and micro-finance institutions, limited
financing opportunities continue to be a drag on the economy. A swift reform of the foreclosure and
insolvency regulation, and a prompt implementation of the remaining elements of the regional
strategy for bank resolution, including the legislation on the Eastern Caribbean Asset Management
Corporation, would help complete the healing process of the banking sector. Adopting the
regionally harmonized credit union legislation would strengthen the regulatory framework in the
non-bank financial sector.
37.
A sound medium-term plan is needed to put public debt on a sustainable path. The
authorities are committed to the ECCU-wide debt target ceiling, but have not yet formulated and
presented a medium-term plan on how to achieve this target. Such a plan is necessary to strengthen
confidence and provide buffers for risks, including from natural disasters. A limited adjustment over
the next four years could accomplish these objectives. This adjustment could be based mostly on
targeted expenditure reductions, and would preserve high-impact projects in new infrastructure and
disaster preparedness. It would also make room for social protection programs to respond to the
needs arising from the reduction of untargeted subsidies. Under this plan, the authorities would be
able to regain control over the composition of expenditure and reduce the risks connected with the
accumulation of short-term debt.
38.
The Citizenship by Investment Program provides new opportunities, but requires a
prudent approach. The Citizenship by Investment Act and its associated regulations contain a
number of welcome aspects in regard to governance arrangements, which are essential for the
success of the program. A prudent use of the annual cap on approved citizenship applications would
help reduce the risk of fiscal dependence on volatile inflows. Additionally, these revenues should be
directed to lower public debt or to improve growth-enhancing infrastructure.
39.
The authorities have made progress on their structural reform agenda, but important
areas remain to be addressed and rapid implementation is key. Important steps have been
taken to address St. Lucia’s dependence on imported fossil fuels, improve the business environment,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

ST. LUCIA

and modernize port operations and customs. Reformed procurement legislation and improved cash
management procedures have enhanced public financial management. More efforts, however, are
needed to rationalize and refocus the education system and address labor skill mismatches.
40.
Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance despite weaknesses in coverage,
frequency, quality, and timeliness, in particular regarding the national accounts, the public sector
beyond the central government, and the balance of payments.
41.
The safeguards framework is relatively sound. St. Lucia is a member of the ECCB, and an
update safeguards assessment is underway. The previous assessment, concluded in April 2012,
found that the ECCB continued to maintain a relatively sound safeguards framework.
42.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV Consultation for St. Lucia take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Annex II. External Position Assessment
St. Lucia’s external position benefited from a robust pick-up in tourist activity and favorable
commodity prices, bringing the current account deficit from 11 percent in 2013 to a preliminary
estimate of 6.7 percent of GDP in 2014. After more than a decade of persistent double-digit current
account deficits, St. Lucia’s external position is estimated to have improved significantly in 2014
largely owing to the recovery of tourism exports and lower food and commodity prices.
The current account deficit is expected to widen gradually over the medium term reflecting a
structural lack of competitiveness. The near term external position is projected to benefit from
favorable commodity and fuel prices. Over the medium term, however, the projected current
account deficit is expected to return to historical levels, reflecting stabilizing commodity and fuel
prices. Higher FDI inflows are likely to encourage FDI-related import growth, while sustained
economic growth and tourism activity pick-up is expected to boost consumer imports. The trade
deficit is also projected to deteriorate on account of subdued export growth, reflecting product and
labor market frictions, high energy and transportation costs, burdensome bureaucratic procedures,
economies of scale disadvantages, and an overvalued real exchange rate, all of which continue to
impair the competitiveness of St. Lucia’s external sector.
Bottlenecks continue to constrain St. Lucia’s productivity, export growth and diversification,
also reflected in the declining tourism market share. Subdued economic growth, accompanied
by rigid labor market conditions and expanding

Empirical evidence points to the presence of some exchange rate overvaluation. The standard
EBA-lite estimates suggest some degree of overvaluation of the real effective exchange rate in 2014.
The current account balance of -6.7 percent of GDP was lower in 2014 than the estimated “norm” of
-3.6 percent of GDP, suggesting an overvaluation of the real effective exchange rate of about
11 percent. Meanwhile, REER-based EBA-lite approach points to an overvaluation of the real
effective exchange rate of about 2.3 percent in 2014. These results suggest somewhat lower
misalignment when compared to the 2014 Staff Report largely on account of lower current account
deficit over the medium term, owing to the

Annex III. Debt Sustainability Analysis

1

Debt levels have risen rapidly in recent years. Many standard vulnerability indicators already exceed
prudential thresholds, including on debt levels, financing requirements, length of maturities, and
usage of external sources, as illustrated by the heat map (Figure A1). In the absence of an
adjustment plan to achieve the authorities’ announced fiscal targets, public sector debt would
remain on an upward trajectory. Although the pace of debt accumulation is expected to slow down
relative to recent consultations, debt dynamics remain unsustainable under the staff’s baseline as
well as standard adverse scenarios.
Background
A large and rising public sector debt burden constitutes one of the most serious
vulnerabilities for St. Lucia’s economic outlook. The dramatic rise in public debt began around
the time the traditional banana industry collapsed in the mid-1990s and was aggravated by the
fallout of September 11, 2001, the slow recovery in the United States from the early-2000s recession,
and the global financial crisis. Between FY1996/97 and FY2014/15, public debt has risen from 28 to
79 percent of GDP.

Structure of Central Government Debt

Sources: St. Lucian Authorities and Fund staff calculations.

Coverage. Central government obligations constitute the largest share of St. Lucia’s public
debt and have been rising over time. These debts include market-based securities,
commercial bank bonds and loans, bilateral and multilateral debt, loans from the national
insurance scheme (NIC), overdraft facilities, and outstanding payables. Public debt also
includes the loans from the domestic commercial banks and the NIC to the statutory
enterprises, both guaranteed and non-guaranteed debts, and loans from multilateral
development institutions, of which all are subject to guarantees. In contrast to the central
government, other public sector debt has been stable in recent years.

St. Lucia, classified as an upper-middle income country, has an IDA-blend status from the World Bank. St. Lucia is
also able to borrow from the Fund under PRGT facilities. However, reflecting the preponderance of market-based
instruments in St. Lucia’s public sector debt, staff has been using the market access country DSA.



Instruments. Despite having access to concessional forms of financing, the majority of
St. Lucia’s debt is market-based. Bilateral and multilateral debt amounts to one quarter of
total public debt, of which the Caribbean Development Bank is the largest creditor. In
contrast, the remaining three-quarters of St. Lucia’s debt instruments have been issued on
commercial terms. The ECCU Regional Government Securities Market (RGSM), is the largest
market in which St. Lucia has issued sovereign debt instruments, accounting for about
40 percent of total central government debt. As St. Lucia has over time saturated the RGSM,
becoming the largest issuer in the market by far, other sources have increasingly been
tapped, including issues on the Trinidad and Tobago securities exchange, debt instruments
listed on the Eastern Caribbean Securities Exchange, other private placements, and bonds
and loans issued directly to the NIC. In each of these markets, there is a mix of short-term

Vulnerabilities posed by public debt. The characteristics of St. Lucia’s debt stock, which
stands at 79.6 percent of GDP—in excess of the 60 percent threshold—and substantial
borrowing requirements result in breaches of key thresholds under the baseline scenario. As
a result, the heat map shows the highest vulnerability in most cells. Other indicators, such as

Baseline Scenario
Staff’s baseline scenario projects an unsustainable debt burden. Under the baseline scenario, the
output gap is expected to close, with real GDP growth approaching 2 percent, close to the average
of 1.9 percent observed over the past 25 years. Inflation, which tends to be volatile in St. Lucia,
should remain moderate and within a range of 1-2½ percent. The medium-term primary fiscal
balance is set to remain in slight surplus of 0.6 percent of GDP, with interest expenses rising over the
projection horizon. As a result, public debt is set to rise steadily, reaching 86 percent of GDP by
2020/21 and 90 percent of GDP by FY2030/31, the date in which the authorities have pledged to
attain a 60 percent of GDP debt level.

Although conclusions are broadly the same, the outlook is somewhat more favorable than in
past consultations. In the 2014 Article IV consultation, debt was also projected to be on an
unsustainable trajectory and was expected to reach 110 percent of GDP in FY2020/21, much higher
than the 86 percent currently expected, reflecting a number of factors including:


Revisions to national accounts data: A recently issued revision to the national accounts
resulted in a 1¼ percent increase in the level of nominal GDP in FY2013/14 (the last year of
data in the previous Article IV consultation). The one-off increase in the denominator has
reduced the debt-to-GDP ratio by about ¼ percent throughout the projection horizon.



Better-than-expected growth outturns and improved projections: Real GDP growth was
stronger than expected last year, and FY2015/16 results are expected to be positively
impacted by upwardly revised real output growth projections for the advanced economies
as well as the late-2014 fall in oil prices, which was not foreseen at the time of the last
consultation.



Net improvements in the fiscal outlook: In the previous Article IV consultation, projections
assumed implementation of the authorities’ announced intentions to provide substantial
income tax relief to individuals and corporations, execute the capital budget at high levels of
expenditures, and negotiate a five percent wage cut. In the event, the authorities did not
implement the tax relief measures, reduced capital expenditures, and negotiated a wage
freeze, instead of a cut. Additionally, new revenue measures have been introduced since the
last consultation and the capital budget cuts are expected to persist, due to tight financing
conditions. On net, the medium-term projected primary balance has been revised up
3.4 percentage points of GDP, substantially reducing debt accumulation.



Lower interest expenditures: In line with the improved primary balance projections and lower
debt accumulations, interest expenditures are lower.

On the basis of prior forecast errors and other countries’ experiences, projections are subject
to risks. Since 2006, growth projections have generally been more optimistic than outturns.
Projections for the primary balance and inflation have not been over-optimistic, but errors have
been large in either direction, likely reflecting the high degree of macroeconomic volatility that is
typical of small developing states. The maximum projected three-year adjustment in the cyclically
adjusted primary balance, at 5½ percent of GDP between FY2012/13 and FY2015/16, suggests an
expected strong performance relative to international experience. However, the downside risk to
projections suggested by this metric is mitigated by distortions from retroactive wage payments in
FY2012/13 as well as by staff’s expectation of limited further adjustment over the medium run. The
highest level of the cyclically adjusted balance is weak relative to the world sample and does not
suggest a downside risk to projections. Finally, risks associated with contingent liabilities from the
financial sector have likely lessened following improvements in the reported financial performance
of banks.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. LUCIA

Alternative scenarios
Under adverse shock scenarios, the baseline debt path becomes even less sustainable.


Growth shock: The growth shock, which simulates a one standard deviation adverse shock to
real GDP growth over 2016-17 has the most severe outcome. In this scenario, the two-year
economic contraction would result in decreased inflation, in line with the widening of the
output gap; a wider primary deficit; and higher government borrowing costs. By FY2020/21,
public debt would reach 93 percent of GDP.



Primary balance, interest rate, and exchange rate shocks: Other adverse shock scenarios have
more modest effects, resulting in debt approaching levels around 1-4 percentage points of
GDP higher than under the baseline. The most severe is the real interest rate shock, in which
case the government’s effective interest rate rises to its highest historical level permanently
starting in FY2016/17. Less severe is the primary balance shock, which envisages a ½
standard deviation deterioration in the primary balance over FY2016/17-FY2017/18, followed
by a 5 percent real exchange rate shock. The risk suggested by the latter scenario is
mitigated by the near currency board arrangement for the Eastern Caribbean dollar.



Combined macro-fiscal shock: The combined macro-fiscal shock is more severe than the
macro-fiscal stress tests, with public debt reaching 114 percent by FY2020/21. The severity of
this scenario reflects the common real sector and primary balance assumptions as under the
real GDP growth shock scenario, plus a rise in the effective interest rate.



Adjustment scenarios:2 Under staff’s recommended adjustment scenario, measures are
implemented totaling 3⅓ percent of GDP spread over FY2016/17-FY2019/20, with an
expected disaster recovery projected over FY2017/18-FY2019/20. Subjecting this scenario to
the growth, inflation, and interest rate shocks of the combined macro-fiscal shock scenario
(the exchange rate depreciation has been excluded due to the exchange rate arrangement)
causes debt to rise up at first, reflecting the deterioration in the primary balance and a
substantially worse macroeconomic environment. However, debt stabilizes at 96 percent of
GDP at the end of the projection horizon. Under the constrained adjustment scenario, in
which capital expenditures are reduced in line with tight financing conditions, with otherwise
identical macroeconomic shocks, debt continues rising throughout the projection period to
reach about 104 percent of GDP.3 The stronger performance under the recommended
adjustment scenario underscores an added benefit from decisive upfront action to make
progress towards debt sustainability.

2

The scenarios are described in ¶21-23 in the main text.

3

In light of the low multipliers assumed for the ECCU countries and already modest share of new infrastructure in the
capital budget, the growth impacts of adjustment are assumed to be zero in both the recommended and financing
constrained scenarios.

38

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. LUCIA

External Debt Sustainability Analysis
External debt is projected to decrease somewhat to 80 percent of GDP by the end of the
forecast horizon. In the next few years, commercial banks’ foreign liabilities are expected to
decrease outright, reflecting these institutions’ deleveraging efforts. A minor recovery to current
dollar levels in later years will not prevent private external debt from falling as a share of GDP over
the medium term. These trends are expected to offset continued increases in public sector external
debt in line with the fiscal projections. Additionally, these projections assume a recovery in foreign
direct investment, which would result in larger non-debt financing sources for projected future
current account deficits. However, the external debt path remains vulnerable to potential adverse
shocks. Under the scenario with key variables held at historical levels, external debt would be on an
upward trajectory. The adverse shock scenarios also suggest vulnerability—under the growth,
interest rate, current account, and the combined shock scenarios, external debt also rises
throughout the forecast period. The most severe effects are observed under the real exchange rate
depreciation scenario, which would result in a step increase in external debt to around 123 percent
of GDP in the year of the shock, before decreasing a bit to 116 by 2020. The vulnerability suggested
by this scenario is mitigated by the regional central bank’s near currency board arrangement, which
makes such a depreciation unlikely.

1/ Public sector is defined as general government and includes public guarantees, defined as Guaranteed debt of the statutory enterprises..
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over U.S. bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes changes in the stock of guarantees, asset changes, and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Annex IV. Energy Sector Issues
St. Lucia is characterized by high energy consumption and overdependence on imported fossil
fuels. Dependence on imported fossil fuels is generally large in the Caribbean relative to the rest of
the world, with this source accounting for 87 percent of total consumption. With no natural
petroleum resources, St. Lucia is entirely dependent on imported fuels. Almost all of its electricity is
generated from diesel, and all the other needs are also satisfied by oil-based products. The
commercial sector and the transport sector are the most intensive users of energy. As other tourismbased economies, St. Lucia is quite energy intensive due to the large consumption by hotel and
other tourism facilities, with a large portion on air conditioning.

Overdependence on imported fossil fuels
has resulted in high electricity tariffs. Over
the last decade, high and volatile oil prices
have increased pressure on electricity tariffs,
which are high internationally. According to
the 2015 World Bank Enterprise Survey,
around 56 percent of firms in St. Lucia
identify electricity as a major constraint to
doing business, which is higher than the

The economy is highly vulnerable to oil
price shocks. Oil deficit accounts for a large
share of the current account deficit of St.
Lucia, especially during episodes of high oil
prices. Fluctuations in world oil prices impact
inflation directly through electricity and
transportation costs. Therefore, with a fixed
exchange rate regime, positive oil price shocks
normally lead to real exchange rate
appreciation and a loss of competitiveness.

St. Lucia has actively engaged in regional
energy plans with other Caribbean states and developed its own national energy plans. In
2010, the Cabinet approved the National Energy Policy (NEP), which aimed to lower and stabilize the
price of energy, especially by exploiting renewable energy resources. In 2013, CARICOM defined a
regional strategy—the CARICOM Energy Policy (CEP)—which focus on regulatory reforms to
improve energy efficiency and diversify the generation mix. Saint Lucia joined the ALBA and
Petrocaribe bodies in 2013. In November 2015, the Petrocaribe Joint Venture Agreement was signed
to facilitate Petrocaribe projects. The initial plan is to use asphalt with Petrocaribe.
The authorities have committed to develop renewable energy resources to diversify the
generation mix. The 2010 NEP established targets for renewable energy to 5 percent of the
electricity generated in 2013, 15 percent in 2015, and 30 percent in 2020. At the 2014 Clinton Global
Initiative Conference, the government further increased its target for renewables to 35 percent by
2020. St. Lucia has been exploring the following options:


48

Geothermal Energy: The geothermal potential is estimated to be around 30 MW or more,
which could satisfy the average base load of energy needs if fully developed. Efforts to develop
geothermal continued in 2014, with the assistance of the Government of New Zealand and the
World Bank. As part of the initiative, community engagement and consultations were held

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. LUCIA

during 2014. Permission has been granted by the Piton Management Authority to conduct
surface exploration studies starting in April 2015. The second stage of exploration for
geothermal energy has started in July 2015, which is expected to be completed in one year.
Private sector developers are expected to participate in the following phases.


Solar: From the 2010 Nexant report, the potential for solar generation is estimated at 36 MW
but current solar photovoltaic (PV) use is limited to a few small systems. Solar PV and solar
water heaters could be economic in St. Lucia. LUCELEC operates several demonstration
programs involving small grid-connected PV systems. Solar water heaters are in use and could
further expand with the low generation cost at about US$0.09 per kWh. A plan to build a 5 MW
solar farm has been approved and it is now in its initial stages.



Wind: The total wind potential on Saint Lucia has been estimated at 40MW and economic
viable with the generation cost. LUCELEC has investigated the resource at several sites. In 2004,
LUCELEC began a partnership with a Canadian group to build a 12 MW wind farm on St. Lucia,
but the project has been delayed by land acquisition issues. In 2015, the government of Saint
Lucia, in collaboration with LUCELEC and WindTex Energy, a U.S.-based company, have erected
a test tower that will help assess the potential for the construction of a 12 MW wind farm in
Dennery. There is also an ongoing environment and social impact assessment of the project.
Energy produced by the wind farm should come on stream in two years.



Waste-to-Energy: In 2014, the government started a waste-to-energy initiative with LUCELEC
and the Carbon War Room. The waste-to-energy initiative will allow the conversion of landfill
waste into energy that can be fed into the grid to supplement the use of diesel, with an
estimated 2 to 3 MW generation capacity.



The government has made efforts to improve energy efficiency. In 2012, the government
introduced voluntary energy efficiency standards for lighting. The government has started a
pilot program of LED street lights in 2013. There are plans to extend the streetlight program
and retrofitting lights of government buildings. To fully implement the project needs financing
and upgrades of building codes. Energy efficiency windows and air conditioning could help
reduce energy usage. Reducing generation and distribution losses is also very important.
LUCELEC has prioritized the installation of smart meters to manage electricity demand and
improve service.

The authorities are planning to implement the following regulatory reforms: (i) establish an
independent regulatory commission for the electricity sector (St. Lucia has also actively advocated
the institution of the proposed regional regulatory authority – Eastern Caribbean Energy Regulatory
Authority); (ii) set up an Energy Policy Advisory Committee to improve communication between
public and private sector; (iii) encourage the development of small-scale renewable energy systems
with license reforms and net-metering; (iv) develop legislation on energy efficiency; (v) update the
1994 Electricity Supply Act to allow commercial entities to generate electricity for their own use; (vi)
complete regulations on grid code, interconnection, and wire and electricity codes for building; and
(vi) redesign the Electricity tariff structure to fully reflect the production cost including the inflation
adjustment and the differential customer categories.

Supplying more energy at reduced costs would require significant investments in the energy
sector. Diversifying the energy mix requires significant investments in technology, power plant
conversion, and upgrading together with investment in renewable energy. According to IDB
estimates, energy investment needs of St. Lucia used in the investment scenario are around 66
million U. S. dollars to cover the cost of the

This amount is likely to be underestimated because it includes only 10 MW for geothermal energy in the
assumptions. There could be additional investment needs for other renewable energy, building and upgrading power
plants, and energy efficiency. The investment scenario reflects a 20-year loan at 5 percent to cover the cost of the
10MW geothermal plant, with debt service covered through cost savings. Assumptions reflect the growth impact
from the energy investment and efficiency gains passed on to end-users in the form of lower electricity tariffs.

Annex V. Education and Unemployment in St. Lucia
Structural shifts in employment have displaced a large number of unskilled workers. Following
the downsizing of the banana industry in the early 1990s, the structure of the economy has shifted
from labor intensive agriculture and manufacturing industries to services over the past two decades.

With efforts made by the authorities, universal education has improved over the years,
especially for secondary education. With the introduction of the Universal Secondary School
program in 2006, enrollment and government expenditure in secondary education have steadily
increased while enrollment in tertiary education has stayed relatively flat. The gross enrollment
ratios of primary and secondary education are above 90 percent. At the same time, teachers in
secondary education have increased from around 300 in 1980s to more than 1000 in 2013, while
numbers in primary and tertiary education have remained flat or declined slightly. As a result, the
pupil-teacher ratios in both primary and secondary education are lower than in most upper middle
income countries.

The skills mismatch is likely one of the key reasons for high unemployment. While the shares of
labor force participants with either a secondary or a tertiary diploma have both increased, the share
of tertiary education is much lower, and that of secondary education much higher, suggesting a
structural lack of workers with adequate skills. The vocational education system remains
underdeveloped and many unemployed with secondary education do not offer the skills sought out
in the labor market.

The 2012 national labor market needs survey confirmed this mismatch. The survey showed a
large gap between the qualifications offered by job seekers and those requested by employers. The
percentage of job seekers with below secondary level education was 60 percent as opposed to a
only 25 percent of employer requests. Conversely, the share of tertiary-educated job seekers was
only 7 percent against a share of 40 percent of job offers.

The brain drain has worsened the mismatch.
Migration trends show a significant drain of highlyeducated labor force. Based on U. S. Census data,
Mishra (2006) showed that 53 percent of the labor
force with tertiary education had migrated to the
United States during the period 1965-2000. The
national census data in 2010 showed that
20 percent of all migrants hold tertiary degrees and
8 percent university degrees.
With unemployment on the rise, public sector
employment has expanded over the last decade. Public sector employees have increased by
23 percent over the last fifteen years (from 8,804 in FY01 to 11,501 in FY14) and average earnings by
40 percent over the period 2000-2013, faster than in most sectors. As a result, the public sector
wage bill has increased to 10 percent of GDP in 2014.
To address weakness in the education system, policy priorities could focus on the following
areas:


Continuing efforts to develop an effective system of technical and vocational training. Policy
makers should reassess the roles of the existing institutions National Skills Development Centre
(NSDC), the Centre for Adolescent
Indicators for the Education Sector Development Plan,
2008-2014
Rehabilitation and Education (CARE), and the

retraining is established, the continuation of benefits could be tied to the participation in
retraining programs.


Increasing provisions for tertiary and continuing education for youth and adults. Investment in
infrastructure should privilege affordable higher education, in line with labor market needs.
Currently post-secondary and tertiary programs are offered at the Sir Arthur Lewis Community
College, the Vieux Fort Post Secondary Department, Monroe College, UWI Open Campus, and
four offshore Medical Schools. Access could be encouraged by providing needs-based financial
assistance to prospective students. Continuing efforts should be made to improve access,
enrollment, and completion of continuing education through programs such as the National
Enrichment and Learning Programme (NELP).



Improving performance measurement in the education system to enhance quality and costeffectiveness. Quality of education is essential to better prepare students for higher level
education and to provide the skills needed in the job market. Professional development
opportunities should be provided to teachers on a continuous basis, but the automatic link
between career development and training should be replaced by a link with performance to
strengthen incentives and allow a better control of costs.



Monitoring labor market needs on a more regular basis to ensure matching between supply and
demand. Regular monitoring of labor market needs would help identify the key gaps and
develop specific policies to address those needs.

Risks to St Lucia’s financial stability remain elevated and largely originate from domestic
sources. Credit risks associated with the deep fragilities in the banking system continue to be the
most important source of domestic risk to St. Lucia’s financial stability. Over the past year, credit
risks held up against the backdrop of weakening bank balance sheets, on the back of declining
credit, and exacerbated by the elevated levels of delinquent loans, despite the marginal
improvement in profitability. Bank exposure to sovereign debt also contributed to heighten credit
risk. Declining credit growth also added onto the rising market and liquidity risks, and, in
combination with rising real interest rates, to tighter monetary and financial conditions.
Macroeconomic risks remain relatively unchanged as gains in macroeconomic performance –
reflected in lower output gap and inflation, strengthening trade, and faster GDP growth – are offset
by deteriorating domestic credit conditions. Inward spillover risks to St. Lucia’s financial stability and
risk appetite remained relatively unchanged since a year ago.
The evolution of risks to St. Lucia’s financial stability can be compared against that of global
risks to financial stability of October 2015 GFSR Map. The key difference is that St. Lucia has not
seen the same easing of market and liquidity pressures and loosening of monetary and financial

conditions. To a large extent, this reflects the significant difficulties that the banking system in
St. Lucia continues to face.
To assess the credit cycle and the soundness of the financial system in St. Lucia, we employ
the use of credit cycle and financial soundness indicators (FSIs) heatmap tool. The tool
incorporates indicators of the current soundness of the financial system and of its corporate and
household counterparties, and produces a heat map of the credit cycle and key FSIs to inform
whether policies are needed. It provides a snapshot of the three basic properties of the banking
sector: credit cycle, balance sheet risks, and loss-absorbing capital buffers. A red indicator signifies
the need for policies when the upper range of the threshold is breached; yellow coloring implies the
state of alert when the indicator falls between the upper and the lower bound; while green signifies
a ‘no policy’ scenario when the indicator is below the lower threshold. When applied to ECCU
economies, however, the tool should be used with caution, given that it was developed to assess
credit booms, causing many St. Lucia indicators to turn green and point to a low risk rating.
St. Lucia credit cycle and balance sheet risks remain elevated and merit close watch. Credit to
private sector declined further in 2015, while excess liquidity continued to accumulate, driven by
robust deposits. Inferior loan quality continues to persist, as marked by high levels of NPLs, while
the balance sheet buffers remain vulnerable, given the low profitability of the banking system. Credit
growth continued to decline throughout 2015 reaching -9.5 percent year-on-year growth in
September 2015. The negative credit growth is marked green since it falls below the 3 percent lower
bound.
Banks’ balance sheet data show sufficient liquidity and contained foreign exchange risks.
St. Lucia deposit-to-loan ratio continues to increase – particularly among the indigenous banks,
reflecting strong deposit base growth – as both, the declining credit and the robust deposit inflows
boost the ratio. Since the estimate falls above the 100 percent benchmark in 2015, the indicator is
marked green, signifying sufficient liquidity in the system. The balance sheet buffers remain
vulnerable as low profitability point to banks’ limited buffers to absorb negative shocks, despite the
sound capital adequacy ratios.

Exchange Rate Assessment: The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. St.
Lucia participates in a currency union with seven other members of the ECCU and has no
separate legal tender. The Eastern Caribbean dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar under a
currency board arrangement at EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar. St. Lucia has accepted the obligations
of Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3 and 4, and maintains an exchange system that is free of
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
Safeguards Assessment: Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Eastern
Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), of which St. Lucia is a member, is subject to a full safeguards
assessment under a four-year cycle. In line with this policy, an update safeguards assessment
of the ECCB is underway. The previous assessment concluded in April 2012 found that the
ECCB continued to maintain a relatively sound safeguards framework. In addition, the external
audit and financial reporting mechanisms complied with international standards and financial
statements were published in a timely manner. Independent oversight on external and internal
audits and reserves management was exercised by the Audit and Investment Committees,
respectively. Recommendations were made to enhance the ECCB’s legal framework.
Article IV consultation: St. Lucia is currently on a 12-month cycle. The last Article IV
consultation was concluded on March 1, 2013 by the Executive Board; the relevant document
is SM/13/41.
Technical Assistance: St. Lucia has received substantial technical assistance from the
Caribbean Region Technical Assistance Center (CARTAC) and the IMF. Technical assistance
missions focused on national accounts, tax reforms, revenue administration, expenditure
rationalization and the financial sector.

FSAP: A joint IMF/World Bank team performed an assessment of the financial sector of the
member states of the ECCU, in two missions—September 1–19 and October 20–31, 2003. The
missions assisted the authorities in assessing the development needs and opportunities for the
financial sector, identifying potential vulnerabilities of financial institutions and markets to
macroeconomic shocks, as well as assessing risks to macroeconomic stability from weaknesses
in the financial sector. The Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) was discussed by the
Executive Board on May 5, 2004, and subsequently published on the IMF’s external website,
including the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) on Banking
Supervision.
AML/CFT: A detailed assessment of the AML/CFT regimes of St. Lucia was conducted by the
Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF) in November 2008, and the eighth follow-up
report was published in November 2013.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of October, 2015)
World Bank Group OECS Regional Partnership Strategy: On November 13, 2014, the Board
of the Executive Directors of the World Bank Group has endorsed the new OECS Regional
Partnership Strategy ((RPS) which will cover the period FY15-19. The high-level objective of the
new RPS is to contribute to lay the foundations for sustainable inclusive growth, in line with
the OECS governments’ priorities. In order to achieve this goal, the program is planned to be
organized around three main areas of engagement. Under the first one, the WBG is planning
to support “competitiveness”. Growth and job creation in the private sector will be supported
both horizontally – by improving the business environment– and vertically – by focusing on
specific sectors with a high potential to generate inclusive sustainable growth (particularly
tourism, agribusiness and their respective linkages). The second area of engagement is “public
sector modernization”, with particular focus on public financial management (PFM) and
institutional capacity, including for statistics and public private partnerships (PPPs), to better
leverage private investment in infrastructure and service provision. The third area is
“resilience”, with the objective to address both social vulnerabilities (in education, health and
social protection), and exposure to natural disasters. Constrained in general by the small size
of investments in the OECS, the IFC and MIGA will contribute to the RPS objectives through
selective investment support, depending on opportunities. The IFC will focus on crisis
response; job creation and inclusive growth; innovation, competitiveness, and integration; and
climate change. MIGA faces limited opportunities for engagement because of the small market
size of the OECS countries.

The RPS is grounded in a holistic approach to tackling the long-standing issues of low
growth and debt sustainability in the Caribbean: the Comprehensive Debt Framework,
developed in 2010 by the Bank at the request of the Heads of Government of CARICOM
countries. Structured around four pillars, the Comprehensive Debt Framework (CDF) is
designed to address the interdependent structural causes of high debt and low growth in
small island states by (i) promoting private-sector led growth, (ii) strengthening fiscal
management, (iii) building resilience to natural disasters, and (iv) improving debt management.
Governments of the OECS recognize the multifaceted nature of the challenges they face and
understand that improvements in competitiveness, reduction in sovereign debt levels, fiscal
adjustments to ensure macro sustainability, and enhanced sustainability and resilience to
shocks are interrelated aspects that are critical to resume and sustain inclusive growth. As a
result, they have used the CDF to frame their own reform strategies and activities.
The indicative IBRD lending program for the six OECS countries is expected to be around
US$120 million, or up to a maximum of US$20 million for each OECS country – including for St.
Lucia - for the period of the RPS (FY15-19), subject to country and program performance,
IBRD’s lending capacity, and exposure management parameters. In addition to the IBRD
envelope, four OECS countries (Dominica, Grenada, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the
Grenadines) can also count on an IDA national allocation. The IDA17 (FY15-17) allocation for
the OECS is equal to SDR61.3 million, an increase of around 22 percent over the IDA16 OECS
allocation (SDR50.3 million). With regard to St. Lucia, its IDA-17 allocation is equal to SDR 17.4
million (roughly USD 24.3mln at today’s exchange rate).

A. Projects
1.
The WB portfolio in St. Lucia includes three projects: (i) Regional Disaster Vulnerability
Reduction Project-RDVRP (IDA $15 Million; PPCR $41 Million); (ii) Caribbean Regional
Communications Infrastructure Project-CARCIP (IDA$6 Million); (iii) Eastern Caribbean Energy
Regulatory Authority-ECERA (IDA$2.8 Million). St. Lucia also benefit of US$ 2 million Bank
Executed Trust Fund to support geothermal development.
2.
Overall, the portfolio quality in St. Lucia is mixed, with CARCIP and ECERA experiencing
some problems and therefore proceeding through a restructuring process, while the RDVRP is
proceeding in a satisfactory manner.
The Caribbean Regional Communications Infrastructure Program (CARCIP) is a broad
umbrella program to include all interested CARIFORUM countries.1 It offers a menu of choices
with specific components to be tailored to each country's priorities. The menu of options are:
(a) ICT Connectivity—to increase access and affordability of broadband communications
1
CARIFORUM comprises the 15 Caribbean countries of CARICOM (i.e., Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas,
Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Montserrat, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia,
St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago), and the Dominican Republic.

networks within region and countries; (b) E-Government—to contribute to improved
Government efficiency and transparency through the delivery of e-services, including egovernment and e-society applications; and (c) IT Industry—to contribute to the development
of the regional and national IT industry. Phase 1 of the Program was approved by the Board on
May 22, 2012 with Grenada (US$10 million IDA), St. Lucia (US$6 million IDA) and St. Vincent
and the Grenadines (US$6 million IDA) as participating countries. Additional countries can join
since this is a comprehensive program that seeks to increase access to regional broadband
networks and advance the development of an ICT-enabled services industry in the Caribbean
Region. The project is currently going through restructuring.
The Eastern Caribbean Energy Regulatory Authority (ECERA) Project (Grenada and St.
Lucia) was approved in June 2011. The objective of this project is to establish and
operationalize a regional approach to the development of the electricity sector in the OECS, by
supporting the establishment of a regional regulator. Currently, Grenada and Saint Lucia have
used IDA credit (with US$2.8 million each, for a total of US$5.6 million) for the design and
operationalization of ECERA. The design phase is coordinated by the OECS Secretariat.
Component A of this project will facilitate the creation and launching of the ECERA, including
carrying out the legal and consultative process leading to the formulation and ratification of
the ECERA treaty, and defining the options for the ECERA self-financing mechanism, reviewing
tariffs and examining incentive mechanisms to promote renewable energy. Component B will
facilitate the initial three years of ECERA’s operations, including the day-to-day operations and
execution of core regulatory tasks including: (i) tariff and investment plan reviews; and (ii)
defining a regional licensing framework for electricity market participants with a particular
focus on facilitating the integration of electricity production from renewable sources into the
supply mix. The project is currently going through restructuring.
A Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Project has been approved by the Board in June 2014.
The package is in the amount of US$68 million equivalent consisting of (a) an IDA Credit in the
amount of 15.57 million SDR (USD$ 24 million equivalent); (b) an IDA Credit from the Crisis
Response Window in the amount of 11.03 million SDR (US$17.0 million equivalent); (c) a Loan
from the Climate Investment Funds: Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR) under the
Strategic Climate Fund (SCF) for US$15.0 million; and (d) a Grant from the Climate Investment
Funds: PPCR-SCF for US$12.0 million. The objective of the Project is to reduce vulnerability to
natural hazards and climate change impacts in Saint Lucia. The Project consists of the following
five components: Risk Reduction and Adaptation Measures; Technical Assistance for Improved
Assessment and Application of Disaster and Climate Risk Information in Decision-making;
Climate Adaptation Financing Facility; Contingent Emergency Response; and Project
Management and Implementation Support.
In spring 2015 the WB has conducted a Country Portfolio Performance Review in the OECS
countries. Some of the main findings regarding the portfolio review in St. Lucia are the
following: (i) country context needs to be better understood and taken into account during
project preparation; (ii) institutional strengthening of national agencies in charge of
10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. LUCIA

monitoring projects, beyond the Project Implementation Unit (PIU), is needed to make sure
that projects contribute to build national capacity; (iii) training initiatives are critical,
particularly on fiduciary training; (iv) a more comprehensive and flexible approach to facilitate
procurement in small states is needed; (v) Government processes are sometimes complex or
slow and cause delays; (vi) Collaboration needs to improve both internally, among line
ministries, and at the Bank, to ensure consistency of messages and clear communication with
the client; and (vii) lack of technical staff is an issue and cause delays in completing activities
by the deadline.

B. Economic and Sector Work
The Caribbean Growth Forum (CGF) -The Caribbean Growth Forum (CGF) is a multistakeholder platform designed to identify, prioritize and implement a set of activities to
improve the growth enabling environment in the Caribbean, while promoting participatory
public policy making. It has so far engaged more than 2,500 representatives from business
associations, civil society organizations, Government, private sector, media, indigenous groups,
and international development agencies on themes such as Logistics and Connectivity;
Investment Climate; and, Skills and Productivity.
Low growth, high unemployment, especially for youth and women, high debt ratios (eight of
the top twelve most indebted countries in the world are in Caribbean), high incidence of crime,
and, growing vulnerability to external shocks characterize the region. In the wake of the global
financial crisis, the high debt/low growth challenge has become even more acute.
A number of Caribbean countries reached out to international donors to find an innovative
approach to the growth challenge in the region. A suggestion was made to launch a genuinely
participatory growth initiative. Following consultations and some preparatory work, the
program started in mid-2012 with a regional launch event in Jamaica. The process is supported
and facilitated by the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Caribbean
Development Bank, Compete Caribbean and the European Union.
Key Outcomes
Positive outcomes are tangible: twelve countries formally joined the process by establishing
their national CGF chapter and have completed the first phase of national dialogue. This effort
has led to the prioritization of concrete and actionable activities and draft action plans are now
available, with details on each activity’ implementation plan (e.g., accountabilities, milestones,
timeline, funding). The results of each country’s dialogue were presented at three regional
forum in The Bahamas in June 2013, in St. Kitts and Nevis in 2014, and in St. Lucia in June 2015.
This allowed national stakeholders from government, private sector and civil society to
compare notes on each other’s’ priorities and exchange ideas on solutions to each identified
challenges with technical specialists and peers. Each government involved in the CGF also
committed to follow-up on implementation of the reform agenda, to report back periodically

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

ST. LUCIA

on progress (every 4-5 months) and to enable independent monitoring of the reforms by
private sector and civil society representatives.
Comprehensive Debt Framework - At the request of the Heads of Government of CARICOM,
the Bank put together a Comprehensive Debt Framework that proposes a strategy for
addressing the high debt challenge faced in the OECS in a sustainable way. This Framework
proposes a holistic approach around four interdependent pillars (Supporting private sector led
growth, including private sector development and financial sector stability; Enhancing fiscal
sustainability; Improving climate change resilience and Disaster Risk Management; and Debt
resolution). The Framework has been rolled out in all the OECS, including Dominica. The
Governments expressed interest in principle, in continue to work with the World Bank and
other development partners to develop policy measures that could help stimulate growth and
reduce debt in the country.
In terms of analytical products, the Bank has completed a series of studies related to public
expenditure, fiscal and debt sustainability, growth and competitiveness, the financial sector,
public sector management and social protection. The ongoing dissemination of these reports
represents a key instrument for policy dialogue with the OECS governments, including St.
Lucia.
The Bank’s program in St. Lucia is further supported by a comprehensive series of completed,
ongoing and planned analytical and advisory activities, including the following: “Towards a

RELATIONS WITH THE CARIBBEAN DEVELOPMENT
BANK (CDB)
1.
The Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) has been an important development partner in
St. Lucia (STL) and is currently the island’s largest multilateral donor. Interventions have been
aimed at facilitating sustainable development by supporting investments in social and
economic infrastructure, as well as creating a more enabling policy environment. Specifically,
CDB has been involved in areas such as: (i)development of physical infrastructure; (ii) public
financial management; (iii) human resource development; (iv)support to the productive sectors;
and (v) community-based poverty reduction.
2.
In 2012, the Bank approved a country assistance strategy with an indicative resource
envelope of $88.5 mn to guide operations in STL over the period 2013-16. Given STL’s
vulnerability to economic shocks and natural hazards, the main strategic objective of the
programme was to assist in building social and economic resilience by: (i) improving efficiency
of social and economic infrastructure; (ii) increasing the contribution of the agricultural sector;
(iii) enhancing youth outcomes; (iv) enhancing the viability of small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs); and (v) improving management capacity in order to reduce vulnerability to
natural hazards and economic shocks. Importantly, recognising the impact of gender and
environmental/climate change factors on a country’s ability to achieve sustainable development
outcomes, these issues are treated as cross-cutting themes in the assistance strategy.
3.
STL has utilised the Bank’s resources extensively over the years and at the end of 2014,
was the third largest recipient of CDB assistance. Cumulative loans, contingent loans and equity
and grants totalled $409.2 mn between 1970 and 2014. Of this amount, just over half was
approved from Ordinary Capital Resources (OCR) with the remainder being sourced from the
“soft” window.
4.
One loan amounting to $14.8mn was approved in 2015 for the rehabilitation of the John
Compton Dam. Fundamentally, the project seeks to improve the reliability and sustainability of
the water supply to the north of island by: (a) increasing the storage capacity of JCD through
sediment removal; (b) establishing operational procedures for sediment removal and
management; (c) rehabilitating JCD structure and monitoring equipment; and (d) reducing the
potential for landslides within the Roseau watershed. The project also provides inter alia
institutional strengthening for the utility provider by building capacity in financial management,
support for a climate action plan and the mainstreaming of gender concerns in provider’s
polices and operations. Other interventions during the year were direct poverty reduction
support and capacity enhancement for small and medium sized enterprises.
5.
Notwithstanding the Bank’s significant involvement in St. Lucia, net resource flows have
been negative over the 2010 to 2014 period and preliminary indications are that 2015 will

follow the trend (see Table 1 below). This has largely been due to implementation capacity
issues and the availability of alternative funding sources. The most significant disbursements
during the period 2013 to 2015 were for lines of credit to support private sector development,
reconstruction following the passage of Hurricane Tomas, education sector enhancement, and a
policy based loan in support of macroeconomic reforms.

STATISTICAL APPENDIX
As of October 22, 2015
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
Although the statistical database compares well and in some areas has a broader coverage
than those of its Eastern Caribbean Central Union (ECCU) peers, the accuracy and timeliness of
macroeconomic statistics should be improved in order to achieve more effective economic
analysis and policy formulation. There are weaknesses in coverage, frequency, quality, and
timeliness, in particular regarding the national accounts, data on the public sector beyond the
central government, and the balance of payments.
National Accounts: Nominal GDP data are compiled using the production and expenditure

approaches on an annual basis. Real GDP data are compiled only using the production
approach. Since 2011, real GDP estimates are compiled with 2006 as the new base year. GDP
estimates are available about four months after the end of the year and are usually finalized
with a two-year lag. Household final consumption expenditure is derived residually. No explicit
changes in inventories series are disseminated.
No official quarterly GDP estimates are disseminated, but a pilot project is currently underway,
with technical assistance from CARTAC, to compile these. CARTAC has provided technical
assistance since May 2011 on quarterly GDP compilation, with St. Lucia serving as a pilot for
the ECCU countries..
Additional technical and human resources are required to implement the new developmental
work in the area of National Accounts.
Price Statistics: The rebasing exercise of the CPI has been completed—the new CPI basket

(base January 2008) is based on the 2006 Household Expenditure Survey. No export and
import price indices are compiled, nor a producer price index.
Government Finance Statistics: Reporting of central government data has improved over the

last few years, but deficiencies remain in the compilation of both government and public
sector statistics. The authorities report monthly data on the central government’s current
revenue and expenditure, using a non GFSM 2001 presentation with lags of a couple of
months. Fiscal data for publication in the GFS Yearbook or in IFS have been reported to STA in
2013 and 2014, which were converted to a GFSM 2001 presentation by IMF staff. The
authorities would thus benefit from moving to a complete GFSM framework for the
compilation of Government Finance Statistics. Additionally, frequent and substantial revisions
suggest that there is a need for further refinement, including improvements to accounting

systems for capital expenditures to record outlays associated with grant-financed projects as
they are realized. Data for the rest of the public sector (financial and nonfinancial public
corporations) are not readily available and should be compiled on a regular basis to improve
fiscal monitoring of the overall general government.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Monthly monetary statistics (for central bank and other

depository corporations) are compiled and reported to the Fund by the ECCB, based on the
standardized report forms, since July 2006. In April 2007, a data ROSC mission assessed the
monetary statistics with reference to the GDDS and the Data Quality Assessment Framework
(DQAF, July 2003). It indicated that the institutional coverage of other depository corporations
is incomplete, as data for mortgage companies, finance companies, building societies, and
credit unions—all of which accept deposits—are excluded. Also, accrued interest is not
incorporated in the value of the interest-bearing assets and liabilities, and valuation
adjustments are included in other liabilities. In addition, source data for the commercial banks
do not provide the disaggregation recommended by the Monetary and Financial Statistics
Manual and Compilation Guide. Close coordination between the ECCB and the single
regulatory unit (which supervises financial corporations other than those licensed under the
Banking Act) is crucial.. Monetary and financial statistics missions visited the ECCB in
November 2009 and November 2014. As a result, the quality of monetary statistics improved,
but coverage of the ODC sector continues to be incomplete, including only commercial banks.
Financial sector surveillance: The ECCB compiles financial soundness indicators (FSIs) for its

member countries, including St. Lucia, but does not report FSIs to STA for dissemination on
the IMF’s website due to confidentiality reasons.
External sector statistics: The ECCB reports annual balance of payments data of its eight
members (including St. Lucia) for publication in the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook
(BOPSY) and the International Financial Statistics (IFS). The compilation of balance of payments
statistics for the ECCU and member states is a joint exercise between the ECCB and its
members. The quality of major components of the balance of payments in the region needs to
be improved, including the recording of goods imports, travel credits, private transfers, and
direct investment transactions.. Timeliness of balance of payments statistics should be
improved as well. CARTAC has provided technical assistance to the ECCB and the member
economies to improve the quality of external sector statistics and to introduce new survey
forms, which were used to collect 2014 data. The new survey forms are aligned with the sixth
edition of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Statistics Manual
(BPM6) and also collected, for the first time, data for the production of international
investment position (IIP) statistics. It is expected that 2014 data based on the results of the
surveys will be disseminated by December 2015. The Ministry of Finance has a detailed
statistics for public sector external debt and publicly guaranteed private sector external debt
(St. Lucia reports public and publicly guaranteed external debt data to the Quarterly External
Debt Statistics (QEDS) database). Data on private external debt are not available yet.

II. Data Standards and Quality

St. Lucia is a participant in the General Data
Dissemination System (GDDS), which has
been superseded by the enhanced GDDS (eGDDS) since May 2015. Its metadata, which
include detailed plans for statistical
development in the main macroeconomic
areas over the short and medium term, have
been posted on the Fund’s Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board (http://dsbb.imf.org)
since September 1, 2004, although updates
are needed.

A Data ROSC for the monetary sector was
conducted in 2007, covering the ECCB and
ECCU member countries, including St. Lucia.
