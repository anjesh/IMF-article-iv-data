IMF Executive Board Concludes the 2016 Article IV Consultation with Germany
On June 24, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with Germany.
The growth momentum has remained steady as strong domestic demand has offset weak
foreign demand. Private consumption growth has been supported by the persistently strong
labor market and lower energy prices, while public consumption and investment have also
been buoyant. Core inflation has been low and stable around 1 percent. The current account
surplus has continued to widen significantly, reaching 8.5 percent of GDP in 2015, reflecting
lower commodity prices and currency effects. The fiscal stance was neutral last year.
Credit growth, long subdued, has picked up, while housing prices have kept trending up in
the context of a slow supply response to surging housing demand. The banking sector faces
multiple challenges, which translate into low profitability. Negative interest rates erode
profits from retail banking, the aggregate cost-to-income ratio is high in international
comparison, while technological changes and the new regulatory environment—which is still
being implemented—require business model adaptation. Low interest rates, if protracted,
would also weaken life insurers’ ability to meet guaranteed commitments.
Looking forward, domestic demand is expected to keep underpinning the moderate growth
momentum. A sizable fiscal expansion, the recent further ECB monetary stimulus, and still
supportive energy prices should continue to offset the weakness in some key trading partners.
GDP is projected to grow by 1.7 percent this year and 1.5 percent next year. A small positive
output gap should open up which, together with the effects of recent ECB policy actions,
should very gradually push up core and headline inflation towards 2 percent. However, this
forecast does not yet reflect the economic impact of the U.K. referendum decision in favor of

leaving the European Union. In addition, growth over the medium term is expected to decline
against the backdrop of a still uncertain global outlook, a population aging fast, and slow
progress on structural reforms.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed the increased contribution to growth from domestic demand,
supported by lower energy prices, rising real wages, declining unemployment, and
accommodative fiscal and monetary policies. These developments will continue to underpin
growth in the period ahead. Directors noted that risks to the outlook are tilted to the
downside, including weaker growth in Germany’s trading partners and heightened
uncertainty following the outcome of the referendum on the U.K. membership in the
European Union. Meanwhile, the large current account surplus persists, and an aging
population and refugee inflows continue to pose challenges.
Against this backdrop, Directors agreed that policies should focus on raising potential growth
and reinforcing rebalancing, which will also support the fragile recovery in the euro area. To
this end, Directors broadly concurred that, to the extent that there are fiscal resources
available within the fiscal rules, they should be used to boost high quality public investment
and finance growth enhancing reforms. They welcomed the authorities’ ongoing efforts to
enhance the overall efficiency of public investment and plans to address administrative and
regulatory constraints to investment. Directors also commended the German government for
shouldering the burden of absorbing a large inflow of refugees.
Directors underscored that faster progress on structural reforms is essential for boosting
medium term growth in a rapidly aging society. They called for well targeted measures to
increase labor supply by promoting labor force participation of women, older workers, and
immigrants; and reforming taxation, the pension system, and health insurance contributions.
Directors also encouraged decisive steps to enhance competition and productivity in the
services sector.
Directors welcomed recent actions to ease supply constraints in the housing sector. They
supported reforming the real estate transaction tax and improving the macroprudential toolkit
targeted at the real estate sector and the supervisory database. Continued close monitoring of
house price developments and mortgage credit is also warranted.
Directors observed that the overall banking sector remains strong, resilient, and well
capitalized. Nevertheless, given prolonged low interest rates, high operating costs, and
technological and regulatory changes, it is important that banks accelerate their efforts to
adjust to these challenges and improve risk management. Directors recommended that the
authorities monitor the insurance sector closely, require action plans from troubled firms, and
keep safety nets under review.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any
qualifiers used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors welcomed the progress made in implementing the recommendations of the
2011 Financial Sector Assessment Program. They considered it a high priority for Germany
to complete the agenda on the new bank recovery and resolution framework, consolidating
the positive effects of the European Single Supervisory Mechanism and Single Resolution
Mechanism. Further efforts are needed to improve the coverage and granularity of
supervisory data, complete resolution planning for large international banks, and broaden
crisis management coordination arrangements with European authorities.
Directors noted the globally systemic importance of large German banks and the potential
spillover effects of their withdrawal from correspondent relationships. They encouraged the
authorities to promote better risk management by these banks, strengthen cooperation with
other national supervisors to harmonize regulatory frameworks, and facilitate cross border
information sharing.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 9, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context
Growth this year is expected to remain moderate as strong domestic demand—buoyed
by a fiscal expansion, a strong labor market, favorable monetary conditions, and lower
energy prices—is offsetting weak external demand. Medium-term potential growth is
projected to decline as the population ages. This keeps savings up and holds back
domestic investment, contributing to the large and persistent current account surplus.
Housing supply is slow to respond to swelling demand, putting pressure on prices in
some areas. In the financial sector, the new supervisory and regulatory architecture is
being implemented and the low interest environment is exacerbating underlying
structural challenges.
Key policy recommendations
Germany should accelerate structural reforms to raise its declining growth potential and
speed up rebalancing. A more dynamic Germany would also benefit the fragile recovery
in the euro area. In the financial sector, the new regulatory and supervisory architecture
needs to be completed and transition risks managed.


Foster the integration in the labor market of women, older workers, and refugees.



Spur competition to increase productivity in the services sector.



Make more rapid progress toward meeting public infrastructure needs, while
tackling administrative bottlenecks.



Remove impediments to housing supply expansion to relieve pressure on house
prices, and develop the legal basis for real-estate-related macroprudential tools to
better contain potential future excesses.



Continue to enhance bank supervision to meet tighter new international standards,
with a particular focus on risk management, internal controls, and the oversight role
of supervisory boards, including through expanded data collection.



Together with the relevant European authorities, complete the new bank resolution
and crisis management agenda.

The growth momentum remains steady as
strong domestic demand is offsetting weak
foreign demand (Figure 1). Private consumption
growth reached a 15-year high last year, while public
consumption surged to accommodate higher social
benefit spending and provide support to a record
number of asylum-seekers. The recovery of
investment in machinery and equipment continued
as capacity utilization remained above historical
averages. Buoyant domestic final demand, however,
was partly countered by a slowdown in import
demand from trading partners, which translated into
stagnating exports in the second half of last year.

at 4.2 percent, reached a new post-reunification low
in March. So far, the introduction of a statutory minimum wage on January 1, 2015 has not had a
visible impact on average wage growth or the aggregate employment trend (Box 1).
3.
External imbalances are widening reflecting new shocks. The current account surplus
continued to widen significantly in 2015, reaching 8.5 percent of GDP, reflecting lower commodity
prices and currency effects (Figure 3). It is now the second largest in the world behind China’s when
measured in U.S. dollars. The narrowing of the oil and gas trade deficit accounted for 62 percent of
the trade surplus increase. In addition, lower oil prices (together with lower lending rates) have
stimulated global demand for automobiles, benefiting German exports (Box 2). On a regional basis,
the surplus vis-à-vis the rest of the euro area widened by 0.7 percent of GDP, as the energy deficit
with the Netherlands shrank. Exports to Asia, on the contrary, decelerated reflecting the ongoing
rebalancing in China. From a saving-investment balances perspective, the surpluses of non-financial
corporations and the general government, at 4.0 percent and 0.7 percent of GDP respectively,
reached their highest levels since 2000. By end of 2015, the CPI-based real effective exchange rate
had depreciated by 5.3 percent from its 2014 average primarily as a result of nominal depreciation
vis-à-vis the dollar and the renminbi.

4.
The persistent CA surplus has boosted the Net International Investment Position
(NIIP). The NIIP reached 48.3 percent of GDP at end-2015 (2.2 percent of world GDP), with gross
assets exceeding 256.3 percent of GDP. The net direct investment position was 18.2 percent of GDP
and the net portfolio position was 3 percent of GDP at end-2015. Foreign claims of German banks
declined sharply after the global financial crisis, from 95 percent of GDP in 2008 to 59 percent of
GDP by end-2015, with an exposure to major emerging markets of less than 5 percent of the total.
In general, foreign assets are well diversified by instrument, while a sizable share of foreign liabilities
consists of government bonds. The implicit return earned on assets has been higher than that paid
on liabilities by 0.6 percentage points on average over 2010–15. However, adverse valuation effects
have kept the pace of NIIP build-up short of the cumulated capital outflow recorded in the financial
account (6 percent of GDP cumulative over 2010–15).
5.
Strong revenues supported the fiscal balance in 2015. The general government surplus
rose to 0.6 percent of GDP (from 0.3 percent in 2014), on the back of buoyant revenue—due to
robust growth of employees compensation and domestic demand—and declining interest payments
(Figure 4). However, the structural balance remained constant at 0.7 percent of GDP, resulting in a
neutral fiscal stance. The unforeseen spending associated with the refugee inflow (about ¼ percent
of GDP in 2015) was comfortably accommodated within the government’s budget target. Public
debt declined to 71 percent of GDP, while the federal government met for the second consecutive
year its commitment to no new net borrowing (the so-called “black zero”).
6.
Credit growth, long subdued, is picking up, and housing price inflation continues to
outstrip disposable income growth. Following the implementation of QE by the ECB, negative
yields on government bonds now extend to maturities up to 8 years and bank lending rates have
declined to historically low levels (Figure 5). After years of stagnation, real credit growth accelerated
to 3 percent in early 2016, half of it accounted for by the mortgage segment, as borrowers took
advantage of record-low interest rates. As a result, housing prices keep trending up in the context of
a slow supply response to surging housing demand. Though firms continue to finance most of
investment needs from retained earnings and cash reserves, credit to non-financial corporations is
also picking up somewhat as bank lending standards are gradually loosened.
7.
The banking sector faces multiple challenges, which translate into low profitability.
Negative interest rates have not been passed on to retail depositors so far. Thus, while they
stimulate credit demand, they erode net interest margins, especially in banks with traditional
business models. The aggregate cost-to-income ratio is high in international comparison, while
technological changes and the new regulatory environment require business model adaptation.
Further consolidation to cut costs, especially among the large number of small retail-focused
institutions, is proceeding but slowly. During market turbulence earlier this year, the equity prices of
the largest German bank declined more markedly than those of other global banks, and its CDS
spreads climbed more rapidly, possibly indicating market concerns about future profitability in the
context of ongoing restructuring (Figure 6).

GERMANY

OUTLOOK, EXTERNAL ASSESSMENT, AND RISKS
The economy is projected to slowly rebalance, with domestic demand supported by the tight labor
market, accommodative monetary conditions, and, in 2016, a fiscal expansion. Declining mediumterm growth prospects, however, continue to hold back domestic investment and push up savings,
preventing faster rebalancing.
8.
Domestic demand is expected to keep underpinning the moderate growth
momentum. A sizable fiscal expansion (see below), further ECB monetary stimulus since March, and
lower energy prices should continue to offset the weakness in key advanced and emerging
countries. Private consumption should remain dynamic as real disposable income, while residential
investment should pick up further to respond to growing needs (see below). All in all, GDP is
projected to grow by 1.7 percent this year and 1.5 percent next year, with a small positive output
gap opening up. Continued large net immigration and the gradual absorption of the refugees into
the labor market over the short-to-medium term will help meet growing labor demand, though the
unemployment rate is likely to bottom out as refugees will face obstacles in finding employment.
Headline inflation will rise as a result of the recent ECB policy actions as well as the small positive
output gap, but will do so only gradually, and will reach two percent only over the medium-term. In
light of the relative cyclical positions and rebalancing needs within the monetary union, inflation in
Germany should remain above the euro area average over the medium-term.
9.
A foreseen fiscal expansion of 1 percent of GDP in 2016 comes at an opportune time,
as, if it materializes, it will cushion the effect of slowing foreign demand, though revenues
might again surprise on the upside. The expansion reflects higher planned social transfers,
refugee-related spending, and, to a lesser extent, higher public investment and income tax relief.
Altogether the structural balance is expected to fall to -¼ percent of GDP in 2016 and remain
constant in 2017, slightly above the lower bounds imposed by the fiscal rules (Germany’s Medium
Term Objective under the Stability and Growth Pact (MTO) and the national “debt brake”). However,
over recent years, tax revenues have systematically overperformed forecasts due to better-thanexpected labor market developments (though over the longer run there has been no systematic
bias).1 Refugee-related spending should reach ½ percent of GDP per year in 2016 and 2017,
although there is uncertainty around this estimate. At the federal level, despite a small deficit
expected in 2016, the government should be able to fulfill its “no net new borrowing” political
commitment by spending reserves accumulated in 2015. The debt sustainability analysis (DSA)
shows that fiscal risks should be manageable, with no severe adverse effects on public debt
dynamics (Annex I).

The projections are prepared by the Working Party for Tax Revenue Estimates, a body including representatives
from the federal and regional governments, research institutes, and the Bundesbank. Decisions are made by
consensus. Although methodologies differ, the macroeconomic scenario used by all members is the same. Thus,
forecast errors in the macroeconomic assumptions would be reflected in all the estimates.

10.
In 2015, the external position continued to be substantially stronger than implied by
medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings. The cyclically-adjusted current
account balance stood at 8.8 percent of GDP in 2015, 3–6 percentage points of GDP above the
assessed norm of 2.5–5.5 of GDP (Annex II). The wide interval reflects the high sensitivity of the
norm to uncertain demographic factors, including future immigration. The REER in 2015 is assessed
as undervalued by 10–20 percent, up from 5–15 percent in 2014. In 2016, the oil and gas trade
balance should narrow further as energy prices remain lower on average than in 2015, while the
lagged effects of the past real effective exchange rate depreciation will counterbalance the
slowdown in external demand. Continued strong wage growth and the fiscal expansion, on the other
hand, should push up imports.
11.
Over the medium-term, the surplus is expected to slowly decline. The rebalancing
process will unfold as the terms of trade windfall is spent, energy prices partially recover, the output
gap becomes positive, and increasing unit labor costs relative to euro area trading partners realign
price competitiveness. However, at 6.8 percent in 2021, the current account surplus is projected to
remain outside the assessed norm, while the (NIIP) will continue to grow rapidly, reaching over
80 percent of GDP by 2021. Based on the EBA model estimation results, in 2015 if fiscal gaps in
Germany and its trading partners were closed, Germany’s current account surplus would have been
lower by some 1.5 percentage points of GDP. The remaining CA gap that is not explained by

identified policy distortions likely reflects the short-term factors mentioned above (such as the
unspent terms of trade windfall), as well as the limited nominal exchange rate adjustment because
of the currency union.
12.
A range of policies could be considered that would strengthen the external
rebalancing relative to the baseline scenario. The foreseen adjustment process is sluggish
because medium-term growth prospects will keep a damper on domestic investment, while
population aging combined with expectations of slow future income growth will continue to keep
savings high. Structural reforms that increase future growth prospects could help reverse these
factors and strengthen the rebalancing process. For instance, model simulations show that higher
labor supply by female workers, better refugee integration, and pension reforms to prolong working
lives will increase future output, enhancing incentives for corporate investment and reducing
household savings already in the short-term, yielding a reduction in the current account surplus and
positive (though small) demand spillovers to the rest of the euro area.2 These reforms are discussed
in more detail in the next section. A medium-term fiscal position closer to the MTO, particularly to
finance more public investment or other growth-enhancing fiscal policies would also be helpful
(see paragraph 17 below).

Risks to the baseline are to the downside. Given the considerable monetary and fiscal
stimulus in the pipeline, upside risk could arise from a stronger-than-expected response of the
economy. Inflation could also reach the ECB inflation target faster should wage pressures intensify,
which would also accelerate the projected external rebalancing. On the downside, several external
and internal risks, which are made particularly salient by the deep trade linkages between Germany
and other euro area countries, the U.K., and China (Figure 7), could derail the growth momentum
(see Annex III):

exit by the U.K. (Brexit) following the referendum on June 23, 2016, would lead to protracted
negotiations on successor arrangements. The related uncertainty may lead to periods of
financial volatility, heightened uncertainty, and discourage investment. The U.K. is Germany’s
third largest export destination, German banks’ consolidated exposures to the U.K. amount to
12 percent of GDP, and Germany’s largest bank has sizable London-based operations.


A greater–than-expected slowdown in key advanced and emerging economies (in particular
China) could spill over to commodity exporters further, roil global financial markets and reduce
global growth. Germany might also act as a transmitter of such a shock to economies in its
manufacturing supply chain, notably in Central and Eastern Europe.3



Tighter or more volatile global financial conditions could lead to sharp asset price declines and a
decompression of credit spreads. In Germany, such a scenario may give rise to financial
turbulence and second round adverse spillovers because of a globally interconnected financial
sector.4 The still incomplete new framework for bank recovery and resolution may complicate
the policy response.

14.
Should a large downside risk materialize in Germany and across other advanced
economies, a fiscal expansion would be warranted. Further monetary support from the ECB
would also be in order in such a scenario. In Germany, if the output gap became significantly
negative, invoking the escape clause under the fiscal rule would be appropriate. In the case of a
moderate recession, the relatively large automatic stabilizers would help absorb adverse shocks.
Authorities’ Views
15.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s views on the outlook and the driving role
of domestic demand at the current juncture. They highlighted the continued strength of the
labor market, but agreed that core inflation had been less dynamic than anticipated. This was
attributed mostly to the decline in oil and other commodity prices that led to a slowdown in core
inflation via indirect channels, as well as the effect of lower non-energy import prices. In contrast,
the pass-through of wages to prices was quite low. Looking forward they projected somewhat more
dynamic core inflation developments than staff, but they saw slight downside risks to this projection.
They also noted the weak response of inflation to measures of economic slack in the past, and did
not expect nominal wage growth to increase significantly from current levels. They also broadly
agreed with staff on risks, expressing particular concern about the erosion of confidence in the
European project across the continent.
16.
As in the past, the authorities did not see the large current account surplus as a
reflection of policy-related macroeconomic imbalances. They noted the need for high household

savings and fiscal discipline in light of long-run demographic developments. While the reasons
behind high net savings by the non-financial corporate sector were less clear, especially since the
long de-leveraging process following the stock market crash of the early 2000s should have been
completed by now, they did not see this as the result of policy distortions but mainly pointed to the
desire of German firms to take advantage of more attractive investment opportunities abroad. The
Bundesbank saw the undervaluation of the REER as much smaller than staff (5–6 percent vis-à-vis
10–20 percent), the different assessments being due to different methodological and conceptual
issues as well as observation periods. The large and growing NIIP was a concern to some
counterparts, given past experience with poor financial investments abroad.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Progress has been slow on addressing needs in public infrastructure and stimulating competition in the
services sector, while mounting aging costs and a successful labor market integration of women and
refugees require further policy action.5 Germany’s leadership at the European level and globally in the
area of structural reforms would be enhanced if more progress was achieved on this front domestically.

modestly reduce the current account gap. The
additional spending would result in a larger output
gap, but this effect would be temporary and limited, because potential output would also increase
as the growth effects of the initiatives are realized. In 2016–17, when the policy space is narrower
(see Figure 4), priority should be given to public investment, while the other reforms that need fiscal
resources could be financed through reallocation within the budget. To avoid continued
overperformance in the future, an assessment of structural changes in macroeconomic variables
underlying revenue projections may be warranted, and forming contingency plans for the use of
unexpected windfalls would be beneficial.

negative. The newly-released 15-year plan for
transportation infrastructure investment points to a sizable increase in investment over
2016–30 relative to the previous plan adopted in 2003 (from EUR 10 billion to EUR 17 billion per
year). However, the plan is not binding and budget appropriations will be decided on a rolling basis.
The public investment backlog should be addressed more vigorously already this year and next,
particularly if revenue keeps overperforming. Reprioritizing within the budget envelope could also
open space for more infrastructure investment in the coming years.
19.
Removing administrative and regulatory constraints to public investment by
municipalities should be a high priority and recent steps in this direction are encouraging.
While gross public investment rose in nominal terms at the federal and regional level, it fell in
municipalities, where the needs are highest. Out of a EUR 3.5 billion Municipal Investment Fund
constituted by the federal government in mid-2015 to provide financial support to local
governments, less than EUR ½ billion have been used so far. Infrastructure planning capacity is
reported to be limited in some localities, while addressing the refugee surge has also drained
administrative resources; strict regulation at the national and European level is an additional
obstacle. To address the situation, and in line with past staff recommendations, the government is
considering reforms to make Germany’s PPP advisory agency Partnership Deutschland more
effective for municipalities, including by changing its ownership structure from private to public and
broadening its mandate to also cover infrastructure programs financed through normal
procurement. Furthermore, the federal government is discussing with the Länder the creation of a
federal transportation agency, which would be in charge of the planning, construction, and
maintenance of federal highways and would be financed through user fees. The specialized agency
would help limit implementation delays and decouple transport infrastructure investment from the
budgetary cycle.

venture capital (including in the context of the EC’s Investment Plan for Europe) and e-procurement
were recently taken. However, based on market research on medium-term bandwidth needs, the
2015 Expert Commission to Strengthen Investment in Germany argued that the government should
be more ambitious in its strategy and promote a greater rollout of fiber cable now rather than later.
Authorities’ Views
21.
The Ministry of Finance stressed its commitment to a balanced federal budget as
important to preserving fiscal discipline, and highlighted capacity and regulatory constraints
to further expand public investment. The commitment to the “black zero” at the federal level was
seen as an important cornerstone of a sound fiscal policy, especially in light of strong and growing
pressures from aging-related spending. Also, it was noted that fiscal policy was already expansionary
given that the German economy was in a situation of normal capacity utilization. On public
investment, the Ministry of Finance considered the current level of public investment as adequate at
the federal level. As to the local level, administrative backlogs and regulatory restrictions, including
European ones, were highlighted. Reducing the overall burden on labor income through lower taxes
and contributions, particularly for the low-to-medium income brackets, was seen as a useful
measure to boost output. On digitization and investment in digital infrastructure, the Ministry of
Economic Affairs highlighted its recently released new Digital Strategy 2025 as a possible framework
for bolder, future initiatives, including the creation of a gigabit optical fiber network.

B. Boosting Labor Supply in an Aging Society
22.
The projected sharp decline of the working age population after 2020 calls for
measures to boost labor supply and thereby mitigate the adverse effects of aging on
potential output. In recent years, immigration flows more than offset the natural decline in the
working age population. In the medium-term, however, some of the relevant push factors behind
immigration (the EU enlargement to the East, severe recessions in several other euro area countries,

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GERMANY

conflicts close to the EU borders) may not persist.8 In addition, the population is aging rapidly also in
many countries of origin in Eastern and Southern Europe. As net immigration flows normalize over
the medium-term, the working age population will resume shrinking and will do so at an increasing
rate. This calls for measures to boost the labor supply along three main axes: successfully integrating
the current wave of refugees into the labor market, incentivizing greater full-time female labor force
participation, and extending working lives further. Some, though not all, of these reforms entail a
small fiscal cost. If they were to be implemented in the short run, when the space available under
the fiscal rules is limited and should be used primarily to increase investment, the cost could be
financed by reprioritizing spending within the budget. In the medium run, on the other hand, there
is space to accommodate these costs without breaching the fiscal rules.

Integrating the refugees and other immigrants into the labor market
23.
Germany’s willingness to accept a large number of refugees has provided an
important global public good, and the challenge going forward will be to integrate into the
labor market the refugees who stay. While the strong current labor market situation is supportive,
in the past immigrants have faced sizable obstacles, resulting in significantly lower labor force
participation, higher unemployment, and lower wages than native workers with similar
characteristics.9 These gaps narrow with the length of their presence in Germany, but never fully
disappear. More recent cohorts and previous immigrants from the same countries of origin as the
current wave of refugees typically had worse labor market outcomes than other immigrants.
24.
Though many measures have been taken and more are underway, further policy action
should be considered to promote a successful labor market integration of refugees. Remaining
restrictions on work during asylum procedures could be further lowered (Box 3). In parallel, active
labor market policies (such as temporary wage subsidies) that have proven successful in the past in
other countries should be vigorously used; the temporary exemption from the minimum wage
currently available to long-term unemployed could be extended to refugees, and the decision on
how much to raise the minimum wage next year should take into account the challenge of
integrating them. Lowering the effective taxation of labor income at the low end of the income scale
may also help moving many refugees and other low-skill workers from social assistance to work. The
cost of these policies is likely to be small, particularly when considering the associated savings from
reduced use of social assistance.
25.
Policies should also ensure that refugees access higher-quality jobs and job training.
In this respect, the traditional, formal approach to job qualifications acquisition and recognition may
not work well for refugees (or other immigrants), who are often older than typical trainees, may have
skills learned informally, and may not be able to afford lengthy schooling periods with low earnings
(the typical vocational training duration is three years). Initiatives to make informal skill recognition

GERMANY

possible and design more flexible forms of vocational training, with language training and a
stronger on-the-job component relative to standard formal schooling, should be given priority.
While all these initiatives may require some additional fiscal outlays in the short-term, they would
have a potentially large payoff down the road through better employment prospects and less
reliance on social welfare. They may also help successfully absorb future non-refugee immigrants.
Incentivizing more active female labor force participation
26.
More active participation of women in the labor market would not only increase labor
supply but also enhance productivity.10 While female labor force participation is relatively high in
Germany, close to half of employed women work only part time. Thus, women work on average
30.5 hours per week, 9 hours less than men do. Limiting constraints to full-time work by women
would boost labor supply. It would also strengthen incentives for on-the-job training provision and
make firms more likely to have women in senior management positions, which can improve
corporate profitability. To this end, the supply of full time schooling services should be expanded
further. Distortions that increase the marginal tax burden for secondary earners should also be
reduced, specifically by moving towards a system in which health insurance contributions depend on
the number of household members covered, with targeted support for poorer households. Greater
provision of childcare services and after-school programs would have the further benefit of
facilitating the social integration of immigrant children. Also in this case, fiscal resources deployed
now—about ¼ percent of GDP if, for example, Germany were to raise spending in this area to the
OECD average—would have potentially important medium-term payoffs through higher potential
GDP.
Extending working lives
27.
Germany’s unfavorable demographic trends are weighing on the outlook. A recent
government report11 estimates that age-related government spending is set to rise between
2 and 4½ percentage points of GDP by 2040 under current policies. Without further reforms,
already-high social security contributions would have to rise further or already-declining
replacement rates would have to fall further. Past reforms will push the statutory retirement age
from the current 65 years to 67 years by 2030 (when pension outlays are expected to accelerate),
but no further increases are foreseen, and some workers can still retire about two years earlier than
other workers. Although participation rates in the 55–64 age group is high in Germany compared to
other OECD countries, the opposite is true for those older than 64. While conditions to extend
employment contracts beyond the statutory retirement age have been relaxed, there is a loss of
pension wealth for those who remain employed.

28.
Extending working lives can bring the double dividend of increasing old-age incomes
while improving the fiscal outlook. To guard against the risk of steep declines in pension benefits
or increases in contribution rates—whether mandatory or voluntary—in the long term, retirement
ages could be indexed to life expectancy. Furthermore, the choice to remain in the labor force
beyond the pensionable age could be made actuarially neutral, allowing individuals to optimize the
timing of retirement. Both policies would aim at encouraging longer working lives on average,
increasing retirement incomes, while also shoring up long-term government finances. A reform in
this direction would result in permanently lower household savings and current account surplus,
thus helping external rebalancing.
Outward spillovers
29.
Policies to boost labor supply would entail positive―though small―outward
spillovers, notably to the euro area.12 The positive response would be commensurate to the
domestic demand effect of each policy and determined by the importance of trade linkages. As all
three policies permanently boost domestic consumption and investment, German imports would
increase, particularly in the short-run, when domestic production has not fully adjusted yet but
demand rises because future gains are anticipated. Short-term demand spillovers would be more
pronounced if the fiscal costs entailed by some of the reforms are deficit-financed rather than
budget-neutral. For the rest of the euro area, the short-term net trade spillover from either extended
childcare provision or training of refugees is estimated at roughly 5 percent of the impact on
Germany’s real GDP. For the prospective increase in retirement ages, the spillover effect rises to
7.5–10 percent. Spillovers to other regions would also be positive but smaller. Joint implementation
of these policies together with a stronger public investment effort would magnify the beneficial
spillover effects.
Authorities’ Views
30.
The authorities broadly agreed that the reforms proposed by staff would be beneficial.
On refugees, the authorities stressed the importance of qualification and training to prevent the
newcomers from being trapped in low-skill and marginal employment. Initiatives to make informal
skill recognition possible and design more flexible forms of vocational training are being considered
but will take some time to develop. They also emphasized that the high professional standards
typical of the German skilled craft sector should be safeguarded. Finally, they explained that no
further exemptions to the minimum wage were being contemplated. The authorities agreed that
broadening opportunities for women to work full time is a priority, and highlighted the ongoing
effort to expand the provision of childcare, whereas changes in tax policies were seen as more
politically difficult to implement. They welcomed staff’s call for facilitating longer working lives to
better provide for retirement income, but also saw promise in planned initiatives to strengthen
second pillar (occupational) pensions—by broadening coverage to more categories of workers—as
well as to encourage work beyond the statutory retirement age.

C. Stimulating Competition in the Services Sector
31.
Competition-enhancing reforms in the services sector should be pursued more
vigorously. Slow productivity growth in the services sector is holding back overall growth, and
reforms to enhance competition in parts of the sector where it is lacking could trigger a shift toward
greater efficiency and innovation.13 However, progress on this front has been slow as special interest
groups appear well organized, and has mainly reflected pressure from the European Commission
(EC). In the context of the EC-driven mutual evaluation on access to and practice of regulated
professions, the federal and state governments reviewed the extent and nature of professional
regulations, and submitted an action plan in January, which the EC has recently qualified as lacking
ambition. In the area of professional services, the loosening of a few requirements are
contemplated. Infringement procedures by the EC are ongoing regarding the minimum compulsory
tariffs of architects and engineers, while an agreement has recently been found with tax advisors to
make these tariffs indicative instead of compulsory. In the retail sector, the government recently
gave its green light to a merger proposal between two supermarket chains that had received a
negative opinion by the competition authority and the monopolies commission, prompting the
chairman of the latter to resign.
32.
Incumbents’ dominant position in railways and postal services is still largely
unchanged. A new version of the long-awaited Act to Strengthen Competition in the Railway Sector
was approved by the federal cabinet in January 2016 but is facing a deluge of amendments in the
parliamentary process. If passed, it would strengthen the powers of the regulator, and would
enhance incentives to boost efficiency, while improving the conditions for the development of a
single European railway market. Meanwhile, the market share of new entrants in the long-distance
rail passenger market segment has remained below 1 percent. In the area of postal services, the
competition authority accused the incumbent operator of abusing its dominant position, while the
monopolies commission called last year for a reform of the legal and regulatory framework so as to
address impediments to effective competition, to no avail.
Authorities’ Views
33.
The authorities agreed that faster progress in reforming regulation in parts of the
services sector would stimulate competition and growth. In the area of professional services,
they saw scope to review conduct regulation, including price regulation, restrictions on interprofessional cooperation, exclusive rights, and shareholding restrictions. By contrast, they thought
entry regulation to be truly instrumental in promoting consumer protection and quality and unlikely
to have adverse economic effects. They saw the digitization of the economy as an opportunity to
rethink and, if necessary, redesign rules and regulations in order to foster innovation and the
transformation of existing markets, while transferring valuable protection standards into the digital

economy. They argued that the proposed railway regulation would have a positive impact on the
competition on the railway sector, and noted that the market share of the incumbent in regional
passenger rail transport and rail freight transport continued to decline, and that the liberalization of
long-distance bus services in 2013 had a strong stimulative effect on the long-distance passenger
market. On the merger between the supermarket chains they explained that the Minister of
Economic Affairs granted a ministerial authorization with conditions, since common “welfare
considerations” prevailed over competition concerns in that particular case.

relatively moderate pace and with largely
unchanged credit standards. When measured in relation to rents or income, current average housing
prices are broadly consistent with long-term averages, suggesting the upswing mainly reflects
catching-up effects. There are, however, important regional differences. Apartment price inflation
rates have recently reached double-digit in some of the largest cities and in some university towns
where pockets of vulnerability (high loan-to-value and debt-service-to-income ratios) have recently
emerged. Available data (e.g., transaction volumes, rates of return) for commercial real estate also
indicate that the market is dynamic, but credit growth in this sector is still moderate and in line with
that in the residential real estate sector.
35.
Housing price inflation also reflects a tepid response of housing supply to a swell in
demand. Even before the refugee surge, net immigration turned out much higher than projected in
the most optimistic migration scenario of the 2009 official demographic projections, expanding the
demand for housing (Figure 8). Housing completions and residential building permits have
rebounded from their 2009 trough, but the new residential construction has remained far below the
amount required to balance the market according to various consultancies and the Federal Ministry
for the Environment. Staff analysis indicates that the long-term housing supply price elasticity has
nearly halved over the past four years, suggesting that, absent new policy action, balancing supply
and demand in the housing market could take a long time and would involve further significant

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

GERMANY

price increases in the short term.14 Furthermore, the mismatch between supply and demand appears
to be concentrated in the affordable housing segment.
36.
To address supply constraints and increase the availability of affordable housing, the
government has developed a comprehensive package of measures. This package includes the
sale of publicly-owned land and properties below market price for affordable housing projects, more
funds for social housing, and targeted tax incentives. It complements the near doubling in the
budget for housing subsidies (Wohngeld) from the beginning of 2016, as well as policy measures
taken earlier to accommodate refugees. The effectiveness of this package should be closely
monitored, and the authorities should stand ready to recalibrate it if the desired effects on supply
do not materialize. In addition, loosening height and zoning restrictions in areas under pressure and
their vicinity seems to be needed.
37.
To further strengthen the housing supply response, lowering the effective real estate
transfer tax rate on new construction would be helpful. The Länder have been free to set the real
estate transaction tax rate since 2007. Since then, rates have increased from 3.5 percent in 2006 to
up to 6.5 percent now. In addition, land may be taxed multiple times before new construction is
completed, which creates distortions and increases the effective tax rate. The authorities could
consider a VAT-like system for land transfer taxation in the case of new construction so as to avoid
double taxation of land and make new construction more financially attractive. To further improve
the efficiency of real estate taxation, they could also tax properties more heavily than transactions; in
fact, an update of property value assessments is long overdue.
38.
Legislation to expand the macroprudential toolkit to address potential imbalances in
the housing market and related data gaps is being prepared. Macroprudential policy
instruments (countercyclical capital buffer, capital buffers for systemically important institutions, a
systemic risk buffer, and phased-in liquidity coverage ratio requirement) have become operational
on January 1, 2016. In June 2015, the Financial Stability Committee recommended additional
macroprudential tools (loan-to-value caps, debt-service-to-income limits, debt-to-income ceilings
and minimum amortization requirements) specifically targeted at the real estate sector, and the
legislation is being drafted. However, the calibration and operationalization of these instruments
requires granular and frequently updated loan-level data on household income and indebtedness,
as well as data on banks’ individual exposures to mortgage risks, which are currently not available to
supervisors, in part because of strict data protection laws. The new legislation would need to
address these data gaps.

The authorities concurred with staff that a housing bubble was not an immediate
concern. Based on its internal valuation models, the Bundesbank’s did not see recent price increases
or mortgage credit developments as alarming, but was closely monitoring the situation. Authorities
agreed with the importance of broadening the macroprudential toolkit, but pointed that privacy
concerns related to data access were complicating the legislative process. There was broad
agreement that housing supply needed to catch up with demand. The authorities noted that their
action plan in this regard was fulfilling one of the commitments made in the government coalition
agreement. They also explained that some measures had already been enacted, and that the action
plan’s success would hinge on continued cooperation across all levels of government as housing
policy is very decentralized.

Low interest rates may be a persistent feature of the global economy looking forward.
Monetary policy is not the only factor pushing interest rates down in Germany and globally. Despite
record low interest rates since the global financial crisis, inflation has remained subdued, a sign that
the natural (or equilibrium) real interest rate—the rate that ensures low inflation at normal capacity
utilization—has dropped to levels well below those prevailing in the past. An aging population and
slower productivity growth are key factors explaining the secular downward trend in real interest
rates since the 1980s (see Box 4). If such factors persist, then nominal and real interest rates may
remain below their pre-crisis levels even after inflation returns to target and monetary policy
normalizes, with important implications for the financial sector.
41.
Multiple challenges require the banking sector to accelerate restructuring to shore up
profitability and safeguard internal capital-generating capacity. Risk-based bank solvency
indicators have improved since the 2014 SSM’s comprehensive assessment and seem comfortable,
but leverage ratios are low in international comparison. Low profitability reflects a bank-specific
combination of remaining crisis legacy problems (especially for banks exposed to the shipping
industry), provisions for compliance violations (in the two largest banks), the need to adjust business
models to the post-crisis regulatory environment (in all large banks), as well as low interest margins
and high operating costs (especially in retail banking). These challenges may have contributed to
make large German private banks more sensitive to market turbulence earlier this year relative to
peers, with uncertainties on the quality of Additional Tier 1 capital a likely amplifying factor. For
large banks, implementing ongoing restructuring plans that involve across-the-board cost-cutting,
refocusing on core activities and withdrawing from non-profitable and capital intensive activities
and locations, and improving IT systems are priorities. Smaller banks should pursue efforts to further
reduce costs, accelerate the development of digital banking solutions, and increase fee-based
activities to offset shrinking interest rate margins. Given abundant lending capacity in the sector,
meeting these challenges is not expected to lead to a meaningful reduction in the availability of
credit to the economy.

Adjustments in banks’ strategies, partly in response to regulatory changes, may entail
negative spillovers to the rest of the world, as major German banks are withdrawing from
correspondent relationships in a number of countries. In a context of tighter capital and liquidity
requirements, stronger AML/CFT and tax transparency rules, as well as economic and trade
sanctions in some countries, German global banks have been reviewing their customer base and
business lines and have terminated accounts with certain customers and locations, though the
phenomenon remains difficult to quantify. To prevent excessive curtailment of financial activities and
important growth disruptions in emerging and developing countries, the authorities should
encourage the relevant German banks to better manage the risks around these relationships. They
should also strengthen the dialogue and cooperation among national supervisors, including to
harmonize regulatory frameworks and facilitate cross-border information sharing on customer due
diligence.
43.
The FSAP conducted a full assessment of Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking
Supervision (BCP) and concluded that the regulatory and supervisory structure was sound,
albeit with some gaps. The assessment was based on a new international methodology, which
emphasized corporate governance and generally raised the bar for both banks and supervisors. The
assessment founds that the establishment of the SSM had a positive impact on supervision, which
moved from a qualitative to a more quantitative approach. However, important shortcomings were
highlighted, among which the need to strengthen the role of bank supervisory boards, to provide
guidance on supervisory expectations for compliance with risk management and other supervisory
requirements, and to improve the coverage and granularity of supervisory data. In particular, the
lack of comprehensive, consistent and granular data affects all aspects of financial supervision, risk
monitoring, and macroprudential policy. A rapid solution to this problem is essential, and a first step
in this direction would be to amend the Federal Data Protection Law, to allow judicious use of data
already produced for other purposes, while maintaining adequate privacy protection.
44.
Completing the agenda on the new bank recovery and resolution framework should be
a high priority as Germany is home to highly interconnected systemic institutions. The new
architecture is complex and still in its infancy. The Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) became
operational at the beginning of the year. The Bank Resolution and Recovery Directive (BRRD) was
transposed into German law, while in January 2016 the Single Resolution Board (SRB) assumed direct
responsibility for resolution planning and implementation (in conjunction with the European
Commission) for (the largest) banks directly supervised by the ECB. However, resolution planning is
still work in progress although manuals and instructions for the use of resolution tools are already
implemented by the SRB. In addition, the FSAP highlighted that the decision-making process for
recovery and resolution is extremely complex as it involves several layers of domestic and European
institutions whose ability to coordinate in crisis time remains to be tested. Moreover, the
arrangements for handling a potential system-wide crisis remain unclear, in particular when it comes
to the coordination between the SRB, the ECB and the German Ministry of Finance. Given the large
size of the banking sector relative to the economy and the strong interconnectedness of the system,
the authorities should accelerate contingency planning, including by testing the plans via real

20

simulation exercises with all concerned parties. Given that Germany is home to one of the largest GSIB, this work should be given the highest priority.
45.
Supervisors need to closely monitor the life insurance sector, demand action plans
from firms in difficulty, and keep safety net arrangements under review. Low interest rates, if
protracted, will erode life insurers’ ability to meet guaranteed commitments. The transition to
Solvency II (which began in January 2016) will make the difficulties more evident, as the new
regulatory framework requires marked-to-market valuations and a forward-looking assessment of
solvency. Search for yield behaviors—longer duration and riskier assets—have been recently
emerging, which is adding to life insurers’ challenge to meet Solvency II as correspondingly higher
capital buffers are required. To help life insurers adjust to the new regime, European Directives allow
a 16 years transition. However, starting in 2017 life insurers will be forced to acknowledge the
impact of transitional measures on their results—a clear communication challenge with the risk of
severe negative reactions by investors. The FSAP analysis indicates that without transitional
measures a significant share of life insurers would not be able to meet regulatory requirements in
the baseline scenario. Medium-sized companies are the most affected as they largely rely on
guaranteed return products as source of income and do not benefit from the same amount of
(international) diversification as larger companies. Thus, supervisors should demand action plans
from firms in difficulty and keep safety net arrangements under review.
Authorities’ Views
46.
The authorities shared staff’s view that the banking sector needed to accelerate its
restructuring. However, they stressed that small retail banks had sizable capital buffers hence time
to adjust to the low interest rate environment. They also recognized that for life insurers the
transition to the new regulatory framework was made more challenging by the necessity to meet
guaranteed return commitments in a low interest rate environment, but expressed confidence in a
smooth adjustment. On supervision, they agreed that efforts to bridge existing data gaps, in
particular for mortgages, had to be stepped up, but argued that the main hurdle was political and
grounded in Germany’s restrictive data protection laws. The authorities also expressed strong
commitment to the new EU bank resolution framework and the concept of bail-in, and shared staff’s
concerns about the challenge to ensure operational readiness to implement the framework, both at
the European and German level.

STAFF APPRAISAL
47.
Germany will remain on a moderate growth path in 2016 as strong domestic demand
is offsetting weak foreign demand. A fiscal expansion, further ECB monetary stimulus, and the
continued effect of lower energy prices should more than compensate for lower demand growth
from key advanced and emerging countries. Private consumption should continue to be dynamic as
a strong labor market boosts real disposable income, while residential investment should respond
faster than in the recent past to surging housing demand. Core and headline inflation are expected
to get close to 2 percent only in the medium-term as labor cost increases slowly pass through to

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

prices. Risks are tilted to the downside. Although the monetary and fiscal stimulus in the pipeline
could yield a positive growth surprise, a further slowdown in external demand, an erosion of
confidence in the European project in parts of Europe, and a rekindling of stress in euro area
sovereign bond markets could derail economic activity.
48.
The current account surplus is projected to stay near record levels this year, and the
external position remains substantially stronger than implied by medium-term fundamentals
and desirable policy settings. Even though the growth contribution from net exports is expected
to turn negative, favorable terms of trade effects will prevent the surplus from falling more rapidly.
The persistent current account surplus reflects a combination of high savings and limited domestic
investment partly due to modest medium term growth prospects. Owing to a persistently sizable
surplus over the medium-term, the net international investment position will continue to grow
rapidly, reaching almost 90 percent of GDP by 2020.
49.
Using of the available room under the fiscal rules to finance public investment and
growth-friendly fiscal policies is appropriate to lift long-term growth, while also helping
narrow the current account surplus. The fiscal expansion planned for this year comes at an
opportune time, as it will offset weakening external demand. In the medium run, the budget balance
is expected to return to a surplus, with the public debt ratio falling below 60 percent of GDP by
2020. Fiscal resources available within the envelope defined by the fiscal rules, including in case of
overperformance, should be used to finance additional public investments and growth-enhancing
structural reforms. Stronger medium-term growth prospects would help revive domestic investment
and reduce the need for saving, supporting the external rebalancing process and generating positive
(though modest) outward spillovers, particularly to the rest of the euro area.
50.
A stronger effort is needed to efficiently address public infrastructure needs, which
will also require tackling administrative constraints. As public investment was low for many
years, particularly at the municipal level, the capacity for planning and execution of new projects has
suffered, which, together with more cumbersome regulatory requirements, is holding back a more
vigorous investment effort. We urge the authorities to rapidly remove these bottlenecks. In this
regard, the planned reform and expansion of the Partnerschaften Deutschland agency will be helpful.
The creation of a federal transportation agency, financed through user fees, would also be important
for a more efficient maintenance and upgrading of the federal roads system. Recent initiatives to
stimulate private investment in fast broadband infrastructure, an area where Germany lags behind
many peers, as well as complementary measures to foster venture capital and e-procurement, are
welcome and should be reinforced.
51.
The projected decline in the labor force due to rapid aging after 2020 calls for
measures to boost labor supply in the medium term. Additional policies to integrate the current
wave of refugees into the labor market, to broaden opportunities for full-time employment of
women, and to extend working lives, would be important in this regard. These reforms would not
only counter the projected growth decline in the medium term but also stimulate private
consumption and investment in the short term.

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GERMANY

52.
By hosting a large number of refugees Germany is helping address a global
humanitarian emergency, and policy actions are recommended to promote a successful labor
market integration of the refugees who remain in Germany. The government has helpfully
removed a number of restrictions to access to employment and training for asylum-seekers and
persons with a temporary suspension of deportation. Policy measures to allow recognition of
informally acquired skills and facilitate more flexible forms of vocational training, with a strong onthe-job component and intensive language teaching, should be strengthened. In parallel, active
labor market policies (such as temporary wage subsidies) that have proven successful in the past in
other countries should be further enhanced. Lastly, the decision on how much to raise the minimum
wage next year should take into account the challenge of integrating the refugees. Marginal tax
wedges should be lowered to incentivize greater labor supply by refugees and low-earning workers
more broadly.
53.
To further boost female labor supply, enhanced childcare and after-school programs
should complement a reduction in the marginal tax burden on secondary earners. While
female labor force participation is relatively high in Germany, almost half of employed women work
only part time. Closing this gap would stimulate labor supply and employers’ provision of on-thejob training, yielding productivity gains over time. Financial support for the expansion of childcare
provision has increased over the recent years, and should be used to improve availability of highquality full-time programs. Incentives to increase hours worked would also be raised by moving
towards a system in which health insurance contributions depend on the number of adult household
members covered, with targeted support for lower income households.
54.
Pension reforms to promote longer working lives can bring the double dividend of
increasing employment while reducing old-age poverty. As the old age dependency ratio is
expected to rise, pressures on public finances will intensify. Existing automatic adjustment
mechanisms to ensure the sustainability of the public pension system will give rise to sustained
increases in contribution rates (pushing up the already high tax burden on labor) and declines in
pension benefits (reducing old-age incomes). By extending working lives, a more adequate level of
old-age income can be maintained, without a further rise in pre-retirement savings. To this end,
indexing the retirement age to life expectancy and making the choice to remain in the labor force
actuarially neutral would be helpful.
55.
Competition-enhancing reforms in the services sector should be pursued much more
vigorously. Progress on this front has been particularly slow, and is badly needed in light of low
productivity growth. Infringement procedures by the European Commission regarding the minimum
compulsory tariffs of architects and engineers have not been followed by any action yet. The longawaited Act to Strengthen Competition in the Railway Sector has been under discussion for over
three years. Meanwhile, the market share of new entrants in the long-distance rail passenger market
segment has remained below 1 percent. Competition in postal services is still hindered by the ultradominant position of the domestic incumbent.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

GERMANY

56.
Even though price dynamics in hot spots deserve close monitoring, concerns about
across-the-board excesses in the mortgage market look premature. In recent years, the upward
price trend has been largely driven by fundamental factors such as demographic developments,
rising incomes, ratcheting up construction costs, and the greater relative attractiveness of the largest
cities where the supply response has been particularly sluggish, as well as lower mortgage rates.
Mortgage credit growth has also been trending up, but at a moderate pace with largely unchanged
credit standards overall. To be ready to address potential imbalances, granular and timely data on a
loan-to-loan basis should be collected, and the legal basis for macroprudential tools specifically
targeted at the real estate sector should be established rapidly.
57.
The government’s policy package to help housing supply adjust to higher demand in
the affordable segment is welcome. The main constraint to a greater housing supply response in
areas under pressure is the availability of building land. A particular focus on increasing the
availability of publicly-owned land as well as on loosening height and zoning restrictions in those
areas and their vicinity is thus needed. The implementation speed and effectiveness of the package,
which requires close cooperation between all levels of government, should be closely monitored.
The authorities should stand ready to reinforce the measures if the desired effects on supply do not
materialize. In parallel, the efficiency of real estate taxation could be improved by a combination of
increasing property tax (through a long overdue update of property values) and reducing the real
estate transfer tax rate. The latter measure would have the additional benefit of further incentivizing
new construction.
58.
The banking sector needs to adjust to several challenges, including a prolonged period
of low interest rates. In addition to low interest rates, low profitability reflects various combinations
of persistent crisis legacy issues, provisions for compliance violations, the need to adjust business
models to the post-crisis regulatory environment and technological change, as well as long-standing
structural inefficiencies. While restructuring efforts at large banks still need to bear fruits and costcutting remains slow, fee-based activities are picking up in the smaller banks—an encouraging sign.
Risk-based solvency measures indicate substantial capital buffers on aggregate, and non-performing
loans are generally low and declining. However, some institutions remain highly leveraged.
59.
Low interest rates, if protracted, will erode life insurers’ ability to meet guaranteed
commitments in the future. Supervisors need to closely monitor the sector, demand action plans
from firms in difficulty, and keep safety net arrangements under review. Long transitional measures
are allowed under the new EU Solvency II framework, and many life insurers are expected to rely on
such measures—in particular those with a higher share of traditional products, lower trend
profitability, and lower unrealized gains on the asset side. Authorities have appropriately re-focused
their supervisory priorities on these firms. They should prepare a communication plan in
coordination with the industry ahead of the publication of the new solvency measures in 2017, to
explain the effect of the transition to Solvency II to various stakeholders.

24

60.
The Germany FSAP analysis indicates that the Single Supervisory Mechanism and
Single Resolution Mechanism have had a positive impact. Nonetheless, further enhancements in
several areas should be high on the agenda of all the relevant authorities at the national and
European level. First, the lack of comprehensive and granular supervisory data negatively affects all
aspects of financial supervision and risk monitoring. Second, as the supervisory landscape evolves,
supervisors need to communicate their expectations to banks—including on strengthening the
oversight role of supervisory boards, internal control and audit, related party exposures, and
operational risk—and develop guidelines and regulations that can be used to substantiate
enforceable measures. Third, resolution planning for large banks with cross-border operations
should be rapidly completed. Fourth, clarifying the necessary coordination arrangements involving
the European and domestic authorities to handle a systemic crisis should be a key priority.
61.
Large global banks are withdrawing from correspondent relationships in a number of
countries. To prevent excessive curtailment of financial activities with emerging and developing
economies, the authorities should encourage the relevant German banks to better manage the risks
around these activities. They should also strengthen the dialogue and cooperation among national
supervisors, including to harmonize regulatory frameworks and facilitate cross-border information
sharing on customer due diligence.

Box 1. The Impact of Minimum Wage: Early Evidence
The new federal statutory minimum wage (MW) of €8.50 per hour became effective on January 1, 2015.
In contrast to many advanced economies, Germany did not have a nationwide MW before, but only MWs
established through collective bargaining agreements in some sectors. The new MW includes some
exemptions (mainly regarding apprentices, interns, long-term unemployed, and youth), but no sectoral or
regional differentiation. Accounting for these exemptions, the Federal Statistical Office reported that
4.0 million low-paid jobs (10.7% of total jobs) would have been covered by the MW as of January 1, 2015.
However, because of phase-in provisions exempting sectors with a minimum wage below €8.50, only
3.3 million workers were affected by the MW at its inception.
No significant aggregate effect of the MW on the labor market can be detected in its first year of
existence. Aggregate wage data show that, in spite of an acceleration in the second quarter of 2015, gross
hourly wages actually decelerated somewhat compared to 2014 for the year as a whole. In parallel, the
unemployment rate continued to decline.
To gain a better understanding of the effects of the MW, staff compared the evolution of wages and
employment across sectors. The effects would be expected to be more visible in sectors with low average
wages, as the MW would have been binding for a larger proportion of workers in those sectors. Focusing on
differential effects across sectors at the same time allows to implicitly control for factors that may have
changed aggregate labor market trends at the same time as the introduction of the MW. The comparison is
carried out only among sectors with ex-ante gross earnings per hour below the median (€22.0) at the end of
2014, as the MW likely had minimal effects on sectors paying higher wages. For these sectors, the difference
in the y-o-y growth of gross hourly earnings and employment between 2015:Q4 and 2014:Q4 is calculated.
The hypothesis is that after the MW was introduced lower-wage sectors experienced stronger wage growth
and weaker employment growth than higher-wage sectors.
Wage growth was slightly higher in sectors where the incidence of the minimum wage was stronger,
but there was no difference in employment growth. The charts show a slightly negative correlation
between wage growth and wage level for low-paying sectors. However, there is no evidence that lowerwage sectors experienced a stronger slowdown in employment growth than higher wage sectors. If one just
focuses on sectors with earnings at the bottom-end of the distribution, these sectors do not seem to show a
clear differential effect either in term of employment or in terms of wage growth.
Marginal employment (the so-called mini-jobs) appears to have been reduced by the MW. Mini-jobs
pay less than €450 per month and are exempted from the employee’s portion of social security
contributions. Many mini-jobs were paid below the MW and the data show that their number declined
substantially after the MW was introduced. The conversion of marginal employment into regular
employment was one of the objectives of the MW law.
In summary, the MW seems to have had little or no effect on aggregate wages and employment so
far, but a sizable downward effect on marginal employment. The lack of an adverse effect on total
employment and the substitution of marginal with regular employment have also been identified by studies
using micro data (Garloff, 2016; Amliger, Bispinck, and Schulten, 2016). The latter study also finds that after
the introduction of the MW wages increased disproportionately in East Germany, for marginal part-time
workers, and for women.

the rest of manufacturing and in the non-manufacturing sector.

CZE

The AI accounts for a sizable share of investment, volatility, and the non-energy goods trade surplus.
Investment in the AI accounted for 5.7 percent of aggregate investment in 2013, and for 27 percent of
aggregate GVA volatility measured on an annual basis during 1991–2013. It represented 19 percent of
Germany’s goods exports, and over 40 percent of the non-energy goods trade surplus in 2015. The share of
the AI trade surplus in the total non-energy goods trade surplus has consistently been above 40 percent
since 2008. The share of value added in AI exports has declined gradually over time as the AI’s supply chain
became more international, but still represented 68 percent in 2011, the last year for which data are available.
These structural strengths can be attributed to a number of factors, including a closed value chain, an
excellent research basis, and very substantial investments in R&D. Germany has a closed value chain,
from the steel industry to suppliers, and to auto manufacturers. All levels of the value chain cooperate
closely in the development of new products and new technologies. The AI also benefits from a highly
competitive domestic machinery construction industry. Non-university applied research think-tanks are part
of well-organized automotive clusters in several German regions. Finally, the AI is Germany’s R&D leader,
representing about 40 percent of total German industry R&D spending in 2014, and one-third of total global
R&D spending in the automotive sector.
The recent fall in oil prices is providing a boost to Germany’s AI exports. As cheaper gasoline lowers the
cost of operating cars, it stimulates global demand for automobiles. A vector autoregression analysis for the
period 2000–15 indicates that real German AI exports decrease with real oil prices. The peak effect of the
response occurs after about 2 years and is about one fourth the size of the oil price shock. This suggests
that, to the extent the fall in oil prices since mid-2014 is at least partly supply driven, the stimulus to the AI
will run for several more quarters and will help offset the current weakness in external demand.
Volkswagen (VW) diesel issues seem to have had very limited effects on the AI so far. VW, at the core
of a complex global supply chain, is the world’s second largest carmaker. It employed 610,000 staff
worldwide at end-2015, 46 percent of them in Germany. Last September, VW admitted to deploying
software to evade emissions standards on 11 million cars worldwide. The company faces penalties, legal
costs, and reputational damage. While financial markets’ initial reaction was strong, the company’s stock
price stabilized quickly, and negative spillovers on the rest of the domestic industry appear to have been
insignificant so far. However, heightened concerns about the emissions level of diesel cars, of which the AI is
a world champion, and disruptive technologies (electric cars, driverless cars) are obvious challenges the AI
will have to keep confronting to maintain its very strong position in the global market.

effective closure of the so-called Balkan route and the EU-Turkey agreement in early 2016, inflows decreased
markedly, from over 200,000 in November 2015 to 16,000 in April 2016.
Once they have received asylum, refugees have the same rights to work, access vocational training,
and receive job search assistance as local workers. However, in practice they remain at a considerable
disadvantage relative to local workers, as they lack language knowledge, relevant skills, and job search
networks. Some elements of the current labor regulation framework are supportive: to help the job
placement of the long-term unemployed, there is a six-month exemption from the statutory minimum wage;
the employment agency can also grant the employer a temporary wage subsidy—a policy that has proven
effective for the labor market integration of immigrants in other countries.1 However, while the asylum
application is pending, or if the application is rejected but the individual is granted “tolerated” status, access
to the labor market, training, and job search assistance is more limited. In response to the refugee surge, the
authorities have taken a number of policy measures to ease these restrictions at an early stage, as well as to
broaden the refugees’ access to language and vocational training. Integration courses (mostly language
training) and active employment services have been opened to asylum seekers and persons with temporary
suspension of deportation with good prospects of being accepted. Access to vocational training, internships,
and related financial support has also been simplified and widened. A ban on temporary agency employment
has been partially lifted, and the processing capacity of the office in charge of recognizing foreign
educational qualifications has been stepped up. The private sector has also launched a number of initiatives.
A new law under discussion would temporarily relax the so-called “labor market test” (the obligation
for the employer to prove that the job could not have been taken by a EU national) in areas with low
unemployment, allow individuals with tolerated status to work for two years after completing vocational
training, and create 100,000 low-paid jobs in the public sector in positions that would not compete with
private sector employment as a way for asylum-seekers to remain active and top up their earnings while the
asylum process in under way. The law would also impose restrictions on the geographical mobility of
refugees who rely on social assistance to ensure an equitable distribution of the financial burden across
regions.

Real interest rates in Germany and globally have been
declining steadily since the 1980s. While in the public
debate the monetary policy response to the Great
Recession is often seen as the primary cause of low
interest rates, the data show that real interest rates have
been trending downward for a long time in advanced
countries, including in Germany. This trend has persisted
through various cycles of monetary policy loosening and
tightening, suggesting structural causes.

The literature has highlighted a number of global

structural changes that have likely affected both the
supply of savings and the investment demand. As life expectancy rises faster than the average retirement
age, households have to save more to provide for longer retirement years (Gottfries and Teulings, 2015).
Rising income inequality in a number of countries may also have amplified the phenomenon, as rich
households tend to save a larger part of their income (Dynan et al, 2004; Cynamon and Fazzari, 2014; Piketty
and Saez, 2014). At the same time, globalization has brought an increasing number of economies closer to
the technological frontier, reducing the need for further fast capital building in catching-up countries (Natal
and Stoffels, 2007). The decline in TFP growth in advanced countries may also have reduced the global
demand for investment funds (Laubach and Williams, 2003; Gordon, 2015), and this process may have been
accentuated by the secular decline in the relative price of investment goods (IMF, 2014). All factors that
decrease global investment demand (an inward shift of the red I/Y curve) or increase the global supply of
savings (an outward shift of the blue S/Y curve) lead to a
Equilibrium in the Market for Borrowable Funds
decline in the equilibrium real rate of interest (Rw), the price
[S/Y] 0
that clears the global market for the desired demand for

RW
funds and supply of funds. These considerations imply that
[I/Y]2
[S/Y] 1
monetary policy is only partially responsible for the current
low interest rate environment. Furthermore, real interest rates
RW0*
may not rise appreciably if and when monetary policy is
RW1*
tightened, unless other, structural factors change as well. In
Germany and globally, policies to counteract the effects of
RW2*
aging, by prolonging working lives, for instance, or structural
reforms that accelerate growth potential might be needed to
durably lift the real rate of interest.

Annex I. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
Public debt continues to fall, and is expected to remain sustainable, given high primary surpluses and a
favorable interest rate-growth differential projected through the medium term. Under the current
macroeconomic outlook, the public debt-to-GDP ratio is still expected to fall below the 60 percent mark
by 2020, from 71.2 percent in end 2015. A negative growth shock represents the largest risk to the debt
outlook. Also, the realization of contingent liabilities related to future bank recapitalization needs or
worse than expected performance of winding-down institutions would push debt up by about 3 percent
of GDP. In both cases, gross financing needs would temporarily rise above 15 percent of GDP.
Nevertheless, debt would swiftly return to a firm downward path after the shock.

A. Baseline Scenario
Macroeconomic assumptions. Real GDP growth is expected to remain at 1.8 percent in 2016,
supported by the stimulus provided by QE and lower oil prices, as well as fiscal stimulus and robust
real wage growth. In the medium run, growth should converge to its potential level, estimated at
1.2 percent. Inflation—based on GDP deflator—should fall back to 1.5 percent in 2016, and remain
close to this level thereafter. Sovereign interest rates continue to fall at all maturities, and are
currently negative up to eight years maturity. Thus, average interest rates are yet lower than one
year ago, and are expected to drop from 2.2 percent in 2015 to 1.3 percent in 2021.1
Germany’s high level of government debt calls for using the higher scrutiny framework. Public
gross debt is currently above the indicative DSA threshold for high scrutiny of 60 percent of GDP.
Debt increased significantly over 2009–10, reaching a peak of 82.5 percent of GDP, reflecting sizable
fiscal stimulus, large financial sector support and euro zone crisis-related lending. Since the peak, it
has declined gradually on the back of fiscal consolidation and a favorable interest rate-growth
differential. Estimated gross financing needs are however below 15 percent of GDP through the
forecast horizon.
Realism of baseline assumptions. The forecasts of macro-fiscal variables affecting debt dynamics
have been on the conservative side. The median forecast error for real GDP growth during 2007–15 is
-0.11 percent, suggesting that there is slight upward bias in the staff projections, but the forecast
bias is in line with other surveillance countries. Similarly, the median forecast error for inflation
(GDP deflator) is 0.54 percent, suggesting that the staff overestimated inflation in the past
(particularly post-2009). The median forecast bias for the primary balance is relatively large, at
1.16 percent of GDP, among the most conservative for surveillance countries.
Cross-country experience suggests that the projected fiscal adjustment is feasible. Both the
maximum 3 year adjustment in the cyclically-adjusted primary balance (CAPB) over the projection
period (½percent of GDP) and 3-year average cyclically adjusted primary balance are not ambitious
1

The interest rate on new borrowing is derived from forecasts of the real interest rate and inflation, and it does not
necessarily match market-based interest rate forecasts. Using market-based forecasts would make little difference to
the debt sustainability analysis.

in cross-country comparison. Germany was able to deliver larger fiscal consolidations in the past,
notably in 2011 and 2012.

B. Shocks and Stress Tests
Germany’s government debt should remain below 75 percent of GDP under plausible macrofiscal shocks, while gross financing needs would remain below 18 percent of GDP. Under all
considered macro-fiscal stress tests, both the debt-to-GDP ratio and gross financing needs either
continue to fall or swiftly return to a downward path after the shock. Temporary shocks to real GDP
growth, a combined macro-fiscal shock, or a contingent liability shock would nonetheless drive a
temporary increase in debt and/or gross financing needs. Given the historical variability of growth,
debt dynamics in Germany is most sensitive to growth shocks.
List of shocks and stress tests2


Growth shock. Under this scenario, real output growth rates are lower than in the baseline by
one standard deviation over 2017–18, i.e. 2.8 percentage points. The assumed decline in growth
leads to lower inflation (0.25 percentage points per 1 percentage point decrease in GDP growth)
and the interest rate is assumed to increase 25 basis points for every 1 percent of GDP
worsening of primary balance. Debt (gross financing needs) would peak at 74 (17) percent of
GDP in this case, and converge to 66 (12) percent of GDP by 2021.



Primary balance shock. This scenario examines the effect of a dual shock of lower revenues and
rise in interest rate, leading to a cumulative 1.4 percent deterioration in the primary balance over
2017–18 (one standard deviation shock to the primary balance). The shock would result in a
modest deterioration of debt dynamics.



Interest rate shock. This scenario assumes a 400 basis points increase in debt servicing costs
throughout the forecast horizon, mimicking the historical maximum interest rate experienced
since 2006. The effect on public debt and gross financing needs would also be relatively modest.



Additional stress test: Combined macro-fiscal shock. This test combines shocks to growth, the
interest rate, and the primary balance; while avoiding double-counting the effects of individual
shocks. The impact on debt dynamics is slightly worse than that of a growth shock.



Additional stress test: Contingent fiscal shock. This scenario assumes a cumulative 3 percent of
GDP (about 90 billion euros) additional support to the financial sector over 2017–18 comprising
of additional re-capitalization needs in the banking system (55 billion euros), a call on half of
capital shield guarantees (25 billion euros), and worse than expected performance of portfolios
of winding-down institutions (10 billion euros). While a sizable shock, the impact on the debt
ratio is relatively limited, and a convergence to 60 percent is still achieved in 2021. Gross
financing needs would remain comfortably below 15 percent.

2

Given that virtually all outstanding sovereign debt is denominated in euros, the scenario of a real exchange rate
shock would not have a relevant effect on debt and is therefore not discussed.

400 and 600 basis points for bond spreads; 17 and 25 percent of GDP for external financing requirement; 1 and 1.5 percent for change in the share of short-term debt; 30 and 45
percent for the public debt held by non-residents.
4/ Long-term bond spread over German bonds, an average over the last 3 months, 11-Mar-16 through 09-Jun-16.
5/ External financing requirement is defined as the sum of current account deficit, amortization of medium and long-term total external debt, and short-term total external debt at
the end of previous period.

Current
account

Background. The current account averaged 6.1 percent of GDP over the last decade and reached 8.5 percent of GDP in 2015, a
1.2 pp. increase relative to 2014. Sixty percent of this increase is accounted for by the improvement in the gas and oil balance
supported by lower commodity prices. The non-energy trade surplus grew by 0.2 percent of GDP owing to a depreciation of
the REER and boosted automobile exports due to lower oil prices. After declining substantially in previous years, the surplus
vis-à-vis the rest of the euro area expanded by 0.7 percent of GDP relative to 2014, mainly because the energy deficit with the
Netherlands shrank. The bulk of the surplus reflects large saving-investment surpluses of non-financial corporations and
households. The government contributed about ⅓ percent of GDP to the improvement in the current account in 2015.
Assessment. The cyclically-adjusted current account balance stood at 8.8 percent of GDP in 2015, which is 3–6 percentage
points of GDP stronger than the value implied by fundamentals and desirable policies. Staff assesses the norm at
2½–5½ percent of GDP. The norm implied by the EBA model is 4.9 percent. 1/ The staff assessment departs from the EBA
norm to incorporate a more favorable demographic outlook reflecting new scenarios from the German statistical agency as
well as staff assumptions on the impact of the recent refugee wave. These factors bring down the assessed CA norm by
0.9 percentage points. The sensitivity of the norm to demographic factors, and uncertainties regarding to the evolution of
these factors, explain the wider range around the assessed CA norm. 2/

Real exchange
rate

Background. By end of 2015, the CPI based real exchange rate had depreciated in effective terms by 5.3 percent from its
2014 average primarily because of nominal bilateral depreciations vis-à-vis the USD and the RMB. These exchange rate
movements are related to the monetary tightening in the U.S. and the implementation and expansion of quantitative easing in
the euro area. As of April 2016, the REER has appreciated 1.3 percent over its 2015 average.
Assessment. Staff’s assessment for 2015 is of a REER undervaluation of 10–20 percent. The EBA REER Level model yields an
undervaluation of about 22 percent. The undervaluation implied by the CA regression model using standard trade elasticities is
10–15 percent. 3/

Capital and
financial
accounts:
flows and
policy measures

Background. In 2015, net portfolio and other investment flows constituted about ½ and ⅓ of the capital and financial account
balance, respectively. On a regional basis, about 2/3 of the net outflows were toward European countries and 1/3 toward the
Americas (mostly the U.S.), with small net inflows from emerging countries and offshore centers. Net direct foreign investment
declined mainly reflecting an increase in flows into Germany. The stock of Germany’s net (Target2) claims on the Eurosystem
went down from a peak of €749 billion in August 2012 to €603 billion in April 2016.
Assessment. Reduced euro area financial stress has led to the resumption of private capital outflows and a declining exposure
to the Eurosystem, though the latter remains well above pre-crisis levels.

FX intervention
and reserves
level
Technical
Background
Notes

Background. The euro has the status of global reserve currency.
Assessment. Reserves held by Euro area countries are typically low relative to standard metrics. The currency is freely floating.
1/ The rapid aging of the population contributes 3.9 percentage points to the estimated EBA CA norm of 4.9 percent of GDP.
Most of the EBA-estimated gap for 2015 reflects the regression’s residual rather than gaps in the policies included in the EBA
model.
2/ In this separate assessment, staff assumes projected refugee inflows unchanged in other countries, including in large
absorbers of refugee flows in Europe (such as Sweden and Austria).
3/ The EBA REER Index model has an unusually poor fit for Germany, predicting a depreciating trend that has not occurred.
The result for 2015 is an estimate of overvaluation (of 2.7 percent) that has been discarded from the assessment as implausible,
including in light of the assessment that the CA is too strong.

Overall Assessment
Overall Assessment:
Germany’s external position in
2015 was substantially
stronger than implied by
medium-term fundamentals
and desirable policy settings.
The current account gap has
widened relative to 2014
reflecting the delayed
response of consumption to
the windfall from lower
energy prices, and REER
depreciation. Current account
surplus modestly narrowed in
early 2016 together with small
appreciation of the REER.
These developments do not
alter the overall assessment of
2015.
Staff projects some gradual
rebalancing in the medium
run as the terms of trade
windfall is gradually spent,
energy prices partially
recover, private investment
keeps strengthening, and
stronger wage growth
relative to euro area trading
partners contributes to
realign price competitiveness.
Potential policy responses:
Fiscal resources available
within the fiscal rules should
be used to boost public
investment and growthenhancing structural reforms.
This would raise Germany’s
potential output and
generate positive demand
spillovers to the rest of the
euro area while reducing the
German current account
surplus.

GERMANY

Background. Germany’s positive net international investment position (NIIP) reached 49 percent of GDP at end-2015. The NIIP
of financial corporations other than MFIs is large and positive (48 percent of GDP), while that of the general government is
large and negative (35 percent of GDP), partly reflecting Germany’s safe haven status. The NIIP is expected to reach 80 percent
of Germany GDP and 3 percent of world GDP by 2021, as the projected CA surplus remains sizable in the medium term. The
implicit rate of return on foreign assets has exceeded that on liabilities by 0.6 percent on average over 2010–15. Foreign assets
are well diversified by instrument, and the exposure to emerging market is small.
Assessment. Safe haven status and the strength of Germany’s current external position limit risks.

economies or negative growth surprises in China. With
its high degree of trade openness, Germany is especially
susceptible to fluctuations in global demand.

II. Tighter or more volatile global financial
conditions, as investors reassess underlying risk and
respond to unanticipated changes in growth and
financial fundamentals in large economies and Fed
policy rate path. This scenario may give rise to domestic
financial risks and second round adverse spillovers
because of the globally interconnected financial sector.

Consider a discretionary fiscal
expansion to the extent
allowed by the fiscal rules. If
the output gap widens
significantly, depending on the
size and nature of the shock to
the economy, invoking the
escape clause under the
national debt brake rule could
be appropriate to support
German growth.

III. Reassessment of regional sovereign risk. Financial
stress in the euro area (EA) could re-emerge triggered
by policy uncertainty, faltering reforms, or political
unrest, as EA institutional weaknesses remain.

Source of Risks
Risks to the economic outlook

Risks to the financial sector
VI. Excessive risk-taking associated with the low
interest rate environment.
The housing market strength in most German urban
areas could continue and real estate assets could
become overvalued. Faced with falling net interest
margin banks may be tempted to adopt (risky) searchfor-yield strategies.
In a context of persistently low interest rates, some life
insurers may not be able to pay guaranteed yields to
policyholders and may become distressed. The shortfall
would likely remain a very small share of GDP but may
have a negative reputational impact on the financial
sector as a whole.
VII. Distress in a major financial institution
One of Germany’s systemic financial institutions may
become distressed if the sector is confronted with
significant shocks. This could trigger a systemic event
given the interconnectedness and the importance of
German SIFIs as global shock emitters.

Take precautionary measures
now by strengthening the
macroprudential framework
and bank supervision. Keep
pushing large banks to reduce
their high leverage.
Supervisors should make full
use of the additional early
intervention powers granted to
them by the 2014 life insurance
reform law to ensure prudent
behavior by the industry.

The authorities should make
sure that the resolution of a
major financial institution does
not contaminate the rest of the
financial system and ensure
ample liquidity provision to the

Exchange Rate Arrangement
Germany’s currency is the euro, which floats freely and independently against other currencies.
Germany is an Article VIII member and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on
payments and transfers for current international transactions. It maintains measures adopted for
security reasons, which have been notified to the Fund for approval in accordance with the
procedures of Decision 144 and does so solely for the preservation of national or international
security.
Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT)
Germany was last assessed against the previous AML/CFT standard in 2009. Some shortcomings were
identified inter alia with respect to the money laundering (ML) and terrorist financing (TF) offenses,
and AML/CFT preventive measures (including the reporting of suspicious transaction requirements,
and customer due diligence, CDD, requirements). In recent years, Germany has introduced
significant reforms to enhance its AML/CFT regime. It notably criminalized self-laundering and
immobilized bearer shares, enhanced domestic cooperation, and improved the supervisory
framework for designated non-financial business and professions (DNFBPs) and the risk analysis
model applied by BaFin for AML/CFT supervision. Onsite visits to financial institutions and DNFBPs
have increased. Germany is currently conducting a national assessment of its ML and TF risks.
Overall, the AML/CFT framework appears strong, but some weaknesses remain. Amongst others,
Germany should consider expanding the range of predicate offenses to ML to include offenses—in
particular serious tax offenses—not only when aggravating circumstances are met but also in their
absence, when the offenses generate significant amounts of proceeds. Germany should also
enhance AML/CFT supervision of banks with cross-border operations and as priority, should give
additional attention to the supervision and audit review of banks’ risk assessments and applicable
control measure, enhance information flow and cooperation between BaFin, ECB and the
Bundesbank on AML/CFT issues and increase staffing. Finally, Germany should take further measures
to facilitate timely access to beneficial ownership information of legal persons.
The next assessment of Germany’s AML/CFT framework is tentatively scheduled to take place in 2021.

STATISTICAL ISSUES (AS OF MAY 24, 2016)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: The economic database is generally comprehensive and of high quality, and data provision is
adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: Germany adopted the European System of Accounts 2010 (ESA2010) in September
2014. The 2006 ROSC Data Module mission found that the macroeconomic statistics generally follow
internationally accepted standards and guidelines on concepts and definitions, scope, classification and
sectorization, and basis for recording. However, the sources for estimating value added for a few
categories of service industries could be improved. A direct source for quarterly changes in inventories,
which is an important indicator of changes in GDP over the business cycle, is lacking. Extrapolations of
changes in inventories are based on the difference between the monthly production index and turnover
index in manufacturing.
Government Finance Statistics: Comprehensive data reporting systems support the accuracy and
reliability of the government finance statistics. However, these data are based on cash accounting
systems, although documentation exists to explain the differences between the general government
data in the ESA2010 (noncash) classification and the general cash data on an administrative basis;
Germany publishes—through Eurostat—general government revenue, expenditure, and balances on a
noncash/ accrual basis on a quarterly basis (ESA2010) and these data are presented in a GFSM 2001
format in International Financial Statistics, albeit with delay. Germany submits annual data for
publication in the Government Financial Statistics Yearbook, in GFSM 2001 format. Monthly data are only
disseminated on a cash-basis and are reported to STA.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: The ECB reporting framework is used for monetary statistics and
data are reported to the IMF through a “gateway” arrangement with the ECB. The arrangement provides
an efficient transmission of monetary statistics to the IMF and for publication in the IFS. Monetary
statistics for Germany published in the IFS cover data on central bank and other depository
corporations (ODCs) using Euro Area wide residency criterion. Data based on national residency
criterion is also published as memorandum items.
Financial Sector Surveillance: Germany participates in the IMF’s Coordinated Direct Investment Survey
(CDIS), Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) and financial soundness indicators (FSIs) databases. The
German authorities compiled a comprehensive set of FSI data and metadata. Of the 40 FSIs, Germany
reports all except net foreign exchange exposure to equity (I31). Even though Germany reports all of
the 12 core FSIs, six FSIs are reported on an annual basis only: (i) NPL Net of Provisions to Capital, (ii)
NPL to Total Gross Loans, (iii) Return on Assets, (iv) Return on Equity, (v) Interest Margin to Gross
Income, and (vi) Non-Interest Expense to Gross Income. Plans are already underway to change the legal
basis for the periodicity of deposit taking institutions’ reporting requirements. In addition, the quality of
data on bank exposures submitted to the BIS needs to be improved, including provision of the data on
ultimate risk basis for advanced countries.

Statement by Mr. Steffen Meyer, Executive Director for Germany
June 24, 2016
1.
I would like to convey my authorities’ gratitude for comprehensive, detailed and
insightful discussions during this Article IV and Financial Sector Assessment cycle. My
authorities find their views well-documented in the set of reports. They found the staff
assessment candid and balanced. With regard to the FSAP they will use the findings to
critically reflect current structures and practices in Germany’s financial sector.
Overview
2.
The German economy is performing well with steady growth supported by solid
private consumption based on a strong labor market and higher wages and a recovery of
investment. The rebalancing of the German economy is underway (net exports do not
contribute to growth) despite a current account surplus that has increased because of
temporary developments (commodity prices). Public and private balance sheets are and
remain healthy.
3.
As indicated in recent years, the German government plans to prudently build on
these favorable developments, emphasizing the medium- and long-term orientation of its
policies. This will ensure a reliable economic policy framework as a central precondition for
stronger private investment and consumption. In addition, and very importantly, this will
support the sustainability of public finances in the face of known and predictable challenges
(demographics) on the one hand and provide resilience to unknown and unforeseen
developments on the other hand. One example for such unforeseen developments is
increased refugee-related expenditures. The approach of fostering confidence and resilience
has served the German economy well and contributed to stability in Europe and globally.
Looking ahead, my authorities fully agree with staff that the key task will be to strengthen
the growth potential of the German economy.
Outlook and Risks
4.
The projection of real GDP growth of 1.7% this year and 1.5% next year is in line
with the assessment of my authorities. They share the view that strong domestic demand is
offsetting currently weak exports especially in 2016. Domestic demand is expected to
remain strong also in the following years on the back of large employment gains and will
additionally be boosted by an expansionary fiscal and monetary policy as well as lower oil
prices. Emerging bottlenecks on the labor market are expected to be dampened by high
immigration. In this context it seems important to distinguish between refugees and labormarket oriented migrants with the latter typically integrating faster and easier into the labor
market.

2
5.
While my authorities largely agree with the expected path of headline inflation, the
decisive role of import prices could have been emphasized more clearly compared to the
impact of the output gap and monetary policy measures.
6.
Concerning risks, my authorities largely agree with staff assessment. However,
investment could turn out stronger than anticipated by staff contributing to a more balanced
view on risks to GDP growth. Concerning the nominal side downside risks to wages seem to
outweigh upside risks in the near future. An additional risk relates to the development of
refugee influx.
External Assessment
7.
My authorities appreciate the in-depth analysis on Germany’s external balance and
agree with staff that the assessment of the German current account surplus cannot be
reduced to mono-causal explanations. Temporary factors as the favorable exchange rate and
commodity prices are responsible for a significant part of the recent surplus. Moreover, my
authorities share the view that a large proportion of the surplus can be attributed to
fundamental factors with demographics and the associated high savings rate being the most
prominent drivers. These fundamental factors are slowly ceasing by nature. Therefore, it is
likely that the current account will decrease only gradually. However, this should be a
market driven process as the surplus reflects mainly the international competitiveness of
German firms and individual decisions by consumers and companies rather than economic
policy. Even sizeable increases in public capital spending would only have modest effects
on the external balance and spill-over effects on partner countries would be fairly limited—
this even more as final demand in Germany is not the main determinant of exports to
Germany for many European neighbors as staff analysis has shown in the past (supply chain
nature of trade integration).
8.
As mentioned in the staff report, the Deutsche Bundesbank assesses the
undervaluation of Germany’s real effective exchange rate (REER) to be far smaller than
staff. The corresponding differences between staff and the Deutsche Bundesbank are partly
related to the uncertainty surrounding the determination of a fundamental equilibrium value
of the REER.
Fiscal Policy and Public Investment
9.
Despite the favorable fiscal outcome and cautious planning for the coming years,
German fiscal policy faces important challenges. First, authorities at all government levels
are currently tackling the urgent task of providing humanitarian assistance to refugees and
engage in efforts to support integration into the society and the labor market. Second, as in
other countries, public budgets benefit from windfall savings resulting from exceptional
circumstances on financial markets. A normalization in interest rates over the medium term

3
needs to be factored in today’s budget planning. Third, population ageing will put pressure
on public finances through the pension, health and long-term care system.
10.
Given these challenges, the German government aims to maintain a balanced-budget
target over the entire projection period until 2020. It will avoid pushing the fiscal deficit to
the numerical limits allowed by national and European fiscal rules, and rather strives for
safety margins to ensure that fiscal rules are observed at all times.
11.
My authorities agree with staff that fiscal policy is expansionary in particular due to
refugee-related spending as well as tax relief notably for families, single parents and lowincome earners. At the same time, public investment continues to expand faster than total
public spending; a special focus is put on infrastructure, education, research and
development. Against this background, my authorities do not agree with staff that “a more
ambitious investment program is needed”. While “increasing public investment” is high on
the government’s agenda the overall quality of public infrastructure in Germany is
considered to be very good also in international comparisons. The challenge is to preserve
infrastructure quality in an efficient manner.
12.
For this reason, my authorities intend to establish a federal transportation entity with
the aim to unbundle the mixed responsibilities of the federal level and the German states, the
“Länder”, to increase overall efficiency. This entity will be organized on the basis of
private-sector principles. It will be responsible for planning, construction, operation,
maintenance and financing of the federal highway infrastructure based on the life cycle
model. To ensure sustainable and predictable financial resources for the transport
infrastructure the federal transportation entity will be financed mainly by user fees. Private
investors will be given the opportunity to finance projects related to transport infrastructure
depending on economic viability.
13.
In addition, my government intends to remove administrative and regulatory
constraints to public investment by municipalities and thereby follows up on
recommendations of the IMF. Germany’s PPP advisory agency Partnership Deutschland
will be transformed into a public agency. This new center of excellence provides advisory
service to municipalities in Germany throughout all project phases and irrespective of the
selected procurement method.
Structural Reforms and Potential Output
14.
In view of unfavorable demographics, my authorities agree that reforms need to be
implemented to strengthen potential output and to increase productivity. Prioritizing
investment, boosting labor supply, and more competition in the services sector are certainly
key reform areas as pointed out by staff. A further target of the federal government is to
attract qualified workers from abroad.

Private Investment
15.
Next to the initiatives to promote efficient private and public investment at all levels
of government mentioned above (para 12 and 13) my authorities are undertaking several
measures to create a more attractive environment for private investment. Thus, they press
vigorously ahead with the energy transition and combine it with an intelligent innovation
policy. They also firmly support the expansion of digital infrastructure and provide targeted
incentives for small and medium-sized enterprises to invest in the digital transformation.
They are improving the environment for “young” companies and venture capital.
Boosting Labor Supply in an Ageing Society
16.
Staff suggestions to boost labor supply will be an important input for ongoing
discussions in Germany. I would highlight the following points with regard to the three
areas emphasized by staff:
-

My authorities agree that extending working lives would improve fiscal sustainability
and increase old-age income. Initiatives to create incentives to work beyond the
statutory retirement age, e.g. by implementing actuarially neutral schemes, are important
to increase retirement age effectively. Indexing the statutory retirement age to life
expectancy, as proposed by staff, is one option. To improve the resilience of the social
system against adverse demographic developments, it is important to strengthen the
second pillar as well, in particular by substantially broadening the coverage of
occupational schemes.

-

The refugee influx in Germany represents a tremendous challenge to all levels of
government, to business and society as a whole. My authorities agree with staff that the
long term task is to help refugees integrate into the labor market and obtain the
necessary qualifications. The German government has taken extensive measures such as
accelerating asylum procedures, providing language skills, and improving skill
recognition. Further measures are planned by the upcoming integration law. My
authorities agree that continuing adjustments are necessary. With regard to the staff’s
recommendation to vigorously use active labor market policies such as temporary wage
subsidies, I would like to point out that in 2016 extensive funds of additional €575
million are provided for active labor market programs for recognized refugees including
job search assistance, on the job training, subsidized public sector employment as well
as wage subsidies. In addition, for asylum seekers the budget for active labor market
policies has been raised by €350 million in 2016. However, measures such as wage
subsidies can only be effective, if necessary requirements for employment (e.g. language
skills) are met.

In the past ten years the female employment rate in Germany has significantly increased
from 65.0 percent in 2006 to 73.6 percent in 2015. Still, my authorities broadly agree
with staff on the importance to further incentivize female labor market participation,
especially to increase hours worked. My authorities’ efforts in this regard are primarily
focused on improving the reconciliation of work and family life (while they do not
exclude discussions of the tax and social security system). Accordingly, high priority is
given to the expansion of child care facilities in terms of quantity and quality. From
2008 until 2019 Germany will have invested €12.4 billion in child care facilities.

Stimulating Competition in the Service Sector
17.
My authorities recognize that there is low productivity growth in some parts of the
services sector in Germany and that less regulation could stimulate competition and growth.
Against this background, regulations must be clearly justified on grounds of consumer
protection, for security reasons, or to preserve the quality of vocational training. My
authorities highlight that some progress was achieved with regard to professional
regulations and services (veterinarians, tax advisors). However, going forward they agree to
carefully examine which regulation is necessary for consumer protection, health or quality
of services and weigh it against positive economic effects.
18.
Although the market share of competitors to the incumbent operator in the longdistance rail passenger market segment has remained below 1 percent, the competition in the
area of regional rail passenger transport and rail freight transport has increased steadily in
recent years. The German government is convinced that the new “Act to Strengthen
Competition in the Railway Sector” will have a positive impact on the competition in the
railway market.
Housing: Relieving Price Pressure by Stimulating Supply
19.
My authorities broadly agree with staff’s assessment of house price developments in
Germany. While there are currently no signs of a substantial broad-based house price
misalignment, residential property might be overvalued to some extent in a number of cities.
They also concur that the expansion of housing supply is currently not sufficient to dampen
house price inflation, and that the constrained supply of building land is an important factor
for the scarcity of affordable housing. However, my authorities acknowledge that the scope
for boosting building land supply in the metropolitan areas might be limited. As noted by
staff, they have developed a comprehensive 10-point-plan to address supply constraints and
will monitor the success of this program closely.

6
FSAP and Financial Sector
20.
My authorities agree that the German financial sector is overall stable and robust to
shocks. They agree that the persistently low interest rate environment is significantly putting
pressure on the profitability of banks including Less Significant Institutions (LSIs). Because
LSIs constitute the majority of German banks, German authorities will continue to carry out
surveys on the low interest rate environment in order to better monitor interest rate risks. My
authorities agree that banks would broadly be able to withstand market and funding liquidity
shocks.
21.
My authorities share most of the conclusions of the stress testing results. As they
have emphasized during the FSAP in 2011, solvency of insurers still remains adequate. With
transitional measures, insurers’ capital levels appear generally sufficient. My authorities
know that without the transitional measures, a significant number of life insurers would
have difficulties in meeting the Solvency II Capital Requirement.
22.
With regard to the Insurances Solvency Stress Testing, my authorities are aware that
“low profitability of life insurers hampers their ability to pay guaranteed yields to
policyholders.” As Germany’s insurance sector is dominated by guaranteed return life
products my authorities know that they need to be cautious when insurers adopt risky
search-for-yield strategies against the backdrop of low profitability and persistent structural
weakness.
23.
My authorities agree that systemic risks and spillovers are important issues that
should be monitored by authorities. However, they note that only limited conclusions can be
drawn from the IMF staff’s analysis regarding “domestic interconnectedness among
publicly traded German banks and insurers”. Although it is true that the German financial
system is interconnected, the degree of interconnectedness is hard to be assessed because a
comparison to other countries and industries is missing.
24.
My authorities concur with staff on the key messages with respect to the German
macro-prudential policy framework: while broadly appropriate, some scope for
improvement is highlighted. They agree that macro-prudential analysis is highly datadependent. An appropriate set of readily available, comprehensive, and reliable data is a
precondition to monitor developments, to identify possible risks to financial stability, to
choose and calibrate the adequate instruments and assess their effects afterwards. This
argument is of particular relevance for the real estate sector. My authorities are currently
working on a legal act implementing a recommendation of the German Financial Stability
Committee (FSC). The German FSC has recommended to create additional macroprudential tools as regards residential real estate as well as a sufficient and proportionate
legal basis for the collection of data to the extent and at all the level of detail necessary for
the calibration and application of the macro-prudential tools.

25.
The assessment shows Germany’s high level of compliance with the Basel Core
Principles for Effective Banking Supervision (BCPs) in general and in particular as
Germany has been assessed not only against the essential but the additional criteria.
Furthermore, the BCPs have been revised substantially in 2012. In addition, Germany is the
first country that has been assessed under the new European banking supervision regime—
Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM)—which conferred specific tasks relating to the
prudential supervision of credit institutions upon the ECB. Regarding the assessment of the
core principles my authorities think that the compliance with a number of principles is
assessed somewhat too negative and that the current regime effectively fulfils the IMF’s
requirements. In most cases the results are driven by the fact that assessors are not satisfied
with the role of the supervisory board within the context of the rules of the German
company law. In my authorities’ view this critical assessment of the supervisory board and
its role within the corporate governance framework in Germany are contradictory to the
statement of the Basel Committee of Banking Supervision, which states that both
concepts—one-tier and two-tier systems—are both equivalent although the role of the board
in its supervisory function in a one-tier-system is broader than in a two-tier-system.
26.
My authorities share the assessment that the transposition of the EU Bank Recovery
and Resolution Directive (BRRD) into German law has significantly strengthened the bank
recovery and resolution regime as well as crisis management in Germany. Germany has
made significant progress in recovery and resolution planning. Resolution of Significant
Institutions (SIs) and transnationally active LSIs is taken to a European level and my
authorities agree that decision-making processes are complex. Identified operational
challenges are being addressed and my authorities are working on making arrangements to
ensure that resolution instruments can be timely implemented in order to avoid potential
negative market sentiments.
27.
In addition, the harmonized EU directive on deposit guarantee schemes, which
entered into force in 2014, establishes a legally binding deposit guarantee for Europe of up
to €100.000 per depositor and therefore addresses prior concerns by the IMF. In certain
circumstances this limit can be extended. The German Act transposing the Deposit
Guarantee Scheme Directive (DGSD) entered into force in July 2015. Since then also
mutual protection schemes introduced a legal claim for reimbursement of €100.000.
The assessment with regard to Eurex Clearing AG shows Germany‘s high level of
compliance with the CPSS /IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMI).
The German authorities are convinced that Eurex Clearing AG’s arrangements fully observe
the regulatory requirements laid down in the PFMI including those on operational risk
management.
