IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation and Third Post-Program
Monitoring with Moldova

On December 16, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation and Third Post-Program Monitoring1 with Moldova.
Political uncertainty, large-scale bank fraud, an unsupportive external environment, and adverse
weather conditions have taken a heavy toll on Moldova. In that light, economic growth, at
3.6 percent, came in surprisingly strong in the first half of 2015 and was largely driven by net
exports. Inflation, at 12.5 percent in September, has risen above its target range of 5 percent
± 1.5 percentage points, yet remains notably contained given the scale of liquidity injections in
problem banks. Aggressively high policy rates and reserve requirements have helped reduce
pressure on the exchange rate, reserves, and inflation.
Reserves fell by about a third between October 2014 and February 2015, but have been stable
since. Net outflows in the financial account surged at end-2014, due to election uncertainty and
the banking crisis, but the outflow in currency and deposits tapered off in the second quarter of
2015. Remittances declined by 19 percent in the first half of the year, but their effect on the
current account was offset by a significant improvement in the trade balance, reflecting mainly
the impact of lower energy prices and lower domestic demand.
The near term outlook is difficult. The economy is projected to contract by 1.75 percent in 2015,
followed by a marginal recovery of around 1.5 percent in 2016. Remittances continue to decline,
and a drought has sharply affected agricultural production, with lingering effects expected in
2016. Capital expenditure is weak. Financing constraints bind across the economy – credit
growth remains negative, external budget support is falling, and yields on short-term government
bills have risen from around 10 percent at end-2014 to over 23 percent.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Deep reform is needed in the financial sector. The closure of three insolvent banks in October is
a welcome step forward. However, to preserve financial stability, a comprehensive review of the
health of the remaining institutions is needed, as well as improvements in the regulatory,
supervisory, and crisis management frameworks. Long-standing deficiencies in identifying
ultimate beneficial ownership of banks need to be urgently corrected.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors expressed concern about the recent political, economic, and financial
developments in the country, and cautioned that significant downside risks remain to the outlook.
Directors regretted that delays in addressing long-identified governance issues in the banking
sector ultimately led to large-scale fraud with substantial economic costs. While noting that
macrofinancial stability has been broadly maintained despite this and other large domestic and
external shocks, Directors urged the authorities to act decisively to address key vulnerabilities in
the financial sector, pursue prudent macroeconomic policies, and deepen structural reforms.
Directors welcomed the recent closure of three insolvent banks, and stressed the importance of
ensuring the soundness of the remaining financial institutions along with improvements in the
regulatory and supervisory frameworks, including in the insurance and non-bank financial
sectors and the AML/CFT framework. Directors called for strengthening the governance in the
banking sector, and welcomed the external review of the supervisory process in the lead up to the
banking crisis. Directors urged the authorities to swiftly enhance the independence, powers, and
crisis management toolkits of both the National Bank of Moldova and the National Commission
for Financial Markets.
With substantial fiscal costs of the banking sector resolution and the potential for further claims
on public sector resources, Directors emphasized the need to pursue credible fiscal consolidation
to ensure medium-term debt sustainability. They stressed the importance of containing current
expenditures, especially pensions and the wage bill, improving revenue collection, and
prioritizing investment projects financed by concessional lending. Directors welcomed the
planned increase in targeted social assistance, and called for advancing structural fiscal reforms
and reinvigorating the privatization agenda in order to strengthen fiscal institutions and reduce
fiscal risks.
Directors agreed that the current monetary policy stance is appropriate and has helped contain
the inflationary pressures arising from the massive liquidity injection to problem banks. They

considered that a gradual relaxation of the tight monetary policy stance would need to strike a
balance between inflationary risks and risks to the real sector. Directors noted that the floating
exchange rate has served Moldova well, and that official interventions in the foreign exchange
market should be limited to preventing excessive exchange rate volatility, while stressing the
need to rebuild foreign exchange reserves.
Directors underscored that steadfast implementation of structural reforms is essential to restore
output growth and enhance the economy’s resilience to potential shocks. Priority should be given
to strengthening the quality of institutions and governance, ensuring in particular the
independence of the judiciary system, a stable regulatory and operating environment, and a level
playing field for private sector companies. Directors stressed the importance of ensuring cost
recovery of the utility services and the independence of the energy sector regulator.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND THIRD POST-PROGRAM MONITORING DISCUSSIONS
December 1, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Context: Moldova has been in the midst of political, economic, and financial turmoil
since late 2014. On October 29, 2015, the government led by Mr. Streleţ (already the
third cabinet in 2015) was dismissed by a no confidence vote in Parliament. Political
instability has been amplified by the revelation of a large-scale fraud in the financial
sector. This resulted in a collapse of three large banks, with a cost to the budget of
around 12 percent of GDP and a significant loss in reserves. The homegrown problems
occurred at the time of difficult external environment, marked by a recession in Russia.
Financial sector: Deep reform is needed in the financial sector. The recent closure of
three insolvent banks is a welcome step forward. However, to preserve financial stability,
a comprehensive review of the health of the remaining institutions is needed, as well as
improvements in the regulatory, supervisory, and crisis management frameworks. Longstanding deficiencies in identifying ultimate beneficial ownership of banks need to be
urgently corrected, together with a re-certification of bank owners and managers as fitand-proper.
Fiscal policy: Lowering the budget deficit to its medium-term target is required to
ensure debt sustainability. This should be accompanied by structural fiscal reforms
aiming at strengthening fiscal institutions and reducing fiscal risks.
Monetary and exchange rate policy: Aggressive monetary tightening since late
2014 has helped contain pressures on the foreign exchange market and on inflation.
Once inflation expectations start to fall towards the targeted level, the stance can be
gradually eased. The authorities should continue to allow exchange rate flexibility in the
face of external shocks, strengthen the inflation targeting regime, and boost reserves.
Structural reforms: Delays in utility tariff adjustments created cascading losses and
debts across the entire energy sector, and lack of transparency in regulation endangers
investment in this key sector. Advancing structural reforms, particularly through
strengthening the quality of institutions and governance, is a priority for growth and
poverty reduction.

CONTEXT
1.
The political environment in Moldova has been very volatile. EU-leaning parties
obtained a narrow majority in the November 2014 Parliamentary elections, suggesting a structural
and economic agenda that would reinforce the Association Agreement with the EU signed in July
2014. However, the three pro-European parties could not form a stable coalition, which led to
multiple changes in government. Following the dissolution of a minority coalition in June, a majority
coalition government led by Prime Minister Streleţ faced growing anti-corruption protests. The
coalition received a blow after the October 15 arrest of Vlad Filat, the leader of the Liberal
Democratic Party to which Streleţ also belongs. Filat was arrested on charges of embezzlement of
$260 million, linked to the bank fraud of $1 billion that was uncovered in late 2014. The government
was dismissed with a no confidence vote in Parliament on October 29, 2015, after only three months
in office, and remains in caretaker capacity until a new coalition can be formed.
2.
A fragile banking system with non-transparent ownership is a clear threat to macrofinancial stability. Three banks—Banca de Economii (BEM), Banca Sociala, and Unibank—
representing a third of the system were closed in October 2015, after being under special
administration of the National Bank of Moldova (NBM) for almost one year. A first stage forensic
audit revealed a well-orchestrated fraud by seemingly unrelated shareholders and highlighted the
shortcomings in the regulatory and supervisory frameworks, many of which were clearly articulated
in the 2014 FSAP update. A generalized run on deposits has been avoided largely because of a full
payout on withdrawn deposits, but there are concerns about the health of some banks.
3.
The external environment is not supportive. Moldova’s close linkages with CIS countries,
particularly Russia, have weighed on growth and the external accounts, contributing to a
depreciation of the nominal exchange rate of the leu against the US dollar by about 27 percent since
the beginning of 2015. Restrictions on Moldovan agricultural and food exports to Russia have been
only partially lifted in 2015, and the capacity to diversify away to European markets requires
substantial investment in improving quality and sanitary standards. Concessional official financial
flows to the public sector are drying up as a result of policy inaction and governance concerns.
4.
Implementation of fiscal and financial sector policies has generally been weak. In line
with staff advice at the time of the last Article IV consultation, monetary policy was tightened once
inflationary pressures emerged. In contrast, staff advice for resisting pre-election pressures for
spending increases went unheeded—significant wage increases and the continuation of pension
top-ups adopted in the run-up to the parliamentary elections of November 2014 have undermined
previous fiscal adjustment efforts. Staff warning at the last Article IV consultation about the urgent
need to address weaknesses in bank governance also went unheeded, with the long delay in
addressing the deteriorating condition of the three insolvent banks1 significantly increasing the

resolution costs. The collapse of these banks has cost the state around 12 percent of GDP and a
large loss of foreign exchange reserves.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
5.
In light of the large domestic and external
shocks, reported economic growth in the first half of
2015 was surprisingly strong. Economic growth came
in at 3.6 percent, largely driven by net exports. Buoyant
exports reflected decumulation of agricultural stocks
from last year’s good harvest, but have also likely
benefited to some degree from real currency
depreciation; some reorientation of exports to the EU has
helped offset the effect of trade restrictions from Russia.
Private consumption has been weak, despite large wage
and pension increases, as remittances from Russia

dropped in the first half of the year.
6.
Inflation has risen above its target range, yet
remains notably contained given the massive
liquidity injection in problem banks. Aggressively high
policy rates and reserve requirements counteracted the
monetization of deposits in the three failed banks, and
while core inflation has pushed up, the main contributors
to the year on year increase in CPI index (12½ percent as
of September) have been food prices and an increase in
utility tariffs.

of external shocks and capital flight, but reserves
have been stable since March. International reserves have declined by US$ 900 million to
US$ 1.77 billion, with most of the loss concentrated between October 2014 and February 2015. Net
outflows in the financial account surged at end-2014, due to the election uncertainty and the
banking crisis. The outflow in currency and deposits continued in Q1 2015, but tapered off in the
second quarter. The y-o-y decline in remittances widened further to 19 percent in the first half of
2015, compared to 7 percent in 2014. However, offsetting this decline was a significant
improvement in the trade balance, reflecting mainly the impact of lower energy prices and lower
domestic demand.

ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS
8.
The economy is projected to contract by 1¾ percent in 2015, followed by a marginal
recovery of around 1½ percent in 2016. Moldova’s growth performance remains highly
dependent on external transfers and climatic conditions (the agricultural and agro-processing
sectors remain the backbone of the Moldovan economy). Both factors constrain the outlook for the
remainder of 2015—remittances continue to decline, and a drought has sharply affected agricultural
production, with lingering effects expected in 2016. Capital expenditure is weak. Financing
constraints bind across the economy—credit growth remains negative, external budget support is
falling, and yields on short-term government bills have risen from around 10 percent at end-2014 to
over 23 percent while rollover rates fell sharply through mid-October.
9.
The near term outlook is difficult. Inflation will remain above its target range throughout
2016, as supply side shocks from utility tariffs and drought-driven food price increases play out.
While this does not preclude a gradual normalization of monetary policy over time, inflation
expectations and currency depreciation expectations would have to start coming down first. Lower
gas import prices will help remove some of the pressure on the balance of payments, but the pace
of reserve accumulation is weak and reserve adequacy measures suggest the need to rebuild
external buffers (Annex II). Higher interest costs from debt issued for banking sector resolution will
limit fiscal space for social and developmental objectives.
10.
The baseline scenario assumes that current political instability can be overcome,
allowing comprehensive reforms to proceed. While the authorities broadly agreed with the need
for the reforms described in this staff report, the prospect for the implementation of such reforms
depends centrally on political events. The fall-out from the banking sector fraud does not yet appear
to have been fully felt. The resignation of the Governor and first deputy Governor in late September
2015 could leave a governance gap at the NBM, pending appointments by Parliament, at a time
when strong leadership on monetary and financial policies is critical to ensure macroeconomic
stability. More generally, underpinning the baseline scenario is an expectation that a comprehensive
set of reforms will be implemented, enabling the return of confidence in the economy, and a
resumption of external financing– the key risk, therefore, is the postponement of a decisive policy
action due to continued political instability. Such a scenario would result in significantly lower
economic growth, higher government debt, and a larger drawdown of international reserves
(Annex I).
11.
The baseline scenario is also subject to other significant downside risks. Further
spillovers from Russia and Ukraine, should tensions escalate, could come through remittances, trade,
and confidence channels (see Annex II). Weaknesses in the financial sector may extend beyond the
recently closed banks; if so, balance sheet repair will preclude a recovery of credit. Prolonged
inaction on utility tariffs, reflecting a volatile regulatory environment, may lead to significant
underinvestment in the sector.

Authorities’ views
12.
The authorities broadly agreed with the baseline outlook, although they saw potential
for stronger growth in 2016. The authorities were cognizant of the need to implement structural
reforms, which they saw as being in Moldova’s best interest, and committed to a dialogue with
international partners that would unlock assistance in delivering on those reforms. In their baseline
scenario, where external financing is not constrained, they envisaged a focus on public investment,
a renewed push for privatization, and a resumption of FDI, all of which, they argued, would support
growth in the order of about 3 percent in 2016.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Financial Sector
13.
The Moldovan banking system has undergone a period of major distress. As noted
above, three banks constituting around one third of the system’s assets collapsed in late 2014 as
a result of large-scale fraudulent transactions that went unaddressed despite warning signs (Box 1).
The generalized bail out—which included domestic interbank deposits, deposits of related parties,
and very large deposits where money laundering concerns arise—dramatically increased the cost of
the crisis. The decision to bailout deposits in the amount of MDL 14.2 billion (around 12 percent of
GDP) led to a massive injection of liquidity and a large loss of foreign exchange reserves which—in
conjunction with an acceleration of inflation following the exchange rate depreciation—prompted
aggressive monetary tightening.
14.
While the collapse of the three banks did not generate a system-wide crisis, there are
concerns about the health of some banks. In July, the NBM instructed the three largest
remaining banks to undergo special diagnostic studies. The objective of these studies, which are
conducted by external independent audit companies, is to review internal risk management policies
and practices in banks, to assess the quality of bank assets and the corresponding adequacy of
provisions, and to scrutinize the shareholders’ structure with a view to assess whether the ultimate
beneficial owners are properly identified and disclosed.2 In the meantime, the NBM has dispatched
special supervisory teams to these banks.
15.
The insurance sector too has been rattled by irregularities. A large insurance carrier has
not been honoring “green card”3 insurance obligations. Over the medium run, actuarial projections
suggest that some insurance companies are likely to have insufficient provisions for their life
insurance portfolios. A number of seemingly non-arm’s length transactions between insurance
companies and banks with presumed common ownership warrant close surveillance. The authorities

have launched criminal investigation into fraud in the "green card" guarantee fund– unauthorized
transactions resulted in about MDL 19 million (just under US$1 million) of losses for the National
Bureau of Motor Insurers (NBMI).
Box 1. Moldova: The Origins and Evolution of the Banking Crisis
Three large banks—Banca de Economii (BEM), Banca Sociala and Unibank—collapsed as a result of
their long-lasting abuse by the shareholder(s). The first stage forensic audit report (the “Kroll report”),
documents that starting in August 2012, these banks were subject to significant shareholder change, which
had the effect of transferring ownership to a series of seemingly unconnected individuals and entities. A
preliminary review of the transactions in each of the banks suggest a deliberate attempt to maximize
exposure to the related entities—which reached nearly MDL 18 billion (or about US$1 billion) before the
banks collapsed.
Dubious lending activities of these banks were largely known, but supervisory action was slow to
come. These banks had, for a significant period of time, exhibited very high credit and liquidity risk, weak
corporate governance, and poor risk management practices. A pattern of interbank lending among these
banks as well as with some foreign banks for which there was no apparent economic rationale, appears to
have been aimed at concealing violations of prudential rules, including on liquidity and related party
lending. While the supervisory authorities duly noted these and other suspicious activities, efforts to address
them were inadequate. In addition, the enforcement of some regulations was obstructed by numerous court
decisions.
Supervisory forbearance and government decisions increased the ultimate resolution costs to the
budget. For example:
 With already a substantial volume of public sector deposits in BEM, the authorities continued to
support the bank’s liquidity by coercing deposits of large state-owned enterprises into BEM well
into late 2014.
 In response to significant liquidity pressures at BEM in early November 2014, the National
Committee for Financial Stability (NCFS) approved a secret government decree that authorized
issuance of a state guarantee to the NBM to provide liquidity to banks in an amount up to
MDL 9.4 billion (this figure was further increased to MDL 14.5 billion in 2015) in order to
compensate for withdrawal of bank deposits, including interbank deposits. Following the adoption
of this decree, BEM resorted to significant domestic interbank borrowing.
 The decree under which liquidity was provided specifically disallowed facilitating the withdrawal of
related party deposits, deposits where there were money laundering concerns, and placements and
liabilities due to non-resident financial institutions. It called for the establishment of a special
commission to review deposits in excess of MDL 500,000 to ensure their eligibility. Nonetheless,
over the course of a few months, the overwhelming majority of such deposits were cleared for
payout, with no appetite to shift the burden of proof of eligibility to depositors.
 Special administration had been in place in these banks for over 10 months before their licenses
were withdrawn on October 16, 2015. The costs could have been lowered by starting the liquidation
process significantly earlier.

Staff’s views
16.
Restoring stability in the financial system will require a broad strategy with deep
reforms in the near and medium term. Policies would need to focus on ensuring the soundness of
the remaining banks and strengthening the regulatory, supervisory, and safety net frameworks. The
supervisory framework in the insurance sector deserves special attention. In addition, care should be
taken to adequately supervise and regulate the risks arising from the rapid growth in non-bank
financial institutions. Priorities include:


Close the three failed banks and initiate asset recovery procedures. On October 16, in line
with Fund recommendations, the NBM withdrew the licenses of the three insolvent banks—a
welcome step in the right direction. This has ringfenced the resolution cost for these three
institutions and halted the creation of liquidity associated with monetization of deposits. The
remaining assets should be liquidated and asset recovery procedures should be promptly
initiated.



Follow up on possible breaches of compliance with banking regulation. The NBM, in its
supervisory capacity, and based on the findings of the first stage forensic audit, should follow up
on possible breaches of compliance with banking regulations, including on transparency of
beneficial ownership, fit and proper requirements, and AML/CFT.



Scrutinize the health of the remaining banks. Staff welcomed the NBM’s initiative in
organizing a comprehensive review of the three largest remaining banks. Conducted by
reputable audit firms, such a review should identify any potential capital shortfall and provide
the basis for determining recapitalization and/or restructuring needs. If the review identifies
capital shortfalls, the current bank shareholders should be asked to provide fresh capital.



Improve the regulatory and supervisory frameworks. Progress in implementing the
recommendations of the 2014 FSAP has been limited—strengthening the legal protection of
central bank staff acting in good faith is a recent positive step. The legislation that gives the
Ministry of Justice power to modify the context of NBM and National Commission for Financial
Markets (NCFM) regulations should be revised to remove such powers. Particular attention
should be paid to adequate fit-and-proper certification of bank owners, directors, and managers
as well as ensuring the establishment and consequent proper treatment of economic
relationships between banks and borrowers. The recent creation of a separate unit in NBM for
identifying ultimate beneficial owners is encouraging.



Enhance the bank resolution and safety net frameworks. The NBM should be assigned the
role of resolution authority and given more resolution options, particularly powers for
establishing a bridge bank. Parliamentary oversight over the issuance of debt to support banks
needs to be restored. The deposit insurance scheme should be revamped in line with the FSAP
recommendations, particularly in getting greater assurance of back-up funding and enhanced
information-sharing between the Deposit Guarantee Fund and NBM.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA



Strengthen supervision and regulation of non-bank financial institutions, and particularly
the insurance sector. Legislation to restore the powers of the NCFM—struck down by a
Constitutional Court ruling in December 2012—should be enacted to enable coordinating
regulatory effort with the NBM. The NCFM should be equipped with stronger and more efficient
tools to regulate the insurance sector, but staff is of the view that supervisory powers for the rest
of the non-bank financial sector should likely rest with the NBM.

The authorities’ views
17.
The authorities broadly shared staff’s views on the steps needed to stabilize and
strengthen the financial sector. There was no disagreement on the wide-ranging financial sector
reform agenda. The authorities also expressed a strong interest in conducting an independent
evaluation of the supervisory activity in the period over which the banking crisis unfolded, aimed at
identifying weaknesses in the supervisory processes that allowed BEM group problems to remain
unaddressed for a long time. The authorities were receptive to the staff’s suggestion to conduct a
thorough review of the fit-and-proper requirements, with a view to identify and address possible
shortcomings and re-evaluate bank directors, managers, and significant owners. They requested
Fund TA to review the fit-and-proper certification, improve the resolution framework, and design an
action plan once the bank diagnostic studies are completed.

B. Fiscal Policy
18.
Budget execution through September was constrained by weaker-than-expected
revenues and tight financing. Substantially lower-than-expected revenues, particularly VAT and
excises have been partly masked by buoyant import-related taxes due to currency depreciation and
one-off non-tax revenues (profit transfer from NBM and proceeds from auctioning IT licenses).
Grants have notably fallen, by nearly 42 percent y-o-y, as external donors have stepped back.
Domestic financing has been constrained by very high interest rates and sharply increasing reserve
requirements. The resulting adjustment on the expenditure side has fallen mainly on capital
investment: only half of the budgeted capital expenditure has been executed during the first nine
months of 2015. Available data indicates that the shortfall is not being filled by recourse to domestic
arrears.

19.
A supplementary 2015 budget sent to Parliament in late October established a lower
cash deficit target. The revised budget takes account of the tightening of financing conditions and
lower revenues by revising down spending on goods and services and capital investment. The new
cash deficit target, at 3.4 percent of GDP, remains contingent on the disbursement of a
US$60 million tranche of a budget support loan from the Government of Romania, which awaits
ratification in the Romanian Parliament.

Staff’s views
20.
Looking ahead, staff reiterated the need to anchor the budget deficit path to a level
that is consistent with medium-term debt sustainability. The government guarantees associated
with the banking sector bailout are projected to bring public debt up from 37 percent of GDP in
2014 to about 52 percent at end-2015. As a result, debt sustainability becomes more vulnerable to
shocks, including potential capital needs for the rest of the banking system and from the
accumulated energy tariff debt, should it end up being securitized (Box 3).
21.
The fiscal framework needs to be strengthened to serve as a solid medium-term
anchor. In line with past advice and with the Law on Public Finance and Fiscal Responsibility (FRL),
staff advised narrowing the deficit to 1½ percent of GDP by 2020. This would be equivalent to a
deficit of about 2½ percent of GDP excluding grants—a level that can be financed without recourse
to exceptionally high official assistance, and consistent with placing public debt as a share of GDP
on a sustainable path. Strengthening the FRL (¶24) would help ensure that it provides an adequate
fiscal anchor.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

22.
A front-loaded fiscal consolidation path is needed in order to put public debt on a
downward trend. Staff advised an overall deficit target of 3.2 percent of GDP in 2016, compared to
a projected 3.4 percent of GDP in 2015. This would require a primary balance reduction of about
0.9 percentage point of GDP given the expected increase in interest costs (Box 2 and Table 3).
Containing expenditures on the public sector wage bill will be essential if this is to be achieved. On
the revenue side, some near term gains could be achieved from alignment of excises closer to the
EU standards, and increasing and standardizing the CIT rate. With the expected increase in targeted
social assistance, efforts should be made to prioritize capital expenditure.
23.
A commitment to fiscal consolidation should be embedded in the Medium-Term
Budget Framework (MTBF) for 2016–18.


On the revenue side, efforts to broaden the tax base and enhance revenue mobilization will be
critical. As recommended by IMF technical assistance, potential measures include rationalizing
CIT and PIT exemptions, updating the real estate valuations for tax purposes, improving tax
compliance (for instance through enhancing the performance of the large tax payer office,
efforts to reduce underreporting on income, and addressing the fragmentation of the local and
state tax administration), and strengthening the efficiency of revenue administration.



Concerning expenditure policies, rationalization and efficiency gains should be pursued,
particularly with respect to the wage bill (including through the size of public employment) and
other current spending. Adjustment should be carefully calibrated to safeguard priority social
spending as well as to prioritize public investment projects with highest potential economic and
social returns.

24.
Staff also called for advancement of structural fiscal reforms in order to strengthen
fiscal institutions and reduce fiscal risks. Specifically:


Fiscal policy stance. The authorities should improve the simple fiscal anchor that was
introduced in the Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL) by explicitly linking it with debt sustainability. In
particular, the FRL should make clearer the circumstances under which the fiscal policy stance
could be relaxed to safeguard social safety nets and address infrastructure needs.



Local government budgets. Amendments to the Law on Local Public Finance (LPF), which aim
to enhance local government efficiency, were fully implemented in January 2015. Reforms to
further ensure fiscal responsibility at the local government level are crucial to safeguard the
overall fiscal discipline and macroeconomic stability. These include the introduction of binding
debt limits on local governments and a mechanism to monitor and enforce these limits. Staff
also encouraged the authorities to strengthen the public investment management process at the
local level.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA



Social security system. Given trends in outward migration and demographics, as well as the
very low replacement rate, a balance has to be struck between the fiscal and social sustainability
of the pension system. Reforms in this area should include increasing the retirement age,
improving coverage and compliance, and introducing a more systematic indexation of pension
benefits without periodic ad-hoc increases.



Performance of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs). Staff supported the authorities’ privatization
efforts and emphasized that successful privatization depends significantly on having a clear
action plan. In addition, to prevent the emergence of fiscal risks from SOEs, the authorities
should develop a regular monitoring mechanism to assess their financial performance.

25.
Strengthening debt and cash management is imperative. Financial instruments are
limited and concentrated in the short end of the maturity spectrum. The government securities
market is illiquid, with very low trading activity on the secondary market. Communication between
the Ministry of Finance and NBM on high frequency liquidity forecasting is weak. Staff
recommended measures aimed at establishing an effective government securities market
infrastructure and at developing a more sophisticated cash management function. This would have
important knock-on effects on the implementation of monetary policy.
Box 2. Moldova: Government Debt Issued for Banking Sector Resolution
Several considerations need to be taken into account in designing the government bonds used for
conversion of NBM’s emergency lending to the closed banks. The crucial element is the interest rate. The
main concern is that a below market interest rate may severely undercapitalize the NBM, whereas an interest
rate closer to the prevailing market level would require a significant compression of primary expenditures. A
compromise solution is required to balance these concerns. The objective is to minimize the cost to the
budget, but to ensure that bonds provide sufficient interest income to enable the NBM to properly fulfill its
mandate of maintaining price stability and financial stability.
Staff’s baseline projection for the interest costs on government debt related to banking sector of around
½ percent of GDP in 2016 assumes the issuance of MDL 14 billion of securities with an effective annual
interest rate of 5 percent. In consultation with the NBM, and taking into consideration the evolution of the
NBM balance sheet, staff estimates that this interest rate would be sufficient to adequately compensate the
NBM for the cost of withdrawing excess liquidity (taking also into account the revenue from other earning
assets and noninterest income), while containing to some extent the fiscal implications of higher debt
service. Given the difficulty in ascertaining the exact impact of staff’s proposal on central bank capital, staff
recommended that the authorities revisit the legal framework governing the distribution of NBM profits, if,
as a result, capital levels need to be rebuilt.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

The authorities’ views
26.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff on the need to strengthen the revenue base.
The authorities highlighted their efforts to boost revenues, and emphasized some of the fiscal
measures planned for 2016, including CIT and PIT reforms, and property tax reforms. They
considered informality and under-reporting of wages to be a key challenge to raising the revenue
take, and were considering tax policy changes that could reduce incentives to under-report.
27.
However, the authorities considered staff’s recommended fiscal path to be too tight,
emphasizing large social and infrastructure needs and deemphasizing debt sustainability
risks. The authorities argued strongly that that the medium-term deficit target should allow for
additional expenditure as long as additional project financing is available. They considered such
spending to be essential to poverty reduction, filling infrastructure gaps, and institution
strengthening, and noted that public sector indebtedness levels are not yet a binding concern.

C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
28.
The monetary stance has aimed to counter external spillovers and monetization of
deposit liabilities in the failed banks. The sharp depreciation of the Russian ruble contributed to a
nominal depreciation of the leu against the US dollar by almost 25 percent between
September 2014 and March 2015, despite the sale by NBM of around a third of its reserves. Capital
flight, given uncertainty related to the outcome of parliamentary elections and fraudulent
transactions in problem banks, added to pressures on the currency and reserves. Although the leu
has remained broadly stable since March 2015, the NBM continued to tighten aggressively in order
to absorb the liquidity released into the system from the monetization of deposits in the three failed
banks. Thus, on the heels of earlier tightening, the NBM increased its policy rate in several steps to
19.5 percent, and the reserve requirement ratio on leu-denominated liabilities from 14 percent to
35 percent.
29.
The growth in reserve money has been contained. The massive step up in liquidity
provision by the NBM to the insolvent banks—from zero in September 2014 to over MDL 12 billion
in recent months—has not resulted in a significant increase in reserve money: much of the initial
money creation was effectively sterilized through the NBM supplying foreign exchange to the banks.

Competitiveness is broadly adequate, but building up external buffers would require
restoring confidence as well as substantial upgrades in export quality. Model-based evidence
does not point to significant exchange rate misalignment in 2015—the REER depreciation observed
since late 2014 narrowed the estimated degree of overvaluation relative to last Article IV (Annex III).
The provisions of the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA), under implementation
since September 2014, should provide a boost to exports and GDP. However, reaping these gains
will require substantial improvement in quality and standards for Moldovan exports.

Staff’s views
31.
Monetary policy currently faces a delicate balance. Recent strong policy tightening was
appropriate to contain inflationary pressures and preserve macroeconomic stability. In the very short
term, significant inflationary risks remain given the planned substantial adjustment in utility tariff.
Tight monetary policy stance is therefore appropriate in the current context. Going forward, there
will be a need to carefully balance inflationary risks against real sector risks, in order to avoid
triggering a strong negative macro-financial loop. So far, the effect of sharply tighter policy settings
has not led to a systemic deterioration of the banks’ loan portfolio, although ever-greening may
mask problems in asset quality.
32.
The NBM should continue allowing the exchange rate to adjust with market
conditions. The NBM should limit interventions in support of the leu to smoothing disorderly
exchange rate volatility. The inflow of remittances and export earnings is now forecast to be more
subdued, driven by developments in Russia. Lower remittances and exports imply a depreciation of
the equilibrium real exchange rate to which the economy will need to adjust, including through
exchange rate depreciation.
33.
There is room to improve the existing inflation targeting framework. The monetary
transmission mechanism has undoubtedly been impeded in the context of a distressed banking
system, and restoring financial stability should improve transmission. However, there is a need for
improving the understanding and modeling of the transmission of policy rates to lending and
deposit rates, and implementing organizational changes to enhance the monetary policy decision
making process. Particular emphasis should be placed on improving coordination with the Treasury
with respect to short-term liquidity and cash management—this could have helped mitigate the
liquidity crunch in T-bill auctions in the second half of the year.

The authorities’ views
34.
Views on the appropriateness of the monetary policy stance were polarized. The NBM
emphasized that monetary tightening—particularly the maintenance of the strongly positive policy
interest rate despite the increase in inflation—has been necessary to contain inflationary
expectations and to prevent deposit outflows. The NBM also agreed with staff’s recommendation on
limiting interventions in the foreign exchange market, noting that recent interventions have been
infrequent and targeted to maintaining liquidity in the market, for example in the face of bulky
fx purchases. However, all other interlocutors disagreed with the view that monetary policy settings

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

are broadly appropriate – they considered liquidity and credit conditions too tight and argued that
monetary policy settings have been very damaging to growth.

D. Structural Reforms

36.
Another important area for structural reforms relates to utility companies. Setting
utility tariffs at cost-recovery levels is necessary for preventing quasi-fiscal costs and ensuring the
financial viability of energy companies, which would contain the risk of service disruptions and help
attract investments in the energy infrastructure. The energy regulator (ANRE) has not adjusted the
tariffs for over three years, which resulted in an accumulated financial deviation and rising
intercompany payment arrears (Box 3).

Box 3. Moldova. Utility Tariffs, Tariff Debt, and Mitigating Strategies
Utility tariffs in Moldova are currently below cost-recovery levels. With imported inputs representing the
bulk of costs for energy producers, pressure on costs rose substantially in 2014 with the sharp currency
depreciation. Despite requests by energy operators, tariffs, however, have remained unchanged until July 18,
2015, when the regulator (ANRE) announced an increase in electricity (37 percent) and gas (15.4 percent)
tariffs. On November 6, 2015 ANRE reinstated tariff adjustment after a two-month suspension, during which
companies were required to undergo an audit to validate the adopted tariff increases.

The July tariff increases do not cover financial deviations accumulated since 2012. The accumulated
losses of utility companies are estimated to be around MDL 2 billion. Addressing the stock of financial
deviations would require an even larger upfront tariff adjustment. In principle, a reasonable solution
could involve amortizing the accumulated tariff debt through a gradual tariff adjustment, starting with
the recognition of the size of the obligation and announcing a schedule for future tariff increases. In
practice, however, the weak rule of law and concerns about political capture of the regulator constrains
the viability of this approach. Consequently, companies are advocating securitization that would
ultimately add to either contingent, or, more likely, direct state liabilities.

Tariff adjustments towards the cost-recovery levels will increase the need for social assistance. The
relevant social assistance programs (Ajutor Social and Heating Allowance) are generally well targeted.
According to the World Bank’s estimates, the spending on these programs would have to increase to
around 0.5 percent of GDP in 2015 and to at least 0.7 percent of GDP in 2016 to properly compensate for
the tariff adjustment.

accumulated over the past years, as well as estimated companies’ asset revaluation.

Staff views
37.
Weak governance and ineffective bureaucracy significantly affect economic outcomes
in Moldova, including resource allocation and growth. To contain public resource
mismanagement, Moldova needs to strengthen the rule of law and ensure credibility and
accountability of its institutions. A streamlined and more competent bureaucracy would be critical in
transforming the relationship between the public and private sector, which is severely tarnished.
Donor interest in supporting these reforms is strong. However, stronger domestic ownership of such
reforms is needed in order to make real progress.
38.
Poverty has decreased sharply since 2010, but further gains will be limited without
structural reforms. The headcount poverty rate (11.4 percent in 2014) has recently met the target
set in the national development strategy, aided by strong growth in agriculture. Social payments
through the well-targeted Ajutor Social and heating allowance program also played a positive role
in achieving this outcome. However, the shocks that hit the Moldovan economy in late 2014 and
2015 and their impact on disposable income, growth, and fiscal space will likely erode some of the
gains in poverty reduction. A carefully calibrated fiscal strategy, containment of fiscal risks,
macroeconomic stabilization and decisive structural reform will be needed to bolster sustainable
growth and make further progress in reducing poverty.
39.
The setting of utility tariffs should be based on a transparent assessment of costs, and
the scope for political pressure on the regulator should be removed. ANRE’s decision to
reinstate tariff adjustments adopted in July 2015 is a welcome first step. The future tariff adjustments

should be made timely and cover amortization and other production and distribution costs.4 For the
recovery of the accumulated financial deviation, a gradual adjustment over several years would be
appropriate to limit the impact of tariff increases on the population. Communication about the
schedule and rationale of planned tariff adjustments and the available social assistance should also
be improved. Finally, the regulatory independence of ANRE should be strengthened, including by
simplifying and depoliticizing its budget approval process by the parliament.
40.
Over the medium term, structural reforms are essential to reorient the growth model
from consumption towards productivity-enhancing investment and exports. Reforms focused
on adapting education and skills to the labor market needs, enhancing labor productivity, and
increasing employment would help reduce reliance on remittances and promote human resource
development.

Authorities’ views
41.
The authorities shared staff’s views on the importance of structural reforms. The
authorities expressed their commitment to implementing the reforms described in the NDS
Moldova 2020, and agreed that strengthening the rule of law would require special attention.
Regarding the utility tariffs, the authorities emphasized the need to conduct independent audits of
the utility companies in order to assess the deviation of the existing tariffs from the cost-recovery
levels before reinstating the tariff adjustment.

POST-PROGRAM MONITORING
42.
Moldova is expected to meet its repayment obligations to the Fund. The Fund’s
exposure is projected to gradually decline from 7.5 percent of GDP (272.4 percent of quota) in 2015
to 0.8 percent of GDP (36.3 percent of quota) by 2020. Total debt service to the Fund would peak at
3.0 percent of export in 2017 (or 1.4 percent of GDP). The updated Debt Sustainability Analysis
suggests that the risk of debt distress is low, although this conclusion is highly dependent on
Moldova’s CPIA5 rating which is currently at the lower-end of the strong policy performance
category. Standard indicators paint a mixed picture on the adequacy of reserves. The large stock of
private external debt – about half of it short-term--poses additional risk, mitigated by the fact that it
represents fairly stable trade credit and intercompany borrowing related to direct investment. Given
Moldova’s vulnerability to exogenous shocks, the difficult near term outlook, and significant

Regarding the electricity tariffs, to prevent delays in necessary tariff adjustments, the law on the electricity sector
should retain a clause that introduces an automatic adjustment in case ANRE fails to act within the timeframe
specified by the law.

CPIA is the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment index. The score (ranging from 1-lowest to 6 highest) reflects the quality of a country’s policies and institutions (for example, the framework for poverty reduction,
sustainable growth, and the effective use of development assistance). Any moderate deterioration in macroeconomic
management and institutions could affect the risk rating.

downside risks, implementing good macroeconomic and financial policies will be critical to ensure
continued capacity to pay.

STAFF APPRAISAL
43.
Political uncertainty, large-scale bank fraud, a recession in Russia, and adverse weather
conditions have taken a heavy toll on Moldova. Even assuming that political volatility recedes
and reforms proceed, as assumed in the baseline, the near term outlook is challenging. Output is
expected to decline by about 1¾ percent in 2015, followed by a marginal recovery in 2016. Inflation
will remain above its target range throughout 2016, and with still elevated expectations on inflation
and currency depreciation, normalization of tight policy settings would likely only come gradually.
Lower gas import prices will help remove some of the pressure on the balance of payments, but the
baseline pace of reserve accumulation is weak and reserve adequacy measures are mixed. Higher
interest costs from debt issued for banking sector resolution will limit fiscal space for social and
developmental objectives.
44.
Nonetheless, macrofinancial stability has been broadly maintained in the face of large
shocks, and the authorities are drawing lessons from the bank failures. The effects of the largescale monetization of deposits associated with the bank bail-outs were contained, thanks to an
aggressively tight monetary policy which sought to prevent further capital flight and a loss of faith in
the currency. The closure of the three insolvent banks in the system was welcome, albeit long
overdue. The NBM has appropriately launched comprehensive reviews of the largest remaining
banks that are critical to ascertaining the health of the rest of the banking system. Staff also
welcomes the authorities’ initiative to conduct an independent expert review of the supervisory
process that led to the bank failures and their openness to Fund TA on reviewing the fit-and-proper
certification process.
45.
Absent continuation of policies to address key vulnerabilities, the situation would
likely deteriorate further. A deepening of the banking crisis or pressure to loosen monetary
settings prematurely would weaken the exchange rate and international reserves and generate
inflationary pressures. The lack of credible policies would not be supportive of a resumption of
external financing, and would compound balance of payments pressures as well as constrain the
capacity of the budget to execute priority expenditure. Growth prospects would be impaired.
46.
The baseline reform scenario is subject to significant additional downside risks. A
further slowdown in Russia could weaken the baseline. The increase in government debt by
12 percent of GDP from the bank bailout reduces Moldova’s capacity to accumulate additional debt
needed for long-term capital expenditures; in this context, prudency is required with respect to
policies that could generate quasi-fiscal debt. If the ongoing comprehensive bank reviews identify
capital shortfalls that cannot be met by private capital injection, there may be further claims on
public resources as the system is restructured.

20

47.
Strengthening the regulatory, supervisory, and safety net frameworks is critical for
preserving financial stability. The recommendations of the 2014 FSAP update should guide the
reform agenda. Of particular importance is (i) building an action plan following the finalization of
the comprehensive reviews of the asset quality, risk management, and ownership structure of the
three largest banks, and (ii) conducting a thorough and independent review of the regulations and
procedures on fit-and-proper tests of ultimate beneficial owners, directors, and managers of banks,
followed by a re-certification in accordance with the revised framework. It is imperative to enhance
the independence, powers, and crisis management toolkits of both the NBM and the NCFM so as to
ensure effective supervision of the entire financial sector; prompt supervisory action is likely needed
in the insurance sector. Following through on findings of the forensic audit reports of transactions in
the three failed banks will also be important—from an asset recovery perspective, as well as to
introduce accountability.
48.
With substantial public costs of the banking crisis resolution, fiscal consolidation to
ensure medium-term sustainability becomes imperative. Against this background, measures to
achieve frontloaded consolidation in 2016 and a deficit of 3.2 percent of GDP are needed to
safeguard a credible path towards deficit target of around 1½ percent of GDP by 2020. The Fiscal
Responsibility Law and the Law on Local Public Finance need to be strengthened to help achieve
medium-term fiscal objectives. A reinvigorated privatization agenda can secure financing for
additional productivity enhancing capital projects, at a pace consistent with the economy’s
absorption capacity.
49.
Monetary policy is appropriately focused on controlling the inflationary impact of
massive liquidity injection to problem banks and maintaining confidence in the currency.
Short-term inflationary pressures remain high due to the prospective utility tariff adjustment, and
still high expectations of currency depreciation. Decisions on gradually normalizing the stance
should carefully strike a balance between inflationary risks and risks to the real sector. The floating
exchange rate regime has served Moldova well, and has helped to mitigate the impact of external
pressures and domestic shocks. Going forward, the NBM should limit its interventions in the foreign
exchange market and intervene only to prevent disorderly exchange rate volatility.
50.
Reinvigorating the structural reform agenda is critical to restore output growth, and
enhance the economy’s resilience to shocks. The adjustment of tariffs to bring utility companies
to a cost recovery level was a welcome step to stop the cascading buildup of energy sector debts.
The stock of past financial deviations should be dealt with in a transparent way, avoiding buildup of
public sector contingent liabilities. Other structural measures aimed at creating a level playing field
for private sector companies are critical to enhance competitiveness, attract investment, and
diversify the export structure—these will also help rebuild foreign reserve buffers. Protecting human
capital, which is essential for long-term sustainable growth, calls for acceleration of reforms in
health, social and education systems.
51.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Moldova be held on the standard 12month cycle.

Annex I. “No Reform” Scenario
A “no reform” scenario leaves Moldova with low growth and weaker external buffers.
Economic growth would be around 1½ percentage points lower than in the baseline, reflecting
significantly lower investment, particularly private investment, and stagnating productivity. A
more depreciated exchange rate, related to higher uncertainties and a loss of confidence in the
leu, would contribute to a higher inflation. A financing mix that includes less concessional donor
financing and a greater reliance on domestic issuance would further squeeze room for primary
expenditure, but debt would remain elevated. While the current account deficit would improve
with weaker domestic absorption, the drop in donor financing and foreign direct investments
would negatively affect international reserves.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize
in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline
(“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a
probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of
discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Annex III. External Stability Assessment
1.
Moldova’s share in global trade increased steadily with more diversified export
markets. Between 2005 and 2014, Moldova’s share in global trade increased by near 30 percent
to 0.013 percent of world trade, as its participation in European markets strengthened. However,
its position in Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) has declined to around 0.1 percent
from 0.2 percent of CIS trade. This pattern also holds for agricultural exports.

The real exchange rate has remained broadly stable, but depreciated over the more
recent period. In 2014, weak external demand from CIS countries (especially Russia)—together
with capital outflow triggered by worries on banking system instability and policy uncertainty—
have weighed on growth and the external accounts. The NEER and REER have depreciated by
about 8.7 percent and 7.5 percent since October 2014.

Model-based evidence does not point to significant exchange rate misalignment in
2015. After the depreciation observed in late 2014 to August 2015, results from applying the
EBA-lite methodology suggests that the leu is slightly overvalued (2 percent), as the underlying
current account balance (-6.9 percent of GDP) exceeds the norm by a margin of 1.4 percent of
GDP. The degree of overvaluation has narrowed relative to last Article IV staff report of
June 2014.

5.
The reserve position is fragile as reserves declined substantially from a position of
strength. Moldova’s negative Investment International Position (IIP) widened in 2014 to
70.6 percent of GDP. Decrease in long-term assets, especially decline in gross reserves is the
major contributor. Gross international reserves declined to USD 2.1 billion at end-2014, falling
20 percent from end-2013 levels, with most of the USD 538 million lost in the last two months of
the year. Standard reserve adequacy indicators paint a mixed picture at end-2014—import
coverage remains well above the standard 3 month benchmark, as does coverage under the
composite measure for flexible exchange rate regimes. However, coverage of short-term debt on
remaining maturity has deteriorated substantially, from over 105 percent in 2013 to around
77 percent. Coverage has fallen further in 2015—another USD387 million were lost by the end of
September 2015. In terms of liabilities, short-term liabilities accounted for 26.8 percent of total
and almost 39 percent of total liabilities consisted of FDI, equivalent to over 45 percent of GDP at
end-2014.
6.
Looking forward, structural reform aimed at upgrading quality and standards
should have important payoffs to exports and growth. In June 2014, Moldova signed an
Association Agreement with the EU which includes provisions establishing a Deep and
Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA). The DCFTA envisions an immediate elimination of both
sides' export duties and has been under provisional implementation since September 2014.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

Significant positive impacts are expected on GDP over the long-run. However, such gains require
substantial improvement in quality and standards for Moldovan exports, which will take place
only gradually.
Staff assessment
7.
Overall external stability is vulnerable to adverse external economic developments
and rigorous policies are needed to mitigate the impact of external shocks. The
deterioration in macrofinancial stability and negative spillovers from trading partners has
weakened external buffers. The main external risks arise from a protracted economic slowdown
in key trading partners (mainly Russia), further intensification of geopolitical tensions, limited
scope for near-term diversification to new export markets as Russia’s restrictions on imports from
Moldova persist, and further declines in remittances, given the magnitude of these flows.
Strengthening competitiveness would require policies aimed at building policy buffers (e.g. fiscal,
structural financial, social) and strengthen Moldova’s ability to withstand adverse external shocks.
Policies aimed at export diversification, shift towards higher end of supply chain and
improvement of investment climate should help to create a conducive environment for fostering
growth and competitiveness.

Safeguards Assessments:
An update safeguards assessment of the National Bank of Moldova (NBM) conducted in the context
of the ECF/EFF arrangements approved by the Board on January 29, 2010 was completed on June 3,
2010. The assessment found that the NBM had strengthened its safeguards framework since the
May 2006 assessment by implementing the majority of recommendations. However, the update
assessment noted the need for independent oversight of the bank and recommended changes to
the central bank’s law to strengthen the governance framework. While the NBM Law has been

2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

amended to address these recommendations, it has yet to establish the newly created Supervisory
Council and independent Audit Committee in practice.
Exchange Arrangements:
Moldova has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4, of the Fund’s Articles of
Agreement. Its exchange system remains free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current
international transactions.
Moldova’s exchange rate regime is classified as “floating”. The NBM intervenes in the domestic
foreign exchange interbank market in order to smooth out sharp exchange rate fluctuations of the
Moldovan leu against the dollar. At the same time, the NBM interventions are not aimed at
changing the trend of the exchange rate determined by the market. The NBM publishes the
information on its interventions.
The official exchange rate of the Moldovan leu to the U.S. dollar announced by the NBM is
determined as the weighted average of daily noncash market transactions performed on the
interbank market. The NBM quotes exchange rates of the leu for other currencies on the basis of the
leu-U.S. dollar rate and the cross-rate between the U.S. dollar and these currencies.
Article IV Consultations:
The previous Article IV consultation was concluded on June 23, 2014. The staff report (Country
Report No. 14/190) was published.
FSAP Participation:
Moldova received an FSAP mission in May 2004; the FSSA (Country Report No. 05/64) was presented
to the Board at the time of the 2004 Article IV discussions. An FSAP update mission visited Moldova
in October 2007; the FSSA update (Country Report No. 08/274) was presented to the Board with
the 2007 Article IV Consultation report. A second FSAP update mission visited Moldova in
March 2014; the FSSA update was presented to the Board with the 2014 Article IV Consultation
report. In October 2015, the authorities consented to the publication of the FSSA.
Resident Representative:
Ms. Armine Khachatryan assumed her duties as Resident Representative in August 2013.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of October 23, 2015)
1.
Moldova's National Development Strategy (NDS)—Moldova 2020 sets eight strategic
priorities. These are justice and fight against corruption; national education system aligned with
labor market requirements; pensions; business environment; roads infrastructure; accessible and
inexpensive finance; energy efficiency; and agriculture and rural development. The NDS is intended
to prioritize state interventions to deliver the overarching goal of bringing about qualitative
economic development and poverty reduction. It was adopted by the Parliament as national law.
The NDS and its consolidated action plan include some measures to reduce inequality and address
key crosscutting themes, such as social inclusion and gender equality, environmental preservation,
climate change and disaster events, and reintegration of localities from the left bank of the Nistru
River (Transnistria).
2.
Aligned with the NDS, the World Bank Group (WBG) Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for
FY14–17, discussed by the Board on September 5, 2013, will provide Moldova with US$570 million
over this period (US$450 million on IBRD&IDA [International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development & International Development Association, together known as the World Bank or WB]
terms, plus US$120 million IFC [International Finance Corporation] commitments). It will support
Moldova in reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity by capturing the full benefits of
openness and integration with the European Union and the broader global economy. Three pillars
are proposed, which will help Moldova diversify and expand its endowment of institutional, human,
and natural capital:


Increasing Competitiveness: continued institutional reforms for a business enabling environment
and governance, access to finance, transparency in the financial sector, and targeted activities to
help improve companies' competitiveness are needed to reduce barriers and to translate
economic openness into concrete benefits of more jobs and higher income.



Enhancing Human Capital and Minimizing Social Risks: the widening gap with EU28 in education
and health outcomes needs to be progressively closed. Demographic challenges need to be
addressed, and vulnerabilities can be tackled by strengthening social protection systems.



Promoting a Green, Clean and Resilient Moldova: the debilitating effects of climatic events on
agriculture and rural livelihoods need to be addressed, natural resource management improved,
and energy security and efficiency achieved to ensure sustainable development.

3.
The CPS has governance and gender lenses, and a calibrated engagement in localities from
Transnistria will be considered in close consultation with the authorities of the Republic of Moldova.
4.
This CPS continues to address governance issues at the country, sectorial and operational
levels across the strategy. Interventions will be pursued to improve the business enabling
environment; enhance public administration reform and quality of public service delivery; and

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

improve public financial management and procurement systems. The CPS will use a governance
filter to ensure that governance is systematically tackled in all operations (analytical and advisory
activities and lending); it will also support enhanced involvement of Civil Society Organizations
through the Global Partnership for Social Accountability to which Moldova has opted in. At the
operational level, WBG will ensure the highest fiduciary standards in projects it supports while
helping the Government to strengthen country systems. This CPS is informed by a gender
assessment, the outcomes of which are discussed at the concept stage of each relevant new
operation (Advisory Services and Analytics and lending).
5.
A mid-term CPS review is currently conducted. This CPS Performance and Learning Review
will aim to confirm, together with country authorities, the proposed strategic pillars and will make
any required adjustments to the lending and analytical program and the results framework through
the end of FY17.
6.
The WB’s current portfolio includes eight projects and one budget support operation. Total
commitments amount to US$255.3 million. The disbursement ratio for FY15 stands at 26.8 percent.
Trust Funds (TFs) provide co-financing to IDA operations, finance carbon operations, and provide
other forms of support, including for Advisory Services and Analytics. The size of the active TF
portfolio is US$26.3 million.
7.
Alongside IDA and IBRD resources, IFC operations in Moldova will continue to focus on
investment and advisory activities that enable private sector growth and diversification. IFC’s
committed portfolio in Moldova stands at US$63.6 million (US$60.6 million outstanding). Portfolio
composition is 96 percent loans and 4 percent equity and quasi-equity. There are currently no nonperforming loans (NPLs) of a total of 14 projects. IFC is targeting yearly commitments of
US$12.5 million, not including mobilization. This level of investment will be maintained over the next
several years, seeking to leverage IFC investments with additional mobilization.
8.
The net exposure of MIGA in Moldova amounts to US$20.3 million in four projects. All
projects support foreign banks' subsidiaries in the country, including micro-finance organizations
and leasing operations. MIGA’s continuing support to these projects signals MIGA’s efforts to
underwrite projects in Moldova, encourage inward foreign direct investment, and add to the WBG’s
strategy of encouraging private sector development in the country.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of November 18, 2015)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General:
Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. Over the last several years, with technical assistance
from the Fund the authorities have improved statistics in several areas, including national accounts, fiscal
and monetary data, consumer prices, external trade and balance of payments. Technical assistance is
ongoing in the area of price and national accounts statistics.
National Accounts:
National accounts statistics are prepared by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) based on the concepts and
methods of the System of National Accounts 1993 (1993 SNA). Estimates do not include the Transnistria region
for which data have not been collected since 1991. GDP is estimated from the production and the
expenditure sides, annually and quarterly. GDP volume measures are chain-linked and presented with 2010 as
the reference year. The annual data are revised—in two stages—as updated information becomes available.
Starting from January 2014, short-term activity indicators are re-classified according to CAEM Rev. 2. Work is
on-going to implement the 2008 SNA and to further improve the compilation of quarterly and annual
national accounts.
Price statistics:
The NBS publishes monthly CPI and PPI data and began publications of the core CPI
from 2010. The weights of the CPI basket are updated on an annual basis to reflect adjustment in consumer
expenditures. On-going technical assistance has improved the reliability of the CPI weights and continues to
work with the NBS to expand CPI coverage to include owner-occupied housing.
Government finance statistics:
Moldova reports annual government finance statistics (GFS) based on Government Finance Statistics Manual
2001 (GFSM 2001) methodology for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY). The
data are on a cash basis and cover above as well as below the line operations and financial balance sheet of
the general government sector. With the support of Fund TA, the authorities introduced regular
dissemination of monthly GFSM 2001 based data for the budgetary central government units.
Monetary statistics:
Monetary and financial statistics are broadly in line with recommendations of the Monetary and Financial
Statistics Manual and of a generally good quality. The NBM compiles and submits monetary data using
Standardized Report Forms (SRFs). Monetary data are reported by the NBM on a regular basis and are being
published in the International Financial Statistics. The NBM also report Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs)
on a quarterly basis, which are posted on the FSI webpage.

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

External sector statistics:
The balance of payments statistics have been compiled fully in line to the sixth edition of Balance of Payments
and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6) starting with data for 2011. Meanwhile international
investment position statistics (IIP) as well as balance of payments time series prior to 2011 are on BPM5 basis..
Besides the balance of payments and IIP statistics, Moldova disseminates other external sector statistics (EES)
datasets such as external debt statistics, international reserves statistics, and coordinated direct investment
survey. All ESS datasets are compiled and disseminated with prescribed SDDS periodicity and timeliness.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Moldova subscribed to the SDDS in May 2006.
A data ROSC report was published in March
2006.

DISCUSSIONS—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By
Mary B. Goodman and
James Gordon (IMF), and
Ivailo Izvorski (IDA)

Prepared by Staff of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association

Based on an assessment of public external debt, Moldova’s risk of debt distress remains
low.1 2 3 Overall public debt dynamics are sustainable but with a significantly higher debt
level in the near term. Private external debt is unusually high for a low-income country. In
view of the country’s vulnerability to exogenous developments and the banking crisis, fiscal
discipline is critical to ensure debt sustainability.

1

This full DSA is prepared jointly by IMF and World Bank staff, in consultation with the Moldovan authorities,
using the debt sustainability framework for low-income countries approved by the Boards of both institutions,
and in accordance with the new staff guidance note on the application of the joint Bank-Fund Debt
Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries (SM/13/292).
2

The inclusion of the overall risk is in line with the staff guidance note on the application of the joint BankFund Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries (SM/13/292). This assessment reflects the high
level of external private sector debt.
3

Moldova’s rating on the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) averaged 3.82 over
the last three years (2012-2014), which places the country at the lower-end of the strong policy performance
category.

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

BACKGROUND
1.
Moldova’s total external debt is estimated to be about 107 percent of GDP at end-2015,
compared to 85½ percent of GDP at end-2014. Private external debt (as a share of GDP), which
accounts for about 70 percent of total external debt, is projected to increase by 12½ percentage points,
while public and public-guaranteed (PPG) external debt to GDP is projected to increase by 9 percentage
points. PPG external debt is held mainly by multilateral and bilateral donors, and is mostly medium- and
long-term.
2.
Total PPG debt-to-GDP is estimated to increase by 14½ percentage points to 52 percent by
end-2015.4 While more than half of PPG debt is external, the share of PPG domestic debt has increased
rapidly in the past two years due to the issuance of a state guarantee to the NBM to provide liquidity to the
banking sector. As the guarantees become callable, the PPG domestic debt structure is expected to change
significantly due to long-term government securities to be issued to the NBM, which will make up about
67 percent of PPG domestic debt. The rest of PPG domestic debt is mainly short-term and held by the
banking system.
3.
Private sector debt is high compared with other low-income countries.5 The stock of external
private sector debt has decreased in 2014 after a decade of accumulation, reaching USD 4.8 billion at end–
2014, mostly due to a decrease in long-term bank loans. Because of concerns over the problem banks, the
banking system, as a whole, faced difficulties in rolling over debt. As a result, the banks’ share of total
private external debt dropped to 8 percent by end-2014 compared with 9½ percent by end-2013. The
share of medium- and long-term debt in total external private debt was about 53 percent, at end-2014.
The majority of non-bank debt is short-term, and consists of trade credits, arrears and other debt liabilities,
mostly for the import of natural resources.6 Similar to other Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries,
private borrowing in Moldova stems mainly from foreign-owned companies borrowing from their parent
companies abroad.
4.
Moldova has recently become a strong policy performer for the purpose of determining the
indicative debt burden thresholds under the Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF). Moldova’s rating

4

PPG debt covers gross debt of the general government, while debt of state-owned enterprises is not included
unless it is explicitly guaranteed by the government. In line with the DSA guidelines, public debt includes liabilities
towards the IMF. Small differences with the macro-framework can be mostly explained by the fact that the DSA debt
does not include arrears. In addition, small differences in the primary surplus arise because, in the DSA, it is
calculated as the overall balance net of interest payments. On the other hand, in the macro-framework, it is
calculated as the overall balance net of interest payments and earnings.
5

By end-2014, the average private external debt amounted around 30 percent of GDP in twelve PRGT eligible
countries that, like Moldova, currently meet the income or market access criteria for graduation. The private external
debt of Moldova is substantially higher – by end-2014, it stood at 70 percent of GDP, only below that of Mongolia
(133 percent) and Grenada (78 percent).
6

Arrears (mainly in the gas sector) increased from USD 136.8 million in 2013 to around USD 172.3 in 2014. Other
debt liabilities (mainly from other energy sectors) increased from USD 537.7 million in 2013 to USD 653.7 million in
2014.

on the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) averaged 3.82 (on a scale of 1 to 6)
over the last three years (2012–2014), which places the country at the lower-end of the strong policy
performance category. The corresponding benchmark levels associated with heightened public debt
vulnerabilities are presented in Table 1.7 8

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
5.
The macroeconomic outlook has been revised to reflect changes in near- and medium-term
projections compared to the previous DSA assessment. In 2014, the Moldovan economy grew by
4.6 percent, driven in large part by a robust performance in agricultural production. However, year-on-year
exports started declining in the third quarter of 2014 because of weaker economic activity in key trading
partners and the trade restriction imposed by Russia.9 In 2015, growth is projected to contract by
1.8 percent, mainly reflecting these on-going negative external factors together with a sharp decline in
remittances, and tight domestic and external financing conditions. Despite the anticipated slowdown in
growth, headline inflation is projected to increase to 9.7 percent, significantly higher than that in the
previous DSA, due to larger than expected currency depreciation and excess liquidity in the banking sector.
The current account deficit is expected to improve in 2015, mainly explained by a sharp reduction in
imports due to lower energy prices. However, capital flows recorded in the capital and financial accounts
are expected to recover, but remain substantially lower than the pre-2014 level because of tightening
external financing conditions. Therefore, the reserve position in 2015 is expected to deteriorate further to
finance the current account deficit. The fiscal position in 2015 is projected to be weak as banking system

See the staff guidance note on the application of the joint Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Framework for LowIncome Countries (SM/13/292).
8

Since Moldova’s CPIA score is at the lower end of the strong policy performers, any moderate deterioration in
macroeconomic management and institutions could push the country into a lower category (e.g. when the next CPIA
updates are published in July 2016). Such a re-classification would reduce the debt threshold levels and may affect
the assessment of debt sustainability. For the medium policy performers, the PPG external debt threshold is
36 percent and the public debt benchmark is 56 percent.

previously projected.

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions behind the DSA
Real GDP is projected to decline by 1.8 percent in 2015, due to weaker economic activity in Russia and
Ukraine, a sharp decline in remittances (associated with the recession in Russia), and slow credit growth to
the private sector. Over the medium term, FDI is expected to recover following the signing of the DCFTA
with the EU, as well as advances in structural reforms will help sustain the economy’s potential growth rate
at around 4-4½ percent.
Inflation is expected increase to 9.7 percent in 2015, driven by a currency depreciation and large excess
liquidity in the banking sector. Weakening currency and increases in utility tariffs are expected to keep
inflation elevated in 2016. Over the medium term, headline inflation is expected to be around 5 percent, in
line with the NBM’s target.
Exports of goods and services (in US dollars) are expected to decline by 16.7 percent in 2015, mainly driven
by declining unit-value prices of exports, in particular of agricultural products. However, exports of goods
and services, as a ratio of GDP, are projected to reach 44 percent in 2015, compared to 41.6 percent in 2014.
This expected increase in exports, as a share of GDP, is mainly due to the recent depreciation of the leu. Over
the medium and long term, exports are supported by structural reforms related to the business environment
improvement, improvement in quality and standards of agricultural exports (with supports from other
international financial institutions), and cross border trade liberalization to European markets. As a result,
exports as a ratio of GDP are projected to reach 47 and 48.5 percent in 2020 and 2035, respectively.
Imports of goods and services (in US dollars) are projected to contract by 23.3 percent in 2015 due to a
large decline in global commodity prices and moderate domestic demand (arising from the large decline in
remittances growth). Imports, as a ratio of GDP, are projected to decline from 78.5 percent in 2014 to
76.6 percent in 2015, and recover to 79.5 percent in the medium term. With favorable external adjustments,
imports of goods and services, as a ratio of GDP, are projected to reach 80 percent in 2035.
Remittances are expected to decline to 19.9 percent of GDP in 2015, mainly due to the recession in Russia
and the depreciation of the Ruble. In the medium term, remittances are expected to recover to 22.5 percent
of GDP, owing to the recovery in the remittance-sourcing countries. In the long term, as the economy
develops, the number of migrants is expected to decline due to better domestic employment opportunities,
and migrants who remain abroad would lose ties with the home country. As a result, remittances as a ratio
of GDP are projected to gradually decline to 21.5 percent by end-2035.
The current account deficit is projected to narrow in the medium term (5.3 percent of GDP in 2020),
following the projected improvement from 6.9 percent in 2015. This reflects a recovery in exports and
curbed import demand as discussed above. The current account deficit is expected to remain stable at about
5.6 percent of GDP in 2035. It will be financed by FDI, which is expected to remain at about 3.1 percent of
GDP in the long run. The reserve level, as a share of GDP, is projected to decline to 21.8 percent in 2020 and
stabilize at 22.5 percent of GDP by end-2035.
The overall budget deficit is projected to increase from 1.7 percent of GDP in 2014 to 3.4 percent in 2015
(or 15.1 percent in 2015, when the costs of the banking sector resolution are included), then decline to
2 percent in 2018 and 1½ percent by 2020, reflecting the authorities’ strong commitments to ensure fiscal
sustainability as specified under the Law on Public Finance and Fiscal Responsibility (FRL). The increased
budget deficit in 2015 is due to revenue deterioration due to a weak external outlook, the full-year effect of
selective spending from pre-election pressure during 2014. Over the long run, the primary balance is
assumed to be around -0.8 percent of GDP.

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions behind the DSA (concluded)
The fiscal cost of banking sector resolution is incorporated into the analysis of debt sustainability. The
baseline scenario assumes the issuance of 14 billion leu of securities by end-2015 with an effective annual
interest rate of 5 percent, which is estimated to be sufficient to adequately compensate the NBM for the cost
of withdrawing excess liquidity while containing, to some extent, the fiscal implications of higher debt
service. Half of the securities are assumed to have a maturity of 10 years, while the other half have a 30-year
maturity, both with a 5-year grace period for repayments of principal. These assumptions imply the interest
payments of around 0.4 to 0.5 percent of GDP over the medium term.
Financing assumptions reflect a shift away from concessional financing. Grant-equivalent financing is
projected to increase slightly from 2.9 percent of GDP in 2015 to 3.1 percent in 2016, before declining to
1.8 percent in 2020, and 1.3 percent over the long run. The long-run trend reflects assumptions of declining
concessional lending and increasing in commercial borrowing (which has a negative weight on the
calculation of the grant element of new external borrowing that is shown in Figure 1A), while maintaining
the total new external borrowing of 2½ percent of GDP. Correspondingly, the grant element of new
borrowing increases from 29.7 percent in 2015 to 31.5 percent in 2020, and is expected to gradually decline
to 18.5 percent in the long run.

EXTERNAL AND PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
A. External Debt Sustainability Analysis
6.
All external public debt ratios remain well below the indicative thresholds under the
baseline and stress tests scenarios.10 Under the baseline scenario, the PV of debt-to-GDP and remittances
would increase significantly from 17½ percent in 2014 to 24½ percent in 2015, and would gradually
decline to around 20 percent in the medium term.11 The increase in the near term reflects a currency
depreciation as well as an increase in multilateral borrowing. In the long term, the PV of debt-to-GDP and
remittances would improve continuously to around 18 and 13½ percent in 2025 and 2035, respectively.
Under the alternative scenario in which exports grow at their historical average minus one standard
deviation in 2016-17, the PV of debt-to-GDP and remittances would peak at 32½ percent in 2017, before
declining to 22¾ and 13¾ percent in 2025 and 2035, respectively. A 30-percent real depreciation in 2016
would result in a similar increase in the PV of debt-to-GDP and remittances in the medium term.
Meanwhile, if the key variables remained at their historical averages, the PV of debt to GDP and remittances
would continuously increase to around 31 percent in the long run. The PV of debt-to-exports and
remittances as well as to revenue would also increase relatively more under the alternative and bound test
scenarios, but none of them breach the threshold. This result is an indication of the significant fiscal and
external adjustments proposed in the medium term. At the same time, it underscores the need for reforms.
7.
While the external risk rating is determined by the PPG external debt, large private external
debt poses additional risks. Private external debt accounted for around 72 percent of the total external
debt in 2014 and it is expected to remain at around 68 percent in the medium term (Text Table 3). Since
short-term debt makes up almost half of private external debt, it might be vulnerable to roll-over risks. In
addition, more than 85 percent of medium- and long-term private external debt is owed by the non-bank
private sector, which poses additional risks to official foreign reserves.
8.
Furthermore, while exports, remittances, and fiscal revenues are projected to be adequate
for the PPG external debt service, liquidity risks remain. Under the baseline scenario, the PV of PPG
external debt service to exports and remittances is expected to increase to 2½ percent in 2015 and peak at
4½ percent in 2020 before declining to around 3 percent by end-2035. Similarly, the PV of PPG external
debt service to revenues would peak in 2020 and then gradually decline until the end of the projection
period. None of the debt service indicators breach the debt service threshold, but some liquidity pressures
could emerge. The decline in remittances reflects a downside risk to the external DSA due to the recession
in Russia and the depreciation of the Ruble. After improving in 2012 and 2013, the current account

10

Remittances in Moldova are substantial, with the three-year (2012-2014) averages of 21.7 percent of GDP and
46.4 percent of exports of goods and services. Following the staff guidance note on the application of the joint BankFund Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries (SM/13/292), the baseline scenario incorporates
remittances and uses the adjusted PPG external debt thresholds as presented in Text Table 1.
11

In Moldova, remittances are classified as either workers’ remittances or compensation of employees. Both
categories are included in the DSA (under “income” and “current transfers”).

deteriorated again, which interrupted the reserves build-up of NBM, impairing the economy’s resilience to

B. Public Sector Debt Sustainability Analysis
9.
Under the baseline scenario, the PPG debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase significantly
in 2015 and gradually decline over the medium and long term, reflecting sustainable public debt
dynamics. Total nominal PPG debt-to-GDP ratio would increase from 37½ percent in 2014 to about
52 percent in 2015 (or 46 percent in PV terms). The increase in the domestic PPG debt-to-GDP ratio is
mainly explained by the costs of the banking sector resolution, while the increase in the external PPG debt-

REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA

to-GDP ratio is driven by the currency depreciation.12 With the macroeconomic assumptions outlined
above, the recommended primary budget deficit path is projected to be below the level that would
stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio. As a result, Moldova’s total PPG debt is expected to gradually decline from
its peak in 2015 to 40 percent in 2020 and 22½ percent by end-2035. Other sustainability indicators
confirm a similar long-term trend under the baseline scenario. PV of debt-to-GDP is projected to
deteriorate from 32½ percent in 2014 to 45¾ percent in 2015, and then gradually improve to 34½ percent
and 18¾ percent in 2020 and 2035 respectively. These PV of debt indicators are below the benchmark level
of 74 percent associated with heightened public debt vulnerabilities for the strong policy performance
category. Similarly, the PV of debt-to-revenue and grants ratio is projected to initially increase to
131¼ percent in 2015, and decline continuously to 100½ and 54½ percent by 2020 and end-2035,
respectively.
10.
While the inclusion of domestic debt does not alter the assessment of Moldova’s overall risk
of debt distress, it emphasizes the importance of prudent fiscal and borrowing policies for the
preservation of the low risk rating. Under all standard alternative scenarios presented in the DSA, the PV
of public debt-to-GDP is projected to be well below the benchmark level of 74 percent. However, some
alternative scenarios would raise the public debt level faster than others. For example, a 30-percent real
depreciation in 2016 would have the strongest impact in the short run with the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio
being above 50 percent in 2016–17. Similarly, a 10-percent of GDP increase in other debt creating flows in
2016 would cause the PV of debt-to-GDP to peak at 51 percent in that year. Such a shock is of a similar
order of magnitude as what may arise from the combination of additional contingent liabilities needed
from the rest of the banking system and from the accumulated energy tariff debt.

C. The Authorities’ View
11.
The authorities concurred with the staff assessment, and noted the importance of fiscal
sustainability. The authorities acknowledged that maintaining prudent fiscal policies over the medium
term would help protect against potential fiscal risks and liabilities, and hence would strengthen debt
sustainability. However, they also stressed the need for flexibility to be able to finance capital investment in
particular when projects are financed by concessional lending. They emphasized that these projects are
essential to making progress in poverty reduction, filling infrastructure gaps, and institution strengthening.

CONCLUSION
12.
The DSA indicates that Moldova’s risk of debt distress remains low, in line with the 2014
assessment. All external indicators for public debt remain well below the debt thresholds under the
baseline, standard bound tests, and alternative scenarios. However, significant private external debt poses
roll-over risks to debt sustainability. Likewise, while being more sensitive to exchange rate depreciation and
12

The total increase in the domestic PPG debt arising from the banking sector resolution is expected to be around
14 million leu or 11¾ percent of GDP. About 45 percent of this amount was issued as a state guarantee to the NBM
in 2014, while the remainder was issued in 2015 (see “Other identified debt-creating flows” in Table 2A).

a sudden increase in other debt creating flows, Moldova’s overall public debt dynamics are projected to
remain on a sustainable path under the baseline scenario and alterative scenarios.
13.
Pursuing prudent fiscal policy and advancing structural reforms remain necessary to ensure
debt sustainability. Due to the country’s sensitivity to exogenous developments and the banking crisis,
debt sustainability critically depends on sound macroeconomic management and continuing progress on
institutional and structural issues that would help unlock the economy’s growth potential and reduce its
vulnerability to shocks. Furthermore, the limited development of the domestic debt market poses financing
risks, especially considering the country’s development needs and significant dependence on foreign
assistance in the form of grants and concessional loans. Efforts to lengthen the average maturity of
domestic debt and deepen the secondary market would help reduce the PPG domestic debt roll-over and
interest rate risks.

4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

1/ Public sector debt covers gross debt of the general government. Debt of state-owned enterprises is not included unless it is explicitly guaranteed by the government.
2/ Gross financing need is defined as the primary deficit plus debt service plus the stock of short-term debt at the end of the last period.
3/ Revenues excluding grants.
4/ Debt service is defined as the sum of interest and amortization of medium and long-term debt.
5/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

Statement by Menno Snel, Executive Director for the Republic of Moldova
and Veronica Volociuc, Alternate Executive Director
December 16, 2015
The Moldovan authorities would like to express their appreciation to staff for the constructive
policy dialogue and valuable advice. The discussions were appropriately focused on policies to
mitigate the consequences of the banking crisis and adverse weather conditions, as well as
imbalances stemming from a difficult external environment. The authorities broadly agree with
the staff’s assessment and policy recommendations provided in the report.
The collapse of three large banks with significant costs for the government budget, together with
the drought in the summer, the external unfavorable environment and limited external financing,
had a considerable impact on macroeconomic and financial stability.
The authorities are in the process of developing a comprehensive Action Plan that will pave the
way to implementing a wide-ranging reform agenda. The key priorities are: (i) ensuring stability
of the financial sector, (ii) stabilizing and streamlining public finances, (iii) improving the
business environment and (iv) increasing the efficiency of state institutions. The authorities
expect that the implementation of this Action Plan will contribute to putting the economy on an
upward trajectory starting as soon as next year. Nevertheless, reversing the current unstable
political situation is regarded as key for promoting the reform agenda.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
After the record growth of 9.4 percent in 2013, the economy grew with 4.6 percent in 2014 and
3.6 percent in the first half of 2015. However, given the internal and external factors currently at
play, the authorities expect negative growth (of -2 percent) by the end of this year.
The large liquidity injections to problem banks spurred inflation well above its target range.
Nevertheless, strong monetary policy response was appropriate in containing pressures on the
foreign exchange market and on inflation. Lower than initial projected imports, frozen external
financing and increased cost of issuing state securities have taken a heavy toll on public finances.
The considerable drop in remittances was offset by an improvement in the trade balance mainly
because of the lower energy prices. However, the external shocks and significant depreciation
pressures on the domestic foreign exchange market have led to a reduction in international
reserves of about 33 percent compared to end October 2014.
The authorities expect the economy to recover in the coming years (projecting 1.5-3.5 percent of
growth for 2016-2018), largely supported by a gradual improvement of the financial sector and
monetary policy conditions, prudent fiscal policy and reforms aimed at streamlining public
expenditures, as well as implementation of a comprehensive structural reform agenda.
Banking sector
The collapse of three major banks
The full compensation of the withdrawn deposits from the three collapsed banks, together with

2
the smooth transfer of deposits to other banks have helped limiting panic among depositors and
avoiding a major bank run and large stress on the financial markets.
During the special administration period, measures were taken to recover the banks’ assets,
including through cooperation with the investigation authorities. Moreover, the National Bank of
Moldova (NBM) appointed qualified experts to conduct financial investigations in these three
banks. The first stage of the investigation was completed with the Kroll Report which identified
the suspicious transactions and the persons involved. The second stage started in October 2015
and will focus on the bank assets to facilitate the asset recovery.
With the withdrawal of the licenses of these three banks on October 16, 2015, the NBM initiated
the process of forced liquidation. The resources collected by the liquidators are predominantly
used for repaying the banks’ debt, including the emergency loans received from the NBM.
Need to further scrutinize the health of the remaining banks
The authorities acknowledge the importance to carefully monitor the health of the remaining
banks. Although the financial soundness indicators show a positive picture, there are suspicions of
nontransparent shareholder structures and potential engagement in high-risk lending operations.
Therefore, the NBM imposed special supervision measures on the three largest remaining banks
and required carrying out diagnostic studies by reputable audit firms. The findings of these studies
will form the basis for designing strategies for potential recapitalization or restructuring. The
recent Fund technical assistance on fit-and-proper certification will contribute to designing an
action plan once the bank diagnostic studies are completed.
Enhancing the regulatory and supervisory framework
The latest improvements of the regulatory framework aim at increasing the transparency of the
banks’ ownership structure, strengthening the information disclosure and market discipline in the
banking sector, tightening the ceiling of banks’ concentration in the market and improving the
structure and the quality of the banks’ capital. As a follow-up to the 2014 FSAP
recommendations, the reporting framework on potential transactions with affiliated or related
persons and classification and review requirements for assets and contingent liabilities were
improved.
Looking forward, the first draft of a new banking law is scheduled to be ready by the end of
March, 2016. It envisages a further strengthening of the banking sector in line with the EU
requirements regarding banking regulation and supervision.
Mid October, the Government approved amendments to the law to take away the Ministry of
Justice’s power to carry on the juridical expertise or modify regulations introduced by the NBM
and the National Commission for Financial Market. The amendments stipulate strengthening the
legal protection of central bank staff. These amendments are still subject to Parliamentary
approval.
In order to increase the transparency of banks’ shareholders, a special unit was established to
ensure sound and prudent management. Specialized software is expected to be implemented to
facilitate these efforts.
The Credit Risk Register will be launched in the first half of 2016 with the support of an

3
international consortium. It will collect, store, process and analyze the information on bank loans,
thus facilitating the monitoring of the quality of the banks’ loan portfolios and enhancing the
ability to swiftly react when credit risks occur.
The authorities are aware that restoring stability in the financial system will require stronger
reforms. While further Fund TA will play a key role in reaching this objective, the design and
implementation of the measures requires strong leadership and accountability from the
authorities.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
Since the end of 2014, the Moldovan leu depreciated and by the end of October 2015 it has lost
28.3 percent against the US dollar. The national currency was mostly exposed to depreciation
pressures in the first two months of 2015 due to the amplified turmoil in the banking sector, as
well as considerable external vulnerabilities, which negatively affected the export proceeds,
remittances and other sources of foreign exchange inflow. The NBM’s interventions in the
foreign exchange market were focused on smoothening out the excessive fluctuations and
discouraging potential speculative movements. In recent months the situation returned to normal,
with the nominal exchange rate returning to a path driven by fundamentals, while the NBM’s
interventions have lowered significantly. Yet, the authorities agree that further interventions
should be done exclusively to prevent potential disorderly exchange rate adjustments without
hindering the exchange rate movements driven by fundamentals.
Despite a considerable reduction, reserves still provide 4-months of import coverage. The
authorities underscore the need to enhance reserve buffers and stand ready to build reserves, when
market conditions allow, without jeopardizing the general market trends.
The depreciation pressures alongside the expansionary fiscal policy spurred the annual inflation
rate from 4.7 percent in December 2014 to 13.2 percent in October 2015. The NBM’s upper
bound (6.5 percent) of the inflation target was exceeded for several consecutive months. Hence,
since end 2014, the NBM has tightened the monetary policy stance increasing its base rate several
times, from 3.5 percent in December 2014 to 19.5 percent in November 2015. In order to sterilize
the excess liquidity (stemming from large emergency loans provided to the problematic banks)
and improve the transmission mechanism of monetary policy, the NBM raised the required
reserves ratio attracted in lei and non-convertible currency from 14 to 35 percent. In the NBM’s
view, refraining from tightening of the monetary policy stance would have deteriorated the
situation in the foreign exchange market and would have made it impossible to stabilize the
market in such a short period of time.
The NBM plans to loosen monetary policy gradually starting next year, while remaining very
cautious in order to not let supply side factors generate some unmanageable second round
inflationary effects.
Fiscal policy
The authorities undertook important measures to mobilize additional fiscal revenues. Excise
duties on fuel and tobacco products were increased, some VAT exemptions were eliminated, and
deductible expenses for tax purposes were revised. Unfortunately, the budget revenues dropped
considerably due to a sizeable decrease in VAT collection as a result of weaker external trade.

4
The external financing of the budget was partly suspended and the demand for state securities was
low as a result of monetary policy tightening and the uncertain environment.
Consequently, the authorities made adjustments in the 2015 budget, approved by the Parliament
on November 20, 2015, considerably correcting the budget revenue. Under these constraints, the
authorities cut significantly the expenditure side, mainly capital expenditures (by 65.1 percent).
The revised budget for the FY 2015 deficit is estimated at 3.4 percent of GDP (compared to
3.9 percent of GDP set in the initially approved 2015 budget).
Regarding the revenue side, for 2016, improvements in the evaluation and reevaluation of real
property are foreseen, and the land tax will be raised. On the expenditure side, a new law on the
public procurement system was approved by the Parliament and will become effective on May 1,
2016. Other priorities for the authorities are an automatic indexation of public sector wages and
rationalization of spending on education /health and energy subsidies. A Fund TA mission in this
regard will take place in the spring of 2016.
The outturn of the 2016 budget will depend on the available external financing, but the authorities
consider that a larger deficit than projected by staff for the next year would provide extra room to
support infrastructure projects in the pipeline, which are essential to boost additional economic
growth. Moreover, larger social needs (0.5 percent of GDP) are foreseen to mitigate the impact of
the recent increase in utility tariffs. The 2016 budget will be proposed once the new government
takes office.
The Ministry of Finance designed a Public Debt Management plan for 2016-2018 which aims to
further develop the domestic market of state securities. It focuses on enhancing the
communication with market participants, to ensure transparency and predictability in the state
securities market. Technical Assistance would be helpful for streamlining the system of primary
dealers as well as monitoring and assessing their performance.
Structural reforms
The authorities remain committed to a reform agenda to support export-led economic growth. The
Moldova 2020 National Development Strategy will remain the key pillar, which aims at
improving the business climate and promoting easier access to finance for enterprises.
The authorities have recently substantially increased the tariffs on electricity and gas to address
the cascading debts and losses in the energy sector. However, these increases do not fully cover
the accrued financial deviations which are planned to be gradually addressed during the next
years.
The authorities continue their efforts to further diversify energy supply and enhance energy
efficiency. The new laws on electricity and natural gas, which are pending Parliamentary
approval, will ensure the full transposition of the EU’s Second Energy Package. In 2014, the IaşiUngheni gas interconnector was launched. A pre-feasibility study on the construction of the
connecting pipeline between Ungheni and Chişinău is scheduled for mid-2016. The authorities
estimate that the technical project and the construction work of the pipeline could be done in the
period 2016-May 2018, subject to external financing from the developing partners and
international financial institutions. The new pipeline would provide much diversification
opportunities. As a next step in enhancing the energy sector, the authorities will focus on
implementation of the EU’s Third Energy Package, strengthening the regulatory, institutional and

5
operational framework, upgrading the energy infrastructure, improving energy efficiency and
facilitating and promoting the use of renewable energy.
Going forward, the authorities are committed to deepen the regulatory reforms and strengthen the
rule of law to encourage private investment.
