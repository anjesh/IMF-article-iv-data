Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation and Third Review Under the ThreeYear Arrangement Under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility and Request for
Waiver and Modifications of Performance Criteria
Prepared by the African Department
(In consultation with other Departments)
Approved by Jean A. P. Clément and Anthony Boote

•

Main issues: Performance under the PRGF-supported program was broadly satisfactory. Through
end-September 2006, all but two performance criteria were observed. Corrective measures have
since been taken. The staff recommends completion of the review.

•

Recent developments: Good harvests in 2005 and 2006 have improved food security, helped
economic recovery and eased inflation. However, economic growth remains too low to effectively
reduce poverty. The authorities plan to complete a revised PRSP by year-end to address growth
constraints and progress toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

•

The 2004 Article IV consultation: On June 28, 2004, Directors stressed the need to advance toward
fiscal consolidation by widening the tax base. They also called for reforms to lower production costs
and diversify the production and export base.

•

The mission and participants: Discussions were held in Niamey from September 22 to October 6,
2006. The staff team comprised Messrs. Sacerdoti (head), Farah, and Fontaine (all AFR). It was
assisted by Mr. Laporte, the Fund’s Resident Representative in Niger. A World Bank mission to
assess the execution of rural and social sector reforms participated in key discussions. The staff team
met with Mr. Zeine, the Minister of Finance and Economy; Mr. Soumana, the National Director of
the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO); and other senior government officials. It also
met with civil society and donor representatives.

•

Past reviews: The Executive Directors approved the PRGF arrangement in January 2005 in an
amount equivalent to 10 percent of quota. The first review was concluded in November 2005.
Directors then approved increased access under the PRGF arrangement to SDR 26.32 million
(40 percent of quota) to provide additional resources for the government’s food security program.
The second review was completed in June 2006. In 2006, Niger received debt relief estimated at
SDR 638 million under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI).

•

Niger, a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), shares a common
fixed exchange rate and external tariffs with other members, and has accepted the obligations under
Article VIII, sections 2, 3, and 4. The BCEAO conducts monetary and exchange rate policies at the
regional level. Relations with the Fund and World Bank are summarized in Appendices II and III.

Executive Summary
•

Macroeconomic performance and policy implementation have been broadly
satisfactory. After a drought in 2004, a bumper harvest in late 2005 and good rains in
2006 have helped economic recovery, improved food security, and eased inflation.
All performance criteria and benchmarks through end-September 2006 were met,
except for two—the reduction of domestic arrears and the flexible pricing system for
domestic petroleum products—and the authorities have since addressed the slippages
and are requesting waivers. The fiscal deficit in 2006 is expected to be narrower than
programmed, reflecting mainly lower spending on investment and food security.

•

Despite a good performance under successive PRGF-supported programs,
growth has not been sufficiently strong to significantly reduce poverty. To
achieve a higher and broad-based growth and make faster progress toward the MDGs,
key challenges are to strengthen the execution of priority programs, improve the
business environment (including access to credit), and enhance domestic revenue. A
revised PRSP outlining policies and reforms in 2007-09 is close to completion, and a
donor conference is envisaged for early 2007.

•

Prospects for 2007 are relatively good. The 2007 fiscal program is consistent with
the medium-term expenditure frameworks for the priority sectors, that have been
recently finalized with donor assistance. The basic fiscal deficit would widen
modestly, but recourse to domestic financing is targeted to be limited. The program
envisages continued reforms in tax administration, in public expenditure management
and in the financial sector. The authorities are working with the World Bank on ways
to reduce the cost of doing business.

•

Risks to the program include adverse weather, shortfalls in donor assistance,
and lack of progress in raising domestic revenue, which could hamper
macroeconomic stability and progress toward the MDGs.

•

The authorities expressed satisfaction with the effectiveness of surveillance and
technical assistance, which they considered a key factor in ensuring the success in
fiscal reforms.

•

Given the strength of the program and the authorities’ commitment to its
implementation, staff supports the authorities’ request for waivers and
completion of the review.

2.
Since 2000, the authorities have maintained a strong commitment to prudent
policies and reforms under programs supported by two successive PRGF
arrangements. The policy and reform agenda was underpinned by a poverty reduction
strategy (PRS) adopted in 2002 that identifies four pillars: enhancing macroeconomic
stability; increasing public investment, especially in irrigation infrastructure; deepening
human capital formation; and buttressing economic governance. A large number of reforms
have been introduced since 2000 to improve public expenditure management, strengthen
domestic revenue, and enhance the economy’s supply reforms (Box 1). As a result, the

Box 1: Progress in Implementing Structural Reforms (2000-2006)
Customs and tax administration
Key measures undertaken by the authorities include:
•
adoption of monthly performance indicators for the main customs offices and consistently tracking
compliance with these indicators;
•
establishment of an issue-oriented audit unit in the large and medium-size taxpayer office;
•
strengthening the large tax payers office;
•
instituting joint pre-shipment company-customs imports verification teams at several border offices;
and
•
preparation and adoption of an action plan (based on the recommendations of the 2005 IMF technical
assistance mission) to enhance the mobilization of tax revenues.
Public expenditure management (PEM)
Key measures undertaken include:
•
the adoption of a new budgetary nomenclature, public accounts charter and a new procurement law;
•
introduction of a Financial Management Information System, the setting up of a Treasury-Budget
computer interface, and computerization of regional treasury offices;
•
a comprehensive assessment of Niger’s public financial management systems through a Public
Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR), with assistance from the EU and
the Bank, and adoption of an action plan;
•
the preparation and incorporation into the budget of medium-term expenditure frameworks for health
and education; and
•
adoption of a unified list of priority expenditure.
Despite these actions, a significant number of actions are needed to further strengthen PEM. To this end, the
authorities have updated, with World Bank assistance, their action plan (2007-2009).
Financial sector reform, privatization, and the regulatory environment
Key steps include:
•
the restructuring and recapitalization of two partially state-owned banks, and the National Post and
Savings Institution (ONPE), with the establishment of separate financial (FinaPoste) and postal (NigerPoste)
branches;
•
the telecommunication sector has been liberalized and a Multisector Regulatory Agency set up;
•
several state-owned enterprises were privatized including cement, textile, diary, and telecom
companies; and
•
One-stop center for investment was created, new mining code was adopted, and steps were taken to
streamline the business regulations.
Despite the progress in financial sector reform, sector remains relatively underdeveloped, access to credit by
the private sector is still limited, and nonperforming loans are relatively high. The cost of doing business also
remains high.
Trade reforms
•
In 2000 Niger adopted the WAEMU common external tariff, with four rates (0, 5, 10, and 20 percent);
and
•
In 2005 Niger removed duties on imports (manufacturing, animal products and vegetables) from all
ECOWAS members.

In particular, the primary school gross enrollment ratio rose from some 42 percent in 2001/2002 to 52 percent
in 2004/2005. This was facilitated by the recruitment of 2,500 teachers a year since 2002 (compared with only
250 civil service teachers a year before the reform) and construction of 1,000 classrooms a year. However, girls’
enrollment in primary school represented only 41 percent of the total in 2005.

Niger reached the completion point under the initiative in 2004; debt relief, including topping-up, reduced the
NPV of debt-to-exports ratio from 390 percent at end-2002 to about 150 percent at end-2004. All creditors
except for Algeria, Iraq, Libya, Taiwan Province of China, and the United Arab Emirates, have signed
agreements to provide debt relief including topping-up.

A recent household survey conducted in mid-2005 indicates that 62 percent of the population is below the
poverty line, defined as income needed for a minimum required food basket.

Box 2. Economic Growth and Productivity in Niger
A growth accounting exercise for Niger for the period 1963–2003 shows that total factor productivity
(TFP) growth was on average negative. While negative TFP growth has been found in other studies for
Sub-Saharan Africa as a whole, the decline in TFP growth in Niger has been more pronounced (see Niger,
Tracing the Sources of Economic Growth, Selected Economic Issues, (forthcoming)).

Droughts, soil erosion and limited progress in modernizing
farming techniques undermined the performance
of the agriculture sector. This in turn has had adverse
consequences for the overall performance of the economy,
and constrained poverty reduction. Strengthening growth
and reducing vulnerability to adverse shocks will require
significant improvements in agricultural productivity.
Effective implementation of the rural sector medium-term
strategy which focuses on irrigation and the introduction of
modern production techniques with large donor assistance
will be critical to Niger’s prospects for growth and
poverty reduction.

pushed GDP growth for
the year as a whole to about 7 percent, and eased inflationary pressures (Figures 1 and
Table 2). However, a large segment of the population continued to rely on drought relief
because of large losses of livestock and increased household indebtedness during the
drought.

5.
In 2006 macroeconomic performance was broadly satisfactory. Real GDP growth
is expected to slow to 3½ percent. Growth in the agriculture sector moderated, with cereal
production remaining close to the record level of late 2005, and performance in the mining
and services has been strong. Average inflation declined to 1¼ percent in the 12 months to
September 2006 and is expected to decrease further to almost zero by end-2006 because of
falling food prices. Based on an equilibrium real effective exchange rate (EREER) analysis
for the WAEMU region and recent evolution of key determinants of the EREER (i.e., terms
of trade, government expenditure, and investment), the exchange rate appears to be close to
its long-run equilibrium. In 2006, the external current account deficit (including grants) is
estimated to have remained unchanged. Niger’s external debt burden was further reduced by
debt relief under the MDRI totaling SDR 638 million from the Fund, IDA and the African

9
Development Fund (AfDF).5 This reduced the NPV of debt-to-export ratio to 46 percent in
2006 (see Appendix IV).

6.
In the first half of 2006, the basic fiscal deficit6 was significantly lower than
programmed because of higher revenue and underspending. Improvements in tax and
customs administration (achieved mainly by tightening control of import valuation and
transit operations, and reinforcing the auditing of large- and medium-sized enterprises)
boosted revenue collection. The underspending was mainly related to food security, given the
good harvest and strong external assistance. As a result, net domestic financing was
significantly smaller than targeted.
7.
The full 2006 fiscal program has been revised to incorporate slower expenditure
execution (Table 3). Overall expenditure (excluding foreign-financed projects) is estimated
to be 1.5 percent of GDP lower than programmed. The bulk of underspending is related to
investments and food security. Revenue is expected to reach the program objective. Overall,
the 2006 basic deficit is expected to be significantly lower than envisaged and will be more

than covered by external budget support (including MDRI debt relief ).7 Thus, net domestic
financing (excluding financing from the Fund) is targeted to decline by 0.3 percent of GDP,
instead of increasing by that percentage, as was programmed. Accordingly, the domestic
financing target for end-December 2006 has been revised.
8.
The bumper harvest in late 2005 and good rains in July through September have
significantly improved food security. The cost of the food security program in 2006 is now
estimated at 1.6 percent of GDP, compared with an anticipated 2.8 percent (MEFP,
paragraph 7). Government contribution to the food security program is estimated to be lower
by 0.7 percent of GDP. The strategic grain reserves are expected to increase to some
76,000 metric tons, from 15,000 metric tons at end-2005.

Through September 2006, all performance criteria were observed, except
two—the targets on net reduction of domestic arrears for end-June 2006 and the
application of flexible pricing mechanism for petroleum products. The authorities have
since accelerated the reduction of domestic arrears. In the third quarter of 2006 the
government deferred some taxes on petroleum products because of strong increases in world
fuel prices and intense social pressures.8 Much of the foregone revenue was recouped in
October and November when the authorities kept domestic retail petroleum prices from
declining in line with world prices. Because of the corrective measures adopted, the staff

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Key Achievements and Remaining Challenges
11.
The Article IV consultation discussions focused on the main challenges: putting
the economy on a higher growth path and making adequate progress toward the
MDGs. Authorities and staff agreed that strengthening economic growth will require a rapid
increase of productivity in agriculture and a broad diversification of the economic base,
which in turn require higher public and private investment and a more favorable business
environment.
12.

Against this background, staff and authorities agreed on the following priorities:
•

Effective execution of growth-critical PRSP-based programs. Key
elements of these programs are: the expansion of irrigation; the
encouragement of the use of modern inputs in agriculture (including through
increased access to credit); increasing investment on roads and transport
(especially in rural areas) to reduce transport costs; and enhancing human
capital formation, which is critical for improving social indicators as well as
productivity. A revised PRSP, to be completed by the end of 2006, will
outline the investment needed to implement these programs and their
implications for economic growth and the MDGs.

•

Reforms that encourage private sector development. These will need to
focus on reducing the cost of doing business and enhancing competitiveness.
In particular, the privatization and restructuring of state-owned financial
institutions should be completed, and the restructuring and eventual
privatization of the state-owned electricity company should be advanced.
Reforms of the regulatory framework and judiciary system would also
improve the business environment, facilitate private investment, and deepen
financial intermediation. To this end, the development of a viable and well
supervised microfinance system is essential.

•

Buttressing revenue collection and PEM. Although Niger will for the
foreseeable future continue to rely on concessional development assistance to
cover its large financing requirement, there is a need to strengthen domestic
revenue to help finance the expenditure associated with the MDGs. Additional
reforms to address tax evasion and improve informal sector compliance will
be critical. Strengthening PEM—especially the development of a mediumterm expenditure framework, improving the tracking of priority programs, and
enhancing ex ante and ex-post controls —is important for enhancing the
effectiveness of poverty reducing programs and for mobilizing higher aid. To
this end, timely execution of the medium-term action plan, developed with
assistance from the World Bank, is critical.

12
B. The Medium-Term Outlook
13.
Over the next few years there are

favorable prospects for improved
economic performance, notably because of

the large foreign-financed investment effort
to increase productivity in agriculture, and
3.0
because of new initiatives in agribusiness
and mining. The PRSP that the authorities

are preparing will target a relatively high rate
of economic growth. Pending a careful
analysis of the forthcoming PRSP, the staff

projects for 2007-09 a growth rate somewhat
above 4 percent. Agriculture should benefit

and modernize techniques and inputs, which
should attenuate the risks from adverse climatic conditions. Mining is likely to benefit from
ongoing expansion of existing uranium mines in view of favorable international prices and
stronger demand. 9 Expansion in the construction and the service sector should also contribute
to growth. Inflation is expected to remain low, assuming there are no major droughts, and the
BCEAO continues its prudent management of monetary policy.

Demand for uranium is expected to strengthen owing to renewed search for alternative energy sources. Niger
now accounts for about 10 percent of world uranium output.

13
14.
The medium-term fiscal objective of the authorities, with which the staff concurs,
is to limit the basic budget deficit to a level that can be covered by grants and highlyconcessional loans, with no recourse to domestic financing, so as to maintain debt
sustainability. To this end, the authorities are committed to strengthen revenue mobilization
through comprehensive reforms in tax and customs administration. The PRSP under
preparation is likely to call for higher resources in support for an expanded investment
program in the priority sectors. The main challenge will be to ensure that these resources
have a high grant component.
15.
Niger is at a moderate risk of debt distress. While external debt indicators over
the medium term remain below the policy-based thresholds, the debt burden is
projected to increase over time. In the baseline scenario the ratio of NPV of debt-to-exports
ratio is projected to rise steadily from 46 percent in 2006 (taking into account the impact of
the MDRI) to about 107 percent by 2025, but the increase tapers off in the outer years and
stabilizes by about 2021 (Appendix IV). Other debt ratios would remain below the policybased indicative thresholds for low-income countries.10 Bound tests show that Niger’s debt
situation is vulnerable to exogenous factors. In particular, a temporary reduction in export
growth and less concessional borrowing terms would significantly weaken debt
sustainability. The result of the DSA underscores the need to finance most of the new
investments through grants. Were grants not forthcoming at the required level, debt
management policy has to be utmost cautious, with only the most concessional financing
contracted for highly productive investments. While Niger remains clearly vulnerable to a
number of external shocks, the staff assessment is that the country remains at a moderate risk
of debt distress under the debt sustainability framework.
16.
The medium-term outlook is subject to risks. Niger is exposed to possible
unfavorable weather conditions which can affect growth, and exacerbate poverty. Shortfalls
in donor assistance and lack of progress in raising domestic revenue could slow the execution
of priority programs, curtail growth, and limit progress toward the MDGs. To mitigate these
risks, it is essential that investment programs in the priority sectors be executed with utmost
effectiveness, and reforms be sustained to strengthen tax administration, improve expenditure
management, and enhance the business environment, so as to foster the diversification of the
economy.

10

Under the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment Rating System, Niger is classified as a
“medium performer”. The debt sustainability thresholds applied for these countries, in terms of NPV of debt-toexports, GDP, and revenue are 150 percent, 40 percent and 250 percent, respectively, and in terms of debt
service to exports is 20 percent.

C. Macroeconomic Framework and Policies for 2007
17.
Prospects for 2007 are favorable with stronger growth, low inflation, and
increased tax revenue to support priority expenditure. Real GDP growth is projected at
about 4 percent. The projection is based on further expansion of the mining and service
sectors, and a good performance in the agriculture sector. Inflation is expected to remain low
at about 2 percent on an annual average. The external current account deficit, excluding
grants, is expected to widen, reflecting higher imports associated with the externally-financed
public investment program, but that would be covered by development assistance.
Fiscal Policy and Public Finance Reforms
18.
The authorities expressed satisfaction with the effectiveness of surveillance and
technical assistance (TA), which they considered key factors in ensuring the success of
fiscal reforms. They hope that Fund TA will continue.
19.
The 2007 budget law provides more resources to priority sectors and safeguards
debt sustainability. The basic fiscal deficit is targeted at 3⅓ percent of GDP. Domestic
revenue is projected to increase to 12 percent of GDP as reforms in tax and customs
administration continue (see below). Domestically financed expenditures are expected to
increase to 15.3 percent of GDP reflecting unanticipated transfers to the Civil Service Social

from the World Bank, the EU, the

modestly positive, reflecting some draw down of deposits accumulated in 2006.
20.
The authorities are committed to further strengthening revenue performance.
Key elements of the reform agenda—computerization of border posts, reinforcing taxpayer
audits and exemption controls (MEFP, paragraphs 21 and 22)—are already under way and
will be consolidated overtime. In particular, the strengthening of ex-post controls at the major
regional custom offices is a structural performance criterion under the program for endDecember 2006. In 2007, reforms will focus on enhancing electronic information-sharing
between border posts for goods in transit as well as for those declared in the main regional
centers in Niger, and the simplification of tax collection procedures to encourage compliance
(structural performance criterion for end-December 2007). However, the authorities stressed
that reforms will only gradually increase revenue and require significant increases in material
and skilled human resources for the tax collection agencies. In this regard, the authorities
plan to seek additional technical and financial support from development partners.
21.
The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening PEM (MEFP,
paragraphs 23 and 24). They will continue to execute the recommendations of PEMFAR,
which will focus on (i) strengthening the preparation of the budget and fully integrating it
with the medium-term expenditure framework; (ii) enhancing the execution and monitoring
of expenditure, with particular attention to priority programs; (iii) streamlining budget
procedures and regulations to avoid delays in budget execution; and (iv) reinforcing ex-ante
and ex-post audits by allocating more human and material resources to the agencies. A pilot
project will give line ministries access to computerized expenditure procedures. In addition,
the authorities will publish quarterly reports on the execution of the budget, and update and
streamline treasury accounts, a structural performance criterion for end-June 2007.

16
External Policies and Regional Integration
22.
Authorities will continue to make good faith negotiations with remaining nonParis Club creditors in order to reach agreements on debt relief on terms comparable
with those already obtained.
23.
While they reiterated their commitment to the WAEMU convergence criteria,
the authorities emphasized that some of the criteria will only be achieved over the
medium term. The reforms to strengthen domestic revenue will help Niger make progress
toward the regional thresholds. Such reforms will in the long run also help reduce the fiscal
deficit. The authorities stated their commitment to prudent debt management.

Other Structural Reforms
24.
The authorities are committed to the flexible pricing system for petroleum
products established in August 2001 (MEFP, paragraph 19). They will consult with the Fund
prior to any change of the pricing system. Since end-September the government has not fully
passed through the decline in international prices, in order to recover the taxes deferred
earlier in 2006, and will continue to do so until the tax recovery is complete.
25.
The authorities are moving to deepen financial intermediation (MEFP
paragraphs 25 and 26). The emphasis is on restructuring and privatizing public financial
institutions, and promoting viable microfinance institutions. The government is recapitalizing
FinaPoste, an independent financial branch of the National Post office. The revamped
institution, which has a large cross-country network, is expected to help mobilize savings and

17
contribute to intermediation. The establishment of a repayment schedule for the frozen postal
deposits is a structural performance criterion for end-December 2007. The ongoing
privatization of Crédit du Niger will help increase competition in the banking sector. To
bring financial services to rural areas—an important element of Niger’s growth strategy—the
authorities are working with the World Bank to establish an autonomous office to supervise
microfinance institutions. The authorities are also developing a restructuring plan for the two
largest microfinance institutions, which are in financial difficulties.
26.
Regulatory reform and privatization aim to improve the business environment.
The authorities have recently reduced the number of procedures for establishing new
businesses, continued improving the one-stop center for new investment, and adopted a new
mining code to stimulate investment.11 They are working with the World Bank to review the
land-tenure system and strengthen the judiciary system, especially the commercial courts. To
remedy skill shortages that hamper the development of the private sector, the authorities are
expanding vocational schools and other training programs. They emphasized that the
restructuring and privatization of the electricity company (NIGELEC) as well as increase in
investment in physical infrastructure, such as road networks, will enhance competitiveness.
IV. STATISTICAL ISSUES
27.
Niger’s economic database is adequate for surveillance and program monitoring
and the country participates in the GDDS (Appendix V). The quality of the consumer
price index (CPI), monetary data, and balance of payments statistics is largely satisfactory.
However, coverage of the CPI needs to expand beyond Niamey, and both monetary and
balance of payment statistics need to be more timely; the latter needs to be broadened to
include informal trade. The quality and timeliness of national accounts and government
finance statistics needs improvements. The authorities have recently established an
independent statistical office and are committed to implementing the recommendations of the
Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC).
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
Since the last quarter of 2005, macroeconomic performance and food security
have improved. A bumper harvest late in the year fueled a strong economic recovery in
2005 and reduced inflation in 2005. A normal harvest in 2006 has further enhanced the food
security, eased inflation, and supported modest economic growth rate in 2006. The
authorities are working closely with UN relief agencies and other donors to strengthen food
security and provide support for the vulnerable.
29.
Nevertheless, Niger’s growth performance is below potential, social indicators
are weak, and poverty is widespread. Limited implementation capacity and resources
slowed the execution of the poverty reduction strategy, especially efforts to improve
agriculture productivity, diversify the economy, and expand rapidly social services. The
11

In 2006, Niger’s ranking of ease of doing business improved from 169 to 160.

18
economy thus remains vulnerable to adverse shocks, including droughts, and progress toward
the MDGs has been limited.
30.
Staff and authorities agreed that establishing conditions for stronger and
broad-based economic growth and improving social conditions are the key challenges.
Boosting economic growth will require increasing agricultural productivity through a
determined implementation of programs to expand irrigation and encourage the use of
modern inputs. This, combined with increased investment in human capital formation and
physical infrastructure would help enhance Niger’s growth prospects and improve social
indicators.
31.
Staff concurs with the authorities that the forthcoming PRSP and accompanying
medium-term expenditure framework would require significantly higher financing
needs than the program currently envisages. It encourages the authorities to work closely
with development partners to mobilize the required technical and financing assistance mostly
in the form of grants.
32.
Given the findings that Niger is at a modest risk of debt distress but remains
vulnerable to a number of shocks, it is the staff view that the bulk of the financing required
for needed investments should be at grant terms.
33.
Performance under the PRGF-supported program has been satisfactory thus far
in 2006. All but two performance criteria through September 2006 were met. The authorities
have since taken steps to address the slippages. Staff welcomes the revision of the fiscal
program for the full year 2006 to take into account lower spending than originally envisaged
both for food security and for investment, and supports the related revision of the
performance criterion on domestic financing of the budget for end-December 2006. Staff also
supports the authorities’ decision to use unspent resources for the 2007 budget, while
encouraging them to strengthen project implementation capacity.
34.
Staff welcomes the shifting of the composition of expenditure toward priority
programs in the 2007 budget, while maintaining debt sustainability. The expected
increase in donor support and modest improvement in domestic revenue will contribute to
higher spending on health, education, and rural sector development.
35.
The measures the authorities are taking to mobilize revenue are appropriate.
Recent steps to strengthen border controls, and the auditing of large and medium-sized
enterprises, have already yielded positive results. Envisaged reforms to further strengthen
border controls and tax audits, tighten exemptions, and simplify tax procedures should help
broaden the tax base and enhance tax compliance.
36.
The steps the authorities are taking to improve public expenditure management
are welcome, in particular the preparation of medium-term expenditure frameworks for key
sectors, the computerization of the budget and treasury operations, and the establishment of a
unified list of priority programs. However, more needs to be done to streamline budgetary
procedures, strengthen treasury accounting, and reinforce ex-ante and ex-post controls. The

19
planned publication of quarterly reports on the execution of the budget will enhance the
transparency of government operations.
37.
Staff urges the authorities to complete the ongoing financial sector reforms,
including the capitalization of the restructured financial branch of the postal network, and the
privatization of Crédit du Niger (CDN). The soundness of the banking system (excluding
CDN) is broadly satisfactory. The successful restructuring of microfinance institutions and
reinforcing the office responsible for supervising them will be key to the efforts to increase
access to credit by the private sector.
38.
The recent efforts to reduce the regulatory burden on investment are welcome,
but further steps are needed to reduce the cost of doing business. The staff encourages
the authorities to advance, with World Bank assistance, the restructuring and privatization of
the electricity company, the reform of the land tenure system, and the strengthening of the
judiciary. These reforms will help improve economic growth prospects.
39.
Staff encourages the authorities to continue strengthening the statistical system,
which still has deficiencies that weaken the monitoring of economic developments.
40.
Staff urges the authorities to reach agreement with non-Paris Club bilateral
creditors that have not yet provided debt relief under the HIPC Initiative.
41.
Risks to the program include the vulnerability of the economy to adverse shocks,
possible shortfalls in donor assistance, and inadequate progress in mobilizing revenue.
However, the authorities’ strong commitment to reforms and continued donor support should
mitigate the risks.
42.
In light of the above considerations, staff recommends Board approval of the
authorities’ request for waivers for the non observance of two performance criteria and
completion of the third review.
43.
Staff welcomes intention to make public the staff report, the letter of intent and the
MEFP. It recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Niger be held under the
24-month consultation cycle, subject to the Board decision on consultation cycles
(Decision No.12794 –(02/76) dated July 15, 2002, as amended).

APPENDIX I—ATTACHMENT I
NIGER: LETTER OF INTENT
Niamey, December 6, 2006
Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
U.S.A
Dear Mr. de Rato
1.
The government continues to implement the policies and reforms envisaged under the
PRGF-supported arrangement. Through September 2006, all performance criteria related to
the third review have been met, with the exception of the target on nonaccumulation of
domestic payment arrears and the application of flexible pricing system for petroleum
products. We have taken corrective measures to address the above-noted slippages. All
structural benchmarks through end-September 2006 have also been met. The bumper harvest
in 2005 and a good harvest in 2006 have supported a recovery of the economy from the 2004
drought, reduced inflationary pressures, and improved food security, which has also
benefited from substantial donor support.
2.
In the first six months of the year budget outlays have remained well below the
program targets, partly because of the improvement in food security, while revenue have
exceeded the program objective. Accordingly, the fiscal deficit and net domestic financing
were much smaller than envisaged under the program.
3.
The program for the remainder of 2006 and for 2007, which is outlined in the
attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP), focuses on policies and
reforms aimed at strengthening economic growth and fighting poverty. In the last part of
2006 spending, especially on priority programs, will increase while attaining the program’s
fiscal objectives. For 2007 the fiscal program presented in the Budget Law is consistent with
our poverty reduction strategy, including increased budget allocations for health, education
and rural sectors. It also envisages continued reforms in tax and customs administration and
public expenditure management. The government also intends to press ahead with reforms to
help strengthen growth. In this context, we plan to finalize and adopt a revised Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) for 2007-09 by end-2006. A donor conference to mobilize
funding for the revised PRSP, which would imply significantly higher financing needs than
currently envisaged under the program’s medium-term framework, is scheduled for the first
quarter of 2007. A revised medium-term macroeconomic framework taking into account the
revised PRSP will be developed during the fourth review of the PRGF.
4.
The government requests the completion of the third review of the PRGF-supported
program and waivers for the nonobservance of two performance criteria. It consents to the
publication by the Fund of this letter of intent, the MEFP, the technical memorandum of

29
understanding, and the staff report. The government considers that the policies presented in
the MEFP are adequate to attain the objectives of the program. It will take any further
measures that may become appropriate for this purpose. Niger will consult with the Fund on
the adoption of any policy measures in advance of any revisions to the policies contained in
the MEFP, in conformity with the rules of the IMF policies on such consultation.
Sincerely yours,
/ S/
Ali Lamine Zeine
Minister of Finance and Economy

APPENDIX I—ATTACHMENT II
NIGER: MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES
OF THE GOVERNMENT OF NIGER FOR 2006-2007
I. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION
Background and Macroeconomic developments
1.
Economic and social conditions continued to improve since the last quarter of 2005.
The 2005 harvest late in year was one of the largest on record, pushing real GDP growth up
to 7 percent for the year as a whole, after a decline of 1 percent in 2004. This led to
significant declines in food prices in the last quarter of 2005; on the basis of data for the first
8 months of 2006, inflation is projected at about 0.3 percent on average in 2006. Good rains
in July-September have resulted in a normal harvest in late 2006. These conditions have
helped reduce the number of vulnerable people from 1.8 million in early 2006 to about
1 million in September. Overall economic growth in 2006 is estimated at some 3.5 percent.
2.
In 2006, the external current account deficit is estimated at 7.5 percent of GDP,
broadly unchanged from 2005, as an increase in the oil import bill of CFAF 16 billion would
be offset by lower cereal imports, which were high in 2005 because of a drought. In addition
to high fuel prices in 2006, the higher oil import bill also reflects increased import volume
aimed at rebuilding domestic stocks after their depletion in 2005 because of production
interruptions in regional refineries. Taking into account project grants and loans and budget
support, the net foreign assets of the central bank (excluding the impact of debt relief
provided by the Fund under the MDRI of about CFAF 60 billion) would remain unchanged
from its 2005 level.
3.
Bank credit to the economy grew strongly during January-September (21.6 percent)
reflecting support for new investments in key sectors such as mining and telecommunication;
this followed 20 percent increase in credit in 2005. The expansion of credit also reflects the
activities of new banks. Broad money expanded by 12.6 percent during January-July, with a
17 percent increase in currency in circulation. Net foreign assets of the banking system
(excluding the impact of MDRI) remained broadly unchanged during the first 7 months of
2007. Broad money growth is expected to slowdown to some 6 percent by end-year.
Fiscal Policy
4.
During the first half of 2006, the government maintained prudent macroeconomic
policies and advanced reforms critical for strengthening growth and reducing poverty. The
basic fiscal deficit was limited to CFAF 17.0 billion (0.9 percent of the estimated GDP for
2006, including HIPC financing investment), much lower than the programmed
CFAF 46.5 billion, reflecting better revenue performance and slower implementation of
expenditure programs, mainly related to food security and investment. The low spending for
food security was made possible by adequate donor support and an improvement in the food
security situation. However, disbursements for the education and health sectors using HIPC

31
resources were also low, and measures have been taken to ensure the acceleration of
disbursements in the second half of the year. The economic rebound in late 2005 and
improvements in tax and customs administration—tightened control of import valuation and
of transit operations, and reinforced auditing of domestic tax obligations of large and
medium-sized enterprises—yielded CFAF 13 billion (0.7 percent of GDP) higher revenue
than anticipated.
5.
Through June 2006, all quantitative performance criteria and benchmarks under the
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) were observed (Table 1), with the exception
of that on domestic arrears. The lower basic deficit (an indicative target under the program)
contained domestic financing of the budget (a performance criterion) to a level significantly
lower than programmed, even when adjusted for the smaller than programmed spending on
food security. Of the other indicative targets, the wage bill was in line with the program
target, while total budgetary revenue exceeded the program target. The performance criteria
related to the nonaccumulation of external arrears and the concessionality of newly
contracted debt were also observed.
6.
All structural performance criteria and benchmarks through end-September were also
observed except for that pertaining to the petroleum pricing mechanism (Table 2). They
relate to monthly indicators for main customs offices (continuous performance criterion), the
reduction of the non-VAT filers at the large taxpayers unit to less than 5 percent and the audit
of large enterprises (at least 60) (both performance criteria), and the design of a timetable to
audit enterprises that benefit from custom duty exemptions (a benchmark). On petroleum
pricing, in view of strong increases in world fuel prices and intense social pressures, the
government allowed tax deferment in July, August and September 2006. Total revenue loss
during the above-noted period is estimated at CFAF 0.2 billion.
7.
Donor assistance and the disbursements by government helped strengthen food
security, through targeted sales at moderate prices and free distributions of food to vulnerable
segments of the population and the rebuilding of strategic grain reserves. The National
System of Security has received through September 2006 donor support of CFAF 7.9 billion
which was used to sell cereals at moderate prices and to rebuild the strategic grain reserves of
Cellule Crise Alimentaire (CCA). The latter will reach 16,000 tons by end-October 2006. The
office responsible for food storage (OPVN) also received CFAF 3.5 billion through
end-October 2006 and donor support of CFAF 2.7 billion, which allowed the office to buy
local rice that was partly resold at moderate prices and to rebuild the strategic grain reserves.
The office is also expected to receive soon an additional CFAF 1.5 billion from the
government. With these resources, OPVN grain reserves would reach some 30,000 tons,
bringing the total stock (including that of CCA) to some 46,000 tons. Additional resources
for rebuilding the strategic grain reserves are expected to be disbursed in the next few months
by the Islamic Development Bank (CFAF 2.6 billion) and the European Union
(CFAF 3.9 billion), which would increase the grain reserves by an additional 30,000 tons.
Further, disbursements for funds for nutritional purposes and agriculture inputs are expected
to reach CFAF 7 billion and the government will provide additional support through the
early warning system (SAP). In total, budget and donor support for the food security program
would reach some CFAF 32 billion in 2006, relative to CFAF 51 billion estimated in
March 2006.

32
Public expenditure management
8.
The government has continued executing the recommendations of the Public
Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR), which benefits
from the technical assistance of a number of donors. Specifically, the government has
(i) finalized the medium-term expenditure framework for the rural sector for 2007-09, and
the one for the post primary education; and (ii) prepared an action plan to strengthen the
financial control function, including the preparation of a manual of procedures, and training
on the new functional budgetary classification and public procurement procedures. In
addition, a new department of Public Procurement has been established by decree of
18th August, 2006 to strengthen the transparency of government transactions. Despite these
actions, further efforts are required to strengthen expenditure management and procurement.
Actions are under way to speed up the procedures of expenditure commitment and payments
orders. To this end, a pilot unit is being established where budget offices of line ministries
can initiate expenditure commitments and obtain necessary approvals by the budget
department and also get information on actual payments by treasury. Also, at the regional
level, budget offices (which execute crédits délégués—about 20 percent of total budgetary
credits) are being computerized to accelerate the execution of expenditure and the flow of
information to the central budget directorate, and to establish better linkages with the
regional treasury offices.
9.
The monitoring of budgetary execution is being strengthened. The budgetary
nomenclature is satisfactory, although certain weaknesses remain regarding the functional
classification, and contains a code to identify poverty-reducing outlays. This has facilitated
the monitoring of expenditure execution, including priority programs included in the unified
list that was established in September 2005 and included in the 2006 budget law.
10.
Regarding the regularization of treasury accounts, the initial balances of the fiscal
years 1997-2002 have been integrated into the treasury accounts after consultation with the
Auditor Court (Chambre des Comptes). However, the integration of initial balances is
incomplete for pre-1996 fiscal years; this will take place before end-June 2007 (a
performance criterion), after the adoption of the laws approving budget executions for
1987-1996. This will allow establishing the consolidated government accounts at
end-December 2002, including the balances for 1997 and preceding years.
II. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2006
Fiscal policy
11.
The fiscal program for 2006 has been revised to incorporate slower execution of
certain expenditure programs and the impact of debt relief (CFAF 3 billion) provided by the
International Development Association (IDA) and the African Development Fund. Total
expenditure (excluding foreign-financed projects) is estimated to be CFAF 27.8 billion lower
than envisaged under the program (1.5 percent of GDP). This reflects lower spending on the
food security program, lower interest payments to multilateral creditors in view of MDRI,

33
and a slower execution of investment because of capacity constraints. The revenue
mobilization effort will continue on the basis of the medium-term action plans of the customs
and tax directorates. The tax revenue target for the year is CFAF 203 billion, 2 billion higher
than programmed, while overall revenue is targeted at CFAF 210 billion (equivalent to
11.3 percent of GDP), in line with the program objective. In customs administration, key
measures envisaged for end-December 2006 are: (i) finalizing an electronic interconnection
between the border posts of Torody and Gaya and Niamey to ensure a rigorous monitoring of
the goods that are processed in the Niamey main custom offices (structural benchmark); and
(ii) establishing units of ex-post control of imports valuations and exemptions in the three
largest regional customs offices (performance criterion). The tax department will continue its
efforts to contain the number of non filers at the medium size tax payer office (MTO);
however, the initial target of 10 percent by end December 2006 cannot be observed due to an
increase in the number of tax payers now under the office, many of which are inactive;
accordingly, the target has been revised to 25 percent (structural benchmark). More efforts
will be made to control the final use of tax-exempted goods, including by strengthening the
coordination between the customs and the tax departments.
12.
On this basis, the basic fiscal deficit (excluding foreign-financed investment) is
projected at CFAF 49.7 billion (2.7 percent of GDP), compared with the originally
programmed CFAF 76.7 billion (4.1 percent of GDP). Taking into account the targeted
reduction in domestic arrears (CFAF 6.1 billion), the cash deficit is estimated at
CFAF 53.2 billion. On the financing side, with unanticipated higher repayments of the
statutory advance to the BCEAO (CFAF 4.1 billion) on the basis of a new agreement signed
in July 2006, and an estimated shortfall in net external budget support of CFAF 11 billion
(CFAF 56 billion relative to programmed CFAF 67 billion), net domestic financing
(excluding financing from the Fund) is targeted to decline by CFAF 5.1 billion, compared
with an increase of CFAF 7 billion envisaged originally.
Structural reforms
13.
The committee responsible for the evaluation of domestic debt and arrears, which
prepared a preliminary report in August 2005 on the evolution of the end-1999 stock
domestic arrears during the period of 1999-2004, updated its analysis through end-June 2006.
On this basis, the remaining stock is estimated at CFAF 137 billion, excluding debt vis-à-vis
the BCEAO which was rescheduled in July 2006. The bulk of these arrears relate to public
and private suppliers (CFAF 71 billion). Arrears related to deposits at the Treasury of
autonomous agencies, local authorities, and the National Social Security Service (CNSS) are
also estimated at CFAF 44 billion. To improve the management of domestic debt and arrears,
the debt management unit at the Ministry of Finance and the Economy (CAADIE) will be
strengthened through the provision of additional human and material resources. This will
allow the unit, inter alia, to update the situation of domestic arrears on a quarterly basis.
During 2006, the reduction of domestic arrears is programmed at CFAF 6.1 billion, which is
mainly related to wages. For 2007, the reduction of domestic arrears is targeted at
CFAF 15.2 billion. For the remainder, a reduction plan will be finalized by end-December
2006 (structural benchmark).

34
14.
The government has advanced financial sector reforms. Regarding Credit du Niger
(CDN), consultants on privatization have completed reports on the financial situation of the
bank and privatization options. Understandings have been reached with the BCEAO on a
schedule for repaying the CDN debt toward this institution. The solicitation of investor
interest for CDN will be launched in December 2006.
15.
The restructuring of the National Postal Office (ONPE) is underway, with the
establishment of two separate postal (NigerPoste) and financial branches (FinaPoste). To
allow FinaPoste to meet its capital requirement and apply for a license from the central bank,
the government will provide CFAF 1.0 billion before end-December 2006. Government’s
payment will be considered a partial payment of the liability of ONPE on account of frozen
deposits (CFAF 4.8 billion). The detailed modalities of reimbursements of frozen postal
deposits will be finalized before end-December 2007 (a performance criterion). A part of
these deposits (CFAF 1.4 billion) will be repaid by end-December 2007, and the rest by
end-December 2009. Regarding NigerPoste, the government is committed to providing
adequate subsidies to ensure the financial viability of the institution as it provides services
across the country, including in rural areas. For the current fiscal year, subsidies equivalent to
CFAF 0.4 billion will be disbursed before end-December 2006.
16.
The government is in the process of strengthening the microfinance sector. To that
end it has prepared a draft decree for creating a more effective regulatory agency. The
government will adopt the decree by end-December 2006 (a structural benchmark). The
government is also developing a restructuring plan for the two largest microfinance
institutions (Taimako and MCPEC) which are in financial difficulties.
III. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES FOR 2007
A. Macroeconomic Framework
17.
In 2007, real GDP growth is projected at about 4 percent, reflecting favorable
performance of the agriculture (including livestock), and mining and construction sectors.
The mining sector would benefit from ongoing investment in the sector as well as a recovery
of gold production after technical problems weakened its performance in 2006. Overall
inflation is projected at 2 percent. The external current account deficit (including grants) is
projected to widen to 10.6 percent of GDP, as expected increase in the exports of uranium
and gold would be more than offset by a strong increase in imports, mainly related to
foreign-financed investment projects and other government outlays. Taking into account
external budget and project support, the net foreign assets of the central bank could remain
stable. The government is reviewing the medium-term outlook in the context of the ongoing
preparation of the revised PRSP for 2007-2009 and a revised outlook will be presented
during the fourth review of the PRGF-supported program.

35
B. Fiscal Policy
18.
The 2007 fiscal policy will be geared toward providing more resources to priority
programs—consistent with the recently prepared medium-term expenditure frameworks for
education, health and the rural sectors—while safeguarding debt sustainability. In this regard,
the basic fiscal deficit (excluding foreign-financed investment) is projected to increase from
CFAF 49.7 billion (2.7 percent of GDP) in 2006 to 65.3 billion (3.3 percent of GDP), which
is 0.5 percent of GDP higher than originally programmed. Domestic revenue is expected to
be CFAF 1 billion (0.1 percent of GDP) higher than envisaged in the June 2006 MEFP owing
to ongoing improvements in customs and tax administration and additional structural
measures envisaged for 2007 (see below). On this basis domestic revenue should reach the
equivalent of 12 percent of GDP, relative to 11.8 percent originally envisaged.
19.
Total expenditure (excluding interest due and foreign financed projects) are
programmed to exceed the original program by CFAF 17 billion (0.9 percent of GDP). The
additional outlays reflect mainly unanticipated transfers to the National Social Security Fund
and additional spending room for priority programs created by lower interest payments
(CFAF 7 billion) partly related to the impact of MDRI. The latter is consistent with the
government’s commitment to strengthen programs aimed at boosting economic growth and
reducing poverty (in line with adopted medium term expenditure frameworks) including the
provision of free health services to children under age five and pregnant women. Accordingly
the proposed fiscal program will increase expenditure (excluding foreign-financed
investment) for education, health, and rural sector development. Foreign-financed projects
are expected to increase significantly, especially those financed by grants, reflecting ongoing
efforts to strengthen execution capacity.
20.
The proposed fiscal program is fully financed. With a planned reduction in domestic
arrears of CFAF 15.2 billion (0.8 percent of GDP), the overall cash deficit (excluding
foreign-financed investment) is projected at CFAF 80.5 billion (4.1 percent of GDP). Taking
into account identified external budget support of CFAF 73.8 billion (mainly from the World
Bank, European Union, African Development Bank, France, and Belgium), net domestic
financing (excluding financing by the Fund) is targeted at CFAF 6.7 billion (0.3 percent of
GDP). While this is higher than the CFAF 1.8 billion initially programmed, cumulative
domestic financing from January 2006 through December 2007 will be lower than originally
envisaged under the program.
Reforms in customs/tax administration and public expenditure management
21.
The revenue mobilization effort will be based on the implementation of the reforms
under way at the Customs and Tax Departments. Concerning the Custom Department,
priority will be given to: (i) more efficient use of data shared electronically by the two border
posts of Torody and Gaya and those of Niamey, where the custom operations are conducted;
(ii) full migration to the Sydonia ++ computer system for the Torody office and the offices in
the interior of the country; (iii) the gradual electronic interconnection between regional
custom offices and those at the border so as to better monitor customs declarations at the
destination centers; (iv) improving the monitoring of goods in transit and in tax free

36
warehouses through electronic interconnection between the two Niamey customs offices and
the headquarter of customs; (v) streamlining the list of certified customs commissioners to
ensure only professionally licensed are allowed to conduct business with customs;
(vi) strengthening control at the unloading harbors of goods destined to Niger, with the full
utilization of shipment documentation of shippers; and (vii) reinforcing the monitoring of
exemptions, while imposing strict limitation on exemptions for certain food and petroleum
products.
22.
Regarding the Tax Department, key measures are: (i) the full use of the analysis
carried out by the research and investigation unit on the suppliers and clients of taxpaying
enterprises; (ii) replacing cumbersome monthly declarations with a simplified tax regime
with quarterly tax declarations for the small and medium-sized enterprises (performance
criterion for end-December 2007); (iii) strengthening joint controls by customs and tax
departments on companies benefiting from exemptions, and the follow-up of the use of
exempted products; (iv) linking electronically the headquarters office with provincial offices;
(v) updating the file of taxpayers under the Large Taxpayers Unit to enterprises consistently
with the threshold of CFAF 100 million turnover (structural benchmark for end-March
2007); and (vi) continuation of on site controls by the unit of small and medium-sized
enterprises in order to ensure the filing of tax declarations.
23.
The strengthening of public expenditure management will continue on a number of
key fronts: (i) the strengthening of budget preparation, with full integration with the mediumterm expenditure framework; (ii) the strengthening of the expenditure monitoring at the
commitment, liquidation, payment order and payment stages, with particular attention to
priority expenditure; (iii) streamlining budget procedures and regulations so as to avoid
delays in budget execution; (v) the strengthening of ex-ante and ex-post controls (financial
comptrollers, finance inspectors, auditor court) through recruitment and training; (vi) the
reduction of delays in the establishment of treasury accounts and the preparation of the
budget execution laws.
24.
Specific measures in public expenditure management are: (i) the publication of
reports on budgetary execution (on a payment order basis, and including the priority
programs under unified list) initially on a semiannual basis, and on a quarterly basis from
end-2007. The publication of the budgetary execution in 2006 before end-March 2007 will
constitute a structural benchmark; (ii) completion of the computerization of the decentralized
budget offices (centres de sous-ordonnancement); (iii) establishment before end-June 2007
of the consolidated balance of treasury accounts at end-2002, including the balances
preceding 1997 (a performance criterion); (iv) the reduction of the number of deposit
accounts at the Treasury, with the closing of inactive accounts and of those which present
debit balances. The closing of the debit accounts will take place before end-June 2007
(structural benchmark).
C. Money, Credit and Financial Sector Reforms
25.
In 2007, monetary policy will continue to be conducted at the regional level with the
objective of containing inflation and maintaining adequate level of reserves. Credit to the
economy is expected to grow at a healthy rate of some 7.7 percent while the growth of credit

37
to government will remain modest. Net foreign assets are projected to increase modestly.
Accordingly, broad money growth is projected at about 6.0 percent.
26.
The government will continue to advance financial sector reforms in 2007. The offer
for sale of CDN will be launched before end-February 2007, based on the expression of
investor interest that is expected by end-December 2006. FinaPoste will also become
operational in early 2007. Regarding the two largest microfinance institutions that are in
financial difficulties, the government will implement a restructuring plan with assistance
from development partners. Further, the microfinance regulatory agency will be provided
with adequate human and material resources to effectively exercise its functions.
D. External Debt Sustainability and Management
27.
The government will continue to pursue a prudent external debt strategy following the
debt relief obtained under the MDRI. The implications of the MDRI on external debt
sustainability will be fully incorporated into our revised poverty reduction strategy which
will include a plan for utilizing the debt relief in a manner most effective to reach the
Millennium Development Goals. To preserve the benefits of the MDRI, the government will
continue to contract debt only with a grant element of at least 50 percent in 2007. To ensure
the implementation of this policy, the Department of Debt at the Ministry of Economy and
Finance has been further strengthened, with assistance from donors, through training of staff
and the provision of equipments.
E. Other Structural Reforms and PRSP Issues
28.
The government reaffirms its commitment to adopting the PRSP as the unique vehicle
for mobilizing donor support to assist us in achieving the MDGs. We are in the process of
updating the PRSP for 2007–09, with participation by a cross section of Nigerien society and
development partners. The revised PRSP takes into account, inter alia, the results of recently
completed surveys to update Niger’s poverty indicators. Further, the relationship between the
sectoral strategies, the medium expenditure frameworks, and economic growth was analyzed
with assistance from the World Bank and the UNDP. The revised PRSP is expected to be
finalized before end-November 2006 and will be submitted then to a national conference for
validation. It will be submitted to the national assembly by December 2006. We will be
convening a roundtable conference in early 2007, at which we will be seeking commitment
of financial and technical assistance from our development partners. In the meantime, the
government has issued the annual progress report on the implementation of the PRSP during
2004-2005.
29.
On petroleum pricing, the government will implement the monthly pricing
mechanism for retail petroleum products in accordance with the decree of August 2001. In
case world fuel prices decline in the future, government will not reduce domestic retail
petroleum prices until deferred revenue during July-September 2006 is fully recovered. In
case of an emergency situation that would require the review of this policy, the government
will consult with the Fund concerning the adoption of appropriate measures.

38
IV. PROGRAM MONITORING
30.
Program monitoring will be based on six-monthly and continuous quantitative
performance criteria, structural performance criteria, including continuous structural
performance criteria, and on indicative targets and structural benchmarks (Tables 1b and 2b).
The definitions of performance criteria and benchmarks are provided in the Technical
Memorandum of Understanding (TMU; Attachment II). Program ceilings on domestic
financing (excluding the position vis-à-vis the IMF) will be adjusted for deviations in
external budget support relative to program projections. This will allow the smooth
implementation of poverty reducing outlays, and, in the case of higher than projected
external budget support, permit a faster implementation of these programs. In case of
shortfalls relative to projections in external budget support, the quarterly ceilings on net
domestic financing will be adjusted upward by a maximum of CFAF 15 billion. In case of
higher than projected external budget support, the quarterly ceilings on net domestic
financing will not be adjusted downward up to CFAF 5 billion. The fourth review under the
program is expected to be completed by end-May 2007, the fifth review by end-November
2007, and the sixth review before the arrangement expires.

APPENDIX I—ATTACHMENT II
NIGER: TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
Niamey, December 6, 2006

1.
This technical memorandum of understanding updates the definitions of the
quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets for Niger’s program under the
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement approved by the Executive
Board in January 2005 Country Report 05/79. The quantitative performance criteria and
indicative targets for December 2006, March 2007, June 2007, September 2007 and
December 2007 are set out in Table 1 attached to the government’s memorandum of
economic and financial policies (MEFP) dated December 6, 2006. The memorandum also
sets out the data-reporting requirements for monitoring the program.
I. DEFINITION OF TERMS
2.
For the purpose of this technical memorandum, the following definitions of “debt,”
“government,” “payments arrears,” and “government obligations” will be used:
(a)
As specified in point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with
Respect to Foreign Debt adopted by the Executive Board of the IMF on August 24,
2000, debt will be understood to mean a current, that is, not contingent, liability,
created under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the form of
assets (including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one or
more payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some future
point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities
incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones
being as follows: (i) loans, that is, advances of money to the obligor by the lender
made on the basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future
(including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans, and buyers’ credits) and
temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized loans, under
which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay interest, by
repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as repurchase
agreements and official swap arrangements); (ii) suppliers’ credits, that is, contracts
where the supplier permits the obligor to defer payments until some time after the
date on which the goods are delivered or services are provided; and (iii) leases, that
is, arrangements under which property is provided that the lessee has the right to use
for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the total
expected service life of the property, while the lessor retains the title to the property.

44
For the purpose of the guideline, the debt is the present value (at the inception of the
lease) of all lease payments expected to be made during the period of the agreement,
excluding those payments that cover the operation, repair, or maintenance of the
property. Under the definition of debt set out above, arrears, penalties, and judicially
awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual
obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation
that is not considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not
give rise to debt. The external debt excludes treasury bills and bonds issued in
CFA francs on the regional financial market of the West African Economic and
Monetary Union (WAEMU).
(b)
Government refers to the central government of the Republic of Niger; it
does not include any political subdivision, the central bank, or any governmentowned entity with a separate legal personality.
(c)
External payments arrears are external payments due but not paid.
Domestic payments arrears are domestic payments due but not paid, including reste
á payer at the Treasury that are over 120 days overdue.
(d)
Government obligation is any financial obligation of the government
verified as such by the government (including any government debt).
II. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
A. Net Domestic Financing of the Government
Definition of the performance criterion
3.
Net domestic financing of the government is defined as the sum of (i) net bank
credit to the government, as defined below; (ii) net nonbank domestic financing of the
government (including government securities issued in CFA francs on the WAEMU
regional financial market and not held by resident commercial banks) proceeds from the sale
of government assets, and privatization receipts net of the cost of structural reforms to
which these proceeds are earmarked.
4.
Net bank credit to the government is defined as the balance of the government’s
claims and debts vis-à-vis national banking institutions. Government claims include cash
holdings by the Nigerien Treasury, deposits with the central bank and commercial banks, and
secured obligations. Government debt to the banking system includes debt vis-à-vis the
central bank (excluding net financing from the IMF’s Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF), but including government securities) and to commercial banks (including
government securities), and deposits with the postal checking system.
5.
The scope of the net bank credit to the government as defined by the BCEAO
includes all central government administrations. The net bank credit to the government and
the net amounts of government treasury bills and bonds issued in CFA francs on the regional
financial market of the WAEMU are calculated by the BCEAO, and nonbank financing is

45
calculated by the Nigerien Treasury, whose figures are those deemed valid within the context
of the program.
6.
Nonbank net domestic financing includes : (i) the change in the amount of
government bonds issued in the regional WAEMU market and not held by Niger’s
commercial banks; (ii) the change in the deposits of Treasury correspondents; (iii) the change
in “comptes de consignations” at the Treasury.
7.
The target for end-December 2006 is based on the variation of stock in net bank
credit to the government from December 31, 2005; the 2007 quarterly targets are based on
the variation of stock in net bank credit to the government from December 31, 2006 to the
date considered for the performance criterion or the indicative target.
Adjustment
8.
The quarterly ceilings on net domestic financing will be subject to adjustments if
disbursements of external budgetary support (including IMF financing under the PRGF) less
external debt service and arrears payments exceed or fall short of projected amounts.
External budgetary support includes resources freed up under the MDRI. The adjustor for
end-December 2006 will be based on external budgetary assistance calculated from January
1, 2006. For 2007, external budget support is calculated from January 1, 2007.
9.
In the event disbursements exceed projected budgetary assistance by up to a limit of
CFAF 5 billion, the quarterly ceilings on net domestic financing will not be adjusted
downward. If disbursements exceed programmed budgetary assistance by more than
CFAF 5 billion, the ceilings on net domestic financing will be adjusted downward pro tanto
by the amount of the excess disbursements beyond the CFAF 5 billion.
10.
In the event disbursements fall short of projected external budgetary assistance, the
quarterly ceilings on net domestic financing for end-December 2006 and for 2007 will be
raised by a maximum of CFAF 15 billion.
11.
Niger’s HIPC Initiative-generated debt-service savings will continue to be transferred
to a central bank account and used to finance new poverty reduction programs that have been
approved in the budget law and are in line with the poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP).
Reporting requirement
12.
Detailed data on domestic financing to government will be provided monthly within
six weeks following the end of each month.
Reduction of Domestic Payments Arrears on Government Obligations
Definition of the performance criterion
13.
Domestic payments arrears are constituted by: (i) arrears identified at end-1999 on
the basis of the audit conducted by the Ministry of Finance in 2005; (ii) the restes à payer at
the Treasury (Treasury float) outstanding at end-2005 and not paid by end-September 2006.
The stock of arrears will be reduced by the amounts indicated in Table 1 annexed to the

46
MEFP. The objective for end –December 2006 is expressed in term of the change in the
stock of arrears from end-December 2005. The quarterly objectives for 2007 are expressed in
terms of changes of the stock of arrears from end-December 2006 to the end of each quarter
in 2007.
14.
The Centre d’Amortissement de la Dette Intérieure de l’Etat (CADDIE) and the
Treasury are responsible for calculating the stock of domestic arrears, and recording their
repayments.
Reporting requirement
15.
Monthly data on the outstanding balance (by creditor), accumulation (including reste
á payer at the Treasury), and repayment of domestic payments arrears on government
obligations will be provided monthly within six weeks following the end of each month.
B. Nonaccumulation of External Payments Arrears
Definition of the performance criterion
16.
Government debt is outstanding debt owed or guaranteed by the government. Under
the program, the government undertakes not to accumulate external payments arrears on
government debt (including treasury bills and bonds issued in CFA francs on the WAEMU
regional financial market), with the exception of external payments arrears arising from
government debt being renegotiated with creditors, including Paris Club creditors.
Reporting requirement
17.
Detailed data on the outstanding balance, accumulation, and repayment of external
payments arrears will be provided monthly within six weeks following the end of each
month.
C. External Nonconcessional Loans Contracted or Guaranteed
by the Government of Niger
Definition of the performance criterion
18.
The government will not contract or guarantee external debt with original maturity of
one year or more with a grant element of less than 50 percent. Nonconcessional external debt
is defined as all debt with a concessionality level of less than 50 percent. To calculate the
level of concessionality for loans with a maturity of at least 15 years, the discount rate to be
used is the ten-year average commercial interest reference rate (CIRR), calculated by the
IMF on the basis of the rates published by the OECD; for loans of less than 15 years, the
six-month average CIRR is to be used.
19.
This performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined in point 9 of the
Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Dept adopted on August 24,
2000, but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been
received. However, this performance criterion does not apply to financing provided by the

47
Fund, to debt rescheduling in the form of new loans, and to treasury notes and bonds issued
in CFA francs on the WAEMU regional financial market.
Reporting requirement
20.
Details on any external government debt will be provided monthly within four weeks
following the end of each month. The same requirement applies to guarantees extended by
the central government.
D. Short-Term External Debt of the Central Government
Definition of the performance criterion
21.
The government will not contract or guarantee external debt with original maturity of
less than one year. This performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined in point 9 of
the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt adopted on
August 24, 2000, but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not
been received. Excluded from this performance criterion are short-term, import-related trade
credits and short-term treasury notes issued in CFA francs on the regional financial market.
Reporting requirement
22.
Details on any external government debt will be provided monthly within six weeks
following the end of each month. The same requirement applies to guarantees extended by
the central government.
E. Pricing of Petroleum Products
Definition of the performance criterion
23.
The government will continuously implement the monthly pricing mechanism for
retail petroleum products in accordance with the decree of August 2001. From June 2006 and
onwards, in case international oil prices decline, domestic retail prices for petroleum products
will be adjusted downward only after all deferred taxes during July-September 2006 have
been collected. Otherwise, the pricing mechanism established under the decree of August
2001 will be implemented without changes in tax rates or deferment in taxes and margin
payments to the oil importing company. In case of an emergency situation that would require
the review of this policy, the government will consult with the Fund concerning the adoption
of appropriate measures.
III. INDICATIVE TARGETS
A. Definitions
24.
Total revenue is an indicative target for the program. It includes tax, nontax, and
special accounts revenue, but excludes revenue from the settlement of reciprocal debts
between the government and enterprises.

48
25.
The civil service wage bill is another indicative target of the program. Wage bill data
are provided by the budgetary accounts and exclude the salaries paid for the reinstatement of
former rebellion members, the medical and training indemnities, the contributions from the
budget to the national retirement fund, and the wage refunds. The wage bill includes cash
vouchers.
26.
The basic fiscal deficit is defined as the difference between total expenditure
(excluding foreign-financed investment, but including HIPC-financed investment) and
domestic revenue as defined in paragraph 23.
27.
The government undertakes not to accumulate any new domestic payments arrears on
government debt as defined in paragraph 2c above. Thus the amount of the restes à payer at
the Treasury of more than 120 days will not increase in the period from end-December 2005
and end-December 2006, and, similarly, will not increase during the periods from
end-December 2006 to end-March, end-June, end-September and end-December 2007.
B. Reporting Requirement
28.
This information will be provided to the IMF monthly within six weeks following the
end of each month.

IX.

Safeguards Assessments:

The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is the common central bank of the
countries of the West African Economic and Monetary Union. A new safeguards assessment
of the BCEAO was completed on November 4, 2005. The assessment found that progress has
been made in strengthening the BCEAO’s safeguards framework of the bank since 2002
when the last safeguards assessment took place.
The BCEAO now publishes a full set of audited financial statements and improvements have
been made to move financial reporting closer to International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS). Furthermore, an internal audit charter has been put in place, mechanisms have been
established to improve risk management and risk prevention, and follow-up on internal and
external audit recommendations has been strengthened.
The new assessment identified a number of areas where further steps would help solidify the
progress made. The main recommendations relate to improvements in the external audit
process (including the adoption of a formal rotation policy), further enhancement of the
transparency of the financial statements by fully adopting IFRS, and further strengthening of
the effectiveness of the internal audit function.
X.

Exchange Arrangements:

Niger is a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). The
exchange system, common to all members of the WAEMU, is free of restrictions on the
making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. The WAEMU’s
common currency, the CFA franc, is pegged to the French franc. On January 12, 1994, the
CFA franc was devalued by 50 percent in foreign currency terms, and the exchange rate was
adjusted from CFAF 50 = F 1 to CFAF 100 = F 1. Effective December 31, 1998, the parity
was switched to the Euro at a rate of CFAF 655.96 = EUR 1. On September 30, 2006, the
rate of the CFA franc in SDR terms was SDR 1 = CFAF 764.96.
XI.

Article IV Consultation:

Niger is on the 24-month consultation cycle, and the last Article IV consultation discussions were
held in Niamey in April 2004, and discussed by the Executive Board on June 28, 2004.

56
Appendix III. Niger: Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of October 30, 2006)
Partnership in Niger’s development strategy
1.
Niger’s poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP), which was adopted in January 2002,
presents a thorough poverty diagnosis and identifies key development challenges. The
Government reconfirmed the main thrust of the PRSP through a second progress report. Bank
and Fund staff prepared a Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) which was discussed at the IMF
Board in January 2005 and distributed to the Bank’s Board in March 2005. The PRSP
outlines a strategy for poverty reduction centered on four strategic pillars: (i) a
macroeconomic framework ensuring economic and financial stability while promoting
sustainable economic growth; (ii) the development of productive sectors, especially in rural
areas; (iii) the development of basic social services; and (iv) the promotion of good
governance and the strengthening of human and institutional capacities. The Government has
begun using the PRSP to improve coordination of development efforts in the country,
including donor-supported activities.
2.
At a donors’ forum in Niamey on June 7 and 8, 2003, donors reaffirmed their
endorsement of the PRSP as a strategic anchor for their assistance, and agreed on a
progressive shift from project to program financing, and the need for further coordination and
harmonization of policies and procedures. The forum resulted in the signing of a protocol
agreement by all donors to coordinate their aid to the education sector. The third (2004) and
the fourth (2005) PRSP Progress Report were transmitted to IMF and World Bank in October
2006. Comments provided by IMF, EU, UNDP and WB in December 2005 were
incorporated. Due to delays in launching the preparation of analytical background papers, the
Government is behind schedule in the preparation of its second PRSP, which is expected to
be finalized by end-December 2006. The PRSP Secretariat is planning to visit Washington
for technical discussions on the second PRSP after circulation of a draft which is expected by
end-November 2006. The World Bank has mobilized a PRSP trust fund to support the
preparation of the revised PRSP together with a trust fund intended to integrate Gender issues
into the strategy.
Areas in which the Bank leads
3.
Privatization and regulatory reform. Key utility sectors, such as telecommunications
and water supply have been liberalized and privatized with support from an IDA credit.
However, the privatization of the electricity company (NIGELEC) has been delayed mainly
due to the difficulty in finding private companies ready to invest US$60-100 million required
for expansion and rehabilitation of the power system. The privatization of the whole sale
petroleum product distribution company (SONIDEP) has failed in part because of difficulties
in finding sound foreign private partners interested in investing in Niger. With the Bank’s
assistance, the authorities revisited their objectives and approach to the private provision of
infrastructure as they seek to enhance corporate governance for selected state owned
companies (NIGELEC, SONIDEP) and create a Government unit to implement the necessary

57
reforms. The Fund is also a key partner in the policy dialogue in this area, for example
through the continuous implementation of a petroleum pricing system.
4.
Rural development. The Bank has provided support to Niger to develop and
implement a comprehensive rural development strategy. This strategy aims at mitigating
vulnerability and stimulating income generation and is centered on three pillars:
(i) improving the access of rural populations to economic opportunities; (ii) protecting rural
populations against risks, improving food security, and managing natural resources in
sustainable; and (iii) enhancing the capacity of public institutions and rural organizations to
improve the management of the rural sector. An action plan covering the 14 programs of the
rural development strategy have been adopted by Decree in October 2006. The transition to a
budget-program approach for the rural sector was finally completed with the adoption in
October 2006, by Decree, of a rural sector MTEF regrouping four line ministries. Bank
assistance in this sector is provided through ongoing operations directly linked to the rural
strategy, including: the Private Irrigation Project II, which aims at increasing production and
profitability of high-value, irrigated crops by private, smallholder farmers with simple, lowcost technologies; the Emergency Locust Project aiming at reducing Niger’s vulnerability to
future desert locust infestations by supporting improved strategies for prevention (through
early warning systems, reactions), and mitigation at both the national and regional levels; and
the Community Action Program, which supports decentralized local financing mechanisms
for village groups and communes, and promotes an integrated community-based ecosystem
management.
5.
Education sector. Within the framework of the Fast track Initiative (FTI), Government
has prepared a ten-year development plan in the education sector (PDDE) for 2003-2013 in
collaboration with the Bank and donors. The key objectives of the government program,
which focuses mainly on primary education, are: (i) increasing access to both formal and
non-formal basic education, in particular for children in rural areas, girls, and the poor;
(ii) improving the quality and relevance of education; and (iii) developing capacities for the
strategic and operational management of the sector at both the central and regional levels and
increasing responsibilities assumed at the community level. The preparation of a
post-primary education program is also underway and will help define a strategic framework
to ensure sustainable expansion of the secondary and other segments of the system as a
response to the growing demands from the primary education leavers. The Bank’s ongoing
investment lending operation (Basic Education Project of US$30 million) supports
improvement in access of the poor to social services, which is one of the strategic pillars of
the PRSP, In addition, the first Development Policy Loan (the Rural and Social Reform
Credit, RSRC-I) approved in June 2006 is helping the government to (i) implement reforms
to increase access of the population to basic education of acceptable quality; (ii) improve
personnel management and allocations; and (iii) fostering governance and accountability
through information sharing and empowering the community in the education sector. In the
context of the FTI, the Bank facilitated the establishment of a Pooled Fund supplied by
several donors to finance the PDDE. This Pooled Fund is currently frozen following findings
of an audit which revealed mismanagement of resources. Government is taking measures to
remove this suspension by early 2007.

58
6.
Health sector. The Bank has worked with Government on the preparation of the
Strategic Orientations for Health Sector Development. In 2002, Government adopted a tenyear health policy strategy (2002-2011). Its main objectives are to further improve access to
health services facilities (from 47 percent in 2000 to 80 percent in 2011) and to reduce the
incidence of infectious diseases, by promoting new approaches, including preventive action.
With a view to make this strategy more operational, Government adopted a five-year
development plan for the sector in January 2006. In the same month, the Bank approved a
health SWAP of US$35 million which includes reproductive health and malaria components.
The RSRC series are helping Government consolidate and enhance health sector reforms by:
(i) strengthening human resources management by recruiting 715 qualified agents in 2006;
(ii) improving budget execution to ensure sufficient resources are available to finance priority
spending; and (iii) reforming the cost-recovery scheme to improve health care accessibility.
7.
Population. Niger’s ability to reduce poverty levels and to meet the MDGs is
constrained by its high rate of population growth, estimated at 3.3 percent per annum.
Government recently acknowledged the need to manage demographic dynamics. In 2004
Government created a new Ministry of Population and Social Action. Recently it has revised
the 1992 National Population Policy, which is an important step towards developing an
articulated national program. At the government’s request, a multi-sector demographics
operation is under preparation by the Bank to address the challenge of rapid population
growth. The Government is also planning to launch a communication and sensitization
strategy to build national consensus on issues related to improving the status and protection
of women and to reduce fertility rates. In this context, the RSRC series will support:
(i) launching information and awareness campaigns on premature marriage and family
planning; and (ii) implementing action plans relative to improving the status of women,
including organization of national forum to build consensus..
8.
Poverty monitoring. The Bank worked closely with Government in preparing a
poverty profile that served as the basis for the PRSP poverty diagnosis. While this diagnosis
was judged as thorough and comprehensive by the Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN), it is
based on household survey data from 1993. Updating the existing database is therefore a
priority of the Government. A nationwide census was recently completed, and preparation of
a new household survey, to be partially funded by the government and the Bank, is scheduled
to be launched in April 2007. A Demographic and Health survey is under finalization and the
2005 Bank financed Core Welfare Indicators Survey (CWIQ) was completed in May 2006
with a validation workshop held in Niamey. It provides updated social indicators which are
needed for the PRSP update and assessment of progress towards PRSP targets. The Bank,
together with other donors, is also advising the authorities on strengthening institutional
arrangements for the monitoring and the evaluation of poverty in the context of the PRSP. In
addition, the Bank has financed the revision of the 2001 Participatory Poverty Assessment
(PPA) as a contribution to Government’s efforts to update and strengthen the knowledge base
on poverty and social development.
Areas where Bank and Fund share the lead
9.
Poverty reduction strategy. Together with other external development partners, the
Bank and Fund have jointly provided assistance to Government in the preparation of its

59
PRSP. Since its completion, both institutions have jointly advised the authorities on the
refinement and implementation of the strategy. The four progress reports on the
implementation of the PRSP have been prepared with the assistance of the Bank and the
Fund and other development partners.
10. Debt sustainability. In April 2005, the Executive Boards of the Bank and Fund
endorsed a joint framework for debt sustainability analysis (DSA) in low income countries. A
joint Bank/Fund DSA under this framework was completed in September 2005. The DSA
indicates that Niger’s risk of debt distress remains high in spite of the significant debt
reduction achieved in the context of the HIPC Initiative and the MDRI. The results of the
DSA show that Niger’s debt situation: i) would worsen significantly in the event of shocks or
weaker economic performance, and ii) is particularly sensitive to the terms and composition
of external financing. Hence, the authorities need to pursue sound macroeconomic policies
and reforms, with particular focus on growth-enhancing measures, and prudent debt policies.
The urgent need to build technical and institutional capacity for debt management has been
stressed by the Bank and the Fund. Several measures aiming to strengthen the external debt
unit were implemented as structural benchmarks under the PRGF-supported programs. Bank
and Fund staffs have also supported the external evaluation of the use of HIPC resources
under the President Special Program. As agreed in the Bank’s Public Expenditure Reform
operation (PERCG), the government integrated HIPC resources into the human development
sectoral expenditures included in the 2006 Budget Law and is in the process of expanding
this to rural development expenditures following completion of the rural sector MTEF in
June 2006 and the elaboration of sector Program Budget.
11. Budgetary and public expenditure reforms. Strengthening public finances is a
prerequisite for success of Niger’s broader reform agenda. The Bank and Fund share the lead
in this area. Both institutions have played key roles in helping Government reduce domestic
and external arrears. While the Fund is leading the dialogue on revenue-enhancing measures,
the Bank is concentrating its efforts on budgetary reforms, in particular in the area of public
expenditure and cash management system. The Fund is also making key contributions to
improving budgetary processes: a number of important measures, such as preparation of
budget review laws and computerization of budgetary expenditure, have been included as
structural benchmarks in the PRGF arrangement. In 2004, the Bank prepared jointly with
Government, EU and France a comprehensive assessment of Niger’s Public Expenditure
Management Systems and Capacities (Public Expenditure Management and Financial
Accountability Review: PEMFAR). The Bank has supported budgetary reforms through four
adjustment operations (PEAC I, PEAC II, PERCG and the ongoing RSRC I). Consolidating
and deepening these reforms (based on the PEMFAR priority action plan) is a critical
objective of the RSRC I which was approved by the Board in June 2006. The Country
Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) was updated in 2004.
12. Financial sector reform. Government launched a comprehensive financial sector
reform program in 2002. Supported by the Financial Sector Technical Assistance Loan
approved in February 2004, the program covers the regulatory and legal environment, the
banking sector, micro-finance, postal financial services and social security. Some progress
has already been realized. Two commercial banks, BCN and BINCI and three insurance

60
companies were restructured and recapitalized. Audits of all major micro-finance institutions
have been completed. Restructuring plans for the post office have been designed and staff
reduction has started. In the next two to three years, measures will be taken to improve the
legal and judicial environment (modification of legislation for the issuing of land titles,
improvement of the legal framework for the taking of guarantees, training of magistrates,
etc.). The Housing Bank (CDN) should be either privatized or liquidated by end December
2006; the Community Lending Bank (CPCT) should be restructured. Micro-finance
institutions will be restructured on the basis of the results of the audits, and the supervisory
unit at the Ministry of Finance and Economy will be strengthened by the creation of a
Microfinance Institutions Regulation Authority by end December 2006. The post office was
split into two entities in 2005, Niger Post, for pure mail transactions, and FinaPoste, a
financial services affiliate. Finally, an actuarial audit was conducted of the CNSS, the social
security institution.
13. Civil service reform and decentralization. The reform and modernization of the civil
service is an important element of Niger’s PRSP, yet there has been little progress in this area
so far. The authorities are currently making an effort to put in place an integrated civil
service database. By allowing a more transparent and effective management of the civil
service, this database should improve control over the wage bill. Controlling the wage bill is
important for maintaining fiscal balance, as recognized by the previous PRGF arrangement,
which had set quantitative benchmarks for the wage bill. The planning for the
implementation of the legal framework for the political decentralization of 1996 has recently
gained momentum. The first local elections took place on July 24, 2004. However, important
concerns regarding this reform remain, such as the lack of capacity at the local level and the
fiscal implications of decentralization. To help Government address some of these concerns,
the Community Action Program and the forthcoming Local Urban Infrastructure
Development Project will help build capacities in rural communities in planning,
implementing, and monitoring micro-development projects.
Areas in which the Fund leads
14. Macroeconomic management. The main objectives of Niger’s macroeconomic
program, as stated in the PRSP, are to ensure economic and financial stability while
promoting sustainable and robust growth. The Fund is supporting this program through its
PRGF framework by providing financial and technical assistance, as well as through
dialogue on macroeconomic policy reforms. The program has made satisfactory progress
since approval of the first PRGF arrangement in 2000 by achieving most of its benchmarks
and overall positive fiscal performance. A second PRGF was approved in January 2005 and
two reviews were successfully completed to date. In the context of the macroeconomic
framework underlying the PRSP, the Bank has provided technical assistance in building
capacity in the Ministry of Finance and Economy to monitor economic performance;
elaborate MTEF and Program Budget in key sectoral ministries (Education, Health ad rural
Development); and macroeconomic modeling.
15. Fiscal policy. Fiscal consolidation is a key objective of the PRGF and is supported by a
number of performance criteria and benchmarks. Increasing budgetary revenue in order to

61
progressively lower the Government’s reliance on external assistance is particularly
important, given Niger’s low level of revenues, compared with regional partners in
WAEMU. In terms of expenditures, the Fund is mainly concerned with overall budget
envelopes, while the Bank focuses on inter and intrasectoral allocations and protection of key
expenditure items in Education, Health and Rural Development.
16. Monetary policy. The Fund leads the policy dialogue on monetary policy, which is set
by the regional monetary authorities (BCEAO).
World Bank Group Strategy
17. The Bank’s most recent Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) covered the period 2003 to
2005 and was approved by the Bank’s Board in January 2003. It supports the implementation
of the PRSP. A new CAS is under preparation and Board presentation is planned in the
Bank’s fiscal year 2007.
18. As of October 30, 2006, the World Bank lending portfolio in Niger consisted of nine
IDA active operations, with a total commitment of US$305 million, of which
US$127.5 million is undisbursed. IDA assistance has helped reduce the volatility in ODA by

compensating short-term declines in assistance from other partners. IDA has also been
responsive to exogenous shocks. For instance, an Africa Emergency Locust Project (AELP)
aiming at fighting the locust’s infestation in West Africa was delivered in FY05 and a Niger
Avian Influenza Control and Human Pandemic Preparedness and Response Activities
program is under preparation. A Health sector SWAP and the first Development Policy
Lending (Rural and Social Reform Credit–RSRC-I) were delivered in FY 06. Within a
medium-term framework, and building on the previous three budget support operations as
well as ongoing investment projects in agriculture, education, and health, the Rural and
Social Reform Credits series will focus on overcoming policy constraints and institutional
bottlenecks in: (i) public sector management; (ii) growth and agricultural development; and
(iii) human development, including demographic growth and gender issues. Pre-appraisal of
the Multi-sector Demographic Program is scheduled for November 2006.

19. The AAA program helps the Government in areas such as poverty analysis, gender,
population growth, sources of growth, and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The
AAA program also aims at reinforcing public sector capacity in pursuit of the PRSP’s
objectives and in preparing Niger to transition to consolidated programmatic lending. In
support of these objectives, sector work on population, rural development, public expenditure
management and financial accountability review (PEMFAR), CPAR, and Participatory
Poverty Assessment have been completed. A Country Economic Memorandum (CEM)
focusing on accelerating growth and achieving the MDGs in Niger is being finalized with
comments received from the government of Niger. For FY06/07, to help the Government
reduce vulnerability to food insecurity and develop a comprehensive social protection
strategy, the Bank is preparing a sector work on food security and social protection for Niger.
Finally, the Bank is preparing a Public Expenditure Tracking Survey (P.E.T.S.), initially in
the education and health sectors. The objectives of the P.E.T.S. is to improve the efficiency
of public spending in social sectors and enhance the social sector outcomes by tracking
leakages, execution rate, and delays of public spending as well as document the arrays of
administrative procedures.
20. The Bank is committed to enhancing external partnerships in the framework of the
Government’s current efforts to mobilize and coordinate donor support for PRSP
implementation. In addition to the strong partnership with the Fund, the Bank is collaborating
with a number of donors in different areas, including the European Union, the African
Development Bank (AfDB), the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), and key
bilateral donors.

Appendix IV. Joint Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis
1.
This debt sustainability is based on end-2005 data for external debt outstanding
provided by the Direction de la Dette for most creditors and staff estimates for debts
outstanding to IDA, the IMF, and the AfDB.12 The overall staff assessment is that Niger is at
a moderate risk of debt distress, although it remains vulnerable to a number of shocks.
2.
Following the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, Niger’s debt outlook shows
remarkable improvement over the short term, while trending upward during the
medium and long term.13 The NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio declined from 22 percent in 2005
to 7.9 percent in 2006 as a result of the MDRI, while the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio fell
from 136 percent in 2005 to 46 percent in 2006. However, Niger’s high financing
requirements, critical for promoting growth, will weigh heavily on the country’s debt
dynamics (Table 1b). Under the baseline scenario the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio is expected
to increase gradually to 22 percent in 2025, still lower than the policy-based indicative
threshold (40 percent); and the NPV of debt-to-export ratio would rise gradually to
107 percent by 2025, significantly below the 150 percent threshold. The increase tapers off in
the outer years and stabilizes close to 2021.
3.
Sensitivity tests show that Niger’s debt burden would worsen, in the event of an
adverse macroeconomic shock or weaker economic performance. If key variables remain
at the historical average of the previous eight years, the debt-to-exports ratio would rise to
120 percent in 2025. Also, a temporary reduction in export growth would have a pronounced
impact on the country’s debt indicators if the ensuing current account deficit had to be
covered by borrowing.
4.
Favorable terms on new borrowing are critical to maintaining debt
sustainability; thus, if interest on new loans increase by 2 percentage points, the NPV of the
debt-to-exports ratio would exceed modestly the indicative threshold, rising to 154 percent
by 2025.
5.
The results from the DSA underscore the need for the authorities to pursue
prudent debt policies combined with sound macroeconomic policies and reforms. These
should focus on growth-enhancing measures and investments, while continuing to seek
grants and highly concessional loans in order to mitigate the likelihood of debt distress. The
DSA suggests that although the risk of debt distress has declined with the granting of HIPC
and MDRI assistance, debt management needs to remain very vigilant, given the country’s
continuing vulnerability to external shocks. This vulnerability must be reduced with
sustained efforts to broaden the export base.
12

This analysis does not account for domestic debt, for which no reliable estimates exist and follows the
granting of MDRI assistance in 2005.

13

The indicative debt-burden thresholds for Niger are NPV of debt-to-exports ratio of 150 percent; NPV of
debt-to-GDP of 40 percent, and debt service to exports ratio of 20 percent.

64
Box 1. Baseline scenario assumptions
The baseline and alternative scenarios for 2006–25 is based on the following assumptions, which
are broadly consistent with those used in the HIPC Completion Point document:
•

Over the length of the projection period, real GDP growth is expected to rise from its
historical average of 2.7 percent to an average of 4.3 percent in 2006–09, and further to about
5 percent by 2025. This results from investments in irrigation and infrastructure, which
would raise productivity in the agriculture sector. This improvement, combined with
efforts to diversify the economy, including through the development of tourism, would
reduce vulnerability to macroeconomic shocks.

•

Average inflation, as measured by the implicit GDP deflator, would average at about
1.5 percent.

•

The revenue to GDP ratio is projected to rise gradually from 10.4 percent in 2005 to
12.6 percent by 2008 and to about 17 percent by 2025, reflecting the gradual convergence of
the tax revenue ratio to the 17 percent WAEMU norm.

•

Public expenditures, currently at 19.0 percent of GDP, would rise sharply to 23.0 percent by
2009, reflecting the authorities’ efforts to embark on major projects to promote growth.
However, it will eventually fall to about 20 percent of GDP over the longer term, as the
authorities make progress towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

•

Total exports of goods and services, which benefited from a temporary boost in gold exports
in 2005, are projected to grow at an annual average rate of 7.2 percent over 2009–25 in value,
spurred by the strengthening of uranium and non-mineral exports. Imports are projected to
grow at an annual average of 6.7 percent in value, broadly in line with nominal GDP growth.
These assumptions lead to an improvement in the non-interest current account deficit from an
average of 10.3 percent of GDP in 2006–10 to about 8.1 percent of GDP by 2025.

The baseline scenario assumes that half of total external financing needs (including project
assistance) will be covered by concessional loans with a 50 percent grant element, excluding the
borrowings from the IMF, while the remaining financial requirements are met by grants and netFDI. Two alternative scenarios are considered; the first is based on borrowing at average
historical terms; the second assumes that borrowing is made at less favorable terms (interest rates
higher by 2 percent).

Appendix V. Niger: Statistical Issues
(As of November 28, 2006)
1.
While the economic database is broadly adequate for surveillance and programming
purposes, there are deficiencies in the statistical system that complicate the monitoring of
certain economic developments. The common indicators for surveillance are generally
provided to the Fund on a timely basis. Weaknesses mainly affect the national accounts and
the public finance statistics. Niger participates in the General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS), and its metadata were posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin
Board on February 26, 2002. The metadata refer to January 2003 and need to be updated.
Metadata for the health and population data categories have not been updated since June
2001, and there are no plans for improvement for the poverty and education data categories.
As a follow-up to GDDS participation, STA technical assistance (funded by the Japanese
government) is being offered to eight member countries of the Western African Economic
and Monetary Union (WAEMU) to assist with implementation of plans for the improvement
of their statistical systems. A Fund regional statistical advisor initiated a program of
assistance in government finance statistics, which is now managed by the West Africa
Regional Technical Assistance Center (AFRITAC West). A real sector statistics
improvement program, conducted in collaboration with the regional statistical office
AFRISTAT and initiated in May 2002, is currently being implemented.
2.
A mission visited Niamey in March 2005 to prepare the data module of the Report on
the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC). It carried out a review of data
dissemination practices against the GDDS, as well as an in-depth assessment of the quality of
national accounts, consumer price, monetary, balance of payments and government finance
statistics. The data ROSC, which was published on June 9, 2006, found that: (i) Niger does
not meet the recommendations of the GDDS for timeliness of all data categories;
(ii) improvements need to be made in data coverage (especially national accounts by
institutional sectors), periodicity (especially quarterly government financial statistics), and
timeliness (especially national accounts, government finance statistics, balance of payments);
and (iii) plans for improvement in these areas should address resource constraints, reinforce
the legal framework for data collection and coordination, and clarify the responsibilities for
dissemination of government operations and public debt data.
3.
Law No 2004-011 of March 2004 transformed the Statistical and National Accounts
Directorate of the Ministry of Economy and Finance into a National Statistical Office (INS),
and created a new unit responsible for statistical coordination, the National Council on
Statistics. Both the institute and the council initiated operations in June 2005.
Real sector
4.
Niger participates in WAEMU’s harmonization of statistical methodologies through
the multilateral surveillance process, currently seeking regional improvements in the area of
national accounts. Ongoing work on overhauling the national accounts and the resulting

69
change in the base year are based on the recommendations of the ROSC mission and
technical assistance from AFRISTAT. Under the GDDS project for the AFRITAC West
countries, a statistical register and an industrial production index are being developed, and a
series of missions are scheduled to assist in the implementation of the System of National
Accounts, 1993 (SNA 1993).
5.
While the national accounts compilation generally follows best methodological
practice, the data ROSC found that some gaps remain for the full adoption of the SNA 1993.
In addition, national accounts data originate mainly from administrative sources, with many
shortcomings, and the household and informal sector surveys are not up-to-date. This paucity
of data sources has compelled compilers to use some questionable statistical techniques.
GDP is estimated using the production and expenditure approaches, but is based on largely
obsolete ratios for many line items. In the absence of appropriate price indices, deflators are
mostly derived from the Harmonized Consumer Price Index (HCPI). GDP validation
possibilities are limited because the same calculation methods are used for estimates and
final data. Efforts are being made to improve and widen data collection procedures, and
reduce delays in data dissemination. Other actions, as indicated in the February 2004April 2005 AFRITAC West Work Program, are the redevelopment of the industrial
production index, development of a statistical register, and production of a CPI with national
coverage.
6.
The new WAEMU’s HPCI was introduced in January 1998. However, the coverage is
limited to Niamey, the weights are based on a household budget survey conducted during
only three months in 1996. As noted, work is under way to revise the HPCI.
Public finances
7.
Monthly government finance statistics are compiled by the Ministry of Economy and
Finance (MEF) with a one- to three-month lag, based on information provided by the budget,
customs, tax, and treasury directorates. The MEF prepares a monthly reconciliation of
spending commitments made by the budget directorate and payments made by the treasury,
but the data are not disseminated to the general public. Data are limited to the operation of
the budgetary central government, that is covering the general budget, special funds, and
operations of the treasury special accounts. They do not cover the social security
administration. No final budget or treasury accounts are published at the end of the fiscal
year.
8.
Following their participation in the AFRITAC-WEST seminar on the GFSM 2001,
held in Lomé, Togo in November 2005, MEF has approved a strategy for migrating from the
methodology of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 1986 (GFSM 1986) to the new
GFSM 2001. No data are reported for publication in International Financial Statistics (IFS)
Monetary data
9.
The monetary statistics are generally based on the Guide to Money and Banking
Statistics in IFS (1984 Guide), but use an incomplete sectorization of assets and liabilities.

70
Implementation of the new Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM) has started,
but without a precise timetable. The source data for monetary statistics are generally reliable,
though they may be reported late. However, the free circulation of banknotes within
countries of the zone complicates the estimation of currency in circulation. Preliminary
monetary data are compiled by the national agency of the Central Bank of West African
States (BCEAO) and released officially by BCEAO headquarters. There has been an
improvement in the timeliness of data provided on interest rates, monetary institutions, and
deposit money banks. The authorities are now reporting monetary data to STA on a regular
basis, with a reduction in the lag from about six months to about three to four months. Most
of the key monetary statistical issues have been resolved.
10.
A monetary and financial statistics mission visited BCEAO headquarters in Dakar in
May 2001. The mission reviewed the procedures for collecting and compiling monetary
statistics and addressed outstanding methodological issues that concern all the member
countries of the WAEMU. The mission also briefed the BCEAO authorities on the
methodology in the new MFSM and discussed the modalities for introducing an IFS areawide page for the WAEMU zone, which was subsequently introduced in the January 2003
issue of IFS.The reorganized website of the BCEAO entered in effect in late 2004 and allows
access to all publications of the central bank and statistical data.
11.
In August 2006, as part of the authorities’ efforts to implement the MFSM’s
methodology, the BCEAO reported to STA monetary data for June 2006 for all member
countries using Standardized Report Forms (1SR-central bank, 2SR-other depository
corporations, and 5SR-monetary aggregates). The data are being reviewed in STA.
Balance of payments data
12.
The balance of payments statistics are compiled in conformity with the Balance of
Payments Manual, Fifth Edition (BPM5). Since December 1998, the responsibility for
compiling and disseminating balance of payments statistics has been formally assigned to the
BCEAO by area-wide legislation adopted by the countries participating in the WAEMU. The
national agency of the BCEAO in Niamey is responsible for compiling and disseminating the
balance of payments statistics, and the BCEAO headquarters in Dakar for delineating the
methodology and calculating the international reserves managed on behalf of the
participating countries.
13.
Data consistency has significantly improved over the past few years, with a full
transition to the BPM5. The BCEAO national agency disseminates balance of payments
statistics with a seven month lag, exceeding GDDS guidelines. The BCEAO also compiles
and disseminates the annual data of the international investment position data with an
18-month lag.
14.
Further improvement in the data for services and transfers (especially workers’
remittances) will depend on the intensification of the contacts with reporting bodies.

71
Concerning the financial account, the foreign assets of the private nonbanking sector are still
not well covered, especially the assets of WAEMU residents, which are obtained through
partial surveys of residents’ foreign assets. The organization of an exhaustive annual survey
of foreign direct investment transactions is still at a very preliminary stage. The BCEAO has
recently updated the compilation of commercial bank data on payments involving
nonresidents (settlement reports). In principle, these settlement reports should be used to
produce a quarterly balance of payments. In practice, a tentative quarterly statement is
produced but not published, and these data are not used to produce annual balance of
payments estimates, but rather to assess existing information.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
December 20, 2006

The following information has become available sinde the issuance of the staff report for the
2006 Article IV Consultation and Third Review under the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility. The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged.
1.
Fiscal developments at end-September 2006 remained in line with program
objectives. Revenue performance was higher than programmed by the equivalent of
0.3 percent of GDP, while domestically financed expenditure remained below program by
0.9 percent of GDP. The revenue overperformance reflects the impact of ongoing reforms to
strengthen tax and customs administration, while underspending was mainly related to the
food security program, because of improved food supply and large donor assistance. As a
result, the basic budget deficit (on commitment basis, excluding grants) and net domestic
financing were smaller than the indicative targets.
2.
The improvement in food security situation continued to reduce inflation. Yearon-year inflation declined from 0.4 percent in September 2006 to 1.4 percent in November.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with Niger

On December 20, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Niger.1
Background
Since 2000, the Nigerien authorities have maintained a strong commitment to prudent
policies and reforms. The policy and reform agenda was underpinned by a poverty
reduction strategy (PRS) adopted in 2002 that identifies four pillars: enhancing
macroeconomic stability; increasing public investment, especially in irrigation infrastructure;
deepening human capital formation; and buttressing economic governance. A large number
of reforms have been introduced since 2000 to improve public expenditure management,
strengthen domestic revenue, and enhance the economy’s supply reforms.
However, over the past five years real GDP growth has not been sufficient to improve per
capita income, and social indicators remain weak. In this regard, Niger remains one of the
poorest countries in the World and is far from achieving the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs). Economic growth has been constrained by weak productivity. In particular,
inadequate irrigation infrastructure and limited use of modern inputs have undermined

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
agricultural performance. Also, economic diversification has been hampered by
infrastructure bottlenecks.

In 2004-05, Niger’s economy was hit by a severe drought that had significant
socioeconomic costs. In late 2004, the drought significantly reduced agricultural production,
triggered a food crisis, and raised inflation during the first half of 2005. The external current
account deficit remained stable because of a significant increase in humanitarian
assistance. However, the situation improved in late 2005, with a bumper harvest pushing
real GDP growth for the year as a whole to about 7 percent, and easing inflationary
pressures.
In 2006 macroeconomic performance was broadly satisfactory. Real GDP growth is
expected to slow to 3½ percent. Growth in the agriculture sector moderated, with cereal
production remaining close to the record level of late 2005; performance in the mining and
services has been strong. Average inflation declined to 1¼ percent in the 12 months to
September 2006 and is expected to decrease further to almost zero by end-2006 because
of falling food prices. In 2006, the external current account deficit (including grants)
remained close to 2005 level as lower food imports offset the high cost of fuel imports.
Niger’s external debt burden was further reduced by debt relief under the Multilateral Debt
Relief Initiative (MDRI) totaling SDR 638 million (US$956.7 million) from the Fund, IDA and
the African Development Fund. This reduced the NPV of debt-to-export ratio from
136 percent in 2005 to 46 percent in 2006.
The implementation of macroeconomic policies thus far in 2006 has been satisfactory. In
the first half of 2006, the basic fiscal deficit was significantly lower than programmed
because of higher revenue and lower spending. Improvements in tax and customs
administration (achieved mainly by tightening control of import valuation and transit
operations, and reinforcing the auditing of large- and medium-sized enterprises) boosted
revenue collection. Good harvest and strong external assistance facilitated a significant
buildup of the strategic grain reserves. For the year as whole, the fiscal deficit and domestic
financing are expected to be lower than originally envisaged. The Central Bank of West
African States pursued a prudent monetary policy.
The authorities continued to implement reforms to strengthen revenue, enhance public
expenditure management (PEM), and increase the supply response of the economy. They
prepared and started implementing an action plan with a focus on strengthening tax and
customs administration. On PEM, they have advanced the computerization of the
operations of the treasury and budget departments, completed a comprehensive
assessment of Niger’s public financial management systems, and adopted medium-term
expenditure plans for key sectors. Other key reforms included the adoption of new mining
code, steps to streamline business regulations, and the removal of duties on imports
(manufacturing, animal products and vegetables) from all members of the Economic
Community of West African States.

3

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Nigerien authorities for their track record of
implementing prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms under two successive
PRGF-supported programs, notwithstanding the economy’s vulnerability to economic
shocks. These reforms have resulted in an increase in revenue collection, improvements in
expenditure management, and a more flexible market-based economy. Prospects for 2007
are relatively favorable, with stronger growth and continued low inflation. Significant
challenges remain, however, to boost economic growth rates to the levels needed to
achieve the MDGs. This will require increased investment in human capital and in
infrastructure, with a focus on agriculture, irrigation, and transport in rural areas; and a
streamlined regulatory framework to promote private sector development. Improving social
services delivery and strengthening governance will also be critical.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ plan to adopt soon a revised Poverty Reduction
Strategy for 2007-2009, outlining policies and reforms to promote economic growth and
reduce poverty. The forthcoming PRSP and the accompanying medium-term expenditure
framework are likely to entail significantly higher financing needs than currently envisaged.
In this regard, Directors encouraged the authorities to work closely with development
partners to mobilize the needed financial assistance, mostly in the form of grants. Debt
management should be strengthened, in view of the risks to debt sustainability, even though
they remain moderate.
Directors commended the prudent fiscal stance in 2006, which is expected to lead to a
smaller deficit than originally envisaged, due in part to ongoing reforms in tax mobilization
and expenditure management. Directors welcomed the shift in expenditure toward priority
programs envisaged in the 2007 budget, and underscored the importance of effective and
timely execution of these programs. Higher priority spending will need to be supported by
donor assistance, as well as by increased domestic revenue based on further reforms in the
tax and customs administrations, including simpler tax procedures and tighter exemptions.
Full implementation of the flexible pricing system for petroleum products will help redirect
resources toward development needs. Directors looked forward to the prompt
implementation of an action plan to eliminate domestic arrears.
Directors emphasized the need to strengthen public expenditure management. They
welcomed the preparation of medium-term expenditure frameworks for key sectors, the
computerization of the budget and treasury operations, and the establishment of a unified
list of priority programs. Further efforts will be needed to streamline budgetary procedures,
strengthen treasury accounting, and reinforce ex-ante and ex-post controls.
Directors urged the authorities to accelerate reforms aimed at enhancing agricultural
productivity, diversifying the economic base, and improving the business environment.
Efforts should continue to reduce the regulatory burden on investment, complete the
restructuring of the electricity company, and reform the land tenure and judiciary systems.
Financial sector reforms should aim at enhancing competitiveness, deepening financial

4
intermediation, and facilitating private investment. In this context, Directors recommended
acceleration of the restructuring of weak microfinance institutions and reinforcement of the
office responsible for their supervision in order to improve access to credit. They looked
forward to the recapitalization of the restructured financial branch of the postal network and
the privatization of the housing bank.

Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to pursue a prudent external debt strategy
following the debt relief under the MDRI, and to use resources freed up by the Initiative in
the most effective manner to reach the MDGs. They urged the authorities to continue to
pursue good faith negotiations with remaining non-Paris Club creditors in order to reach
agreements on debt relief on terms comparable with those already obtained.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

IMF Executive Board Completes the Third Review Under Niger's PRGF Arrangement
and Approves US$8.9 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed today the third
review of Niger's economic performance under a three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility (PRGF) arrangement. The completion of the review enables the release of a further SDR
5.9 million (about US$8.9 million), which will bring the total amount disbursed under the
arrangement to SDR 23.5 million (about US$35.4 million). Niger's PRGF arrangement was
approved on January 31, 2005 (see Press Release No. 05/20).
The Board waived Niger's non-observance of the quantitative performance criterion on the
reduction in domestic payment arrears on government obligations and the continuous structural
performance criterion on the application of the petroleum pricing mechanism.
Following the IMF Executive Board discussion, Mr. Murilo Portugal , Deputy Managing
Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“The Nigerien authorities are to be commended for the satisfactory overall performance of the
economy under the PRGF-supported program. Following the strong rebound of agricultural
production in 2005, economic activity continued to expand in 2006, sustained by a good harvest
and a strengthening of mining and service activities. During 2006, inflationary pressures have
eased, as food prices declined. The improved food supply and strong donor support have
allowed the reconstitution of the strategic grain reserves.
“The authorities are committed to persevering with their program of strong macroeconomic
policies and economic reforms in 2007 and beyond. The 2007 fiscal program calls for shifting
expenditure toward priority outlays. It also emphasizes continued improvements in the tax and
customs administrations aimed at broadening the tax base by tightening exemptions and
simplifying tax procedures. Steadfast implementation of reforms in public expenditure
management will be critical for enhancing the effectiveness of Niger’s pro-growth and pro-poor
programs.
“The debt relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) has reduced Niger’s
external debt burden significantly. The authorities are committed to using the resources freed up
by the MDRI effectively, so as to advance toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
To preserve debt sustainability, it is important that the authorities strengthen debt management

-2-

and rely only on highly concessional resources, preferably in the form of grants, to finance
highly productive investment.
“The authorities plan to adopt in early 2007 a revised Poverty Reduction Strategy for 20072009. In the face of the significant challenges that lie ahead as Niger advances toward the
MDGs, the strategy will outline policies and reforms to help sustain high economic growth and
reduce poverty. Increased investment in human capital and infrastructure will be required, and
government investment in key sectors will need to be accompanied by reforms to promote
private sector development. Other priorities are to deepen financial intermediation, including
through the development of a viable microfinance system; to reform the regulatory framework;
and to enhance the efficiency of key public utilities,” Mr. Portugal said.
The PRGF is the IMF's concessional facility for low-income countries. PRGF-supported
programs are based on country-owned poverty reduction strategies adopted in a participatory
process involving civil society and development partners and articulated in the Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). This is intended to ensure that PRGF-supported programs are
consistent with a comprehensive framework for macroeconomic, structural, and social policies
to foster growth and reduce poverty. PRGF loans carry an annual interest rate of 0.5 percent and
are repayable over 10 years with a 5½-year grace period on principal payments.

Statement by Laurean W. Rutayisire, Executive Director for Niger
December 20, 2006
On behalf of my Nigerien authorities, I would like to express my deep appreciation to
management and staff for their invaluable policy advice and assistance which have
contributed to strengthening macroeconomic stability, after the profound economic
disruption in the wake of the 2005 food crisis. I also wish to convey to Executive Directors
my authorities’ appreciation of their support to Fund’s continued involvement in Niger. A
testimony of my authorities’ gratitude has been well reflected in the staff report, as my
authorities expressed their satisfaction about the effectiveness of Fund’s surveillance and
technical assistance.
My Nigerien authorities have shown a strong commitment to sound policies and reforms in
recent years which helped strengthen macroeconomic stability and growth, and support
initiatives taken to reduce poverty. In this regard, several measures have been implemented,
including those aimed at better formulating and executing the budget, increasing revenue
collection, improving social indicators, and accelerating private sector development. As
regards public expenditure management, my authorities have completed the medium-term
framework for the rural sector for 2007-09 and finalized an action plan to strengthen
financial control function. As a result, the basic fiscal deficit and the net domestic financing
have been much lower than initially projected. Furthermore, the domestic financing target
has been revised to take into account these developments. My authorities have also envisaged
finalizing by end-December 2006 the revised PRSP, whose key-components include the
expansion of irrigation, the use of modern inputs in agriculture, the investment on roads and
transport, and the enhancement of human capital training. However, my authorities’ efforts
have been hampered by adverse effects of exogenous shocks, including the 2004 drought
with its subsequent food crisis which hit the Nigerien economy. With the favorable
developments on agricultural production in 2005 and 2006 as well as the substantial donor
support, the food security was improved in 2006 while the economy resumed its recovery
from the drought effects. All performance criteria and benchmarks through end-September
were met, except two, for which my authorities have already taken the needed correctives
measures.
My authorities are fully aware of the challenges ahead, in particular the need for
strengthening the execution of priority programs, improving the business environment, and
enhancing domestic revenue. The achievement of such objectives requires further progress in
fostering higher and broad-based growth, through the development of an agriculture
production system less vulnerable to weather vagaries, with an emphasis on important
irrigation projects. The rural sector accounts, on average, for 40 percent of the total value
added of the Nigerien economy and it employs about 80 percent of active population. My
authorities welcome the findings of the interesting Selected Issues Paper on Sources of
Economic Growth in Niger which identifies investments on irrigation among others (foreign

2
aid, financial sector development etc.) as one of the most relevant variables having high
correlation with growth in Niger. Despite the capacity constraints facing the economy, my
authorities remain determined to address the challenges ahead, in close collaboration with
development partners. They are grateful to the international community for its support in
helping mitigate the adverse effects of food shortage in 2005. In view of the investment
programs and other necessary reforms to address the challenges described above, the
financial needs are daunting and require substantial and timely external assistance.
Given their strong commitment, the corrective measures taken, and the set of reforms
underway, my authorities are requesting waivers for nonobservance of missed criteria, the
completion of the third review under the PRGF Arrangement and that of the 2006 Article IV
consultation.
I. Recent economic developments
A severe drought in late 2004 with its subsequent consequences on food security
compromised the positive economic developments noted since 2000, showing once again the
high vulnerability of Nigerien economy to exogenous shocks. Indeed, GDP growth rate felled
to -0.9 percent in 2004 against an average growth rate of 5.1 percent achieved between 2000
and 2003. An exceptional harvest in 2005 and normal weather conditions in 2006
significantly increased the levels of agriculture production and pushed annual growth rates to
respectively 7 percent and 3.5 percent. The combined effects of the favorable agricultural
production during these two last years, the donor food assistance and the authorities’ sound
economic policies--including sales at moderate prices, building of strategic grain reserves,
and free distributions to vulnerable groups--helped reduce the number of vulnerable people
from 1.8 million to 1 million. Those effects also contributed to easing the inflation rate which
averaged about 0.3 percent a year. Thanks to donors support, including that from MDRI, the
external current account deficit, estimated at 7.5 percent of GDP, could remain stable in 2006
in spite of the still high level of food imports.
On the revenue side, my authorities have tightened control of imports valuation and transit
operations while reinforcing the auditing of large-and-medium taxpayers enterprises. Those
actions could yield a little more revenue than envisaged initially. On the expenditure side, we
note that the total expenditure, excluding those related to foreign-financed projects, could be
lower by about 1.5 percent of GDP than envisaged under the program. As outlined in the
authorities’ memorandum of economic and financial policies, the underspending resulted
from lower spending on food security, as agriculture production improved throughout the
country, lower interest payments to multilateral creditors in view of MDRI, and slower
execution of investment projects constrained by lack of institutional capacity. Finally, the
resulting effects of higher revenue collection, underspending, and important external support
led to a 2006 basic deficit lower than envisaged and a revised domestic financing, reduced by
0.3 percent of GDP.

3
On the financial sector, my authorities take good note of the staff’s favorable assessment of
the soundness of the Nigerien banking system as well as the development of credit to
economy. They are working on the elaboration of a restructuring plan for the two largest
microfinance institutions experiencing financial difficulties. My authorities reaffirm that
Finaposte will be operational by December 2006 and the offer for sale of CDN will be
launched by end-February 2007.
Regarding the program performance, all performance criteria and benchmarks through endSeptember 2006 were met, except those on the reduction of domestic arrears and the flexible
pricing system for domestic petroleum products. As corrective actions, my authorities have
increased the pace of arrears reduction while committing to elaborate a clearance plan by
end-December 2006 in order to avoid any slippage in the future. As regards the overrun on
the petroleum pricing, the government has already recovered part of the deferred tax in
October and November 2006. In the event of a future decline in world fuel prices, my
authorities will take steps to maintain stable domestic retail prices until deferred revenue is
fully recouped.
II. Medium-term Outlook and Objectives
My authorities reached an agreement with the staff on the main economic priorities over the
medium-term, with the view to strengthen economic growth, in particular by increasing
productivity in agriculture, broadening diversification of the economic base, bolstering public
and private investments, and improving business environment. The first priority of this
agreement relates to the effective execution of growth-critical PRSP-based programs. Keyactions for its implementation are focused on the expansion of irrigation, improvement on
credit access, higher investments on roads and transport, and better enhancement of human
capital training. The second priority suggests the implementation of reforms conducive to the
development of private sector with a great emphasis on measures aimed at reducing the cost
of doing business, accelerating the pace of ongoing privatization and restructuring process,
improving the development and supervision of microfinance institutions. The third priority is
related to measures pertaining to the strengthening of revenue collection and public
expenditure management.
The medium-term prospects, based on increased domestic revenue and higher international
community support to finance the priorities set forth in the revised PRSP, appear favorable.
In this context, a GDP growth rate above 4 percent is projected for 2007-09, starting from 4.1
percent in 2007 and growing steadily up to 4.5 percent in 2009. My authorities’ medium-term
fiscal objectives are centered on a strategy that promotes the preservation of debt
sustainability, through a large recourse to grants and highly concessional loans to finance
basic budget deficit. While taking good note of the staff’s assessment concluding that Niger
remains at moderate risk of debt distress, my authorities are eager to implement cautious debt
policy focused on the mobilization of grants and concessional loans to finance their new

4
investments. In the mining and agriculture sectors, their strategy aim to put emphasis on
more productive projects which could have a high growth impact and ensure more income
for rural people over the years.
Fiscal Policies for 2007
My authorities are developing a dynamic approach to revenue collection. They have set a
revenue collection target of 12 percent of GDP for 2007. Building on their successful
experience of the two last years, my authorities are envisaging to consolidate in 2007 the
existing measures implemented so far, including the computerization of border posts and the
extension of taxpayers’ audits and exemption controls. To be consistent with the objective of
revenue collection described above, my authorities agreed that the existing measure of expost controls at the major regional customs offices could be shift to a structural performance
criterion for end-December 2006. As new measures to be implemented in 2007, they
envisage to introduce tax collection simplification and enhance the electronic informationsharing between border posts for goods in transit as well as for those declared at the main
regional centers. Aware of the positive impact of qualified human resources and sufficient
material on the level of revenue collection, my authorities are planning to have recourse to
technical and financial assistance from development partners in these areas.
On the expenditure side, my authorities’ immediate concern is to ensure adequate budget
resources to finance the priority programs set out in the 2007 budget law. To that end, they
are envisaging to increase the resources allocated to priority spending from 5.7 percent of
GDP in 2006 to 6.4 percent GDP in 2007. As rightly reflected in the staff report, most of
these resources will be directed to health, education and rural sectors. Consistent with their
commitment on public expenditure management, my Nigerien authorities intend to pursue
steadfastly the implementation of PEMFAR recommendations. To that end, they will
continue to (i) strengthen the preparation of the budget and fully integrate it with mediumterm expenditure framework; (ii) enhance the execution and monitoring of expenditure; (iii)
reinforce ex-ante and ex-post audits by allocating more human and material resources to
agencies; (iv) streamline budget procedures and regulations to avoid delays in customs
execution. In view of the need to increase transparency and governance in financial
operations, my authorities are committed to publish quarterly reports on the execution of the
budget, update and streamline treasury accounts.
PRSP and Structural Reforms
My authorities underscore the importance of the PRSP which remains the unique vehicle for
mobilizing donor support. With the elaboration of this document, they intend to centralize
and streamline agreed policy reforms aiming at achieving higher and sustainable growth with
the goal to reducing poverty and making progress towards the MDGs. The process of
updating it for the period 2007-09 is at its final stage and all stakeholders; including Civil

5
society and development partners have been involved. Moreover, the results of recent
surveys updating Niger’s poverty indicators have been taken into account and the sectoral
strategies, the medium-term frameworks on health, education and rural sector, as well as the
main conclusions of the 2005 annual progress report have been reflected, with assistance
from World Bank and UNDP. Based on the fact that all their strategies are set out in this
document and encouraged by the 2005 international community mobilization which has been
effective in helping mitigate the food crisis, my Nigerien authorities would like to organize a
donor conference in early 2007, at which they will seek commitments of financial and
technical assistance from developments partners to put in place those reforms. They call upon
the international community to increase their invaluable support, as domestic revenue
remains insufficient despite the efforts made in recent years to improve revenue collection.
On the structural reforms, my authorities are committed to press ahead with the
implementation of reform agenda. For the financial sector, some progress has been made
during 2006. Indeed, regarding the Crédit du Niger (CDN), reports on financial situation of
the bank and the privatization options have been completed and understandings have been
reached with the central bank, the BCEAO, for repaying the CDN debt. The solicitation of
investors’ interest will be launched on December 2006. The restructuring of the national
postal office (ONPE) is advancing, with the establishment of two separate entities,
NIGERPOSTE, for the postal branch, and FINAPOSTE, for the financial activities.
Commitment to meet requirement for FINAPOSTE has been taken for end-December 2006
by the government and modalities of reimbursement of frozen postal deposits are to be
finalized by end-December 2007. In order to strengthen the microfinance sector, a decree for
creating a regulatory agency will be adopted by end-December 2006 and a restructuring plan
for the two largest microfinance entities is being designed. Important strides have been
achieved on the area of business environment. To that end, my authorities have recently
reduced the number of procedures for starting business and adopted a new mining code to
stimulate investment. In the same vein, they are working with the World Bank to review the
land-tenure system and strengthen the judiciary system, especially the commercial courts.
The discussions with the World Bank on the new strategy to render more attractive the offer
for sale of the electricity company, the NIGELEC, are underway.
III. Conclusion
Under the last PRGF-supported program, my Nigerien authorities have implemented sound
macroeconomic policies and made important progress in the macroeconomic stabilization.
These achievements have created a strong foundation for the full implementation of the
poverty reduction strategy. However, the recent economic and social disruption in the wake
of drought and locust invasion that occurred in the last quarter of 2004 has once again shown
the high vulnerability of the Niger economy to shocks. My authorities believe that an
adequate response to the vulnerability requires continued efforts to diversify production and
put the economy on a sustainable growth path, which would render it less dependent on

6
weather conditions. In particular, they stress the need to encourage the development of
irrigation infrastructure and the use of modern technology to improve agricultural
productivity. To this end, they are committed to pursue their reforms agenda, in particular the
implementation of measures pertaining to the execution of priority programs, the
improvement of business environment and that of the domestic revenue collection. They also
rely on the continuous support of the Fund, in particular through its catalytique role in
mobilizing the development partners to assist them in addressing these daunting challenges.
I would like, therefore, to ask Directors for their support for my authorities’ request for
waivers, and the completion of the third review under the PRGF arrangement as well as that
of the 2006 Article IV Consultation.
